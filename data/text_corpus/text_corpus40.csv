200,this study develops approximate analytical solutions for seawater extent in unconfined coastal aquifers considering unsaturated flow and assuming steady state sharp interface conditions for both constant flux flux controlled aquifers and constant head head controlled aquifers inland boundary conditions these analytical solutions were verified with numerical simulations of variable saturation and variable density flow the results show that neglecting unsaturated flow underestimates the steady state seawater extent particularly for flux controlled aquifers this occurs because the vadose zone transmits part of the freshwater flux towards the sea leading to a lower watertable and consequently a more landward seawater extent larger capillary fringes accompanying finer grained sediments and smaller pore sizes cause more landward locations of the interface toe for both flux controlled and head controlled aquifers the ratio of the capillary fringe thickness to the saturated zone thickness controls the relative difference in the interface toe location between cases with and without unsaturated flow when this ratio is 17 3 the relative difference in the interface toe location is 30 for the flux controlled aquifer base scenario adopted in the current study the presented analytical solutions provide improved predictions of the steady state seawater extent in thin unconfined aquifers particularly for those with relatively large capillary fringe thicknesses keywords sharp interface steady state capillary fringe seawater intrusion analytical solution 1 introduction coastal zones support more than 60 of the world s population neumann et al 2015 rapid population growth and urban development in coastal regions are responsible for increased freshwater demand as a result the dynamic equilibrium between freshwater and seawater has shifted landward in many places due to the exploitation of coastal aquifers sea level rise slr and or from other developments e g canal construction the resulting seawater intrusion has become a critical issue for the sustainable management of coastal groundwater on a global scale werner et al 2013 a substantial body of literature on seawater intrusion exists that is based on field and experimental observations e g mao et al 2006 badaruddin et al 2015 levanon et al 2017 numerical simulations e g brovelli et al 2007 robinson et al 2007 xu and hu 2017 and analytical solutions e g liu et al 2014 strack and ausk 2015 fahs et al 2016 among the methods used to calculate the seawater extent and its movement in coastal aquifers numerical simulations are the most widely adopted due to their ability to deal with complex factors that are otherwise challenging to incorporate into analytical solutions e g dispersive mixing aquifer heterogeneity time varying boundary conditions etc werner et al 2013 nevertheless analytical solutions are frequently used as first order assessment tools to estimate seawater extent because of advantages in 1 reduced computational effort 2 insights into relationships between parameters and seawater extent and 3 being exact they can be used to verify numerical models analytical solutions are most commonly based on the sharp interface representation of the freshwater seawater mixing zone steady state conditions and the dupuit forchheimer approximation i e hydrostatic pressure head distribution these allow application of the so called ghijben herzberg relationship drabbe and badon ghijben 1889 english translation given by post 2018 which expresses the depths of freshwater below and above sea level as a function of water density differences strack 1976 used the ghijben herzberg relationship and the method of girinskii potentials girinskii 1947 to develop analytical solutions for seawater extent in coastal aquifer these solutions formed the basis for many subsequent analytical studies aimed at solving a wide variety of interface flow problems under various conditions for example mantoglou 2003 applied strack s 1976 theory to determine optimal pumping rates in coastal aquifers subject to seawater intrusion lu and luo 2014 adopted strack s 1976 theory in deriving analytical solutions to investigate the effects of boundary conditions and aquifer size on the maximum pumping rate and interface toe location in coastal aquifers werner and simmons 2009 werner et al 2012 ferguson and gleeson 2012 and lu et al 2015 also applied strack s 1976 solutions to examine the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to slr recharge change pumping and other factors that cause seawater intrusion the method described by strack 1976 was extended to predict seawater extent in more complex settings including sloping e g koussis et al 2015 lu et al 2016 and stratified coastal aquifers e g strack and ausk 2015 rathore et al 2018 and in aquifers comprised of both confined and unconfined semi confined units e g bakker et al 2017 the theory of strack 1976 was also applied to the analysis of riparian freshwater lenses werner and laattoe 2016 and the effect of shoreline subsurface barriers on island lenses lu et al 2019 amongst other problems previous analytical solutions to seawater extent in unconfined coastal aquifers neglect processes occurring in the vadose zone even though unsaturated flow has been shown to affect groundwater movement e g parlange and brutsaert 1987 barry et al 1996 li et al 1997 2000 kong et al 2016 jeong and park 2017 luo et al 2018 in unconfined coastal aquifers kong et al 2013 2015 found that lateral unsaturated flow can facilitate groundwater wave propagation however whether consideration of the vadose zone might influence estimates of steady state seawater extent in unconfined coastal aquifers remains untested the primary influence of the vadose zone on seawater extent in unconfined coastal aquifers is most likely associated with the lateral transmission of freshwater towards the sea within this zone which is otherwise omitted in methods that consider only the region below the watertable e g strack 1976 therefore it can be expected that the effects of unsaturated flow on seawater extent can be safely neglected for unconfined aquifers with large saturated thickness because the additional freshwater discharge through the unsaturated zone would be relatively minor however as shown in fig 1 unconfined coastal aquifers with small thicknesses ranging from 0 1 to 25 m are widely distributed around the world zamrsky et al 2018 it remains unclear to what extent unsaturated flow affects seawater extent for these thin aquifers although the vadose zone has been considered in numerical studies of seawater intrusion in unconfined coastal aquifers e g xin et al 2010 robinson et al 2014 yu et al 2019 these studies did not investigate vadose zone effects on seawater extent additionally to date no analytical solution that includes unsaturated flow is available for prediction of seawater extent in unconfined coastal aquifers here approximate analytical solutions are presented for the steady state seawater extent in coastal aquifers taking into account unsaturated flow these analytical solutions are used to gain insights into unsaturated flow effects on the steady state seawater extent both constant flux flux controlled aquifers and constant head head controlled aquifers inland boundary conditions are considered given their importance as previously highlighted e g werner and simmons 2009 lu et al 2015 after validation with a numerical model hypothetical scenarios that illustrate the effects of unsaturated flow on the steady state seawater extent are considered sensitivity analyses of unsaturated zone parameters are further conducted to examine the effects of unsaturated flow on the steady state seawater extent for both flux controlled and head controlled aquifers 2 approximate analytical solutions 2 1 conceptual model an idealized unconfined coastal aquifer given by a rectangular domain perpendicular to the shoreline oabc with dimensions of l l length d l height is considered fig 2 the aquifer is underlain by a horizontal impermeable base oa and has a land surface boundary bc oc and ab represent the seaward and inland boundaries respectively the x z coordinate origin is placed at the intersection of the vertical seaward boundary and the impermeable base the hydraulic head above the datum ϕ l coincides with the watertable height while h l is the depth of the interface below the watertable hs l is the depth of the interface below sea level hs l is the sea level hc hs hs l is the elevation of the interface above the impermeable base and hl l is the hydraulic head at distance l from the shoreline i e the inland boundary hydraulic head the freshwater discharge per unit aquifer width flowing from inland to the sea is qf l2 t the inland boundary condition adopted in deriving the analytical solution involves specifying either hl or qf corresponding to constant head or constant flux inland boundary conditions respectively recharge through the surface boundary of the aquifer is neglected following previous work e g strack 1976 koussis et al 2012 lu et al 2016 the following assumptions are made 1 the flow system and the freshwater seawater interface are at steady state 2 a sharp interface rather than transition zone separates freshwater and seawater 3 aquifer hydraulic properties are homogeneous and isotropic 4 the aquifer has a uniform geometry with a vertical seaward boundary 5 the seepage face is ignored along the seaward boundary and 6 vertical hydraulic gradients are neglected in both the saturated zone and the vadose zone i e the dupuit forchheimer approximation leading to the same horizontal hydraulic gradient both above and below the watertable 2 2 constant flux inland boundary condition according to darcy s law and the dupuit forchheimer approximation the freshwater flux in the region of the aquifer between the seaward boundary and interface toe is 1 q f h c ϕ k s d z ϕ d k ψ d z d ϕ d x where ks lt 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity k ψ lt 1 is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and ψ l is the pressure head positive in the saturated zone and negative in the vadose zone the first and second terms on the right side of eq 1 define the net horizontal fluxes per unit width in the saturated and vadose zones respectively kong et al 2015 xin et al 2016 for the dupuit forchheimer approximation ψ is a linear function of elevation z l i e ψ ϕ z both in the saturated and vadose zones application of the same hydrostatic assumption in the analysis of tide induced watertable fluctuations was shown to produce reasonable results in terms of predicting tide induced watertable fluctuation behavior e g kong et al 2013 2015 during the past decades various expressions have been proposed to describe the relationship between k ψ and ψ in the vadose zone e g gardner 1958 mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 luo et al 2019 here gardner s 1958 function is chosen because i it has been widely employed in similar studies e g kong et al 2015 xin et al 2016 and ii it is relatively simple and permits analytical solutions for many problems gardner s 1958 function for describing the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity taking into account the capillary fringe can be written as 2 k ψ k s ψ ψ ca k s e β ψ ψ ca ψ ψ ca where ψca l is the thickness of the capillary fringe and β l 1 is the relative hydraulic conductivity exponent according to the ghijben herzberg equation the vertical thickness of the freshwater zone h above the interface is given by 3 h 1 α ϕ h s 0 x x t where α ρf ρs ρf is the relative density difference with ρf ml 3 and ρs ml 3 the densities of freshwater and seawater respectively substitution of eqs 2 and 3 into eq 1 leads to 4 q f k s 1 α ϕ h s ψ c a k s β 1 e β ϕ d ψ c a d ϕ d x hereafter flow above the watertable including flow within both the capillary fringe and the overlying unsaturated

using the sea boundary condition i e x 0 ϕ hs 6 c 1 k s ψ c a h s k s β h s k s β 2 e β h s d ψ c a the ghijben herzberg relationship drabbe and badon ghijben 1889 is 7 h s α ϕ h s combining eqs 5 and 7 to eliminate ϕ yields 8 q f x c 1 k s 1 α h s 2 2 α 2 k s ψ c a h s α h s k s β h s α h s k s β 2 e β h s α h s d ψ c a eq 8 can be used to calculate the interface location as shown in the last three terms on the right side of the equation the shape of the interface is related to ψca and β which describe the capillary effect we will discuss the effect of these additional terms on steady state seawater extent in the following section at the interface toe x xt we have 9a h s h s 9b ϕ ϕ t 1 α α h s with eqs 6 and 9a substituted into eq 8 the interface toe location is 10 x t k s 1 α h s

where q l2 t is the same as qf without partitioning flow into unsaturated flow and saturated flow otherwise q is equal to the saturated zone flux at the interface toe qxt analytical derivation given in appendix both conditions q qf and q qxt will be discussed later for the former unsaturated flow is completely ignored whereas for the latter it is partially considered by a smaller qxt 2 3 constant head inland boundary condition as pointed out by lu et al 2016 the analytical solution for a constant head inland boundary can be obtained from the relationship between the inland hydraulic head and freshwater flux which allows for modification of the solution for a constant flux inland boundary similar to eq 1 the freshwater discharge of the aquifer segment between the interface toe and inland boundary is 12 q f 0 ϕ k s d z ϕ d k ψ d z d ϕ d x k s ϕ ψ c a 1 β 1 e β ϕ d ψ c a d ϕ d x integrating eq 12 gives 13 q f x c 2 1 2 k s ϕ 2 k s ψ c a ϕ k s β ϕ k s β 2 e β ϕ d ψ c a where c 2 is the integration constant that can be determined by the inland boundary condition i e x l ϕ hl 14 c 2 1 2 k s h l 2 k s ψ c a h l k s β h l k s β 2 e β h l d ψ c a q f l at the interface toe x xt we have the same relation as given by eq 9 thus inserting eqs 9b and 14 into eq 13 yields 15 q f k s 1 2 h l 2 ψ c a h l h l β 1 β 2 e β h l d ψ c a 1 2 ϕ t 2 ψ c a ϕ t ϕ t β 1 β 2 e β ϕ t d ψ c a x t l combining eqs 10 and 15 leads to the analytical solution for aquifers subject to a constant head inland boundary define 16 c 3 k s 1 α h s 2 2 α 2 k s ψ c a α h s k s α β h s k s β 2 e β 1 α α h s d ψ

solution without unsaturated flow lu et al 2015 22 x t 1 α l h s 2 α 2 h l 2 1 α α h s 2 compared to eq 22 eq 21 depends not only on the sea level inland hydraulic head and aquifer length but also on the thickness of the capillary fringe and relative hydraulic conductivity exponent although the simplification of ignoring recharge within the above mathematical development may depart from the conditions expected in real world coastal phreatic aquifers adding recharge affects the assumption of hydrostatic conditions and makes estimation of the capillary fringe thickness challenging at least within the simple analytical framework of the current analysis that is rudimentary equations can be devised that characterize the vadose zone effect in the absence of recharge on the seawater extent given that recharge is neglected in the current analysis the results should be considered to apply to arid and semi arid areas where evaporation is balanced by rainfall in the upper part of the vadose zone liu 2011 macdonald et al 2021 for example based on the field data during dry periods squeo et al 2006 indicated that a coastal aquifer in north central chile is maintained at a constant watertable for nearly eight months primarily by inland flux from higher parts of the basin rather than recharge from the aquifer surface 2 4 unsaturated flow effects the effect of unsaturated flow is quantified using the relative difference rd between the interface toe locations calculated with x t and without x t unsaturated flow 23 r d x t x t x t 100 larger rd magnitudes indicate increased unsaturated flow effects it should be noted that to calculate rd for flux controlled aquifers x t and x t are replaced by xt calculated from eqs 10 and 11 respectively whereas to calculate rd for head controlled aquifers x t and x t are replaced by xt calculated from eqs 21 and 22 respectively 3 hypothetical scenarios hypothetical scenarios using parameters informed by published studies are used to examine the effects of unsaturated flow on the steady state seawater extent in flux controlled and head controlled aquifers two different model scales are considered 100 m length 6 m thickness and 1000 m length 15 m thickness the former is similar to the scale typically adopted in assessing salt marshes e g shen et al 2015 2018 whereas the latter is similar to the scale adopted in evaluating previous analytical solutions of seawater extent e g lu et al 2016 2019 in all hypothetical scenarios seawater and freshwater densities are set to 1025 and 1000 kg m3 respectively leading to α 40 to further examine the effects of unsaturated flow on the steady state seawater extent two soils are considered for each type of aquifer fine sand and weld silty clay loam jensen and hanks 1967 with weak and strong capillary effects respectively these two soils are referred to as sand and loam in the following to determine the thickness of the capillary fringe and relative hydraulic conductivity exponent for these two soils we fitted the modified gardner s function to measured data compiled by jensen and hanks 1967 with values given in table 1 a nonlinear regression algorithm matlab function lsqcurvefit was used to determine the optimal fitting parameters in a similar manner to luo et al 2019 2020 the fitted curves are in good agreement with measured data for both soils fig 3 yielding r 2 values of 0 94 and 0 97 respectively a summary of the hypothetical scenarios is presented in table 2 4 validation of analytical solutions we compare the analytical solutions with numerical results from sutra a 3 d variable saturation and variable density groundwater model voss and provost 2008 numerical simulations are based on scenarios 1 and 5 table 2 with qf 0 02 m2 d for the flux controlled aquifer and hl 3 5 m for the head controlled aquifer note that the corresponding landward boundary head and flux are 3 58 m and 0 0169 m2 d calculated from the analytical solution in the flux controlled and head controlled situations respectively the soil water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity function in sutra are represented using the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 as can be seen in figure s1 supporting information the van genuchten mualem model with fitting parameters of αvg 2 08 m 1 and nvg 11 44 matches the measured data compiled from jensen and hanks 1967 reasonably well yielding r 2 0 99 while the analytical solutions presented here assume sharp interface conditions sutra requires at least a small level of dispersion to avoid numerical errors the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity were set to 0 125 and 0 03 m respectively in a compromise between seeking a narrow mixing zone and numerical stability the model domains were discretized with node spacings of 0 25 and 0 06 m in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively to satisfy the péclet number stability criterion voss and souza 1987 to account for differences between the sharp interface of the analytical solution and the dispersive approach of sutra an empirical dispersion correction factor originally recommended by pool and carrera 2011 and later modified by lu and werner 2013 was adopted 24 λ α 1 δ w 1 4 1 where δ l is the transverse dispersivity 0 03 m and w l is the depth to the aquifer base below sea level w hs is used as an approximation for the unconfined aquifer conditions the value of λ was implemented into the analytical solutions by replacing α with λ steady state numerical model results were obtained by long time transient simulations starting initially with a freshwater filled aquifer numerical simulations were run for 1950 d with a time step of 300 s to ensure steady state results the transient location where the salt concentration is 17 5 ppt in the aquifer bed was observed until it was constant figure s2 the ilu preconditioned orthomin solver orthomin was used in numerical simulations with convergence tolerances of 10 11 kg m s2 and 10 12 for solver iterations during pressure and transport solutions respectively the assumption of a hydrostatic pressure distribution in the vadose zone was found to be consistent with the numerical model this can be seen in figure s3 which shows pressure head contours that are generally parallel with the aquifer bottom in the whole domain for both flux controlled and head controlled aquifers i e based on scenarios 1 and 5 table 2 as expected given the lack of vertical flow e g caused by recharge or evapotranspiration within the unsaturated zone note that the same hydrostatic assumption was adopted in previous studies to examine the effects of unsaturated flow on tide induced watertable fluctuations kong et al 2013 2015 as well as on hillslope recession processes where the aquifer bottom is usually sloping hilberts et al 2007 kong et al 2016 luo et al 2018 fig 4 compares the results of the analytical solution corrected for dispersion according to eq 24 and the numerical modeling for both flux controlled and head controlled aquifers i e based on scenarios 1 and 5 table 2 by comparison the sharp interface falls within the mixing zone of the dispersive results both with and without the inclusion of vadose zone effects however with the inclusion of unsaturated flow eqs 10 and 21 the sharp interface appears to be closer to the center of the mixing zone 17 5 ppt contour regardless of the aquifer type flux controlled or head controlled this adds confidence to the assumption of a hydrostatic pressure distribution in the vadose zone and the benefit of considering the unsaturated zone more generally for the flux controlled aquifer eq 11 with q qxt performs better in predicting the sharp interface in comparison to eq 11 with q qf fig 4a this demonstrates the importance of accounting for unsaturated flow since eq 11 with q qxt partially considers unsaturated flow discrepancies between analytical solutions and numerical modeling results are likely influenced by analytical solution assumptions such as the omission of vertical flow and an outflow face at the shoreline to allow for freshwater discharge 5 results and discussion 5 1 unsaturated flow effects in flux controlled aquifers the effects of unsaturated flow on flux controlled aquifers were examined by considering interface toe locations obtained from analytical solutions that include neglect or partially consider unsaturated flow i e eq 10 eq 11 with q qf and eq 11 with q qxt respectively table 2 details the relevant flux controlled scenarios scenarios 1 4 as shown in fig 5 xt decreases gradually i e interface toe locations shift further seaward with increasing qf whether taking unsaturated flow effects into account or not as expected for both small scale and large scale aquifers comprised of loam or sand as stated earlier for flux controlled sand aquifers with smaller scale scenario 1 ignoring unsaturated flow underestimates the steady state seawater extent fig 5a the vadose zone holds part of inland freshwater flux i e unsaturated flow and so leads to a lower watertable and a smaller seaward hydraulic gradient i e a larger xt for a given qf using eq 23 the difference between the interface toe locations obtained with and without capillary effects can be calculated consistent with the trend of the interface toe location the difference between the interface toe locations obtained by eqs 10 and 11 with q qf decreases from 7 14 to 1 19 m as qf increases from 0 005 to 0 03 m2 d since pumping wells are widely distributed in coastal aquifers around the world de graaf et al 2019 jasechko et al 2020 intensive pumping will significantly decrease the inland flux reduced qf and so increase the difference of the interface toe location calculated with and without unsaturated flow as a result ignoring unsaturated flow effects may lead to an inappropriate management strategy for fresh groundwater resources by comparison the result is closer to that calculated by eq 10 when unsaturated flow is partially considered eq 11 with q qxt to contrast with the low capillarity of sand we present results for loam to illustrate more clearly how unsaturated flow affects the steady state seawater extent in flux controlled aquifers with smaller scale scenario 2 again the interface toe location is underestimated if unsaturated flow is neglected fig 5b in comparison to the sand flux controlled aquifer the interface toe location is closer to the shoreline for the loam flux controlled aquifer at the same inland freshwater flux as mentioned earlier rd x t and x t calculated from eqs 10 and 11 with q qf respectively for flux controlled aquifers is independent of the inland flux with values of 22 3 for the smaller sand flux controlled aquifer and 30 for the smaller loam flux controlled aquifer as might be expected the effects of unsaturated flow are more significant in loam flux controlled aquifers due to strong capillary effects of the loam for flux controlled aquifers with larger scale scenarios 3 and 4 corresponding to figs 5c and d respectively there are still significant deviations between the interface toe locations calculated with and without accounting for unsaturated flow it should be noted that qf is assumed the same as that in small scale aquifers to highlight the significant role played by unsaturated flow this small inland flux occurs widely in reality according to a recent estimate by jasechko et al 2020 due to high groundwater pumping even landward hydraulic gradients exist in a substantial fraction of the east coast and gulf coast of the us compared to smaller flux controlled aquifers the difference of the interface toe location increases for larger flux controlled aquifers while rd x t and x t calculated from eqs 10 and 11 with q qf respectively decreases to 7 92 for the larger sand flux controlled aquifer and 11 6 for the larger loam flux controlled aquifer this is because increasing the saturated zone depth reduces the contribution of the flow in the vadose zone to the total overall flow to further assess the analytical solution with consideration of unsaturated flow the steady state seawater extent was calculated for a broader range of flux controlled aquifers the model parameters are based on scenarios 1 2 with fixing d hs 3 m but varying the sea level hs from 3 to 17 m i e the aquifer thickness d varied from 6 to 20 m the inland freshwater flux qf was set to 0 1 m2 d as can be seen when hs increases from 3 to 17 m rd x t and x t calculated from eqs 10 and 11 with q qf respectively decreases from 30 to 7 in loam flux controlled aquifers while it decreases from 22 to 5 in sand flux controlled aquifers fig 6 this suggests that the effects of unsaturated flow on the steady state seawater extent weakens with increasing saturated zone thickness in comparison to sand aquifers for the same hs rd is larger for loam aquifers due to more pronounced capillary effects this confirms that increasing the ratio of the thickness of the capillary fringe to that of the saturated zone leads to more significant effects of unsaturated flow as expected when q qxt in eq 11 rd greatly decreases compared with q qf indicating the importance of considering unsaturated flow 5 2 unsaturated flow effects in head controlled aquifers in order to examine unsaturated flow effects on the steady state seawater extent in head controlled aquifers the interface toe location was calculated for scenarios 5 8 table 2 based on the analytical solutions with and without unsaturated flow i e eqs 21 and 22 respectively the interface toe location shifts seaward with increasing hl whether taking unsaturated flow effects into account or not as expected for both small scale and large scale aquifers comprised of loam or sand fig 7 consistent with flux controlled aquifers the interface toe location is underestimated for head controlled aquifers without accounting for unsaturated flow for sand head controlled aquifers with smaller scale scenario 5 when increasing hl from 3 5 to 5 m xt decreases from 8 56 to 1 69 m with unsaturated flow considered whereas it decreases from 7 62 to 1 46 m with unsaturated flow ignored fig 7a as above this is because the vadose zone can hold part of inland freshwater flux and hence leads to a more landward steady state seawater extent the underestimation of the interface toe location due to ignoring unsaturated flow also occurs for the other three cases figs 7b d it should be noted that for a given aquifer xt calculated from the analytical solution without including unsaturated flow is identical for sand and loam head controlled aquifers fig 7 since the watertable is the same in both the sand and loam head controlled aquifers however because of different capillarity magnitudes xt is slightly smaller for sand aquifers compared to loam aquifers with unsaturated flow included to further quantify the role played by unsaturated flow rd was calculated for head controlled aquifers as shown in fig 8 it increases monotonically as hl increases specifically for smaller sand and loam head controlled aquifers increasing hl from 3 5 to 5 m results in rd varying from 11 to 13 6 and 15 to 18 5 respectively fig 8a this is because unsaturated flow is increased at larger hl under the dupuit forchheimer approximation the horizontal hydraulic gradient is the same both above and below the watertable increasing hl induces a larger hydraulic gradient and hence increased unsaturated flow in addition rd is greater for loam aquifers compared to sand because of the greater capillary effect of the loam compared with smaller head controlled aquifers rd is smaller in larger head controlled aquifers where unsaturated flow effects are relatively minor fig 8b moreover rd is smaller for head controlled aquifers compared with flux controlled aquifers indicating that the capillary effect plays a more significant role in flux controlled aquifers this occurs since due to the addition of the vadose zone the flow towards the sea is unchanged in the flux controlled situation leading to a head drop at the inland boundary whereas in the head controlled case flow towards the sea is enhanced with the addition of the vadose zone despite this enhanced flow in the head controlled case the seaward hydraulic gradient is lower which induces a more landward seawater extent with unsaturated flow considered the analytical solution with unsaturated flow included was also used to calculate the steady state seawater extent for a broader range of head controlled aquifers the model parameters are based on scenarios 5 6 taking d hs 3 m but varying the sea level hs from 3 to 17 m i e the aquifer thickness d varied from 6 to 20 m the inland hydraulic head hl was 1 m higher than hs for head controlled aquifers as can be seen rd decreases with increasing hs fig 9 this again shows that the effects of unsaturated flow on steady state seawater extent weaken with increasing thickness of the saturated zone furthermore rd is smaller in head controlled aquifers compared with flux controlled aquifers which indicates a more significant role played by unsaturated flow in flux controlled aquifers 5 3 sensitivity analyses sensitivity analyses were performed to further examine the effects of unsaturated flow on seawater extent for both flux controlled and head controlled aquifers the present study focuses on two parameters related to unsaturated flow namely the thickness of the capillary fringe ψca and relative hydraulic conductivity exponent β sensitivity analyses for both flux controlled and head controlled aquifers are based on scenarios 1 and 5 table 2 respectively motivated by the increasing global mean sea level kim et al 2019 we considered two different sea levels of 3 and 3 5 m for both flux controlled and head controlled aquifers in addition we assumed that ψca varied from 0 to 0 5 m and that β increased from 5 to 20 m 1 for sand for sensitivity analysis of ψca β was fixed at its optimal value i e 11 m 1 for sand whereas ψca was fixed at its optimal value i e 0 35 m for computing the sensitivity of β note that different from scenarios 5 hl was varied from 4 to 5 m when conducting sensitivity analyses for the head controlled aquifer fig 10 shows the sensitivity of rd to soil unsaturated flow parameters for sand flux controlled aquifers with hs 3 m before slr and hs 3 5 m after slr as can be seen varying β and ψca leads to a wide range of rd for the flux controlled aquifer especially when rd is calculated from eqs 10 and 11 with q qf this suggests that appropriate values of ψca and β are essential for accurately assessing the steady state seawater extent for the controlled aquifers as expected rd decreases with increasing β or decreasing ψca which both weaken the capillary effect in comparison to the sensitivity analyses of β and ψca rd varies in a wider range for changing ψca indicating that the flow in the capillary fringe has more influence on the steady state seawater extent moreover rd becomes smaller after slr fig 10 for example when ψca 0 5 and β increases from 5 to 20 m 1 rd calculated from eqs 10 and 11 with q qf respectively decreases from about 31 to 26 before slr whereas it decreases from about 28 to 23 after slr the saturated zone thickness increases and then the ratio of the thickness of the capillary fringe to that of the saturated zone decreases after slr resulting in a reduction of rd when calculated from eqs 10 and 11 with q qxt rd is significantly smaller than that from eqs 10 and 11 with q qf fig 10 note that rd is independent of the inland freshwater flux in flux controlled aquifers section 2 4 similarly fig 11 presents the sensitivity of rd to unsaturated flow parameters for a sand head controlled aquifer with hs 3 m before slr and hs 3 5 m after slr again rd decreases with increasing β or decreasing ψca consistent with flux controlled aquifers a change in ψca leads to a wider variation of rd and a reduction in rd can be found after slr fig 11 6 conclusions based on the sharp interface assumption and dupuit forchheimer approximation analytical solutions that take account of unsaturated flow for the steady state seawater extent in unconfined coastal aquifers were derived for both constant flux and constant head inland boundary conditions these analytical solutions were obtained by solving the discharge equation with consideration of unsaturated flow and application of continuity conditions for the head and flux at the interface after validation with numerical solutions the analytical solutions were employed to reveal the effects of unsaturated flow on the steady state seawater extent in thin unconfined coastal aquifers the results lead to the following conclusions 1 part of inland freshwater flux is located within the vadose zone i e as unsaturated flow hence leading to a lower watertable and a smaller seaward hydraulic gradient in comparison to the case where the unsaturated zone is ignored so neglecting unsaturated flow leads to underestimation of the steady state seawater extent particularly for flux controlled aquifers 2 the effects of unsaturated flow on steady state seawater extent weaken with increasing saturated zone thickness for both flux controlled and head controlled aquifers therefore unsaturated flow can be safely ignored when the aquifer has a large saturated zone 3 appropriate unsaturated zone parameter values ψca and β are essential for accurately determining the steady state seawater extent in thin unconfined coastal aquifers of these two parameters the interface location an important measure of seawater intrusion is more sensitive to ψca this shows that flow in the capillary fringe is more significant than flow in the overlying unsaturated zone in affecting the steady state seawater extent to facilitate the analytical derivations we assumed a sharp interface between seawater and freshwater and a steady state sea level these assumptions may be not appropriate for real coastal aquifers where seawater and freshwater can mix in a wide range lu et al 2009 and hydrodynamic flow conditions caused by tide and wave effects are significant xin et al 2010 moreover we neglect rainfall and pumping wells within the modelled zone independent of these factors this study confirms that unsaturated flow can play an important role in controlling seawater extent in thin unconfined coastal aquifers and the results

200,this study develops approximate analytical solutions for seawater extent in unconfined coastal aquifers considering unsaturated flow and assuming steady state sharp interface conditions for both constant flux flux controlled aquifers and constant head head controlled aquifers inland boundary conditions these analytical solutions were verified with numerical simulations of variable saturation and variable density flow the results show that neglecting unsaturated flow underestimates the steady state seawater extent particularly for flux controlled aquifers this occurs because the vadose zone transmits part of the freshwater flux towards the sea leading to a lower watertable and consequently a more landward seawater extent larger capillary fringes accompanying finer grained sediments and smaller pore sizes cause more landward locations of the interface toe for both flux controlled and head controlled aquifers the ratio of the capillary fringe thickness to the saturated zone thickness controls the relative difference in the interface toe location between cases with and without unsaturated flow when this ratio is 17 3 the relative difference in the interface toe location is 30 for the flux controlled aquifer base scenario adopted in the current study the presented analytical solutions provide improved predictions of the steady state seawater extent in thin unconfined aquifers particularly for those with relatively large capillary fringe thicknesses keywords sharp interface steady state capillary fringe seawater intrusion analytical solution 1 introduction coastal zones support more than 60 of the world s population neumann et al 2015 rapid population growth and urban development in coastal regions are responsible for increased freshwater demand as a result the dynamic equilibrium between freshwater and seawater has shifted landward in many places due to the exploitation of coastal aquifers sea level rise slr and or from other developments e g canal construction the resulting seawater intrusion has become a critical issue for the sustainable management of coastal groundwater on a global scale werner et al 2013 a substantial body of literature on seawater intrusion exists that is based on field and experimental observations e g mao et al 2006 badaruddin et al 2015 levanon et al 2017 numerical simulations e g brovelli et al 2007 robinson et al 2007 xu and hu 2017 and analytical solutions e g liu et al 2014 strack and ausk 2015 fahs et al 2016 among the methods used to calculate the seawater extent and its movement in coastal aquifers numerical simulations are the most widely adopted due to their ability to deal with complex factors that are otherwise challenging to incorporate into analytical solutions e g dispersive mixing aquifer heterogeneity time varying boundary conditions etc werner et al 2013 nevertheless analytical solutions are frequently used as first order assessment tools to estimate seawater extent because of advantages in 1 reduced computational effort 2 insights into relationships between parameters and seawater extent and 3 being exact they can be used to verify numerical models analytical solutions are most commonly based on the sharp interface representation of the freshwater seawater mixing zone steady state conditions and the dupuit forchheimer approximation i e hydrostatic pressure head distribution these allow application of the so called ghijben herzberg relationship drabbe and badon ghijben 1889 english translation given by post 2018 which expresses the depths of freshwater below and above sea level as a function of water density differences strack 1976 used the ghijben herzberg relationship and the method of girinskii potentials girinskii 1947 to develop analytical solutions for seawater extent in coastal aquifer these solutions formed the basis for many subsequent analytical studies aimed at solving a wide variety of interface flow problems under various conditions for example mantoglou 2003 applied strack s 1976 theory to determine optimal pumping rates in coastal aquifers subject to seawater intrusion lu and luo 2014 adopted strack s 1976 theory in deriving analytical solutions to investigate the effects of boundary conditions and aquifer size on the maximum pumping rate and interface toe location in coastal aquifers werner and simmons 2009 werner et al 2012 ferguson and gleeson 2012 and lu et al 2015 also applied strack s 1976 solutions to examine the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to slr recharge change pumping and other factors that cause seawater intrusion the method described by strack 1976 was extended to predict seawater extent in more complex settings including sloping e g koussis et al 2015 lu et al 2016 and stratified coastal aquifers e g strack and ausk 2015 rathore et al 2018 and in aquifers comprised of both confined and unconfined semi confined units e g bakker et al 2017 the theory of strack 1976 was also applied to the analysis of riparian freshwater lenses werner and laattoe 2016 and the effect of shoreline subsurface barriers on island lenses lu et al 2019 amongst other problems previous analytical solutions to seawater extent in unconfined coastal aquifers neglect processes occurring in the vadose zone even though unsaturated flow has been shown to affect groundwater movement e g parlange and brutsaert 1987 barry et al 1996 li et al 1997 2000 kong et al 2016 jeong and park 2017 luo et al 2018 in unconfined coastal aquifers kong et al 2013 2015 found that lateral unsaturated flow can facilitate groundwater wave propagation however whether consideration of the vadose zone might influence estimates of steady state seawater extent in unconfined coastal aquifers remains untested the primary influence of the vadose zone on seawater extent in unconfined coastal aquifers is most likely associated with the lateral transmission of freshwater towards the sea within this zone which is otherwise omitted in methods that consider only the region below the watertable e g strack 1976 therefore it can be expected that the effects of unsaturated flow on seawater extent can be safely neglected for unconfined aquifers with large saturated thickness because the additional freshwater discharge through the unsaturated zone would be relatively minor however as shown in fig 1 unconfined coastal aquifers with small thicknesses ranging from 0 1 to 25 m are widely distributed around the world zamrsky et al 2018 it remains unclear to what extent unsaturated flow affects seawater extent for these thin aquifers although the vadose zone has been considered in numerical studies of seawater intrusion in unconfined coastal aquifers e g xin et al 2010 robinson et al 2014 yu et al 2019 these studies did not investigate vadose zone effects on seawater extent additionally to date no analytical solution that includes unsaturated flow is available for prediction of seawater extent in unconfined coastal aquifers here approximate analytical solutions are presented for the steady state seawater extent in coastal aquifers taking into account unsaturated flow these analytical solutions are used to gain insights into unsaturated flow effects on the steady state seawater extent both constant flux flux controlled aquifers and constant head head controlled aquifers inland boundary conditions are considered given their importance as previously highlighted e g werner and simmons 2009 lu et al 2015 after validation with a numerical model hypothetical scenarios that illustrate the effects of unsaturated flow on the steady state seawater extent are considered sensitivity analyses of unsaturated zone parameters are further conducted to examine the effects of unsaturated flow on the steady state seawater extent for both flux controlled and head controlled aquifers 2 approximate analytical solutions 2 1 conceptual model an idealized unconfined coastal aquifer given by a rectangular domain perpendicular to the shoreline oabc with dimensions of l l length d l height is considered fig 2 the aquifer is underlain by a horizontal impermeable base oa and has a land surface boundary bc oc and ab represent the seaward and inland boundaries respectively the x z coordinate origin is placed at the intersection of the vertical seaward boundary and the impermeable base the hydraulic head above the datum ϕ l coincides with the watertable height while h l is the depth of the interface below the watertable hs l is the depth of the interface below sea level hs l is the sea level hc hs hs l is the elevation of the interface above the impermeable base and hl l is the hydraulic head at distance l from the shoreline i e the inland boundary hydraulic head the freshwater discharge per unit aquifer width flowing from inland to the sea is qf l2 t the inland boundary condition adopted in deriving the analytical solution involves specifying either hl or qf corresponding to constant head or constant flux inland boundary conditions respectively recharge through the surface boundary of the aquifer is neglected following previous work e g strack 1976 koussis et al 2012 lu et al 2016 the following assumptions are made 1 the flow system and the freshwater seawater interface are at steady state 2 a sharp interface rather than transition zone separates freshwater and seawater 3 aquifer hydraulic properties are homogeneous and isotropic 4 the aquifer has a uniform geometry with a vertical seaward boundary 5 the seepage face is ignored along the seaward boundary and 6 vertical hydraulic gradients are neglected in both the saturated zone and the vadose zone i e the dupuit forchheimer approximation leading to the same horizontal hydraulic gradient both above and below the watertable 2 2 constant flux inland boundary condition according to darcy s law and the dupuit forchheimer approximation the freshwater flux in the region of the aquifer between the seaward boundary and interface toe is 1 q f h c ϕ k s d z ϕ d k ψ d z d ϕ d x where ks lt 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity k ψ lt 1 is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and ψ l is the pressure head positive in the saturated zone and negative in the vadose zone the first and second terms on the right side of eq 1 define the net horizontal fluxes per unit width in the saturated and vadose zones respectively kong et al 2015 xin et al 2016 for the dupuit forchheimer approximation ψ is a linear function of elevation z l i e ψ ϕ z both in the saturated and vadose zones application of the same hydrostatic assumption in the analysis of tide induced watertable fluctuations was shown to produce reasonable results in terms of predicting tide induced watertable fluctuation behavior e g kong et al 2013 2015 during the past decades various expressions have been proposed to describe the relationship between k ψ and ψ in the vadose zone e g gardner 1958 mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 luo et al 2019 here gardner s 1958 function is chosen because i it has been widely employed in similar studies e g kong et al 2015 xin et al 2016 and ii it is relatively simple and permits analytical solutions for many problems gardner s 1958 function for describing the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity taking into account the capillary fringe can be written as 2 k ψ k s ψ ψ ca k s e β ψ ψ ca ψ ψ ca where ψca l is the thickness of the capillary fringe and β l 1 is the relative hydraulic conductivity exponent according to the ghijben herzberg equation the vertical thickness of the freshwater zone h above the interface is given by 3 h 1 α ϕ h s 0 x x t where α ρf ρs ρf is the relative density difference with ρf ml 3 and ρs ml 3 the densities of freshwater and seawater respectively substitution of eqs 2 and 3 into eq 1 leads to 4 q f k s 1 α ϕ h s ψ c a k s β 1 e β ϕ d ψ c a d ϕ d x hereafter flow above the watertable including flow within both the capillary fringe and the overlying unsaturated

three terms on the right side of the equation the shape of the interface is related to ψca and β which describe the capillary effect we will discuss the effect of these additional terms on steady state seawater extent in the following section at the interface toe x xt we have 9a h s h s 9b ϕ ϕ t 1 α α h s with eqs 6 and 9a substituted into eq 8 the interface toe location is 10 x t k s 1 α h s

where q l2 t is the same as qf without partitioning flow into unsaturated flow and saturated flow otherwise q is equal to the saturated zone flux at the interface toe qxt analytical derivation given in appendix both conditions q qf and q qxt will be discussed later for the former unsaturated flow is completely ignored whereas for the latter it is partially considered by a smaller qxt 2 3 constant head inland boundary condition as pointed out by lu et al 2016 the analytical solution for a constant head inland boundary can be obtained from the relationship between the inland hydraulic head and freshwater flux which allows for modification of the solution for a constant flux inland boundary similar to eq 1 the freshwater discharge of the aquifer segment between the interface toe and inland boundary is 12 q f 0 ϕ k s d z ϕ d k ψ d z d ϕ d x k s ϕ ψ c a 1 β 1 e β ϕ d ψ c a d ϕ d x integrating eq 12 gives 13 q f x c 2 1 2 k s ϕ 2 k s ψ c a ϕ k s β ϕ k s β 2 e β ϕ d ψ c a where c 2 is the

the same relation as given by eq 9 thus inserting eqs 9b and 14 into eq 13 yields 15 q f k s 1 2 h l 2 ψ c a h l h l β 1 β 2 e β h l d ψ c a 1 2 ϕ t 2 ψ c a ϕ t ϕ t β 1 β 2 e β ϕ t d ψ c a x t l combining eqs 10 and 15 leads to the analytical solution for aquifers subject to a constant head inland boundary define 16 c 3 k s 1 α h s 2 2 α 2 k s ψ c a α h s k s α β h s k s β 2 e β 1 α α h s d ψ

solution without unsaturated flow lu et al 2015 22 x t 1 α l h s 2 α 2 h l 2 1 α α h s 2 compared to eq 22 eq 21 depends not only on the sea level inland hydraulic head and aquifer length but also on the thickness of the capillary fringe and relative hydraulic conductivity exponent although the simplification of ignoring recharge within the above mathematical development may depart from the conditions expected in real world coastal phreatic aquifers adding recharge affects the assumption of hydrostatic conditions and makes estimation of the capillary fringe thickness challenging at least within the simple analytical framework of the current analysis that is rudimentary equations can be devised that characterize the vadose zone effect in the absence of recharge on the seawater extent given that recharge is neglected in the current analysis the results should be considered to apply to arid and semi arid areas where evaporation is balanced by rainfall in the upper part of the vadose zone liu 2011 macdonald et al 2021 for example based on the field data during dry periods squeo et al 2006 indicated that a coastal aquifer in north central chile is maintained at a constant watertable for nearly eight months primarily by inland flux from higher parts of the basin rather than recharge from the aquifer surface 2 4 unsaturated flow effects the effect of unsaturated flow is quantified using the relative difference rd between the interface toe locations calculated with x t and without x t unsaturated flow 23 r d x t x t x t 100 larger rd magnitudes indicate increased unsaturated flow effects it should be noted that to calculate rd for flux controlled aquifers x t and x t are replaced by xt calculated from eqs 10 and 11 respectively whereas to calculate rd for head controlled aquifers x t and x t are replaced by xt calculated from eqs 21 and 22 respectively 3 hypothetical scenarios hypothetical scenarios using parameters informed by published studies are used to examine the effects of unsaturated flow on the steady state seawater extent in flux controlled and head controlled aquifers two different model scales are considered 100 m length 6 m thickness and 1000 m length 15 m thickness the former is similar to the scale typically adopted in assessing salt marshes e g shen et al 2015 2018 whereas the latter is similar to the scale adopted in evaluating previous analytical solutions of seawater extent e g lu et al 2016 2019 in all hypothetical scenarios seawater and freshwater densities are set to 1025 and 1000 kg m3 respectively leading to α 40 to further examine the effects of unsaturated flow on the steady state seawater extent two soils are considered for each type of aquifer fine sand and weld silty clay loam jensen and hanks 1967 with weak and strong capillary effects respectively these two soils are referred to as sand and loam in the following to determine the thickness of the capillary fringe and relative hydraulic conductivity exponent for these two soils we fitted the modified gardner s function to measured data compiled by jensen and hanks 1967 with values given in table 1 a nonlinear regression algorithm matlab function lsqcurvefit was used to determine the optimal fitting parameters in a similar manner to luo et al 2019 2020 the fitted curves are in good agreement with measured data for both soils fig 3 yielding r 2 values of 0 94 and 0 97 respectively a summary of the hypothetical scenarios is presented in table 2 4 validation of analytical solutions we compare the analytical solutions with numerical results from sutra a 3 d variable saturation and variable density groundwater model voss and provost 2008 numerical simulations are based on scenarios 1 and 5 table 2 with qf 0 02 m2 d for the flux controlled aquifer and hl 3 5 m for the head controlled aquifer note that the corresponding landward boundary head and flux are 3 58 m and 0 0169 m2 d calculated from the analytical solution in the flux controlled and head controlled situations respectively the soil water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity function in sutra are represented using the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 as can be seen in figure s1 supporting information the van genuchten mualem model with fitting parameters of αvg 2 08 m 1 and nvg 11 44 matches the measured data compiled from jensen and hanks 1967 reasonably well yielding r 2 0 99 while the analytical solutions presented here assume sharp interface conditions sutra requires at least a small level of dispersion to avoid numerical errors the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity were set to 0 125 and 0 03 m respectively in a compromise between seeking a narrow mixing zone and numerical stability the model domains were discretized with node spacings of 0 25 and 0 06 m in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively to satisfy the péclet number stability criterion voss and souza 1987 to account for differences between the sharp interface of the analytical solution and the dispersive approach of sutra an empirical dispersion correction factor originally recommended by pool and carrera 2011 and later modified by lu and werner 2013 was adopted 24 λ α 1 δ w 1 4 1 where δ l is the transverse dispersivity 0 03 m and w l is the depth to the aquifer base below sea level w hs is used as an approximation for the unconfined aquifer conditions the value of λ was implemented into the analytical solutions by replacing α with λ steady state numerical model results were obtained by long time transient simulations starting initially with a freshwater filled aquifer numerical simulations were run for 1950 d with a time step of 300 s to ensure steady state results the transient location where the salt concentration is 17 5 ppt in the aquifer bed was observed until it was constant figure s2 the ilu preconditioned orthomin solver orthomin was used in numerical simulations with convergence tolerances of 10 11 kg m s2 and 10 12 for solver iterations during pressure and transport solutions respectively the assumption of a hydrostatic pressure distribution in the vadose zone was found to be consistent with the numerical model this can be seen in figure s3 which shows pressure head contours that are generally parallel with the aquifer bottom in the whole domain for both flux controlled and head controlled aquifers i e based on scenarios 1 and 5 table 2 as expected given the lack of vertical flow e g caused by recharge or evapotranspiration within the unsaturated zone note that the same hydrostatic assumption was adopted in previous studies to examine the effects of unsaturated flow on tide induced watertable fluctuations kong et al 2013 2015 as well as on hillslope recession processes where the aquifer bottom is usually sloping hilberts et al 2007 kong et al 2016 luo et al 2018 fig 4 compares the results of the analytical solution corrected for dispersion according to eq 24 and the numerical modeling for both flux controlled and head controlled aquifers i e based on scenarios 1 and 5 table 2 by comparison the sharp interface falls within the mixing zone of the dispersive results both with and without the inclusion of vadose zone effects however with the inclusion of unsaturated flow eqs 10 and 21 the sharp interface appears to be closer to the center of the mixing zone 17 5 ppt contour regardless of the aquifer type flux controlled or head controlled this adds confidence to the assumption of a hydrostatic pressure distribution in the vadose zone and the benefit of considering the unsaturated zone more generally for the flux controlled aquifer eq 11 with q qxt performs better in predicting the sharp interface in comparison to eq 11 with q qf fig 4a this demonstrates the importance of accounting for unsaturated flow since eq 11 with q qxt partially considers unsaturated flow discrepancies between analytical solutions and numerical modeling results are likely influenced by analytical solution assumptions such as the omission of vertical flow and an outflow face at the shoreline to allow for freshwater discharge 5 results and discussion 5 1 unsaturated flow effects in flux controlled aquifers the effects of unsaturated flow on flux controlled aquifers were examined by considering interface toe locations obtained from analytical solutions that include neglect or partially consider unsaturated flow i e eq 10 eq 11 with q qf and eq 11 with q qxt respectively table 2 details the relevant flux controlled scenarios scenarios 1 4 as shown in fig 5 xt decreases gradually i e interface toe locations shift further seaward with increasing qf whether taking unsaturated flow effects into account or not as expected for both small scale and large scale aquifers comprised of loam or sand as stated earlier for flux controlled sand aquifers with smaller scale scenario 1 ignoring unsaturated flow underestimates the steady state seawater extent fig 5a the vadose zone holds part of inland freshwater flux i e unsaturated flow and so leads to a lower watertable and a smaller seaward hydraulic gradient i e a larger xt for a given qf using eq 23 the difference between the interface toe locations obtained with and without capillary effects can be calculated consistent with the trend of the interface toe location the difference between the interface toe locations obtained by eqs 10 and 11 with q qf decreases from 7 14 to 1 19 m as qf increases from 0 005 to 0 03 m2 d since pumping wells are widely distributed in coastal aquifers around the world de graaf et al 2019 jasechko et al 2020 intensive pumping will significantly decrease the inland flux reduced qf and so increase the difference of the interface toe location calculated with and without unsaturated flow as a result ignoring unsaturated flow effects may lead to an inappropriate management strategy for fresh groundwater resources by comparison the result is closer to that calculated by eq 10 when unsaturated flow is partially considered eq 11 with q qxt to contrast with the low capillarity of sand we present results for loam to illustrate more clearly how unsaturated flow affects the steady state seawater extent in flux controlled aquifers with smaller scale scenario 2 again the interface toe location is underestimated if unsaturated flow is neglected fig 5b in comparison to the sand flux controlled aquifer the interface toe location is closer to the shoreline for the loam flux controlled aquifer at the same inland freshwater flux as mentioned earlier rd x t and x t calculated from eqs 10 and 11 with q qf respectively for flux controlled aquifers is independent of the inland flux with values of 22 3 for the smaller sand flux controlled aquifer and 30 for the smaller loam flux controlled aquifer as might be expected the effects of unsaturated flow are more significant in loam flux controlled aquifers due to strong capillary effects of the loam for flux controlled aquifers with larger scale scenarios 3 and 4 corresponding to figs 5c and d respectively there are still significant deviations between the interface toe locations calculated with and without accounting for unsaturated flow it should be noted that qf is assumed the same as that in small scale aquifers to highlight the significant role played by unsaturated flow this small inland flux occurs widely in reality according to a recent estimate by jasechko et al 2020 due to high groundwater pumping even landward hydraulic gradients exist in a substantial fraction of the east coast and gulf coast of the us compared to smaller flux controlled aquifers the difference of the interface toe location increases for larger flux controlled aquifers while rd x t and x t calculated from eqs 10 and 11 with q qf respectively decreases to 7 92 for the larger sand flux controlled aquifer and 11 6 for the larger loam flux controlled aquifer this is because increasing the saturated zone depth reduces the contribution of the flow in the vadose zone to the total overall flow to further assess the analytical solution with consideration of unsaturated flow the steady state seawater extent was calculated for a broader range of flux controlled aquifers the model parameters are based on scenarios 1 2 with fixing d hs 3 m but varying the sea level hs from 3 to 17 m i e the aquifer thickness d varied from 6 to 20 m the inland freshwater flux qf was set to 0 1 m2 d as can be seen when hs increases from 3 to 17 m rd x t and x t calculated from eqs 10 and 11 with q qf respectively decreases from 30 to 7 in loam flux controlled aquifers while it decreases from 22 to 5 in sand flux controlled aquifers fig 6 this suggests that the effects of unsaturated flow on the steady state seawater extent weakens with increasing saturated zone thickness in comparison to sand aquifers for the same hs rd is larger for loam aquifers due to more pronounced capillary effects this confirms that increasing the ratio of the thickness of the capillary fringe to that of the saturated zone leads to more significant effects of unsaturated flow as expected when q qxt in eq 11 rd greatly decreases compared with q qf indicating the importance of considering unsaturated flow 5 2 unsaturated flow effects in head controlled aquifers in order to examine unsaturated flow effects on the steady state seawater extent in head controlled aquifers the interface toe location was calculated for scenarios 5 8 table 2 based on the analytical solutions with and without unsaturated flow i e eqs 21 and 22 respectively the interface toe location shifts seaward with increasing hl whether taking unsaturated flow effects into account or not as expected for both small scale and large scale aquifers comprised of loam or sand fig 7 consistent with flux controlled aquifers the interface toe location is underestimated for head controlled aquifers without accounting for unsaturated flow for sand head controlled aquifers with smaller scale scenario 5 when increasing hl from 3 5 to 5 m xt decreases from 8 56 to 1 69 m with unsaturated flow considered whereas it decreases from 7 62 to 1 46 m with unsaturated flow ignored fig 7a as above this is because the vadose zone can hold part of inland freshwater flux and hence leads to a more landward steady state seawater extent the underestimation of the interface toe location due to ignoring unsaturated flow also occurs for the other three cases figs 7b d it should be noted that for a given aquifer xt calculated from the analytical solution without including unsaturated flow is identical for sand and loam head controlled aquifers fig 7 since the watertable is the same in both the sand and loam head controlled aquifers however because of different capillarity magnitudes xt is slightly smaller for sand aquifers compared to loam aquifers with unsaturated flow included to further quantify the role played by unsaturated flow rd was calculated for head controlled aquifers as shown in fig 8 it increases monotonically as hl increases specifically for smaller sand and loam head controlled aquifers increasing hl from 3 5 to 5 m results in rd varying from 11 to 13 6 and 15 to 18 5 respectively fig 8a this is because unsaturated flow is increased at larger hl under the dupuit forchheimer approximation the horizontal hydraulic gradient is the same both above and below the watertable increasing hl induces a larger hydraulic gradient and hence increased unsaturated flow in addition rd is greater for loam aquifers compared to sand because of the greater capillary effect of the loam compared with smaller head controlled aquifers rd is smaller in larger head controlled aquifers where unsaturated flow effects are relatively minor fig 8b moreover rd is smaller for head controlled aquifers compared with flux controlled aquifers indicating that the capillary effect plays a more significant role in flux controlled aquifers this occurs since due to the addition of the vadose zone the flow towards the sea is unchanged in the flux controlled situation leading to a head drop at the inland boundary whereas in the head controlled case flow towards the sea is enhanced with the addition of the vadose zone despite this enhanced flow in the head controlled case the seaward hydraulic gradient is lower which induces a more landward seawater extent with unsaturated flow considered the analytical solution with unsaturated flow included was also used to calculate the steady state seawater extent for a broader range of head controlled aquifers the model parameters are based on scenarios 5 6 taking d hs 3 m but varying the sea level hs from 3 to 17 m i e the aquifer thickness d varied from 6 to 20 m the inland hydraulic head hl was 1 m higher than hs for head controlled aquifers as can be seen rd decreases with increasing hs fig 9 this again shows that the effects of unsaturated flow on steady state seawater extent weaken with increasing thickness of the saturated zone furthermore rd is smaller in head controlled aquifers compared with flux controlled aquifers which indicates a more significant role played by unsaturated flow in flux controlled aquifers 5 3 sensitivity analyses sensitivity analyses were performed to further examine the effects of unsaturated flow on seawater extent for both flux controlled and head controlled aquifers the present study focuses on two parameters related to unsaturated flow namely the thickness of the capillary fringe ψca and relative hydraulic conductivity exponent β sensitivity analyses for both flux controlled and head controlled aquifers are based on scenarios 1 and 5 table 2 respectively motivated by the increasing global mean sea level kim et al 2019 we considered two different sea levels of 3 and 3 5 m for both flux controlled and head controlled aquifers in addition we assumed that ψca varied from 0 to 0 5 m and that β increased from 5 to 20 m 1 for sand for sensitivity analysis of ψca β was fixed at its optimal value i e 11 m 1 for sand whereas ψca was fixed at its optimal value i e 0 35 m for computing the sensitivity of β note that different from scenarios 5 hl was varied from 4 to 5 m when conducting sensitivity analyses for the head controlled aquifer fig 10 shows the sensitivity of rd to soil unsaturated flow parameters for sand flux controlled aquifers with hs 3 m before slr and hs 3 5 m after slr as can be seen varying β and ψca leads to a wide range of rd for the flux controlled aquifer especially when rd is calculated from eqs 10 and 11 with q qf this suggests that appropriate values of ψca and β are essential for accurately assessing the steady state seawater extent for the controlled aquifers as expected rd decreases with increasing β or decreasing ψca which both weaken the capillary effect in comparison to the sensitivity analyses of β and ψca rd varies in a wider range for changing ψca indicating that the flow in the capillary fringe has more influence on the steady state seawater extent moreover rd becomes smaller after slr fig 10 for example when ψca 0 5 and β increases from 5 to 20 m 1 rd calculated from eqs 10 and 11 with q qf respectively decreases from about 31 to 26 before slr whereas it decreases from about 28 to 23 after slr the saturated zone thickness increases and then the ratio of the thickness of the capillary fringe to that of the saturated zone decreases after slr resulting in a reduction of rd when calculated from eqs 10 and 11 with q qxt rd is significantly smaller than that from eqs 10 and 11 with q qf fig 10 note that rd is independent of the inland freshwater flux in flux controlled aquifers section 2 4 similarly fig 11 presents the sensitivity of rd to unsaturated flow parameters for a sand head controlled aquifer with hs 3 m before slr and hs 3 5 m after slr again rd decreases with increasing β or decreasing ψca consistent with flux controlled aquifers a change in ψca leads to a wider variation of rd and a reduction in rd can be found after slr fig 11 6 conclusions based on the sharp interface assumption and dupuit forchheimer approximation analytical solutions that take account of unsaturated flow for the steady state seawater extent in unconfined coastal aquifers were derived for both constant flux and constant head inland boundary conditions these analytical solutions were obtained by solving the discharge equation with consideration of unsaturated flow and application of continuity conditions for the head and flux at the interface after validation with numerical solutions the analytical solutions were employed to reveal the effects of unsaturated flow on the steady state seawater extent in thin unconfined coastal aquifers the results lead to the following conclusions 1 part of inland freshwater flux is located within the vadose zone i e as unsaturated flow hence leading to a lower watertable and a smaller seaward hydraulic gradient in comparison to the case where the unsaturated zone is ignored so neglecting unsaturated flow leads to underestimation of the steady state seawater extent particularly for flux controlled aquifers 2 the effects of unsaturated flow on steady state seawater extent weaken with increasing saturated zone thickness for both flux controlled and head controlled aquifers therefore unsaturated flow can be safely ignored when the aquifer has a large saturated zone 3 appropriate unsaturated zone parameter values ψca and β are essential for accurately determining the steady state seawater extent in thin unconfined coastal aquifers of these two parameters the interface location an important measure of seawater intrusion is more sensitive to ψca this shows that flow in the capillary fringe is more significant than flow in the overlying unsaturated zone in affecting the steady state seawater extent to facilitate the analytical derivations we assumed a sharp interface between seawater and freshwater and a steady state sea level these assumptions may be not appropriate for real coastal aquifers where seawater and freshwater can mix in a wide range lu et al 2009 and hydrodynamic flow conditions caused by tide and wave effects are significant xin et al 2010 moreover we neglect rainfall and pumping wells within the modelled zone independent of these factors this study confirms that unsaturated flow can play an important role in controlling seawater extent in thin unconfined coastal aquifers and the results

201,effective water resources management in california relies substantially on real time information of snow water equivalent swe at basin scale and mountain ranges given that mountain snowpacks provide the primary water supply for the state however swe estimation based solely on remote sensing modeling or ground observations does not meet contemporary operational requirements in this context this study develops a data fusion framework that combines multi source datasets including satellite observed daily mean fractional snow covered area dmfsca snow pillow swe measurements physiographic data and historical swe patterns into a linear regression model lrm to improve swe estimates in real time we test two lrms a baseline regression model lrm baseline that uses physiographic data and historical swe patterns as independent variables and an fsca informed regression model lrm fsca that includes the dmfsca from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite imagery as an additional independent variable by incorporating the satellite observed dmfsca lrm fsca outperforms lrm baseline with increased median r2 from 0 54 to 0 60 and reduced median pbias of basin average swe from 2 6 to 2 2 in the snow pillow swe cross validation lrm fsca explains 87 of the variance in the snow course swe measurements with 0 1 pbias while lrm baseline explains a lower 81 variance with 1 4 pbias both of which show higher accuracy than swe estimates from the two operational swe datasets the snow data assimilation system snodas 73 and 2 4 respectively and nationtional water model nwm 75 and 15 9 respectively additionally lrm fsca explains 85 of the median variance in the airborne snow observatory swe with 9 2 pbias which is comparable to the lrm baseline 86 and 11 3 respectively and considerably better than snodas 64 and 28 2 respectively and nwm 33 and 30 1 respectively this study shows a substantial model improvement by constraining the geographical and seasonal variation on snow cover via satellite observation and highlights the values of using multi source observations in real time swe estimation the developed swe estimation framework has crucial implications for effective water supply forecasting and management in california where climate extremes e g droughts and floods require particularly skillful monitoring practices keywords snow water equivalent snow covered area real time swe modeling statistical learning sierra nevada snowpack remote sensing 1 introduction seasonal snow covers over 30 of the earth s land surface and provides the water supply for approximately one sixth of the global population dozier 1989 barnett et al 2005 in the western united states meltwater from seasonal snowpack contributes 50 to 80 of annual runoff stewart et al 2004 li et al 2017 snowmelt runoff recharges groundwater aquifers and surface water reservoirs providing a vital water source for urban and agricultural areas barnett et al 2005 mote et al 2005 bales et al 2006 mountain snowpack strongly influences the timing and magnitude of streamflow hamlet et al 2005 lundquist et al 2015 and thus accurate real time information of the spatial variability of mountain snowpack is particularly important for effective water management and water supply forecasting he et al 2016 one traditional method to forecast water supply in california relies on in situ observations of snow water equivalent swe including an automatic snow pillow network providing real time swe measurements and extensive manual snow courses taken at the beginning of each month during snow seasons pagano et al 2004 he et al 2016 however these point scale and transect scale ground observations inadequately capture the spatial heterogeneity of snowpack distribution in mountainous terrain molotch and bales 2005 bales et al 2006 recent studies indicate that spatial patterns of snow accumulation and melt are shifting due to climate change further motivating improved understanding of the processes controlling streamflow generation nijssen et al 2001 barnett et al 2005 godsey et al 2014 mote et al 2018 therefore to better support water management decision making it is imperative to have accurate real time spatially distributed swe information many efforts have been made to estimate spatially distributed swe in near real time i e with a one or two day processing lag time yet all approaches have limitations when applied over large scale mountainous regions dozier et al 2016 for the in situ swe observations the natural resource conservation service nrcs has operated the snow telemetry snotel network since the mid 1960s serreze et al 1999 there are more than 800 snotel sites located in the mountainous regions across the western united states providing swe measurements automatically every 15 minutes additionally the california legislature estabilished the california cooperative snow surveys ccss program in 1929 with alliances in more than 50 state federal and private agencies roos 2004 they collect and analyze snow data from snow courses and now there are more than 200 snow courses located throughout the sierra nevada these ground based swe measurements have been interpolated into spatially distributed swe based on their relationships with predictor variables e g elevation aspect slope solar radiation wind etc using spatial interpolation or regression methods carroll et al 1999 fassnacht et al 2003 fassnacht et al 2012 molotch et al 2005 however the accuracy of these statistcical methods is largly hindered by the high heterogeneity of swe distribution over mountainous terrian the observation desnity and the representativeiness of the predict variables in addition to the interpolation or regression of in situ swe observations remotely sensed passive microwave pm data have provided global swe observations over the past three decades takala et al 2017 yet applications of pm swe data products are limited by many factors such as the mixed pixel problem at coarse spatial resolutions e g 25 km the saturation of the pm signal over deep snow the many to one relationships between the pm signal snow grain size and swe and the impacts of forest cover durand and margulis 2007 vander jagt et al 2013 while fusing ground based snow depth observations could increase the spatial resolution of pm swe data products e g 5 km takala et al 2017 it remains challenging to overcome the aforementioned issues and thus pm based swe data products often exclude mountainous regions snow models hydrological models and land surface models are also available for real time swe estimation however these models often show poor performance in swe estimation partly because of the high uncertainty of precipitation model forcing which is particularly problematic in mountainous regions milly and dunne 2002 adam et al 2006 other operational models like the snow data assimilation system snodas from the noaa national weather service s national operational hydrologic remote sensing center nohrsc are usually available in near real time carroll et al 2001 barrett 2003 clow et al 2012 evaluated snodas with ground snow survey data in the colorado rocky mountains and reported that snodas performed well in forested areas with 77 of the variance in swe explained but exhibited high uncertainties over alpine regions in which only 30 of the variance in swe was explained because of high wind redistribution despite the listed challenges recent progress has been made in real time swe estimation by combining historical swe estimates developed via reanalysis with statistical models schneider and molotch 2016 bair et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 in this context reanalyses of swe distribution using swe reconstruction models and data assimilation techniques have been promising for swe modeling over large scale mountainous regions durand et al 2008 molotch 2009 guan et al 2013 girotto et al 2014 margulis et al 2016 rittger et al 2016 bair et al 2016 2018 these methods outperforms pm and snodas by the exploitation of satellite based observations of snow cover depletion and or snow albedo bair et al 2019 notwithstanding these methods cannot be used for real time swe estimation given the retrospective calculation process therefore to improve real time swe estimation one effort has coupled the historical swe from reconstruction models as an independent predictor for statistically based swe estimation schneider and molotch 2016 bair et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 because snow distribution is often controlled by the interactions between meteorology and local constant topographic characteristics snow patterns exhibit considerable consistency from year to year deems et al 2008 mendoza et al 2020 pflug and lundquist 2020 in other words the historical swe data usually contains relevant information regarding the swe patterns of interest e g real time swe by incorporating this relevant pattern from the historical reconstructed swe data real time swe estimation has been substantially improved in some large mountain ranges such as upper colorado river basin ucrb schneider and molotch 2016 and a few basins in california sierra nevada zheng et al 2018 to evaluate modeled swe accuracy early studies have used many independent validation datasets including ground based onservations and the airborne snow observatory aso swe products the ground based swe observations particularly snow pillow and snow course data represent the most accurate swe information at point scale i e snow pillow and transect scale i e snow course and have thus been used as validation datasets in many previous research erickson et al 2005 franz et al 2008 raleigh and lundquist 2012 margulis et al 2015 wrzesien et al 2019 however a limitation of these datasets is that they cannot fully capture the spatial variability of swe over an entire watershed clark et al 2011 moreover these sites are often located at easily accessible locations further limiting their representativeness for evaluating spatially complex swe estimates another commonly used validation dataset is based on the interpolation of intensive snow surveys molotch et al 2005 durand and margulis 2007 guan et al 2013 meromy et al 2013 schneider and molotch 2016 yet the high logistical cost and feasibility of these surveys prevent its operational applications over larger areas the nasa aso mission and now aso inc which was created to transfer the technology for implementation around the globe provides swe estimates with unprecedented accuracy from year to year in several selected basins in the california sierra nevada and elsewhere in the western united states painter et al 2016 the aso aircraft carries a light detection and ranging lidar sensor and a visible through near infrared imaging spectrometer to measure snow on and snow off surface heights that are differenced to derive estimates of snow depth by leveraging snow density calculated by a physically based snow model isnobal marks et al 1999 constrained by in situ measurements aso has derived very accurate swe estimates at a high spatial resolution 50 m painter et al 2016 the detailed description of aso swe product and its uncertainty analysis is well documented in painter et al 2016 while the evaluation methods might be different the magnitude of aso swe uncertainty is far less than that of the swe errors from aforementioned swe estimation studies like swe interpolation and or regression fassnacht et al 2003 schneider and molotch 2016 reconstruction guan et al 2013 rittger et al 2016 and data assimilation margulis et al 2016 thus aso swe is increasingly used as ground truth information to evaluate other swe data products at large basin scales bair et al 2016 yang et al 2018 oaida et al 2019 aso swe outperforms the traditional small scale ground based swe observations by providing spatially complete swe estimates over large watersheds at a high spatial resolution painter et al 2016 bormann et al 2018 yet one limitation of using aso swe product in validation is that it only has a relatively short perioed 2013 present compared to the snow pillow mid 1960s and snow survey mid 1930s datasets additionally airborne campaigns are mostly conducted during the snow ablation period near and after peak swe and for only a few selected watersheds limiting our understanding of snow accumulation and swe in time and space thus using aso data alone cannot comprehensively evaluate the swe accuracy in the sierra nevada for watersheds and periods when the aso data are not available the objectives of this study are to improve real time swe estimation over all basins in the california sierra nevada and to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the swe estimates relative to other real time swe products currently produced operationally built on previous work we developed a statistically based data fusion framework to estimate swe in real time which combines ground snow pillow swe measurements physiographic data satellite observed daily mean fractional snow covered area dmfsca physically based historical swe patterns with a linear regression model lrm previous studies have used remotely sensed fsca data to inform hydrological models in many applications where the swe is often inferred from snow cover depletion curves liston 1999 gómez landesa and rango 2002 andreadis and lettenmaier 2006 clark et al 2006 niu and yang 2007 however fsca is not directly related to swe and fsca can remain constant as swe changes from day to day rendering fsca on a single day less useful in predicting swe therefore we introduce a new variable dmfsca which is calculated as the mean of time series fsca from the beginning of each water year to the date of simulation as a predictor variable on swe estimation dmfsca is sensitive to the magnitude of snow accumulation i e increases dmfsca and ablation processes i e decreased dmfsca as it describes the historical temporal variability of snow cover for example when pixels are completely covered by snow i e fsca equal 100 for a modeling day the dmfsca value in a pixel with seasonal snowpack e g high elevations with continuous snow accumulation would be greater than in a pixel with an ephemeral snowpack i e low elevations with frequent snowmelt which are more likely to correspond with the swe distribution than the fsca values for these two pixels both equal 100 using dmfsca also has a low pass filtering effect that reduces the influences of the noise in fsca data for swe modeling although dmfsca does not provide direct swe information it is potentially useful as an explanatory variable in a statistical regression to explain the spatial distribution of swe to examine the influence of satellite derived dmfsca for swe estimation we compared two lrms in this study a baseline regression model lrm baseline in which the dependent variables included physiographic variables and historical swe patterns from an swe reanalysis dataset margulis et al 2016 and an fsca informed swe regression model lrm fsca in which the dmfsca derived from modis satellite imagery rittger et al 2020 was included as an additional independent variable two other swe datasets were also included in comparison to provide a baseline of swe accuracy in the operational applications swe estimates from snodas carroll et al 2001 barrett 2003 and from the national water model hereafter nwm swe retrospective runs version 1 2 operated by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration gochis et al 2018 we present the inter model differences in terms of their accuracy interannual variability and spatial patterns section 2 describes the study area and section 3 describes the datasets the lrm framework and the evaluation methods the results are presented in section 4 with the discussion and conclusion given in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 study area the study area covers 20 major snow dominated watersheds hydrological unite code 8 huc8 in the sierra nevada california with a total area of 49 409 km2 fig 1 given ephemeral snowpacks variations below 1500 m elevation in the sierra nevada bales et al 2006 guan et al 2013 margulis et al 2016 rittger et al 2016 the modeling domain is cutoff to areas above 1500 m of which the average elevation is 2270 m ranging from 1500 m to 4410 m the sierra nevada has a mediterranean climate with distinct dry summers and wet winters the average annual temperature is approximately 10 c and the total annual precipitation is approximately 830 mm estimated from parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism 30 year normals daly et al 1994 80 of the annual precipitation occurs in the cold months from october to may mainly in the form of snow swain et al 2016 influenced by the prevailing west winds the west facing windward slopes of the sierra nevada capture the majority of the moisture from the pacific ocean generating a large amount of orographic precipitation while the eastern leeward slopes have more arid climate conditions based on national land cover database 2011 nlcd2011 evergreen needle leaf forest 38 and shrub lands 36 are the two major land cover types in the sierra nevada with most of the forest cover on the western slopes of the sierra where the annual precipitation and temperature are both relatively high trujillo et al 2012 hansen et al 2013 the aso mission details on https www jpl nasa gov missions airborne snow observatory aso began snow survey flights of the upper tuolumne river basin trb fig 1 in 2013 and routinely provides swe data at a 50 m resolution during the snowmelt seasons the upper trb is located on the west side of the sierra nevada with a total area of 1200 km2 the average elevation of the upper trb is about 2680 m with a wide elevation range from 1500 m to 3970 m a range similar to the entire sierra nevada about 40 of the trb is above tree line which is proportionally much more alpine land area than the sierra nevada study area on the whole evergreen needle leaf forest 37 and shrublands 48 are the two dominant land cover types in the upper trb hansen et al 2013 the average annual temperature and total precipitation are about 4 c and 1260 mm respectively based on prism 30 year normals daly et al 1994 snowmelt runoff from the trb drains into the hetch hetchy reservoir providing the primary water resource to the city of san francisco and other bay area municipalities 3 methods and datasets the lrm relies on the lasso and elastic net regularized generalized linear model glmnet details on https glmnet stanford edu articles glmnet html to approximate the relationship between the independent variables listed in table 1 and the dependent variable i e swe observations from ground snow pillow stations fig 2 illustrates the schematic of the lrm with a detailed description in sections 3 1 and 3 2 to examine the impacts of satellite observed dmfsca on model performance we run two lrms at a daily time step at 500 m spatial resolution i e the same resolution as used by schneider and molotch 2016 during the period when there is significant snow on the ground i e from january to june over the water year wy october 1 september 30 2001 through 2019 across the modeling domain fig 1 hereafter termed lrm baseline and lrm fsca both simulations were evaluated through three methods including 1 cross validation at snow pillow stations 2 comparison against snow course measurements across the sierra and 3 comparison against the spatially distributed aso swe data in the upper trb the performance of snodas and the nwm swe were also included in the latter two evaluations i e against snow course swe and aso swe to compare the performance of these complementary models relative to those developed herein given that snow pillow swe observations were used in some of the presented models i e lrms and snodas snow pillow swe observations were not used for model comparison as they are not independent from model input data in these circumstances 3 1 data sources 3 1 1 dependent variable the swe training samples for the lrm were acquired from 113 snow pillow stations across the study area fig 1 the snow pillow stations over 1500 m span the elevation range from 1570 m to 3475 m with more sites located in the mid elevations than lower and higher elevations fig 3 the average elevation of snow pillow stations is about 2500 m and the average density is about 440 km2 per site while snow pillow stations may be inadequate to capture the high spatial variability of swe across the sierra they are denser than the station networks in most mountainous regions globally and thus the sierra nevada is a relatively ideal region for statistically based swe modeling all snow pillow data were downloaded from the california data exchange center https cdec water ca gov and quality controlled because using the point scale snow pillow swe observations may not fully represent the average swe estimates over the 500 m grid cell molotch et al 2005 meromy et al 2013 we used fsca data to scale the point swe observations to improve their representativeness at the 500 m grid scale schneider and molotch 2016 3 1 2 independent variables table 1 lists all the independent variables used in the two lrms including the 18 static physiographic variables and the dynamic historical swe reanalysis and dmfsca earlier studies of bair et al 2018 fassnacht et al 2003 schneider and molotch 2016 suggested that physiographic variables have significnat impacts on swe distrubution and thus we selected the listed physiographic variables table 1 for swe modeling all physiographic variables were derived from the shuttle radar topography mission 1 arc second global digital elevation model srtm dem which was downloaded from https earthexplorer usgs gov at about 30 m spatial resolution and then resampled to 500 m spatial resolution using bilinear interpolation method the extent of swe was determined by a gap filled daily fsca dataset which was derived from the modis snow covered area and grain size modscag painter et al 2009 at a 463 m spatial resolution modscag shows better performance than the standard nasa snow cover product mod10a1 hall et al 2002 when compared to fsca from landsat 5 and landsat 7 during accumulation and melt rittger et al 2013 recent work has shown that modscag has a bias of only 0 5 when compared to fsca from landsat 8 rittger et al 2021 the modscag fsca was further refined to account for off nadir viewing dozier et al 2008 improved cloud detection and canopy adjustment rittger et al 2020 and interpolated using a smoothing spline method dozier et al 2008 creating spatially and temporally complete stc modscag fsca hereby referred to as stc modscag data from wy 2021 is publicly available with a time lag of about two days and the historical dataset from 2001 to 2020 is available on request to early adopters https nsidc org snow today data request in addition to swe reconstruction efforts previously noted the fsca data has been used for evaluating climate models wrzesien et al 2015 minder et al 2016 and for validating regional scale models to better understand the sources of and deposition of dust and carbon sarangi et al 2019 2020 we first resampled the stc modscag fsca data from sinusoidal projection to the universal transverse mercator utm zone 11 n with the 1983 north american datum nad i e the original projection of the aso swe data at 500 m resolution using the bilinear interpolation method the resampled fsca data were then used to scale snow pillow swe observations as previously noted so that the point scale swe observations are more representative of the 500 m grid cell mean swe additionally the independent variable dmfsca was calculated based on daily stc modscag fsca both stc modscag fsca and dmfsca were represented as a percentage 0 100 value finally we used the binary snow extent derived from this real time stc modscag fsca dataset to determine the snow covered areas for the final modeled swe estimates in which the snow free pixel was determined when the fsca value equals 0 the sierra nevada swe reanalysis snsr daily at about 100 m resolution from 1985 to 2016 data details on https margulis group github io data margulis et al 2015 2016 was used as to provide analog historical swe patterns see table 1 last variable for the lrms in real time swe estimation the snsr relies on a land surface model simplified simple biosphere model version 3 xue et al 2003 coupled with a snow depletion curve model lsm sdc liston 2004 to derive the prior swe and fsca estimates in which the radiative and meteorological forcings are obtained from downscaled nldas 2 xia et al 2012 the particle batch smoother pbs data assimilation da scheme was then used to account for the uncertainty of the prior swe estimate directly based on the fsca retrieved from landsat i e landsat 5 thematic mapper landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper and landsat 8 operational land imager details in margulis et al 2015 2016 snsr provides the most accurate swe estimates on average across the entire sierra in a comparison with four other large scale swe datasets at various spatial resolutions yang et al 2018 it also has a long historical modeling period i e 32 years relative to other datasets bair et al 2016 guan et al 2013 rittger et al 2016 covering a large range of swe conditions despite the good performance of snsr it is not applicable for real time swe estimation given its requirement of complete seasonal snow cover depletion information observed from satellites for the pbs da process margulis et al 2015 2016 thus we selected the snsr to provide historical swe patterns for the lrm to select the historical snsr that can best represent the spatial patterns of swe on the target simulation date we designed a two step process to compare the snow pillow swe patterns between the target simulation date and historical dates first we identified the historical dates that have similar numbers of non zero swe observations e g the difference is 10 in the study which can reduce the impact of zero values on the linear regression fits in the next step secondly the similarity of swe patterns was quantified by the squared pearson correlation coefficient r2 of the simple linear regression between snow pillow swe on the two dates for each date when the lrm is run the historical swe reanalysis with the highest r2 was used as the best historical swe distribution data this two step process assumes that the similarity in swe patterns at stations is also true across the sierra nevada to replicate how a real time swe estimation would produce we only chose the historical swe on the wys before the current simulation wy even though the snsr is available throughout 1986 2016 partially handicapping our approach by not using all of the historical data all the historical swe data were resampled from the native 100 m spatial resolution to 500 m using bilinear interpolation to match the extent and scale of the resampled stc modscag fsca data to eliminate the influence of magnitude difference all the independent variables i e 18 physiographic variables the dmfsca and the snsr were scaled to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 we used a mask of the maximum water extent in the global surface water gsw dataset pekel et al 2016 to exclude water bodies inside the study area that are often mapped fsca or modeled swe incorrectly the maximum water extent data was derived from landsat imagery that has a higher spatial resolution of 30 m for the 1984 2019 period we resampled this dataset to the 500 m resolution using the nearest neighbor method which shows good performance in resampling categorical data 3 2 statistical model for swe estimation the glmnet used in lrm outperformes the generalized linear model glm originally employed by schneider and molotch 2016 by optimally handling linearly related independent variables e g the physiographic variables used by the lrm to address multicollinearity among independent variables the glmnet uses an elastic net approach to combine two regularization approaches 1 shrinking the coefficients of correlated predictors to zero while keeping all independent variables i e ridge regression and 2 selecting one independent variable and discarding the others i e lasso regression resulting in a more stable and accurate model the optimal hyperparameter was determined by a k fold i e 10 folds cross validation where the lowest mean absolute error among approximately one hundred model simulationswas chosen in the final model details in friedman et al 2010 simon et al 2011 2013 tibshirani et al 2012 following schneider and molotch 2016 the gaussian distribution with the identity link function was used to transform the dependent variable in the glmnet given the requirement of the gaussian distribution of swe observations for the statistical lrm training we only ran the model on the days with more than 40 snow pillow stations i e about 35 of the total stations reporting non zero swe values we used 40 as an empirical threshold to stop running the lrm to ensure the representativeness of model training samples 3 3 two operational swe datasets snodas provides daily swe estimates at 0600 coordinated universal time utc in near real time for the contiguous united states at a 1000 m spatial resolution since wy 2004 data are available at https nsidc org data g02158 barrett 2003 snodas is a physically based snow modeling and data assimilation system which ingests a variety of outputs from physically based models meteorological data remote sensing data and snotel observations including snow depth and swe carroll et al 2006 clow et al 2012 the national water model nwm is an extension of the weather research and forecasting hydrological model wrf hydro coupled with the community noah land surface model with multiparameterization options noah mp to simulate the land surface processes including swe gochis et al 2018 the nwm swe dataset used in this study is the output of the nwm retrospective version 1 2 data are available at http edc occ data org nwm getdata which is a 25 year retrospective simulation from 1993 to 2017 nwm swe covers a large domain roughly from latitude 19 n to 58 n that includes the continental united states canada and mexico at a spatial resolution of 1000 m to assure data consistency with snodas we used the nwm swe data at 0600 utc in the comparison for consistent data evaluation and inter comparison each snodas and nwm swe grid cell at 1000 m resolution was disaggregated evenly to four 500 m grid cells and then resampled to the nad83 utm zone 11 n using bilinear interpolation method 3 4 model evaluation we used ground swe observations and the aso swe product to provide a comprehensive validation for the four swe models i e lrm baseline lrm fsca snodas and nwm at different scales the ground observations i e snow pillow and snow courses provide the most accurate swe estimates at a point scale or transect scale across the entire sierra while the aso swe data represents the most accurate basin scale swe estimates to the extent of our knowledge because snow pillow swe observation is not an independent evaluation dataset for lrm and snodas we only applied cross validation at snow pillow sites to evaluate lrms performance in modeling swe the snow pillow cross validation was conducted for all 2682 daily simulations i e 141 days per year on average for the 19 year modeling period i e wys 2001 2019 the swe validation was conducted against a total of 6407 snow course station years and 23 aso flights details in the following three sub sections 3 4 1 cross validation using snow pillow swe observations we used the monte carlo cross validation i e repeated random sub sampling validation method dubitzky et al 2007 to evaluate the two lrms performance for each simulation day we randomly identified 10 of the 113 snow pillow observations i e 11 samples for testing with the remaining 90 of observations used for model training next a simple linear regression model was fit between the modeled swe estimates and the testing observation we repeated this process 30 times in balance of computational cost and evaluation efficiency the average values of the following four statistical metrics from all 30 simple linear regression models were used to describe the overall performance of each simulation squared pearson correlation coefficient r2 root mean squared error rmse relative mean absolute error rmae i e mean absolute error divided by the mean of fsca scaled snow pillow observations and percent bias pbias of average swe for modeled estimates against observations the r2 represents the correlation between modeled and observed swe and the rmse represents the variability of the model residuals the rmae represents the relative errors of modeled swe in the context of different swe magnitudes the last metric pbias represents the relative bias of average swe over the entire study domain the typical model performance is described by the distribution of each metric with the combination of the mean median and one standard deviation these four metrics were also used in the subsequent validations using snow course measurements and the aso swe data 3 4 2 validation using snow course swe measurements there are 215 snow course sites located in the study area with an average elevation of 2400 m ranging from 1500 m to 3500 m each snow course consists of approximately 5 15 point scale swe measurements along an established transect using a calibrated federal snow sampler dewalle and rango 2008 these data offer monthly swe measurements near the first day of each month from january to may or june depending on the amount of snow remaining on the ground to ensure the independence of the evaluation data from the training data i e snow pillow swe we removed snow course sites located within a 2 km distance of snow pillows leaving 148 snow course sites for evaluation all the snow course data were downloaded from the california data exchange center http cdec water ca gov we extracted swe estimates from the four swe datasets at snow course sites and compared them to snow course swe measurements the spatial mismatch of the transect to 500 m pixels may cause uncertainties in this evaluation to reduce the impact of this mismatch we scaled snow course swe measurements using fsca data so that the observations can better represent the average swe estimates at the 500 m resolution schneider and molotch 2016 additionally to reduce the impacts from resampling previously described the swe estimates at the eight neighboring grid cells surrounding the target grid cell i e the snow course site located in the middle of the 3 3 grid cell window were also used in the evaluation the swe value with the smallest difference among the nine grid cells was used in the calculation of the statistical metrics bair et al 2016 rittger et al 2016 margulis et al 2016 given the difference in data availability lrms from 2001 to 2019 snodas from 2004 to the present nwm swe from 1993 to 2017 we only compared the evaluation results in their overlap period from wy 2004 to wy 2017 for data consistency only swe estimates available for all datasets at snow course sites were compared there remain 6407 station years in total that contain coincident swe estimates for the four swe datasets the same four statistical metrics i e r2 rmse rmae and pbias were calculated to evaluate swe accuracy at snow course sites 3 4 3 validation using aso swe data considering the overlap period wys 2004 2017 of the four swe datasets and the aso data availability wy 2013 to present we compared the aso swe validation for the four models throughout wys 2013 2017 with a total of 19 days i e 19 aso flights we also included the validation in wy 2018 and wy 2019 for lrm baseline and lrm fsca with 4 additional flights to give a more comprehensive lrm model evaluation given the various spatial projections and resolutions of these datasets we resampled all data into the same projection as the aso swe data see section 3 1 2 and 500 m spatial resolution a 3 3 window see section 3 4 2 was also used in the validation against aso swe the basin wide pbias was calculated directly based on the resampled swe data over the entire trb meaning no neighboring pixels were considered in the pbias calculation 3 5 inter comparison of swe datasets the temporal overlap period of the four swe datasets covers 14 wys from 2004 to 2017 including the region s most recent snow drought period 2012 2016 and the wet years of 2011 and 2017 for each wy we calculated the maximum snow water storage hereafter sws across the sierra and the day of year doy when the sierra wide sws reaches the maximum we introduce sws i e swe multiples by the total area in this comparison because it is a water volume metric that can reflect water availability for the study area directly while swe value only represents equivalent water depth the maximum sws over the entire sierra was determined when the sierra wide average swe reaches the peak value in other words the doy of maximum sws is the same as the doy of maximum sierra wide average swe additionally to reveal the difference in maximum annual snow water availability at a pixel scale among datasets we compared the spatial distribution of 14 year average pixel wise peak swe and its changes as a function of elevation where the pixel wise peak swe is defined as the maximum swe estimates over the entire water year from october 1 to september 30 of the following year margulis et al 2016 4 results 4 1 evaluation of model performance 4 1 1 sierra wide cross validation with snow pillow observations lrm fsca exhibited notable improvements compared with lrm baseline in the snow pillow cross validation indicated by the median mean and standard deviation of all statistical metrics table 2 specifically lrm fsca explained 59 8 of the variance in snow pillow swe 6 higher than that for lrm baseline 53 9 table 2 the rmse for lrm fsca was 17 4 8 7 cm with an average reduction of 1 4 cm compared with the lrm baseline 18 8 9 2 cm lrm fsca also had a lower rmae 51 3 160 0 and basin wide pbias 15 2 155 0 than lrm baseline 56 0 204 0 and 17 2 200 0 respectively both lrm fsca and lrm baseline had high variation in rmae and pbias values but low variation in r2 and rmse values table 2 this can be explained by the high relative errors of a few simulations in very low swe period when a small absolute difference could result in a great relative error the improvement in lrm fsca s performance was more significant during the primary snow accumulation periods i e january march than during the snowmelt seasons fig 4 the seasonal variability of model accuracy calculated in each month for lrm fsca and lrm baseline exhibited similar patterns lrm fsca exhibited much better performance than lrm baseline in five of the six months we modeled including january through may during the period of the largest volumes of melt for the swe estimates in june when snow remained primarily in high elevation regions both lrm fsca and lrm baseline showed similar low accuracy this can be explained by the low representativeness of the training samples in june given that most stations are located at middle to low elevations and reported zero swe the r2 for both lrms exhibited little seasonal variability compared with the other three metrics indicating that the spatial variability of the snow pillow observations was consistently captured by the model training over time rmse generally increased throughout the snow season increases in rmse from january to april were consistent with the increased snow accumulation during that period however the continued increase in rmse in may and june suggested a decreasing performance of the lrms starting in may as snow accumulation was no longer high for this period this general trend was also supported by the distribution of rmae and basin wide pbias fig 4c and d both of which indicated much better performance of lrms in january through april than that in may and june 4 1 2 sierra wide validation with snow course measurements the swe values of the two lrm models were relatively well aligned with snow course swe values fig 5a and b whereas snodas and nwm swe values showed greater deviation from the 1 1 line fig 5c and d adding the dmfsca to the lrm largely reduced the uncertainty of swe estimates over the snow course sites lrm fsca outperformed the lrm baseline with a 7 0 06 increase in r2 and 14 2 5 cm 20 4 3 and 93 1 3 reductions in rmse rmae and pbias respectively the overall pbias for lrm fsca and lrm baseline were slightly positive with the highest observed swe values underestimated by both lrms see swe values greater than 100 cm generally located below the 1 1 line in fig 5a and b the overall performance of lrm fsca was notably better than snodas and nwm swe showing both 29 6 3 cm and 6 4 cm respectively lower rmse 28 6 9 and 35 9 4 lower rmae and 96 2 3 and 99 15 8 lower absolute pbias respectively snodas had slightly higher accuracy than nwm swe with 9 2 5 and 85 13 5 lower rmae and absolute pbias values respectively and similar rmse values while the r2 for snodas 0 73 was slightly lower than that for nwm swe 0 75 because elevation is the main topographic control on swe distribution we also examined the relationship between elevation and swe errors for each datasets fig 5 the results showed that both lrms underestimated swe for the middle elevation snow course sites but overestimated swe for relatively high and low elevations red and blue dots above 1 1 line in fig 5a and b these swe error patterns were possibly caused by a nonlinear relationship between swe and elevation e g a curve alike an upside down u shape no particular pattern was observed for snodas nwm swe had a clear underestimation for low and middle elevations but overestimation for relatively high elevations around 3000 m while the swe estimation errors for each product had high variability all datasets tended to overestimate swe for very low swe values but underestimated swe for moderate to high swe values red lines in fig 5 4 1 3 basin scale validation with aso swe data the two lrms also performed better than snodas and nwm swe when compared with the aso data in the upper trb during the overlapping period from wys 2013 2017 with 19 aso flights table 3 and fig 6 lrm fsca and lrm baseline explained similar proportions of variance in aso swe with the same mean r2 of 0 85 which was at least 31 0 20 higher on average than the other two operational swe datasets the variance of aso swe explained by lrm fca lrm baseline snodas and nwm swe were 85 5 85 5 65 6 and 32 18 respectively table 3 lrm fsca lrm baseline and snodas illustrated more robust swe estimates than nwm swe given the relatively lower standard deviation of r2 table 3 the improvement of lrm fsca relative to the lrm baseline was less evident over the trb because the evaluation metrics showed cloase values table 3 lrm fsca had lower rmse than lrm baseline for 13 out of 19 days fig 6b but the median rmse for lrm fsca 9 8 cm was 26 2 0 cm higher than that for lrm baseline 7 8 cm for the period one table 3 the median rmse for lrm fsca 13 3 cm was 4 0 5 cm less than that for lrm baseline 13 8 cm in the period two further suggesting that lrm fsca and lrm baseline had similar performance over the trb during this validation period in the daily model cross validation with snow pillow swe observations we found that the improvement in lrm fsca s performance was more pronounced during snow accumulation periods than during the snowmelt seasons and lrm fsca only showed a little better performance than lrm baseline in the late season given that aso generally flies near or after peak swe date i e around april 1 and mostly in the late snowmelt season it was not surprising to see that lrm fsca and lrm baseline showed similar accuracy when validated with aso swe data the rmae for lrm fca lrm baseline snodas and nwm swe were 23 6 12 5 24 8 13 6 35 1 20 7 and 45 2 13 8 respectively lrm baseline had the smallest pbias 4 1 29 7 compared with lrm fsca 5 5 27 7 snodas 35 4 41 9 and nwm swe 28 8 15 5 although nwm swe had a large pbias the variability of its pbias was the smallest 15 5 indicating it consistently underestimated swe which was also shown in figure 6d with negative pbias values on 18 out of 19 dates to visualize spatial differences across swe datasets not apparent by summary statistics in fig 6 or table 3 we selected five days near peak swe from wys 2013 through 2017 to show the spatial distribution of swe errors on one day in each wy as with the summary statistics compared with the aso swe on a pixel by pixel basis the magnitudes of swe errors for lrm fsca and lrm baseline were much smaller than that for snodas and nwm swe fig 7 both lrm fsca and lrm baseline overestimate swe in wys 2014 and 2015 the extreme drought years with a mixture of overestimation and underestimation in the normal and wet years of wys 2013 2016 and 2017 additionally the spatial distribution of swe errors for the two lrms revealed similar patterns the lrms tended to underestimate swe in the northern high alpine regions of the trb and overestimate swe in the western low elevation valley regions for the densely forested regions mostly located in the southeastern of the trb the lrms tended to overestimate swe for all comparison years both the magnitude and the spatial pattern of swe residuals for lrm fsca and lrm baseline were identical indicating that on average the two lrms had similar accuracy in the upper trb the spatial distribution of snodas errors exhibited greater variability and magnitude than the two lrms with a relatively large overestimation of swe for most regions in wys 2013 2014 2015 and 2017 in wy 2016 snodas overestimated swe for the low elevation forested regions but underestimated swe for high elevation alpine regions exhibiting relatively identical patterns compared with the two lrms the swe errors for nwm swe revealed rather similar spatial patterns under diverse snow conditions with overestimation in some low elevation valleys and forests and underestimation at the medium to higher elevations overall nwm swe underestimated swe for most regions across the trb 4 2 spatial and temporal variability of swe 4 2 1 inter and intra annual variability of snow water storage to reveal the variability of snow water storage sws across the sierra nevada as well as the sws differences among the four swe datasets we also compared the daily sws through their 14 year overlap period wys 2004 2017 including the 2012 2016 california drought period with extremely low sws fig 8 gray shading the two lrms generally had higher sws than snodas and nwm swe particularly for the period close to the peak sws date only subtle differences in sws were observed among datasets in the early snow accumulation and late snowmelt seasons looking more closely at the differences of maximum snow accumulation the annual maximum sws exhibited high interannual variability across all models fig 9a and b the average maximum sws for the driest year 2015 and wettest year 2011 derived from all the four swe datasets were 3 4 0 6 gigaton gt i e 4 0 gt for lrm baseline 3 7 gt for lrm fsca 3 2 gt for snodas and 2 7 gt for nwm and 38 6 7 7 gt i e 47 1 gt for lrm baseline 42 5 gt for lrm fsca 34 6 gt for snodas and 30 0 gt for nwm respectively with a 35 2 gt sws difference on average between these two years the year to year changes of the maximum sws for the four swe datasets followed a similar pattern but the magnitudes varied lrm baseline consistently estimated the highest sws followed by lrm fsca snodas and nwm swe with the median maximum sws of 25 0 gt 23 2 gt 16 0 gt and 13 8 gt respectively the maximum sws difference i e absolute value among the datasets in any given year ranged from a low of 0 1 gt in 2012 between lrm fsca and snodas to a maximum of 17 1 gt in 2011 between lrm baseline and nwm swe fig 8 for each pair of datasets the 14 year average sws difference was the smallest between lrm fsca and lrm baseline 1 2 1 2 gt ranging from 0 2 gt to 4 6 gt and was largest between lrm baseline and nwm swe 9 8 5 1 gt ranging from 1 3 gt to 17 1 gt the date of maximum sws exhibited a very high inter annual variability for all the four swe datasets in the comparison period fig 9c and d lrm fsca and nwm swe generally peaked earlier over the entire sierra followed by snodas and lrm baseline with the median peaked dates of doy of 70 70 73 and 74 i e equivalent to march 11 0 3 and 4 days in a common year respectively the dates of maximum sws were close in 11 out of 14 years among four datasets with the exceptions of wys 2010 2013 and 2015 in wy 2010 a moderate swe year nwm swe peaked on march 14 32 days earlier than snodas on april 15 while lrm fsca and lrm baseline estimated peak sws on april 8 and april 7 respectively notably in wy 2013 an extremely dry year both lrm fsca and nwm swe peaked in january while lrm baseline and snodas peaked in march for dry wy 2015 only snodas peaked in march while the other three datasets peaked in december or january although the peak sws dates varied significantly in these two dry years the sws values between january to march did not change appreciably over time for all the four datasets in wy 2015 fig 8 suggesting that the significant differences in the peak sws date estimated from different datasets in dry years may only have a subtle influence on water volume forecasts 4 2 2 spatial distribution of pixel wise peak swe lrm fsca and lrm baseline generally had a similar spatial pattern of pixel wise peak swe with only slightly lower swe estimated by lrm fsca in relatively low elevations 2500 m fig 10 and on the eastern slopes of the sierra fig 11 because the dmfsca well represented the difference between low elevations and eastern sierra with relatively ephemeral snowpacks versus high elevations with consistent snow covers lrm fsca likely decreased swe errors for low elevations and eastern sierra where lrm baseline tended to overestimate swe the swe patterns for snodas and nwm swe were considerably different relative to the two lrms with much lower peak swe at high elevations 3500 m and low elevations 2200 m fig 10 relative to the two lrms snodas exhibited notably greater swe at around 2400 3300 m elevations interestingly this relationship was reversed for the highest elevations above 3400 m where snodas swe values were significantly lower than the two lrms while the average pixel wise peak swe over the middle to high elevations exhibited distinct differences the influence of these differences on the range wide sws was relatively modest given the significantly smaller alpine area compared with the area of the low elevations 2500 m in the sierra red dots in fig 10 this also explained the high sws difference among datasets near peak snow accumulation period when low elevation swe was relatively high fig 8 a small difference in low elevation swe can result in relatively large differences in sws given the large low elevation land area additionally both snodas and nwm swe estimated much lower pixel wise peak swe than the lrms for the eastern slopes of the sierra and the low elevations of the western slopes of the sierra fig 11 nwm swe exhibited much lower swe in majority regions compared with the other three datasets fig 11 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with existing swe estimation methods in this study we combine ground observations with remotely sensed data in a linear regression model lrm for real time swe estimation in the sierra nevada caliofornia a key strength of the lrm is its simplicity compared with physically based snow models e g swe reconstruction models swe data assimilation and snodas we present lrm fsca as a marked improvement on the lrm baseline the basis of which is established in schneider and molotch 2016 we include the new variable dmfsca as an additional explanatory variable in the lrm given that dmfsca describes the variability of snow cover over time that corresponds with the swe accumulation and ablation processes the results presented here indicate that including the satellite observed dmfsca as one additional predictor variable for the lrm has improved swe estimation accuracy this suggests that dmfsca contains important information for real time swe modeling additionally we show the performance of lrm fsca and lrm baseline are considerably better than the operational swe datasets i e snodas and nwm swe hence the real time lrm swe estimates have potentially crucial implications for practical water resource management to give further context of the improved lrm fsca relative to other promising swe estimation models represented in the literture we compare our results with a few recently published studies in the text below schneider and molotch 2016 estimated swe distribution using a similar method as lrm baseline they reported a mean r2 value of 0 33 in snow pillow cross validation which is 44 0 26 lower than the 0 59 reported here for lrm fsca suggesting lrm fsca had a much improved performance this is partly due to the higher density of the training samples i e 440 km2 per snow pillow swe observation for this study versus 700 km2 for schneider and molotch 2016 and the higher accuracy of the historical swe reanalysis data used in the sierra nevada than those used in the rocky mountains by schneider and molotch 2016 yang et al 2018 the statistical model glmnet used in this study also outperforms the original glm model used by schneider and molotch 2016 in an environment with highly correlated independent variables given that glmnet can adaptively choose a subset of the independent variables for a specific modeling date using the penalized maximum likelihood additionally the differences in the patterns of winter snowfall precipitation between the maritime sierra nevada and the continental rocky mountains may also cause the differences in the model performance the winter snowfall over the sierra nevada is strongly influenced by atmospheric rivers which often result in relatively uniform accumulation patterns across the sierra nevada ralph et al 2004 while the snowfall over the larger rocky mountain domain studied by schneider and molotch 2016 is more complex spatially and is more significantly influenced by land atmosphere interactions other than orographic processes rasmussen et al 2011 zheng et al 2018 applied machine learning techniques to estimate swe at the same 500 m resolution using observations from a dense wireless snow depth sensor network and a physically based swe dataset i e reconstructed swe from guan et al 2013 to get swe at snow depth sensor locations they applied the mean ratio of the co located snow pillows and snow depth sensors in the basin for average snow density even though the snow density shows much less spatial variability than snow depth painter et al 2016 sturm et al 2010 using basin average snow density may induce uncertainties for the final swe estimation compared with our large scale sierra wide swe estimation their swe modeling is more explicit with a denser snow depth network i e 50 km2 per sensor over specific watersheds inluding american basin and merced tuolumne basin compared with our 440 km2 per site across the sierra they also evaluated their swe estimates against the aso swe data in the upper trb specifically the average rmse for their swe estimation during the overlap period i e april 1 7 and 16 2016 was 15 cm which is almost the same as we estimated for the lrm fsca 14 cm on the same dates they also had an average r2 value of 0 84 which is slightly lower than the reported 0 88 for lrm fsca on the same dates in our study although modeling swe over the entire sierra nevada faces greater challenges given the significantly larger modeling domain and lower density of sampling sites our swe model has shown a similar performance compared with zheng et al 2018 s swe model lrm fsca also compared favorably well with swe reconstruction models developed in the sierra nevada guan et al 2013 bair et al 2016 2018 guan et al 2013 reported an rmse of 20 5 cm and 25 4 cm for their reconstructed swe and snodas respectively when evaluated with 20 snow surveys in the sierra nevada showing a 19 4 9 cm lower rmse for their swe reconstruction model than that for snodas in this study lrm fsca reported a 29 6 3 cm and 34 5 0 cm lower rmse than snodas when compared with snow course swe observations and aso swe respectively although the evaluation datasets used by guan et al 2013 and this study are different the relative improvements compared with snodas indicate that our lrm fsca is very likely to have a better performance than guan et al 2013 s swe reconstruction model bair et al 2016 reported an average of 26 0 rmae for their reconstructed swe data when evaluated by aso swe data over wys 2013 to 2015 while lrm fsca reported an average rmae of 24 4 for the same period although our lrm fsca has a small negative bias 1 9 while the swe estimation of bair et al 2016 had 0 bias the developed lrm fsca suggests a comparable accuracy with bair et al 2016 s reconstruction model 5 2 model limitations one limitation of the developed swe modeling framework is that it heavily relies on ground swe observations whereas some other models can be used in regions without ground observations guan et al 2013 margulis et al 2016 rittger et al 2016 bair et al 2018 as a statistically based model the number and the distribution of the snow pillow stations have significant impacts on model performance hence the lrm shows relatively better performance from january through april when more stations are covered by snow providing a better representation of the overall swe patterns across the sierra the model accuracy decreases in may and june as the number of snow pillows with zero swe values increases in addition to the lower representativeness of snow pillow swe observations in the late snowmelt season compared with those in the early snow season the discrepancy due to incompatible spatial support of snow pillow swe versus grid based swe estimates is another reason for the lower accuracy of the lrms in the late snow season although we used fsca to scale the point snow pillow swe observations to grid cell in the model notwithstanding the absolute error of the lrm is relatively low given that only a small region is covered by snow in the late snowmelt season fig 10 the influence of this deterioration in model performance during the late snow season has little impact on the estimation of the total snow water storage or snow water availability given that both swe and snow covered regions i e high elevation regions are relatively low in the late snow season furthermore the spatial representativeness of the swe training samples may have an impact on the lrm s accuracy for example snow pillow stations are typically located in small forest clearings and relatively flat locations meromy et al 2013 there are less snow pillows on the eastern side of the sierra nevada and the elevation distribution of the snow pillow fig 3 differs significantly from the elevation distribution of the modeling domain across the sierra fig 10 regions with less snow pillow coverage e g high elevations in fig 5 are very likely to see a relatively lower accuracy in lrm swe estimates the uncertainties in the historical swe reanalysis data and the fsca data are not considered in this study the historical swe reanalysis provides an analogous swe pattern from a historical date for the target simulation date table 1 the basis for the value in using the historical swe reanalysis is that swe patterns on the simulation date often show similarity to the swe from analog dates in the past hence we rely on this analog swe pattern to improve the statistically based swe estimation models schneider and molotch 2016 the accuracy of the historical swe data has an important impact on the performance of the lrm given that the historical analog swe distribution is the most informative predictor variable used in the lrm table 1 there are inherent uncertainties in choosing the best historical swe reanalysis for the lrm herein we used snow pillow swe observations on the target modeling date versus the historical date to inform the selection of the historical swe date used in the lrm given the point based nature of these snow pillow swe observations these data cannot fully capture the heterogeneity of the swe distributions on the historical and target dates however for the historical swe data selection the snow pillow swe observation is the only dataset we can rely on as the truth the methods applied here are generally tranferable to other regions in which high quality historical swe data are available for example the snsr swe estimation model is generally applicable to different mountain locations across the world but at the time of this writing the model has only been implemented in selected areas hence high quality historical swe data may not be available in other regions e g the upper colorado river basin and this may limit potential applications of the lrm based real time swe estimation method in this context other datasets with reasonably high accuracy swe estimations such as swe recontructions from guan et al 2013 rittger et al 2016 and bair et al 2018 showing lower accuracy than snsr but higher accuracy than statistically based swe regressions schneider and molotch 2016 yang et al 2018 could also be fed into the lrm future work is needed to investigate the influence of errors in different historical swe data on the lrm swe estimation accuracy in this study fsca data were used to determine snow extent to scale the snow pillow and snow coure swe observations to better represent swe over a 500 m modeling grid cell and to calculate dmfsca for the lrm fsca simulations the daily gap filled fsca from stc modscag we used in this study is one of the most advanced products although the uncertainty of this dataset is not negligible given the technical challenges in addressing issues like cloud cover contamination canopy cover and the effect of wide view angles of modis imagery particularly over forested regions dozier et al 2008 bair et al 2019 rittger et al 2020 to reduce the impacts of uncertainties in the historical swe data and fsca data we scaled the historical swe data and dmfsca to mean 0 and standard deviation 1 so that only the patterns were ingested into the lrms thus the absolute values of the historical swe data were not relevant to the lrm simulation on the target date in other words the performance of lrm will only be impacted by the relative swe errors of the historical swe data and the dmfsca as quantifying the uncertainties in fsca data is beyond the scope of this study we do not discuss the impacts of the uncertainties in the fsca scale snow pillow swe measurements i e the model training samples on the model performance 6 conclusion this study offers evidence that satellite derived dmfsca contains significant information for statistically based swe estimation in real time comparing two lrms lrm fsca has a better overall performance in swe estimation than lrm baseline both lrms show high accuracy in the months january february and march a slightly lower accuracy in april and poor performance in may and june when there is less snow adding the dmfsca improves lrm fsca median r2 value from 0 54 to 0 60 and reduces the median pbias from 2 6 to 2 2 when validated by the snow pillow swe observations in cross validation lrm fsca also shows a similar improvement in r2 and pbias from 0 81 to 0 87 and from 1 4 to 0 1 respectively in the snow course validation the improvement of lrm fsca is less evident when validated by the aso swe data in the trb 85 of the aso swe variance is explained by the lrm fsca with the median rmse rmae pbias values of 13 3 cm 18 9 and 9 0 which is

much better than snodas and nwm swe nwm swe shows the lowest accuracy the maximum snow water storage derived from all the four swe datasets reveals a consistently high interannual variability with a

201,effective water resources management in california relies substantially on real time information of snow water equivalent swe at basin scale and mountain ranges given that mountain snowpacks provide the primary water supply for the state however swe estimation based solely on remote sensing modeling or ground observations does not meet contemporary operational requirements in this context this study develops a data fusion framework that combines multi source datasets including satellite observed daily mean fractional snow covered area dmfsca snow pillow swe measurements physiographic data and historical swe patterns into a linear regression model lrm to improve swe estimates in real time we test two lrms a baseline regression model lrm baseline that uses physiographic data and historical swe patterns as independent variables and an fsca informed regression model lrm fsca that includes the dmfsca from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite imagery as an additional independent variable by incorporating the satellite observed dmfsca lrm fsca outperforms lrm baseline with increased median r2 from 0 54 to 0 60 and reduced median pbias of basin average swe from 2 6 to 2 2 in the snow pillow swe cross validation lrm fsca explains 87 of the variance in the snow course swe measurements with 0 1 pbias while lrm baseline explains a lower 81 variance with 1 4 pbias both of which show higher accuracy than swe estimates from the two operational swe datasets the snow data assimilation system snodas 73 and 2 4 respectively and nationtional water model nwm 75 and 15 9 respectively additionally lrm fsca explains 85 of the median variance in the airborne snow observatory swe with 9 2 pbias which is comparable to the lrm baseline 86 and 11 3 respectively and considerably better than snodas 64 and 28 2 respectively and nwm 33 and 30 1 respectively this study shows a substantial model improvement by constraining the geographical and seasonal variation on snow cover via satellite observation and highlights the values of using multi source observations in real time swe estimation the developed swe estimation framework has crucial implications for effective water supply forecasting and management in california where climate extremes e g droughts and floods require particularly skillful monitoring practices keywords snow water equivalent snow covered area real time swe modeling statistical learning sierra nevada snowpack remote sensing 1 introduction seasonal snow covers over 30 of the earth s land surface and provides the water supply for approximately one sixth of the global population dozier 1989 barnett et al 2005 in the western united states meltwater from seasonal snowpack contributes 50 to 80 of annual runoff stewart et al 2004 li et al 2017 snowmelt runoff recharges groundwater aquifers and surface water reservoirs providing a vital water source for urban and agricultural areas barnett et al 2005 mote et al 2005 bales et al 2006 mountain snowpack strongly influences the timing and magnitude of streamflow hamlet et al 2005 lundquist et al 2015 and thus accurate real time information of the spatial variability of mountain snowpack is particularly important for effective water management and water supply forecasting he et al 2016 one traditional method to forecast water supply in california relies on in situ observations of snow water equivalent swe including an automatic snow pillow network providing real time swe measurements and extensive manual snow courses taken at the beginning of each month during snow seasons pagano et al 2004 he et al 2016 however these point scale and transect scale ground observations inadequately capture the spatial heterogeneity of snowpack distribution in mountainous terrain molotch and bales 2005 bales et al 2006 recent studies indicate that spatial patterns of snow accumulation and melt are shifting due to climate change further motivating improved understanding of the processes controlling streamflow generation nijssen et al 2001 barnett et al 2005 godsey et al 2014 mote et al 2018 therefore to better support water management decision making it is imperative to have accurate real time spatially distributed swe information many efforts have been made to estimate spatially distributed swe in near real time i e with a one or two day processing lag time yet all approaches have limitations when applied over large scale mountainous regions dozier et al 2016 for the in situ swe observations the natural resource conservation service nrcs has operated the snow telemetry snotel network since the mid 1960s serreze et al 1999 there are more than 800 snotel sites located in the mountainous regions across the western united states providing swe measurements automatically every 15 minutes additionally the california legislature estabilished the california cooperative snow surveys ccss program in 1929 with alliances in more than 50 state federal and private agencies roos 2004 they collect and analyze snow data from snow courses and now there are more than 200 snow courses located throughout the sierra nevada these ground based swe measurements have been interpolated into spatially distributed swe based on their relationships with predictor variables e g elevation aspect slope solar radiation wind etc using spatial interpolation or regression methods carroll et al 1999 fassnacht et al 2003 fassnacht et al 2012 molotch et al 2005 however the accuracy of these statistcical methods is largly hindered by the high heterogeneity of swe distribution over mountainous terrian the observation desnity and the representativeiness of the predict variables in addition to the interpolation or regression of in situ swe observations remotely sensed passive microwave pm data have provided global swe observations over the past three decades takala et al 2017 yet applications of pm swe data products are limited by many factors such as the mixed pixel problem at coarse spatial resolutions e g 25 km the saturation of the pm signal over deep snow the many to one relationships between the pm signal snow grain size and swe and the impacts of forest cover durand and margulis 2007 vander jagt et al 2013 while fusing ground based snow depth observations could increase the spatial resolution of pm swe data products e g 5 km takala et al 2017 it remains challenging to overcome the aforementioned issues and thus pm based swe data products often exclude mountainous regions snow models hydrological models and land surface models are also available for real time swe estimation however these models often show poor performance in swe estimation partly because of the high uncertainty of precipitation model forcing which is particularly problematic in mountainous regions milly and dunne 2002 adam et al 2006 other operational models like the snow data assimilation system snodas from the noaa national weather service s national operational hydrologic remote sensing center nohrsc are usually available in near real time carroll et al 2001 barrett 2003 clow et al 2012 evaluated snodas with ground snow survey data in the colorado rocky mountains and reported that snodas performed well in forested areas with 77 of the variance in swe explained but exhibited high uncertainties over alpine regions in which only 30 of the variance in swe was explained because of high wind redistribution despite the listed challenges recent progress has been made in real time swe estimation by combining historical swe estimates developed via reanalysis with statistical models schneider and molotch 2016 bair et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 in this context reanalyses of swe distribution using swe reconstruction models and data assimilation techniques have been promising for swe modeling over large scale mountainous regions durand et al 2008 molotch 2009 guan et al 2013 girotto et al 2014 margulis et al 2016 rittger et al 2016 bair et al 2016 2018 these methods outperforms pm and snodas by the exploitation of satellite based observations of snow cover depletion and or snow albedo bair et al 2019 notwithstanding these methods cannot be used for real time swe estimation given the retrospective calculation process therefore to improve real time swe estimation one effort has coupled the historical swe from reconstruction models as an independent predictor for statistically based swe estimation schneider and molotch 2016 bair et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 because snow distribution is often controlled by the interactions between meteorology and local constant topographic characteristics snow patterns exhibit considerable consistency from year to year deems et al 2008 mendoza et al 2020 pflug and lundquist 2020 in other words the historical swe data usually contains relevant information regarding the swe patterns of interest e g real time swe by incorporating this relevant pattern from the historical reconstructed swe data real time swe estimation has been substantially improved in some large mountain ranges such as upper colorado river basin ucrb schneider and molotch 2016 and a few basins in california sierra nevada zheng et al 2018 to evaluate modeled swe accuracy early studies have used many independent validation datasets including ground based onservations and the airborne snow observatory aso swe products the ground based swe observations particularly snow pillow and snow course data represent the most accurate swe information at point scale i e snow pillow and transect scale i e snow course and have thus been used as validation datasets in many previous research erickson et al 2005 franz et al 2008 raleigh and lundquist 2012 margulis et al 2015 wrzesien et al 2019 however a limitation of these datasets is that they cannot fully capture the spatial variability of swe over an entire watershed clark et al 2011 moreover these sites are often located at easily accessible locations further limiting their representativeness for evaluating spatially complex swe estimates another commonly used validation dataset is based on the interpolation of intensive snow surveys molotch et al 2005 durand and margulis 2007 guan et al 2013 meromy et al 2013 schneider and molotch 2016 yet the high logistical cost and feasibility of these surveys prevent its operational applications over larger areas the nasa aso mission and now aso inc which was created to transfer the technology for implementation around the globe provides swe estimates with unprecedented accuracy from year to year in several selected basins in the california sierra nevada and elsewhere in the western united states painter et al 2016 the aso aircraft carries a light detection and ranging lidar sensor and a visible through near infrared imaging spectrometer to measure snow on and snow off surface heights that are differenced to derive estimates of snow depth by leveraging snow density calculated by a physically based snow model isnobal marks et al 1999 constrained by in situ measurements aso has derived very accurate swe estimates at a high spatial resolution 50 m painter et al 2016 the detailed description of aso swe product and its uncertainty analysis is well documented in painter et al 2016 while the evaluation methods might be different the magnitude of aso swe uncertainty is far less than that of the swe errors from aforementioned swe estimation studies like swe interpolation and or regression fassnacht et al 2003 schneider and molotch 2016 reconstruction guan et al 2013 rittger et al 2016 and data assimilation margulis et al 2016 thus aso swe is increasingly used as ground truth information to evaluate other swe data products at large basin scales bair et al 2016 yang et al 2018 oaida et al 2019 aso swe outperforms the traditional small scale ground based swe observations by providing spatially complete swe estimates over large watersheds at a high spatial resolution painter et al 2016 bormann et al 2018 yet one limitation of using aso swe product in validation is that it only has a relatively short perioed 2013 present compared to the snow pillow mid 1960s and snow survey mid 1930s datasets additionally airborne campaigns are mostly conducted during the snow ablation period near and after peak swe and for only a few selected watersheds limiting our understanding of snow accumulation and swe in time and space thus using aso data alone cannot comprehensively evaluate the swe accuracy in the sierra nevada for watersheds and periods when the aso data are not available the objectives of this study are to improve real time swe estimation over all basins in the california sierra nevada and to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the swe estimates relative to other real time swe products currently produced operationally built on previous work we developed a statistically based data fusion framework to estimate swe in real time which combines ground snow pillow swe measurements physiographic data satellite observed daily mean fractional snow covered area dmfsca physically based historical swe patterns with a linear regression model lrm previous studies have used remotely sensed fsca data to inform hydrological models in many applications where the swe is often inferred from snow cover depletion curves liston 1999 gómez landesa and rango 2002 andreadis and lettenmaier 2006 clark et al 2006 niu and yang 2007 however fsca is not directly related to swe and fsca can remain constant as swe changes from day to day rendering fsca on a single day less useful in predicting swe therefore we introduce a new variable dmfsca which is calculated as the mean of time series fsca from the beginning of each water year to the date of simulation as a predictor variable on swe estimation dmfsca is sensitive to the magnitude of snow accumulation i e increases dmfsca and ablation processes i e decreased dmfsca as it describes the historical temporal variability of snow cover for example when pixels are completely covered by snow i e fsca equal 100 for a modeling day the dmfsca value in a pixel with seasonal snowpack e g high elevations with continuous snow accumulation would be greater than in a pixel with an ephemeral snowpack i e low elevations with frequent snowmelt which are more likely to correspond with the swe distribution than the fsca values for these two pixels both equal 100 using dmfsca also has a low pass filtering effect that reduces the influences of the noise in fsca data for swe modeling although dmfsca does not provide direct swe information it is potentially useful as an explanatory variable in a statistical regression to explain the spatial distribution of swe to examine the influence of satellite derived dmfsca for swe estimation we compared two lrms in this study a baseline regression model lrm baseline in which the dependent variables included physiographic variables and historical swe patterns from an swe reanalysis dataset margulis et al 2016 and an fsca informed swe regression model lrm fsca in which the dmfsca derived from modis satellite imagery rittger et al 2020 was included as an additional independent variable two other swe datasets were also included in comparison to provide a baseline of swe accuracy in the operational applications swe estimates from snodas carroll et al 2001 barrett 2003 and from the national water model hereafter nwm swe retrospective runs version 1 2 operated by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration gochis et al 2018 we present the inter model differences in terms of their accuracy interannual variability and spatial patterns section 2 describes the study area and section 3 describes the datasets the lrm framework and the evaluation methods the results are presented in section 4 with the discussion and conclusion given in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 study area the study area covers 20 major snow dominated watersheds hydrological unite code 8 huc8 in the sierra nevada california with a total area of 49 409 km2 fig 1 given ephemeral snowpacks variations below 1500 m elevation in the sierra nevada bales et al 2006 guan et al 2013 margulis et al 2016 rittger et al 2016 the modeling domain is cutoff to areas above 1500 m of which the average elevation is 2270 m ranging from 1500 m to 4410 m the sierra nevada has a mediterranean climate with distinct dry summers and wet winters the average annual temperature is approximately 10 c and the total annual precipitation is approximately 830 mm estimated from parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism 30 year normals daly et al 1994 80 of the annual precipitation occurs in the cold months from october to may mainly in the form of snow swain et al 2016 influenced by the prevailing west winds the west facing windward slopes of the sierra nevada capture the majority of the moisture from the pacific ocean generating a large amount of orographic precipitation while the eastern leeward slopes have more arid climate conditions based on national land cover database 2011 nlcd2011 evergreen needle leaf forest 38 and shrub lands 36 are the two major land cover types in the sierra nevada with most of the forest cover on the western slopes of the sierra where the annual precipitation and temperature are both relatively high trujillo et al 2012 hansen et al 2013 the aso mission details on https www jpl nasa gov missions airborne snow observatory aso began snow survey flights of the upper tuolumne river basin trb fig 1 in 2013 and routinely provides swe data at a 50 m resolution during the snowmelt seasons the upper trb is located on the west side of the sierra nevada with a total area of 1200 km2 the average elevation of the upper trb is about 2680 m with a wide elevation range from 1500 m to 3970 m a range similar to the entire sierra nevada about 40 of the trb is above tree line which is proportionally much more alpine land area than the sierra nevada study area on the whole evergreen needle leaf forest 37 and shrublands 48 are the two dominant land cover types in the upper trb hansen et al 2013 the average annual temperature and total precipitation are about 4 c and 1260 mm respectively based on prism 30 year normals daly et al 1994 snowmelt runoff from the trb drains into the hetch hetchy reservoir providing the primary water resource to the city of san francisco and other bay area municipalities 3 methods and datasets the lrm relies on the lasso and elastic net regularized generalized linear model glmnet details on https glmnet stanford edu articles glmnet html to approximate the relationship between the independent variables listed in table 1 and the dependent variable i e swe observations from ground snow pillow stations fig 2 illustrates the schematic of the lrm with a detailed description in sections 3 1 and 3 2 to examine the impacts of satellite observed dmfsca on model performance we run two lrms at a daily time step at 500 m spatial resolution i e the same resolution as used by schneider and molotch 2016 during the period when there is significant snow on the ground i e from january to june over the water year wy october 1 september 30 2001 through 2019 across the modeling domain fig 1 hereafter termed lrm baseline and lrm fsca both simulations were evaluated through three methods including 1 cross validation at snow pillow stations 2 comparison against snow course measurements across the sierra and 3 comparison against the spatially distributed aso swe data in the upper trb the performance of snodas and the nwm swe were also included in the latter two evaluations i e against snow course swe and aso swe to compare the performance of these complementary models relative to those developed herein given that snow pillow swe observations were used in some of the presented models i e lrms and snodas snow pillow swe observations were not used for model comparison as they are not independent from model input data in these circumstances 3 1 data sources 3 1 1 dependent variable the swe training samples for the lrm were acquired from 113 snow pillow stations across the study area fig 1 the snow pillow stations over 1500 m span the elevation range from 1570 m to 3475 m with more sites located in the mid elevations than lower and higher elevations fig 3 the average elevation of snow pillow stations is about 2500 m and the average density is about 440 km2 per site while snow pillow stations may be inadequate to capture the high spatial variability of swe across the sierra they are denser than the station networks in most mountainous regions globally and thus the sierra nevada is a relatively ideal region for statistically based swe modeling all snow pillow data were downloaded from the california data exchange center https cdec water ca gov and quality controlled because using the point scale snow pillow swe observations may not fully represent the average swe estimates over the 500 m grid cell molotch et al 2005 meromy et al 2013 we used fsca data to scale the point swe observations to improve their representativeness at the 500 m grid scale schneider and molotch 2016 3 1 2 independent variables table 1 lists all the independent variables used in the two lrms including the 18 static physiographic variables and the dynamic historical swe reanalysis and dmfsca earlier studies of bair et al 2018 fassnacht et al 2003 schneider and molotch 2016 suggested that physiographic variables have significnat impacts on swe distrubution and thus we selected the listed physiographic variables table 1 for swe modeling all physiographic variables were derived from the shuttle radar topography mission 1 arc second global digital elevation model srtm dem which was downloaded from https earthexplorer usgs gov at about 30 m spatial resolution and then resampled to 500 m spatial resolution using bilinear interpolation method the extent of swe was determined by a gap filled daily fsca dataset which was derived from the modis snow covered area and grain size modscag painter et al 2009 at a 463 m spatial resolution modscag shows better performance than the standard nasa snow cover product mod10a1 hall et al 2002 when compared to fsca from landsat 5 and landsat 7 during accumulation and melt rittger et al 2013 recent work has shown that modscag has a bias of only 0 5 when compared to fsca from landsat 8 rittger et al 2021 the modscag fsca was further refined to account for off nadir viewing dozier et al 2008 improved cloud detection and canopy adjustment rittger et al 2020 and interpolated using a smoothing spline method dozier et al 2008 creating spatially and temporally complete stc modscag fsca hereby referred to as stc modscag data from wy 2021 is publicly available with a time lag of about two days and the historical dataset from 2001 to 2020 is available on request to early adopters https nsidc org snow today data request in addition to swe reconstruction efforts previously noted the fsca data has been used for evaluating climate models wrzesien et al 2015 minder et al 2016 and for validating regional scale models to better understand the sources of and deposition of dust and carbon sarangi et al 2019 2020 we first resampled the stc modscag fsca data from sinusoidal projection to the universal transverse mercator utm zone 11 n with the 1983 north american datum nad i e the original projection of the aso swe data at 500 m resolution using the bilinear interpolation method the resampled fsca data were then used to scale snow pillow swe observations as previously noted so that the point scale swe observations are more representative of the 500 m grid cell mean swe additionally the independent variable dmfsca was calculated based on daily stc modscag fsca both stc modscag fsca and dmfsca were represented as a percentage 0 100 value finally we used the binary snow extent derived from this real time stc modscag fsca dataset to determine the snow covered areas for the final modeled swe estimates in which the snow free pixel was determined when the fsca value equals 0 the sierra nevada swe reanalysis snsr daily at about 100 m resolution from 1985 to 2016 data details on https margulis group github io data margulis et al 2015 2016 was used as to provide analog historical swe patterns see table 1 last variable for the lrms in real time swe estimation the snsr relies on a land surface model simplified simple biosphere model version 3 xue et al 2003 coupled with a snow depletion curve model lsm sdc liston 2004 to derive the prior swe and fsca estimates in which the radiative and meteorological forcings are obtained from downscaled nldas 2 xia et al 2012 the particle batch smoother pbs data assimilation da scheme was then used to account for the uncertainty of the prior swe estimate directly based on the fsca retrieved from landsat i e landsat 5 thematic mapper landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper and landsat 8 operational land imager details in margulis et al 2015 2016 snsr provides the most accurate swe estimates on average across the entire sierra in a comparison with four other large scale swe datasets at various spatial resolutions yang et al 2018 it also has a long historical modeling period i e 32 years relative to other datasets bair et al 2016 guan et al 2013 rittger et al 2016 covering a large range of swe conditions despite the good performance of snsr it is not applicable for real time swe estimation given its requirement of complete seasonal snow cover depletion information observed from satellites for the pbs da process margulis et al 2015 2016 thus we selected the snsr to provide historical swe patterns for the lrm to select the historical snsr that can best represent the spatial patterns of swe on the target simulation date we designed a two step process to compare the snow pillow swe patterns between the target simulation date and historical dates first we identified the historical dates that have similar numbers of non zero swe observations e g the difference is 10 in the study which can reduce the impact of zero values on the linear regression fits in the next step secondly the similarity of swe patterns was quantified by the squared pearson correlation coefficient r2 of the simple linear regression between snow pillow swe on the two dates for each date when the lrm is run the historical swe reanalysis with the highest r2 was used as the best historical swe distribution data this two step process assumes that the similarity in swe patterns at stations is also true across the sierra nevada to replicate how a real time swe estimation would produce we only chose the historical swe on the wys before the current simulation wy even though the snsr is available throughout 1986 2016 partially handicapping our approach by not using all of the historical data all the historical swe data were resampled from the native 100 m spatial resolution to 500 m using bilinear interpolation to match the extent and scale of the resampled stc modscag fsca data to eliminate the influence of magnitude difference all the independent variables i e 18 physiographic variables the dmfsca and the snsr were scaled to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 we used a mask of the maximum water extent in the global surface water gsw dataset pekel et al 2016 to exclude water bodies inside the study area that are often mapped fsca or modeled swe incorrectly the maximum water extent data was derived from landsat imagery that has a higher spatial resolution of 30 m for the 1984 2019 period we resampled this dataset to the 500 m resolution using the nearest neighbor method which shows good performance in resampling categorical data 3 2 statistical model for swe estimation the glmnet used in lrm outperformes the generalized linear model glm originally employed by schneider and molotch 2016 by optimally handling linearly related independent variables e g the physiographic variables used by the lrm to address multicollinearity among independent variables the glmnet uses an elastic net approach to combine two regularization approaches 1 shrinking the coefficients of correlated predictors to zero while keeping all independent variables i e ridge regression and 2 selecting one independent variable and discarding the others i e lasso regression resulting in a more stable and accurate model the optimal hyperparameter was determined by a k fold i e 10 folds cross validation where the lowest mean absolute error among approximately one hundred model simulationswas chosen in the final model details in friedman et al 2010 simon et al 2011 2013 tibshirani et al 2012 following schneider and molotch 2016 the gaussian distribution with the identity link function was used to transform the dependent variable in the glmnet given the requirement of the gaussian distribution of swe observations for the statistical lrm training we only ran the model on the days with more than 40 snow pillow stations i e about 35 of the total stations reporting non zero swe values we used 40 as an empirical threshold to stop running the lrm to ensure the representativeness of model training samples 3 3 two operational swe datasets snodas provides daily swe estimates at 0600 coordinated universal time utc in near real time for the contiguous united states at a 1000 m spatial resolution since wy 2004 data are available at https nsidc org data g02158 barrett 2003 snodas is a physically based snow modeling and data assimilation system which ingests a variety of outputs from physically based models meteorological data remote sensing data and snotel observations including snow depth and swe carroll et al 2006 clow et al 2012 the national water model nwm is an extension of the weather research and forecasting hydrological model wrf hydro coupled with the community noah land surface model with multiparameterization options noah mp to simulate the land surface processes including swe gochis et al 2018 the nwm swe dataset used in this study is the output of the nwm retrospective version 1 2 data are available at http edc occ data org nwm getdata which is a 25 year retrospective simulation from 1993 to 2017 nwm swe covers a large domain roughly from latitude 19 n to 58 n that includes the continental united states canada and mexico at a spatial resolution of 1000 m to assure data consistency with snodas we used the nwm swe data at 0600 utc in the comparison for consistent data evaluation and inter comparison each snodas and nwm swe grid cell at 1000 m resolution was disaggregated evenly to four 500 m grid cells and then resampled to the nad83 utm zone 11 n using bilinear interpolation method 3 4 model evaluation we used ground swe observations and the aso swe product to provide a comprehensive validation for the four swe models i e lrm baseline lrm fsca snodas and nwm at different scales the ground observations i e snow pillow and snow courses provide the most accurate swe estimates at a point scale or transect scale across the entire sierra while the aso swe data represents the most accurate basin scale swe estimates to the extent of our knowledge because snow pillow swe observation is not an independent evaluation dataset for lrm and snodas we only applied cross validation at snow pillow sites to evaluate lrms performance in modeling swe the snow pillow cross validation was conducted for all 2682 daily simulations i e 141 days per year on average for the 19 year modeling period i e wys 2001 2019 the swe validation was conducted against a total of 6407 snow course station years and 23 aso flights details in the following three sub sections 3 4 1 cross validation using snow pillow swe observations we used the monte carlo cross validation i e repeated random sub sampling validation method dubitzky et al 2007 to evaluate the two lrms performance for each simulation day we randomly identified 10 of the 113 snow pillow observations i e 11 samples for testing with the remaining 90 of observations used for model training next a simple linear regression model was fit between the modeled swe estimates and the testing observation we repeated this process 30 times in balance of computational cost and evaluation efficiency the average values of the following four statistical metrics from all 30 simple linear regression models were used to describe the overall performance of each simulation squared pearson correlation coefficient r2 root mean squared error rmse relative mean absolute error rmae i e mean absolute error divided by the mean of fsca scaled snow pillow observations and percent bias pbias of average swe for modeled estimates against observations the r2 represents the correlation between modeled and observed swe and the rmse represents the variability of the model residuals the rmae represents the relative errors of modeled swe in the context of different swe magnitudes the last metric pbias represents the relative bias of average swe over the entire study domain the typical model performance is described by the distribution of each metric with the combination of the mean median and one standard deviation these four metrics were also used in the subsequent validations using snow course measurements and the aso swe data 3 4 2 validation using snow course swe measurements there are 215 snow course sites located in the study area with an average elevation of 2400 m ranging from 1500 m to 3500 m each snow course consists of approximately 5 15 point scale swe measurements along an established transect using a calibrated federal snow sampler dewalle and rango 2008 these data offer monthly swe measurements near the first day of each month from january to may or june depending on the amount of snow remaining on the ground to ensure the independence of the evaluation data from the training data i e snow pillow swe we removed snow course sites located within a 2 km distance of snow pillows leaving 148 snow course sites for evaluation all the snow course data were downloaded from the california data exchange center http cdec water ca gov we extracted swe estimates from the four swe datasets at snow course sites and compared them to snow course swe measurements the spatial mismatch of the transect to 500 m pixels may cause uncertainties in this evaluation to reduce the impact of this mismatch we scaled snow course swe measurements using fsca data so that the observations can better represent the average swe estimates at the 500 m resolution schneider and molotch 2016 additionally to reduce the impacts from resampling previously described the swe estimates at the eight neighboring grid cells surrounding the target grid cell i e the snow course site located in the middle of the 3 3 grid cell window were also used in the evaluation the swe value with the smallest difference among the nine grid cells was used in the calculation of the statistical metrics bair et al 2016 rittger et al 2016 margulis et al 2016 given the difference in data availability lrms from 2001 to 2019 snodas from 2004 to the present nwm swe from 1993 to 2017 we only compared the evaluation results in their overlap period from wy 2004 to wy 2017 for data consistency only swe estimates available for all datasets at snow course sites were compared there remain 6407 station years in total that contain coincident swe estimates for the four swe datasets the same four statistical metrics i e r2 rmse rmae and pbias were calculated to evaluate swe accuracy at snow course sites 3 4 3 validation using aso swe data considering the overlap period wys 2004 2017 of the four swe datasets and the aso data availability wy 2013 to present we compared the aso swe validation for the four models throughout wys 2013 2017 with a total of 19 days i e 19 aso flights we also included the validation in wy 2018 and wy 2019 for lrm baseline and lrm fsca with 4 additional flights to give a more comprehensive lrm model evaluation given the various spatial projections and resolutions of these datasets we resampled all data into the same projection as the aso swe data see section 3 1 2 and 500 m spatial resolution a 3 3 window see section 3 4 2 was also used in the validation against aso swe the basin wide pbias was calculated directly based on the resampled swe data over the entire trb meaning no neighboring pixels were considered in the pbias calculation 3 5 inter comparison of swe datasets the temporal overlap period of the four swe datasets covers 14 wys from 2004 to 2017 including the region s most recent snow drought period 2012 2016 and the wet years of 2011 and 2017 for each wy we calculated the maximum snow water storage hereafter sws across the sierra and the day of year doy when the sierra wide sws reaches the maximum we introduce sws i e swe multiples by the total area in this comparison because it is a water volume metric that can reflect water availability for the study area directly while swe value only represents equivalent water depth the maximum sws over the entire sierra was determined when the sierra wide average swe reaches the peak value in other words the doy of maximum sws is the same as the doy of maximum sierra wide average swe additionally to reveal the difference in maximum annual snow water availability at a pixel scale among datasets we compared the spatial distribution of 14 year average pixel wise peak swe and its changes as a function of elevation where the pixel wise peak swe is defined as the maximum swe estimates over the entire water year from october 1 to september 30 of the following year margulis et al 2016 4 results 4 1 evaluation of model performance 4 1 1 sierra wide cross validation with snow pillow observations lrm fsca exhibited notable improvements compared with lrm baseline in the snow pillow cross validation indicated by the median mean and standard deviation of all statistical metrics table 2 specifically lrm fsca explained 59 8 of the variance in snow pillow swe 6 higher than that for lrm baseline 53 9 table 2 the rmse for lrm fsca was 17 4 8 7 cm with an average reduction of 1 4 cm compared with the lrm baseline 18 8 9 2 cm lrm fsca also had a lower rmae 51 3 160 0 and basin wide pbias 15 2 155 0 than lrm baseline 56 0 204 0 and 17 2 200 0 respectively both lrm fsca and lrm baseline had high variation in rmae and pbias values but low variation in r2 and rmse values table 2 this can be explained by the high relative errors of a few simulations in very low swe period when a small absolute difference could result in a great relative error the improvement in lrm fsca s performance was more significant during the primary snow accumulation periods i e january march than during the snowmelt seasons fig 4 the seasonal variability of model accuracy calculated in each month for lrm fsca and lrm baseline exhibited similar patterns lrm fsca exhibited much better performance than lrm baseline in five of the six months we modeled including january through may during the period of the largest volumes of melt for the swe estimates in june when snow remained primarily in high elevation regions both lrm fsca and lrm baseline showed similar low accuracy this can be explained by the low representativeness of the training samples in june given that most stations are located at middle to low elevations and reported zero swe the r2 for both lrms exhibited little seasonal variability compared with the other three metrics indicating that the spatial variability of the snow pillow observations was consistently captured by the model training over time rmse generally increased throughout the snow season increases in rmse from january to april were consistent with the increased snow accumulation during that period however the continued increase in rmse in may and june suggested a decreasing performance of the lrms starting in may as snow accumulation was no longer high for this period this general trend was also supported by the distribution of rmae and basin wide pbias fig 4c and d both of which indicated much better performance of lrms in january through april than that in may and june 4 1 2 sierra wide validation with snow course measurements the swe values of the two lrm models were relatively well aligned with snow course swe values fig 5a and b whereas snodas and nwm swe values showed greater deviation from the 1 1 line fig 5c and d adding the dmfsca to the lrm largely reduced the uncertainty of swe estimates over the snow course sites lrm fsca outperformed the lrm baseline with a 7 0 06 increase in r2 and 14 2 5 cm 20 4 3 and 93 1 3 reductions in rmse rmae and pbias respectively the overall pbias for lrm fsca and lrm baseline were slightly positive with the highest observed swe values underestimated by both lrms see swe values greater than 100 cm generally located below the 1 1 line in fig 5a and b the overall performance of lrm fsca was notably better than snodas and nwm swe showing both 29 6 3 cm and 6 4 cm respectively lower rmse 28 6 9 and 35 9 4 lower rmae and 96 2 3 and 99 15 8 lower absolute pbias respectively snodas had slightly higher accuracy than nwm swe with 9 2 5 and 85 13 5 lower rmae and absolute pbias values respectively and similar rmse values while the r2 for snodas 0 73 was slightly lower than that for nwm swe 0 75 because elevation is the main topographic control on swe distribution we also examined the relationship between elevation and swe errors for each datasets fig 5 the results showed that both lrms underestimated swe for the middle elevation snow course sites but overestimated swe for relatively high and low elevations red and blue dots above 1 1 line in fig 5a and b these swe error patterns were possibly caused by a nonlinear relationship between swe and elevation e g a curve alike an upside down u shape no particular pattern was observed for snodas nwm swe had a clear underestimation for low and middle elevations but overestimation for relatively high elevations around 3000 m while the swe estimation errors for each product had high variability all datasets tended to overestimate swe for very low swe values but underestimated swe for moderate to high swe values red lines in fig 5 4 1 3 basin scale validation with aso swe data the two lrms also performed better than snodas and nwm swe when compared with the aso data in the upper trb during the overlapping period from wys 2013 2017 with 19 aso flights table 3 and fig 6 lrm fsca and lrm baseline explained similar proportions of variance in aso swe with the same mean r2 of 0 85 which was at least 31 0 20 higher on average than the other two operational swe datasets the variance of aso swe explained by lrm fca lrm baseline snodas and nwm swe were 85 5 85 5 65 6 and 32 18 respectively table 3 lrm fsca lrm baseline and snodas illustrated more robust swe estimates than nwm swe given the relatively lower standard deviation of r2 table 3 the improvement of lrm fsca relative to the lrm baseline was less evident over the trb because the evaluation metrics showed cloase values table 3 lrm fsca had lower rmse than lrm baseline for 13 out of 19 days fig 6b but the median rmse for lrm fsca 9 8 cm was 26 2 0 cm higher than that for lrm baseline 7 8 cm for the period one table 3 the median rmse for lrm fsca 13 3 cm was 4 0 5 cm less than that for lrm baseline 13 8 cm in the period two further suggesting that lrm fsca and lrm baseline had similar performance over the trb during this validation period in the daily model cross validation with snow pillow swe observations we found that the improvement in lrm fsca s performance was more pronounced during snow accumulation periods than during the snowmelt seasons and lrm fsca only showed a little better performance than lrm baseline in the late season given that aso generally flies near or after peak swe date i e around april 1 and mostly in the late snowmelt season it was not surprising to see that lrm fsca and lrm baseline showed similar accuracy when validated with aso swe data the rmae for lrm fca lrm baseline snodas and nwm swe were 23 6 12 5 24 8 13 6 35 1 20 7 and 45 2 13 8 respectively lrm baseline had the smallest pbias 4 1 29 7 compared with lrm fsca 5 5 27 7 snodas 35 4 41 9 and nwm swe 28 8 15 5 although nwm swe had a large pbias the variability of its pbias was the smallest 15 5 indicating it consistently underestimated swe which was also shown in figure 6d with negative pbias values on 18 out of 19 dates to visualize spatial differences across swe datasets not apparent by summary statistics in fig 6 or table 3 we selected five days near peak swe from wys 2013 through 2017 to show the spatial distribution of swe errors on one day in each wy as with the summary statistics compared with the aso swe on a pixel by pixel basis the magnitudes of swe errors for lrm fsca and lrm baseline were much smaller than that for snodas and nwm swe fig 7 both lrm fsca and lrm baseline overestimate swe in wys 2014 and 2015 the extreme drought years with a mixture of overestimation and underestimation in the normal and wet years of wys 2013 2016 and 2017 additionally the spatial distribution of swe errors for the two lrms revealed similar patterns the lrms tended to underestimate swe in the northern high alpine regions of the trb and overestimate swe in the western low elevation valley regions for the densely forested regions mostly located in the southeastern of the trb the lrms tended to overestimate swe for all comparison years both the magnitude and the spatial pattern of swe residuals for lrm fsca and lrm baseline were identical indicating that on average the two lrms had similar accuracy in the upper trb the spatial distribution of snodas errors exhibited greater variability and magnitude than the two lrms with a relatively large overestimation of swe for most regions in wys 2013 2014 2015 and 2017 in wy 2016 snodas overestimated swe for the low elevation forested regions but underestimated swe for high elevation alpine regions exhibiting relatively identical patterns compared with the two lrms the swe errors for nwm swe revealed rather similar spatial patterns under diverse snow conditions with overestimation in some low elevation valleys and forests and underestimation at the medium to higher elevations overall nwm swe underestimated swe for most regions across the trb 4 2 spatial and temporal variability of swe 4 2 1 inter and intra annual variability of snow water storage to reveal the variability of snow water storage sws across the sierra nevada as well as the sws differences among the four swe datasets we also compared the daily sws through their 14 year overlap period wys 2004 2017 including the 2012 2016 california drought period with extremely low sws fig 8 gray shading the two lrms generally had higher sws than snodas and nwm swe particularly for the period close to the peak sws date only subtle differences in sws were observed among datasets in the early snow accumulation and late snowmelt seasons looking more closely at the differences of maximum snow accumulation the annual maximum sws exhibited high interannual variability across all models fig 9a and b the average maximum sws for the driest year 2015 and wettest year 2011 derived from all the four swe datasets were 3 4 0 6 gigaton gt i e 4 0 gt for lrm baseline 3 7 gt for lrm fsca 3 2 gt for snodas and 2 7 gt for nwm and 38 6 7 7 gt i e 47 1 gt for lrm baseline 42 5 gt for lrm fsca 34 6 gt for snodas and 30 0 gt for nwm respectively with a 35 2 gt sws difference on average between these two years the year to year changes of the maximum sws for the four swe datasets followed a similar pattern but the magnitudes varied lrm baseline consistently estimated the highest sws followed by lrm fsca snodas and nwm swe with the median maximum sws of 25 0 gt 23 2 gt 16 0 gt and 13 8 gt respectively the maximum sws difference i e absolute value among the datasets in any given year ranged from a low of 0 1 gt in 2012 between lrm fsca and snodas to a maximum of 17 1 gt in 2011 between lrm baseline and nwm swe fig 8 for each pair of datasets the 14 year average sws difference was the smallest between lrm fsca and lrm baseline 1 2 1 2 gt ranging from 0 2 gt to 4 6 gt and was largest between lrm baseline and nwm swe 9 8 5 1 gt ranging from 1 3 gt to 17 1 gt the date of maximum sws exhibited a very high inter annual variability for all the four swe datasets in the comparison period fig 9c and d lrm fsca and nwm swe generally peaked earlier over the entire sierra followed by snodas and lrm baseline with the median peaked dates of doy of 70 70 73 and 74 i e equivalent to march 11 0 3 and 4 days in a common year respectively the dates of maximum sws were close in 11 out of 14 years among four datasets with the exceptions of wys 2010 2013 and 2015 in wy 2010 a moderate swe year nwm swe peaked on march 14 32 days earlier than snodas on april 15 while lrm fsca and lrm baseline estimated peak sws on april 8 and april 7 respectively notably in wy 2013 an extremely dry year both lrm fsca and nwm swe peaked in january while lrm baseline and snodas peaked in march for dry wy 2015 only snodas peaked in march while the other three datasets peaked in december or january although the peak sws dates varied significantly in these two dry years the sws values between january to march did not change appreciably over time for all the four datasets in wy 2015 fig 8 suggesting that the significant differences in the peak sws date estimated from different datasets in dry years may only have a subtle influence on water volume forecasts 4 2 2 spatial distribution of pixel wise peak swe lrm fsca and lrm baseline generally had a similar spatial pattern of pixel wise peak swe with only slightly lower swe estimated by lrm fsca in relatively low elevations 2500 m fig 10 and on the eastern slopes of the sierra fig 11 because the dmfsca well represented the difference between low elevations and eastern sierra with relatively ephemeral snowpacks versus high elevations with consistent snow covers lrm fsca likely decreased swe errors for low elevations and eastern sierra where lrm baseline tended to overestimate swe the swe patterns for snodas and nwm swe were considerably different relative to the two lrms with much lower peak swe at high elevations 3500 m and low elevations 2200 m fig 10 relative to the two lrms snodas exhibited notably greater swe at around 2400 3300 m elevations interestingly this relationship was reversed for the highest elevations above 3400 m where snodas swe values were significantly lower than the two lrms while the average pixel wise peak swe over the middle to high elevations exhibited distinct differences the influence of these differences on the range wide sws was relatively modest given the significantly smaller alpine area compared with the area of the low elevations 2500 m in the sierra red dots in fig 10 this also explained the high sws difference among datasets near peak snow accumulation period when low elevation swe was relatively high fig 8 a small difference in low elevation swe can result in relatively large differences in sws given the large low elevation land area additionally both snodas and nwm swe estimated much lower pixel wise peak swe than the lrms for the eastern slopes of the sierra and the low elevations of the western slopes of the sierra fig 11 nwm swe exhibited much lower swe in majority regions compared with the other three datasets fig 11 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with existing swe estimation methods in this study we combine ground observations with remotely sensed data in a linear regression model lrm for real time swe estimation in the sierra nevada caliofornia a key strength of the lrm is its simplicity compared with physically based snow models e g swe reconstruction models swe data assimilation and snodas we present lrm fsca as a marked improvement on the lrm baseline the basis of which is established in schneider and molotch 2016 we include the new variable dmfsca as an additional explanatory variable in the lrm given that dmfsca describes the variability of snow cover over time that corresponds with the swe accumulation and ablation processes the results presented here indicate that including the satellite observed dmfsca as one additional predictor variable for the lrm has improved swe estimation accuracy this suggests that dmfsca contains important information for real time swe modeling additionally we show the performance of lrm fsca and lrm baseline are considerably better than the operational swe datasets i e snodas and nwm swe hence the real time lrm swe estimates have potentially crucial implications for practical water resource management to give further context of the improved lrm fsca relative to other promising swe estimation models represented in the literture we compare our results with a few recently published studies in the text below schneider and molotch 2016 estimated swe distribution using a similar method as lrm baseline they reported a mean r2 value of 0 33 in snow pillow cross validation which is 44 0 26 lower than the 0 59 reported here for lrm fsca suggesting lrm fsca had a much improved performance this is partly due to the higher density of the training samples i e 440 km2 per snow pillow swe observation for this study versus 700 km2 for schneider and molotch 2016 and the higher accuracy of the historical swe reanalysis data used in the sierra nevada than those used in the rocky mountains by schneider and molotch 2016 yang et al 2018 the statistical model glmnet used in this study also outperforms the original glm model used by schneider and molotch 2016 in an environment with highly correlated independent variables given that glmnet can adaptively choose a subset of the independent variables for a specific modeling date using the penalized maximum likelihood additionally the differences in the patterns of winter snowfall precipitation between the maritime sierra nevada and the continental rocky mountains may also cause the differences in the model performance the winter snowfall over the sierra nevada is strongly influenced by atmospheric rivers which often result in relatively uniform accumulation patterns across the sierra nevada ralph et al 2004 while the snowfall over the larger rocky mountain domain studied by schneider and molotch 2016 is more complex spatially and is more significantly influenced by land atmosphere interactions other than orographic processes rasmussen et al 2011 zheng et al 2018 applied machine learning techniques to estimate swe at the same 500 m resolution using observations from a dense wireless snow depth sensor network and a physically based swe dataset i e reconstructed swe from guan et al 2013 to get swe at snow depth sensor locations they applied the mean ratio of the co located snow pillows and snow depth sensors in the basin for average snow density even though the snow density shows much less spatial variability than snow depth painter et al 2016 sturm et al 2010 using basin average snow density may induce uncertainties for the final swe estimation compared with our large scale sierra wide swe estimation their swe modeling is more explicit with a denser snow depth network i e 50 km2 per sensor over specific watersheds inluding american basin and merced tuolumne basin compared with our 440 km2 per site across the sierra they also evaluated their swe estimates against the aso swe data in the upper trb specifically the average rmse for their swe estimation during the overlap period i e april 1 7 and 16 2016 was 15 cm which is almost the same as we estimated for the lrm fsca 14 cm on the same dates they also had an average r2 value of 0 84 which is slightly lower than the reported 0 88 for lrm fsca on the same dates in our study although modeling swe over the entire sierra nevada faces greater challenges given the significantly larger modeling domain and lower density of sampling sites our swe model has shown a similar performance compared with zheng et al 2018 s swe model lrm fsca also compared favorably well with swe reconstruction models developed in the sierra nevada guan et al 2013 bair et al 2016 2018 guan et al 2013 reported an rmse of 20 5 cm and 25 4 cm for their reconstructed swe and snodas respectively when evaluated with 20 snow surveys in the sierra nevada showing a 19 4 9 cm lower rmse for their swe reconstruction model than that for snodas in this study lrm fsca reported a 29 6 3 cm and 34 5 0 cm lower rmse than snodas when compared with snow course swe observations and aso swe respectively although the evaluation datasets used by guan et al 2013 and this study are different the relative improvements compared with snodas indicate that our lrm fsca is very likely to have a better performance than guan et al 2013 s swe reconstruction model bair et al 2016 reported an average of 26 0 rmae for their reconstructed swe data when evaluated by aso swe data over wys 2013 to 2015 while lrm fsca reported an average rmae of 24 4 for the same period although our lrm fsca has a small negative bias 1 9 while the swe estimation of bair et al 2016 had 0 bias the developed lrm fsca suggests a comparable accuracy with bair et al 2016 s reconstruction model 5 2 model limitations one limitation of the developed swe modeling framework is that it heavily relies on ground swe observations whereas some other models can be used in regions without ground observations guan et al 2013 margulis et al 2016 rittger et al 2016 bair et al 2018 as a statistically based model the number and the distribution of the snow pillow stations have significant impacts on model performance hence the lrm shows relatively better performance from january through april when more stations are covered by snow providing a better representation of the overall swe patterns across the sierra the model accuracy decreases in may and june as the number of snow pillows with zero swe values increases in addition to the lower representativeness of snow pillow swe observations in the late snowmelt season compared with those in the early snow season the discrepancy due to incompatible spatial support of snow pillow swe versus grid based swe estimates is another reason for the lower accuracy of the lrms in the late snow season although we used fsca to scale the point snow pillow swe observations to grid cell in the model notwithstanding the absolute error of the lrm is relatively low given that only a small region is covered by snow in the late snowmelt season fig 10 the influence of this deterioration in model performance during the late snow season has little impact on the estimation of the total snow water storage or snow water availability given that both swe and snow covered regions i e high elevation regions are relatively low in the late snow season furthermore the spatial representativeness of the swe training samples may have an impact on the lrm s accuracy for example snow pillow stations are typically located in small forest clearings and relatively flat locations meromy et al 2013 there are less snow pillows on the eastern side of the sierra nevada and the elevation distribution of the snow pillow fig 3 differs significantly from the elevation distribution of the modeling domain across the sierra fig 10 regions with less snow pillow coverage e g high elevations in fig 5 are very likely to see a relatively lower accuracy in lrm swe estimates the uncertainties in the historical swe reanalysis data and the fsca data are not considered in this study the historical swe reanalysis provides an analogous swe pattern from a historical date for the target simulation date table 1 the basis for the value in using the historical swe reanalysis is that swe patterns on the simulation date often show similarity to the swe from analog dates in the past hence we rely on this analog swe pattern to improve the statistically based swe estimation models schneider and molotch 2016 the accuracy of the historical swe data has an important impact on the performance of the lrm given that the historical analog swe distribution is the most informative predictor variable used in the lrm table 1 there are inherent uncertainties in choosing the best historical swe reanalysis for the lrm herein we used snow pillow swe observations on the target modeling date versus the historical date to inform the selection of the historical swe date used in the lrm given the point based nature of these snow pillow swe observations these data cannot fully capture the heterogeneity of the swe distributions on the historical and target dates however for the historical swe data selection the snow pillow swe observation is the only dataset we can rely on as the truth the methods applied here are generally tranferable to other regions in which high quality historical swe data are available for example the snsr swe estimation model is generally applicable to different mountain locations across the world but at the time of this writing the model has only been implemented in selected areas hence high quality historical swe data may not be available in other regions e g the upper colorado river basin and this may limit potential applications of the lrm based real time swe estimation method in this context other datasets with reasonably high accuracy swe estimations such as swe recontructions from guan et al 2013 rittger et al 2016 and bair et al 2018 showing lower accuracy than snsr but higher accuracy than statistically based swe regressions schneider and molotch 2016 yang et al 2018 could also be fed into the lrm future work is needed to investigate the influence of errors in different historical swe data on the lrm swe estimation accuracy in this study fsca data were used to determine snow extent to scale the snow pillow and snow coure swe observations to better represent swe over a 500 m modeling grid cell and to calculate dmfsca for the lrm fsca simulations the daily gap filled fsca from stc modscag we used in this study is one of the most advanced products although the uncertainty of this dataset is not negligible given the technical challenges in addressing issues like cloud cover contamination canopy cover and the effect of wide view angles of modis imagery particularly over forested regions dozier et al 2008 bair et al 2019 rittger et al 2020 to reduce the impacts of uncertainties in the historical swe data and fsca data we scaled the historical swe data and dmfsca to mean 0 and standard deviation 1 so that only the patterns were ingested into the lrms thus the absolute values of the historical swe data were not relevant to the lrm simulation on the target date in other words the performance of lrm will only be impacted by the relative swe errors of the historical swe data and the dmfsca as quantifying the uncertainties in fsca data is beyond the scope of this study we do not discuss the impacts of the uncertainties in the fsca scale snow pillow swe measurements i e the model training samples on the model performance 6 conclusion this study offers evidence that satellite derived dmfsca contains significant information for statistically based swe estimation in real time comparing two lrms lrm fsca has a better overall performance in swe estimation than lrm baseline both lrms show high accuracy in the months january february and march a slightly lower accuracy in april and poor performance in may and june when there is less snow adding the dmfsca improves lrm fsca median r2 value from 0 54 to 0 60 and reduces the median pbias from 2 6 to 2 2 when validated by the snow pillow swe observations in cross validation lrm fsca also shows a similar improvement in r2 and pbias from 0 81 to 0 87 and from 1 4 to 0 1 respectively in the snow course validation the improvement of lrm fsca is less evident when validated by the aso swe data in the trb 85 of the aso swe variance is explained by the lrm fsca with the median rmse rmae pbias values of 13 3 cm 18 9 and 9 0 which is comparable with lrm baseline 0 86 r2 13 8 cm rmse 19 0 rmae 7 4 pbias in the evaluation using aso swe data i e 23 aso flight covering the wys 2013 through 2019 in the trb the swe estimation errors for the lrms exhibit similar patterns in the year to year comparison the regions with higher errors are mostly found in the valleys alpine regions and dense forests both lrm fsca and lrm baseline perform much better than snodas and nwm swe nwm swe shows the lowest accuracy the maximum snow water storage derived from all the four swe datasets reveals a consistently high interannual variability with a 35 2 gt 139 of the 14 year mean average difference between the driest year 2015 and wettest year 2011 in the 14 year comparison period indicating an intense fluctuation of drought and flood risks in california the developed lrm fsca with daily satellite derived information improves real time swe estimation and it will benefit the reservoir regulations the management of agricultural water use and the risk assessment of natural hazards like snow drought and rain on snow floods using multi source observations including remote sensing ground based observations and the statistical learning model

202,accurate streamflow prediction is of significant importance in watershed management and has been attracting a lot of research interest hybrid hydrological models that employ advantages of physically based models pbms and data driven models ddms emerge recently as reliable tools for analyzing hydrological processes both pbms and ddms have uncertain parameters that could affect the hybrid modeling results conventional computational algorithms that rely on repeated sampling such as monte carlo simulation mcs have been recognized as robust tools for assessing the propagation of parameter uncertainties however the efficiency of these computational algorithms can decrease exponentially as the number of parameters increases meanwhile although parameter uncertainty of pbms has been widely studied that of ddms in a hybrid modeling framework has not been well investigated in this study a hybrid model framework is proposed for streamflow prediction and an effective arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion apce method is implemented to assess the propagation of ddm parameter uncertainty within the hybrid modeling framework the hybrid hydrological model integrating fully distributed mike she and four machine learning techniques increases the coefficient of determination r2 from 0 70 to 0 82 for two validation periods the apce method generates highly similar probabilistic results as mcs and achieves a 90 efficiency enhancement in uncertainty assessment the results prove that apce is an efficient alternative to mcs for assessing uncertainties of hyperparameters in hybrid models this study helps improve the performance of the streamflow prediction and also provide an insight into the uncertainty propagation involved in the hybrid models

relies on expertise knowledge while ddm is of low consideration of physical hydrological processes low explanatory depth and low generalization ability devia et al 2015 ghaith et al 2020 ömer faruk 2010 it is also hard to know a priori which type of model would be better suited for a given situation mishra et al 2007 more importantly pbm and ddm could be regarded as complementary to each other in many aspects hence it is logical to employ the advantages of both pbm and ddm by proposing a hybrid model framework bagheri et al 2016 humphrey et al 2016 konapala et al 2020 hydrological models are associated with substantial inherent uncertainties that originate from input data model structures and model parameters fan et al 2016 li et al 2020 shrestha and wang 2020 song et al 2015 this is particularly true for the hybrid models due to their large number of parameters le et al 2020 li et al 2020 in the past few decades many methods for uncertainty analysis were developed to address the parameter uncertainty in hydrological models computational algorithms that rely on repeated sampling in particular monte carlo simulation mcs is the most widely used method for assessing the propagation of parameter uncertainty in hydrological models ehlers et al 2019 khu and werner 2003 however the efficiency of the computational algorithm can decrease significantly even exponentially in some cases as the number of parameters increases as a result more efficient methods are desired furthermore most of the previous studies on assessing parameter uncertainty propagation in hydrological modeling focused on parameters of pbm rather than ddm kavetski et al 2006 emam et al 2018 that may be because the parameters of ddm are often discrete or arbitrarily distributed which makes it challenging to apply an efficient algorithm for assessing its uncertainty propagation while there are a few studies on uncertainty quantifications for ddms zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 there is a lack of efficient methods for assessing the parameter uncertainty propagation of the ddm part of hybrid hydrological modeling therefore it is desired to investigate the uncertainty propagation of ddm parameters to support a comprehensive and robust uncertainty analysis for hybrid hydrological models polynomial chaos expansion pce is an efficient algorithm for assessing uncertainty propagation that has attracted much attention recently tabatabaei et al 2019 keshtegar et al 2019 pce decomposes the probability distribution of a random variable into several distributions of independent variables when using pce for uncertainty analysis of model parameters it can be regarded as a surrogate model the surrogate model captures the relationship between the model output and model parameters and constructs the probability distribution of model output using the distribution information of model parameters although the pce method has been successfully applied in many fields the conventional pce requires the uncertain parameters to be continuous which is not applicable for hybrid models assisted by ddm whose parameters are often discrete zhang et al 2020 wan et al 2020 to address such concerns arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion apce was developed wan and karniadakis 2006 witteveen and bijl 2006 apce creates polynomials from raw statistical moments of input data which makes it suitable for ddms and hydrological models where parameters can be arbitrarily distributed the objective of this study is to explore the potential of hybrid modeling for daily streamflow prediction and assess the uncertainties that originated from the hybrid model parameters using the advanced apce method the apce method will be utilized for the first time to assess the uncertainty propagation of hybrid model parameters in streamflow simulation models this entails the following three tasks 1 building and calibrating a mike she model based on physical parameters and meteorological data for streamflow prediction 2 integrating mike she with machine learning techniques including multi layer perceptron mlp random forest rf k nearest neighbors knn and support vector regression svr and developing a hybrid model to improve the streamflow prediction performance and 3 applying the apce approach to assess the uncertainty of machine learning hyperparameters within the proposed hybrid modeling framework a case study for an watershed in southwest china will be used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach this work will help improve the understanding of the hydrological processes in the case study it will also provide an insight into the uncertainties involved in hybrid models 2 methodology 2 1 hybrid modeling framework hybrid models incorporating both pbm and ddm can enhance the overall modeling performance for hydrological prediction ghaith et al 2020 nourani et al 2014 the hybrid model in this study is developed in two stages 1 establishment and calibration of a mike she model based on the meteorological land surface and hydrological data 2 construction of an ensemble model by stacking four ddms and using the output of the mike she model as well as the meteorological data as inputs a schematic representation for the integrated hybrid model framework is presented in fig 1 mike she is one of the most well known spatially distributed and physically based hydrological models refsgaard and storm 1995 abbott et al 1986 abbott et al 1986 it utilizes a geographic information system gis framework and geospatial data and simulates terrestrial water cycle processes such as evapotranspiration overland flow unsaturated soil water and ground water movements zhang et al 2008 vieux 2008 on the other hand ddm finds relationships between the system state variables i e input internal and output variables based on analyzing the data about a system without hypothetical knowledge of the system solomatine et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 statistical techniques such as autoregression integrated moving average arima and machine learning techniques like artificial neural networks ann and random forest rf are two popular approaches for developing ddm boyd et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 it is believed that machine learning techniques have an advantage over statistical techniques in modeling nonlinear systems li et al 2014 in this study four classic machine learning algorithms including multilayer perceptron mlp rf k nearest neighbors knn and support vector regression svr are employed and more details about these four algorithms can be referred to previous literature rosenblatt 1961 cover and hart 1967 breiman 2001 awad and khanna 2015 these four machine learning algorithms have been proven to be reliable for streamflow prediction in previous studies yonaba et al 2010 ghorbani et al 2016 liang et al 2018 wu and chau 2010 2 2 uncertainty quantification 2 2 1 polynomial chaos expansion the foundation of the polynomial chaos expansion pce method is derived from the homogeneous function in the wiener theory wiener 1938 the key idea of pce is that the distribution of an output random variable can be expressed as a composition of independent variables presented by orthogonal polynomials ghaith and li 2020 assume y f x is a model and x x 1 x 2 xd are uncertain model parameters in the format of random variables the model output random variable y can be represented by a multivariate polynomial expansion as follows xiu and karniadakis 2003 1 y a 0 p 0 i 1 1 a i 1 p 1 ξ i 1 i 1 1 i 2 1 i 1 a i 1 i 2 p 2 ξ i 1 ξ i 2 i 1 1 i 2 1 i 1 i 3 1 i 2 a i 1 i 2 i 3 p 3 ξ i 1 ξ i 2 ξ i 3 where p n ξ i 1 ξ i n is the polynomials e g hermite polynomials of order n in terms of the multi dimensional independent standard random variables ξ ξ i 1 ξ i n and a i 1 i r represents the pce coefficients the dimension of ξ ξ i 1 ξ i n is usually the same as x x 1 xd the following assumes that there is a one to one correspondence between ξ and x thus ξ could be expressed as ξ ξ1 ξ d eq 1 can be rewritten into a compact form 2 y j 0 a j ψ j ξ where a j and a i 1 i r have one to one correspondence so do ψ j ξ and p n ξ i 1 ξ i n for instance a generalized pce model could be established by substituting the polynomials in eq 1 with one dimensional hermite polynomials concerning standard normal random variables ghaith et al 2021 to employ finite terms of polynomials the pce representation of the model is usually truncated in practice the mth order truncated polynomial expansion of y with respect to the d dimension vector ξ ξ1 ξ2 ξ d can be expressed as follows 3 y j 0 m a j ψ j ξ for the truncated polynomials the number of the pce coefficients can be calculated as 4 n d m d m 2 2 2 arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion conventional pce methods select polynomials based on the distribution of input variables xiu and karniadakis 2002 for example the hermite orthogonal polynomial family is usually used for input variables with a continuous gaussian distribution arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion apce generalizes chaos expansion techniques towards arbitrary distributions of random variables with arbitrary probability measures which can be either discrete continuous or discretized continuous and can be specified either analytically as probability density cumulative distribution functions or numerically as histograms or raw data sets oladyshkin and nowak 2012 apce creates polynomials from the existence of a finite number of moments of the input data instead of requiring the complete knowledge of a probability density function which makes it suitable for modeling systems where the input random variables are arbitrarily distributed wan et al 2020 guo et al 2019 the optimal polynomial basis for apce can be obtained by calculating the statistical moments the polynomials pk ξ in eq 1 can be rewritten as 5 p k ξ p k ξ i 0 k p i k ξ i where p i k are coefficients and 6 μ 0 μ 1 μ k μ 1 μ 2 μ k 1 μ k 1 μ k μ 2 k 1 0 0 0 p 0 k p 1 k p k 1 k p k k 0 0 0 1 where μ2k 1 represents the 2k 1 th moment of ξ statistical moments are the only required information on the uncertain input for establishing an apce model to solve for the apce coefficients a non intrusive method i e the regression method was adopted in this study due to its effectiveness high accuracy and strong stability assume ξ i i 1 n are n samples of input random variables which are usually selected by latin hypercube sampling lhs and y i i 1 n are corresponding target responses the apce coefficients are obtained by solving the minimization problem q 7 q a r g m i n i 1 n y i i 0 n a i p i ξ i 2 3 experimental setup 3 1 study area and data collection the anning river basin arb in southwest china fig 2 is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology the anning river located between 102 06 to 102 10 e and 26 38 to 29 02 n is a tributary of the upper reaches of the yangtze river it originates in the hengduan mountain range and flows through four cities mianning xichang dechang and miyi the total length of the river is 337 km and the draining area is approximately 11 150 km2 the arb is in a dry warm valley and possesses a typical non zonal climate the mean annual temperature at arb is between 17 c to 19 c and the mean annual precipitation is approximately 1 240 mm with over 90 of the rain observed between june and october the land use is mainly forests croplands and built ups it is also a gathering place for 14 national minorities which makes arb one of the most important areas in the upper reaches of the yangtze river in terms of social and cultural development daily meteorological observations from 1977 to 1986 and 2006 to 2007 including maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation sunshine duration and wind speed were obtained from the national meteorological center of china daily streamflow records for the same periods were collected at a controlled hydrometric station i e wantan station land use data were obtained from the resources and environment data cloud platform of the chinese academy of sciences soil data 1 km 1 km were extracted from the harmonized world soil database more details about the collected data are shown in table 1 3 2 hybrid model setup and uncertainty propagation in this study as shown in fig 1 a hybrid framework that consists of one pbm i e mike she and four ddms i e mlp rf knn and svr is developed for streamflow prediction digital elevation model dem meteorological land use land cover soil and hydrological data are collected and used to represent the catchment heterogeneity within the mike she model the mike she model is calibrated for daily streamflow at the wantan station during the period of 1977 to 1983 while data during the 1984 to 1986 period and the 2006 to 2007 period are used for validation the calibration validation split of raw data is based on the data availability and how we expect to use the model in practice the auto calibration tool embedded in mike she is adopted for parameter calibrations and a global optimization algorithm i e the population simplex evolution method with an aggregated objective function of minimizing root mean square error is used in this study 2017 the ranges of primary sensitive parameters including the manning coefficient detention storage horizontal hydraulic conductivity vertical hydraulic conductivity specific yield storage coefficient drainage level and time constant are determined based on our previous work and literature and shown in table 2 wijesekara et al 2014 wang et al 2012 li et al 2021 for the ddms the output of mike she i e streamflow prediction along with the meteorological data including precipitation mean temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature and wind speed are employed as input variables while the corresponding streamflow is the output target observed streamflow data from the period of 1977 to 1983 are used for calibration while data during the 1984 to 1986 period and the 2006 to 2007 period are used for validation the ddm parameters were determined by random search and cross validation there are many uncertain parameters in the proposed hybrid models including both mike she and ddm parameters while some efforts have been made to quantify the effects of uncertain mike she parameters mcmichael and hope 2007 christiaens and feyen 2002 assessing the uncertainties of ddm parameters especially in a hybrid modeling framework is still challenging in this study four ddm parameters in the hybrid framework are identified as uncertain including the number of nearest neighbors k of the knn model the number of the minimum leaf nodes nleaf and the number of trees ntree in rf and the number of neurons nneuron in mlp these parameters are selected because they are the most important numerical parameters for the ensembled ddm oshiro et al 2012 doukim et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 the type of kernel function is regarded as the most important parameter for svm because it is not a numerical parameter it isnot included in the uncertainty analysis in this study min and lee 2005 since there are no universally accepted distributions for these selected parameters uniform distributions i e k u 1 30 n l e a f u 1 30 n t r e e u 100 3000 and n n e u r o n u 10 50 are assumed then apce is utilized to evaluate the propagation of uncertainty associated with the four ddm parameters to the hybrid model output i e daily streamflow a non intrusive method that employing 100 times lhs is used to solve the apce coefficients and the iteration times of lhs is determined based on the number of samples required for solving the minimization problem q at least 15 samples are required in this study since mcs is widely recognized as a reliable tool for uncertainty analysis mooney 1997 zhou et al 2020 the performance of apce in this study is compared with a benchmark mcs with 1 000 simulation runs as the number of uncertain parameters increases both methods will require more computational time but the apce is expected to be increasingly more advantageous than mcs in terms of efficiency 3 3 performance measures for traditional deterministic prediction where there is one exact value of predicted streamflow for each time step four commonly used criteria including mean absolute percentage error mape root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are employed for performance evaluations 8 m a p e 100 n i 1 n y i y i y i

value of sample i y is the mean of observed values y is the mean of predicted values to demonstrate the reliability of apce where a probability distribution of streamflow is generated for each time step during prediction the results obtained by apce are compared with distributions generated by mcs the inherent probabilistic characteristics including mean standard deviation skewness and kurtosis of the distributions from both apce and mcs are examed the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test which is a nonparametric test is adopted to compare the shape of the two obtained distributions massey 1951 the null hypothesis h 0 is that the two distributions are statistically identical while the alternative hypothesis ha is that the two distributions are not statistically identical the test statistic d is the maximum absolute distance between the two cumulative distribution functions the goal of the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test is to check if two sets of samples results of apce and mcs are drawn from populations with the same distribution 4 results 4 1 deterministic prediction and model comparison in this study the mike she model is first employed for streamflow prediction in arb a hybrid framework consisting of one pbm i e mike she and four ddms i e mlp rf knn and svr is then developed and utilized to further improve the streamflow prediction accuracy in this study the results of six models are analyzed including the standalone mike she model i e mike she four hybrid models where mlp rf knn and svr are integrated with mike she i e hybrid mlp hbrid rf hybrid knn and hybrid svr respectively and one ensemble hybrid model where the mean ensemble of mlp rf knn and svr is integrated with mike she i e hybrid ensemble table 3 presents the overall results of these evaluation criteria for the six models during the two validation periods 1984 to 1986 and 2006 to 2007 it is found that while all the models provide satisfactory daily streamflow predictions the five hybrid models comprehensively outperform the standalone mike she model this may be because hybrid models can capture hydrological processes that are confidently captured by pbm as well secondary hydrological processes that are not incorporated in pbm but can be addressed by a ddm to further compare hybrid ensemble and mike she fig 3 a and b show the comparison of observed streamflow versus predicted streamflow obtained from mike she and hybrid ensemble during the two validation periods two scatter plots of observed versus predicted daily streamflow for mike she and the hybrid method across the two validation periods are also presented in fig 3c and d specifically during the 1984 to 1986 period the value of mape rmse r2 and nse obtained from the hybrid model is 23 30 117 77 0 81 and 0 84 respectively while these results from mike she are 43 03 143 84 0 73 and 0 72 respectively in the 2006 to 2007 period the hybrid model results in mape rmse r2 and nse are 42 75 104 66 0 74 and 0 75 respectively and those of mike she are 32 77 115 99 0 68 and 0 65 respectively overall hybrid ensemble provides more accurate streamflow predictions than the mike she model on top of that the mike she model tends to produce more slight underestimations during some low streamflow periods 500 m3 s and high streamflow periods 1500 m3 s as suggested in fig 3 it is noteworthy that for the 2006 to 2007 period both models are found to perform worse than they do for the 1984 to 1986 period this may be because that both models are calibrated using data from 1977 to 1983 which most likely represents the 1984 to 1986 period better than the 2006 to2007 period it implies that the target hydrological processes have changed slightly over time in addition to the hybrid ensemble model results of the other four hybrid models are also analyzed performance comparisons among hybrid rf hybrid mlp hybrid knn and hybrid svr on the two validation datasets is shown in fig 4 it can be observed that hybrid mlp performs the best although all these four models show overall satisfactory predictions it also suggests that hybrid mlp and hybrid svr are able to generate more accurate predictions for extremely high values it might be because knn and rf models are classification algorithms that could not generate predictions exceeding the range of training samples devak et al 2015 buskirk 2018 it is noted that hybrid mlp performed slightly better than hybrid ensemble in terms of the four criteria however the hybrid ensemble model has a well known advantage of robustness wang et al 2021 christiansen et al 2009 it is believed that an ensemble model can make more reliable predictions with low variance than a single model recognized especially when applied to different case studies de coste et al 2021 zhang and ma 2012 the ensemble structure is thus recommended for modeling complex hydrological processes and selected for uncertainty analysis in section 4 2 4 2 uncertainty analysis of model parameters in the hybrid ensemble model selected for uncertainty analysis the hyperparameters of the data driven ensemble are determined through random search and cross validation to quantify the effects of hyperparameter uncertainty the apce method is applied and compared with mcs which is a widely accepted benchmark technique for uncertainty analysis 4 2 1 comparison of inherent probabilistic characteristics for every timestamp two probabilistic outputs can be respectively produced through apce and mcs by varying the hyperparameters to demonstrate the reliability of apce the probabilistic output produced by apce is compared with the probabilistic output produced by mcs at every timestamp during the two validation periods fig 5 shows the interval predictions generated by mcs and apce on the two validation periods the interval predictions are produced based on the probabilistic prediction of both methods the 95 and 5 quantiles are selected from the probabilistic predictions to form an interval prediction at every timestamp it is observed that most observations fall into both mcs and apce interval predictions additionally the differences between mcs interval predictions and apce interval predictions are minor fig 6 shows scatter plots of the mean values of probabilistic outputs produced by apce meanapce versus the mean values of probabilistic outputs produced by mcs meanmcs it can be observed that there is an excellent agreement r2 0 99996 for the 1984 1986 period and r2 0 99995 for the 2016 2017 period between the mean flow rates generated by apce and those generated by mcs to further compare the two probabilistic outputs at every timestamp during the validation periods the error meanapce meanmcs and error percentage meanapce meanmcs meanmcs are calculated and shown in fig 7 during the 1984 to 1986 period the absolute errors on june 30th 1985 and july 8th 1985 when peak flows occurred are the largest the errors are 17 17 m3 s and 11 19 m3 s respectively similarly the largest errors during the period of 2006 to 2007 are found on peak flow days september 5th and 7th 2006 with an error of 9 16 m3 s and 8 58 m3 s respectively it can also be observed that most of the absolute error percentages are less than 2 5 in contrast with absolute errors the biggest absolute error percentages are found on low flow days standard deviation skewness and kurtosis are also important statistics for characterizing a probabilistic output fig 8 presents the errors apce minus mcs in standard deviation skewness and kurtosis overall the errors in these statistics are minor similar to the absolute errors in mean the largest absolute errors in these statistics are observed when the flow rate is high moreover mcs method is likely to generate distributions with a higher standard deviation than apce which indicates that the data points are spread out over a slightly larger range of values and mcs method also generates distributions with higher kurtosis which illustrates that the distributions tend to have heavy tails or outliers this may be because the apce method is built based on using the collocation points which only account for part of the parameter range ghaith and li 2020 the analysis of errors in mean standard deviation skewness and kurtosis show that apce is able to generate consistent results as mcs for quantifying the uncertainty of hyperparameters in the hybrid ensemble model 4 2 2 two sample kolmogorov smirnov test a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test is implemented in this study to compare the probabilistic output produced by apce with that produced by mcs at every timestamp during the validation periods fig 9 shows the p values of the kolmogorov smirnov test at every timestamp during the two validation periods when the significance level α 0 01 it can be observed that p value 0 01 at all timestamps which implies the two distributions from apce and mcs are statistically identical when the significance level α 0 05 it can be noticed that p values 0 05 at most timestamps which verifies the high similarities between the distributions from apce and mcs these results suggest that there is little difference between the probabilistic outputs produced by apce and those produced by mcs at most timestamps and that apce is as reliable and robust as mcs in this study in sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 the probabilistic prediction results of apce are compared with mcs mcs is considered as a robust and reliable uncertainty quantification technique and it has been widely applied in many fields but it can be computationally expensive as the number of hyperparameters increases in this study mcs method is used as a benchmark and the simulation runs are set as 1 000 based on literature and our computation ability cassettari et al 2012 heijungs 2020 khu and werner 2003 the apce method that generates very similar probabilistic results as mcs requires only 100 simulation runs this indicates a 90 efficiency enhancement and proves apce as an efficient alternative to mcs for assessing uncertainties of hyperparameters in hybrid models in addition the proposed apce method can overcome the limitation of conventional pce which requires a continuous distribution of the target uncertain parameter and thus address the lack of efficient tools for assessing uncertainties in hybrid models 5 conclusions in this study a hybrid framework based on the integration of one physically based model pbm and four data driven models ddm was developed to improve hydrological prediction accuracy and a novel arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion apce approach was proposed to assess the propagation of hyperparameter uncertainties in the hybrid model specifically a hybrid model involving mike she multi layer perceptron mlp random forest rf k nearest neighbors knn and support vector regression svr was developed a case study to predict daily streamflow in the anning river in southwest china was conducted elevation land use soil meteorological and hydrological data were used for mike she to represent the catchment heterogeneity and generate preliminary predictions of daily streamflow the obtained preliminary predictions along with meteorological data from four stations upstream of the outlet station were then fed into the ensemble of mlp rf knn and svr to generate the final predictions of daily streamflow the performance of the proposed hybrid models and the standalone mike she model were evaluated by mape rmse r2 and nse the results showed that the hybrid models outperformed the standalone mike she model in addition to address the lack of efficient techniques for analyzing hyperparameter uncertainty in hybrid modeling a novel apce method was introduced to assess the propagation of uncertainties of four hyperparameters in the proposed hybrid model the polynomials used in apce were created from the raw statistical moments of four hyperparameters from mlp rf and knn the distribution of the streamflow at each timestamp was decomposed into these polynomials the monte carlo simulation mcs method was used as a benchmark in this study the results demonstrated that apce can generate uncertainty quantification results very similar to mc but requires much less computational effort it is worth mentioning that the proposed apce can overcome the limitation of conventional pce which requires a predefined continuous distribution of the target uncertain parameters and is not applicable for the uncertain analysis of hyperparameters with a discrete distribution the findings reported in this study shed new light on implementing novel apce for uncertainty analysis of hydrological models it also lays the groundwork for future research into the application of apce on the uncertainty analysis of hyperparameters the study was limited by the use of a single case study further studies need to be carried out to validate the wide applicability of the apce method additionally the proposed apce method relies on observations to quantify the propagation of parameter uncertainties with a model further improvements can be made to expand apce s

probabilistic results as mcs and achieves a 90 efficiency enhancement in uncertainty assessment the results prove that apce is an efficient alternative to mcs for assessing uncertainties of hyperparameters in hybrid models this study helps improve the performance of the streamflow prediction and also provide an insight into the uncertainty propagation involved in the hybrid models keywords hydrological model hybrid modeling mike she machine learning parameter uncertainty apce 1 introduction accurate streamflow prediction is of practical significance and has been attracting a lot of research interest hydrological models are regarded as necessary tools in understanding the behavior of a hydrological system and simulating the streamflow physically based models pbms which are based on mathematical descriptions of the physics of hydrological systems have been widely used and well studied more recently data driven models ddms that are based purely on relationships between given input data and output data have also shown great potential for hydrological modeling remesan and mathew 2016 solomatine et al 2008 although both pbms and ddms have been successfully applied in hydrological modeling there are certain limitations associated with them pbm suffers from scale related problems requires data about the initial state of a model and the morphology of catchments and relies on expertise knowledge while ddm is of low consideration of physical hydrological processes low explanatory depth and low generalization ability devia et al 2015 ghaith et al 2020 ömer faruk 2010 it is also hard to know a priori which type of model would be better suited for a given situation mishra et al 2007 more importantly pbm and ddm could be regarded as complementary to each other in many aspects hence it is logical to employ the advantages of both pbm and ddm by proposing a hybrid model framework bagheri et al 2016 humphrey et al 2016 konapala et al 2020 hydrological models are associated with substantial inherent uncertainties that originate from input data model structures and model parameters fan et al 2016 li et al 2020 shrestha and wang 2020 song et al 2015 this is particularly true for the hybrid models due to their large number of parameters le et al 2020 li et al 2020 in the past few decades many methods for uncertainty analysis were developed to address the parameter uncertainty in hydrological models computational algorithms that rely on repeated sampling in particular monte carlo simulation mcs is the most widely used method for assessing the propagation of parameter uncertainty in hydrological models ehlers et al 2019 khu and werner 2003 however the efficiency of the computational algorithm can decrease significantly even exponentially in some cases as the number of parameters increases as a result more efficient methods are desired furthermore most of the previous studies on assessing parameter uncertainty propagation in hydrological modeling focused on parameters of pbm rather than ddm kavetski et al 2006 emam et al 2018 that may be because the parameters of ddm are often discrete or arbitrarily distributed which makes it challenging to apply an efficient algorithm for assessing its uncertainty propagation while there are a few studies on uncertainty quantifications for ddms zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 there is a lack of efficient methods for assessing the parameter uncertainty propagation of the ddm part of hybrid hydrological modeling therefore it is desired to investigate the uncertainty propagation of ddm parameters to support a comprehensive and robust uncertainty analysis for hybrid hydrological models polynomial chaos expansion pce is an efficient algorithm for assessing uncertainty propagation that has attracted much attention recently tabatabaei et al 2019 keshtegar et al 2019 pce decomposes the probability distribution of a random variable into several distributions of independent variables when using pce for uncertainty analysis of model parameters it can be regarded as a surrogate model the surrogate model captures the relationship between the model output and model parameters and constructs the probability distribution of model output using the distribution information of model parameters although the pce method has been successfully applied in many fields the conventional pce requires the uncertain parameters to be continuous which is not applicable for hybrid models assisted by ddm whose parameters are often discrete zhang et al 2020 wan et al 2020 to address such concerns arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion apce was developed wan and karniadakis 2006 witteveen and bijl 2006 apce creates polynomials from raw statistical moments of input data which makes it suitable for ddms and hydrological models where parameters can be arbitrarily distributed the objective of this study is to explore the potential of hybrid modeling for daily streamflow prediction and assess the uncertainties that originated from the hybrid model parameters using the advanced apce method the apce method will be utilized for the first time to assess the uncertainty propagation of

pbm and ddm can enhance the overall modeling performance for hydrological prediction ghaith et al 2020 nourani et al 2014 the hybrid model in this study is developed in two stages 1 establishment and calibration of a mike she model based on the meteorological land surface and hydrological data 2 construction of an ensemble model by stacking four ddms and using the output of the mike she model as well as the meteorological data as inputs a schematic representation for the integrated hybrid model framework is presented in fig 1 mike she is one of the most well known spatially distributed and physically based hydrological models refsgaard and storm 1995 abbott et al 1986 abbott et al 1986 it utilizes a geographic information system gis framework and geospatial data and simulates terrestrial water cycle processes such as evapotranspiration overland flow unsaturated soil water and ground water movements zhang et al 2008 vieux 2008 on the other hand ddm finds relationships between the system state variables i e input internal and output variables based on analyzing the data about a system without hypothetical knowledge of the system solomatine et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 statistical techniques such as autoregression integrated moving average arima and machine learning techniques like artificial neural networks ann and random forest rf are two popular approaches for developing ddm boyd et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 it is believed that machine learning techniques have an advantage over statistical techniques in modeling nonlinear systems li et al 2014 in this study four classic machine learning algorithms including multilayer perceptron mlp rf k nearest neighbors knn and support vector regression svr are employed and more details about these four algorithms can be referred to previous literature rosenblatt 1961 cover and hart 1967 breiman 2001 awad and khanna 2015 these four machine learning algorithms have been proven to be reliable for streamflow prediction in previous studies yonaba et al 2010 ghorbani et al 2016 liang et al 2018 wu and chau 2010 2 2 uncertainty quantification 2 2 1 polynomial chaos expansion the foundation of the polynomial chaos expansion pce method is derived from the homogeneous function in the wiener theory wiener 1938 the key idea of pce is that the distribution of an output random variable can be expressed as a composition of independent variables presented by orthogonal polynomials ghaith and li 2020 assume y f x is a model and x x 1 x 2 xd are uncertain model parameters in the format of random variables the model output random variable y can be represented by a multivariate polynomial expansion as follows xiu and karniadakis 2003 1 y a 0 p 0 i 1 1 a i 1 p 1 ξ i 1 i 1 1 i 2 1 i 1 a i 1 i 2 p 2 ξ i 1 ξ i 2 i 1 1 i 2 1 i 1 i 3 1 i 2 a i 1 i 2 i 3 p 3 ξ i 1 ξ i 2 ξ i 3 where p n ξ i 1 ξ i n is the polynomials e g hermite polynomials of order n in terms of the multi dimensional independent standard random variables ξ ξ i 1 ξ i n and a i 1 i r represents the pce coefficients the dimension of ξ ξ i 1 ξ i n is usually the same as x x 1 xd the following assumes that there is a one to one correspondence between ξ and x thus ξ could be expressed as ξ ξ1 ξ d eq 1 can be rewritten into a compact form 2 y j 0 a j ψ j ξ where a j and a i 1 i r have one to one correspondence so do ψ j ξ and p n ξ i 1 ξ i n for instance a generalized pce model could be established by substituting the polynomials in eq 1 with one dimensional hermite polynomials concerning standard normal random variables ghaith et al 2021 to employ finite terms of polynomials the pce representation of the model is usually truncated in practice the mth order truncated polynomial expansion of y with respect to the d dimension vector ξ ξ1 ξ2 ξ d can be expressed as follows 3 y j 0 m a j ψ j ξ for the truncated polynomials the number of the pce coefficients can be calculated as 4 n d m d m 2 2 2 arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion conventional pce methods select polynomials based on the distribution of input variables xiu and karniadakis 2002 for example the hermite orthogonal polynomial family is usually used for input variables with a continuous gaussian distribution arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion apce generalizes chaos expansion techniques towards arbitrary distributions of random variables with arbitrary probability measures which can be either discrete continuous or discretized continuous and can be specified either analytically as probability density cumulative distribution functions or numerically as histograms or raw data sets oladyshkin and nowak 2012 apce creates polynomials from the existence of a finite number of moments of the input data instead of requiring the complete knowledge of a probability density function which makes it suitable for modeling systems where the input random variables are arbitrarily distributed wan et al 2020 guo et al 2019 the optimal polynomial basis for apce can be obtained by calculating the statistical moments the polynomials pk ξ in eq 1 can be rewritten as 5 p k ξ p k ξ i 0 k p i k ξ i where p i k are coefficients and 6 μ 0 μ 1 μ k μ 1 μ 2 μ k 1 μ k 1 μ k μ 2 k 1 0 0 0 p 0 k p 1 k p k 1 k p k k 0 0 0 1 where μ2k 1 represents the 2k 1 th moment of ξ statistical moments are the only required information on the uncertain input for establishing an apce model to solve for the apce coefficients a non intrusive method i e the regression method was adopted in this study due to its effectiveness high accuracy and strong stability assume ξ i i 1 n are n samples of input random variables which are usually selected by latin hypercube sampling lhs and y i i 1 n are corresponding target responses the apce coefficients are obtained by solving the minimization problem q 7 q a r g m i n i 1 n y i i 0 n a i p i ξ i 2 3 experimental setup 3 1 study area and data collection the anning river basin arb in southwest china fig 2 is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology the anning river located between 102 06 to 102 10 e and 26 38 to 29 02 n is a tributary of the upper reaches of the yangtze river it originates in the hengduan mountain range and flows through four cities mianning xichang dechang and miyi the total length of the river is 337 km and the draining area is approximately 11 150 km2 the arb is in a dry warm valley and possesses a typical non zonal climate the mean annual temperature at arb is between 17 c to 19 c and the mean annual precipitation is approximately 1 240 mm with over 90 of the rain observed between june and october the land use is mainly forests croplands and built ups it is also a gathering place for 14 national minorities which makes arb one of the most important areas in the upper reaches of the yangtze river in terms of social and cultural development daily meteorological observations from 1977 to 1986 and 2006 to 2007 including maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation sunshine duration and wind speed were obtained from the national meteorological center of china daily streamflow records for the same periods were collected at a controlled hydrometric station i e wantan station land use data were obtained from the resources and environment data cloud platform of the chinese academy of sciences soil data 1 km 1 km were extracted from the harmonized world soil database more details about the collected data are shown in table 1 3 2 hybrid model setup and uncertainty propagation in this study as shown in fig 1 a hybrid framework that consists of one pbm i e mike she and four ddms i e mlp rf knn and svr is developed for streamflow prediction digital elevation model dem meteorological land use land cover soil and hydrological data are collected and used to represent the catchment heterogeneity within the mike she model the mike she model is calibrated for daily streamflow at the wantan station during the period of 1977 to 1983 while data during the 1984 to 1986 period and the 2006 to 2007 period are used for validation the calibration validation split of raw data is based on the data availability and how we expect to use the model in practice the auto calibration tool embedded in mike she is adopted for parameter calibrations and a global optimization algorithm i e the population simplex evolution method with an aggregated objective function of minimizing root mean square error is used in this study 2017 the ranges of primary sensitive parameters including the manning coefficient detention storage horizontal hydraulic conductivity vertical hydraulic conductivity specific yield storage coefficient drainage level and time constant are determined based on our previous work and literature and shown in table 2 wijesekara et al 2014 wang et al 2012 li et al 2021 for the ddms the output of mike she i e streamflow prediction along with the meteorological data including precipitation mean temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature and wind speed are employed as input variables while the corresponding streamflow is the output target observed streamflow data from the period of 1977 to 1983 are used for calibration while data during the 1984 to 1986 period and the 2006 to 2007 period are used for validation the ddm parameters were determined by random search and cross validation there are many uncertain parameters in the proposed hybrid models including both mike she and ddm parameters while some efforts have been made to quantify the effects of uncertain mike she parameters mcmichael and hope 2007 christiaens and feyen 2002 assessing the uncertainties of ddm parameters especially in a hybrid modeling framework is still challenging in this study four ddm parameters in the hybrid framework are identified as uncertain including the number of nearest neighbors k of the knn model the number of the minimum leaf nodes nleaf and the number of trees ntree in rf and the number of neurons nneuron in mlp these parameters are selected because they are the most important numerical parameters for the ensembled ddm oshiro et al 2012 doukim et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 the type of kernel function is regarded as the most important parameter for svm because it is not a numerical parameter it isnot included in the uncertainty analysis in this study min and lee 2005 since there are no universally accepted distributions for these selected parameters uniform distributions i e k u 1 30 n l e a f u 1 30 n t r e e u 100 3000 and n n e u r o n u 10 50 are assumed then apce is utilized to evaluate the propagation of uncertainty associated with the four ddm parameters to the hybrid model output i e daily streamflow a non intrusive method that employing 100 times lhs is used to solve the apce coefficients and the iteration times of lhs is determined based on the number of samples required for solving the minimization problem q at least 15 samples are required in this study since mcs is widely recognized as a reliable tool for uncertainty analysis mooney 1997 zhou et al 2020 the performance of apce in this study is compared with a benchmark mcs with 1 000 simulation runs as the number of uncertain parameters increases both methods will require more computational time but the apce is expected to be increasingly more advantageous than mcs in terms of efficiency 3 3 performance measures for traditional deterministic prediction where there is one exact value of predicted streamflow for each time step four commonly used criteria including mean absolute percentage error mape root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are employed for performance evaluations 8 m a p e 100 n i 1 n y i y i y i

value of sample i y is the mean of observed values y is the mean of predicted values to demonstrate the reliability of apce where a probability distribution of streamflow is generated for each time step during prediction the results obtained by apce are compared with distributions generated by mcs the inherent probabilistic characteristics including mean standard deviation skewness and kurtosis of the distributions from both apce and mcs are examed the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test which is a nonparametric test is adopted to compare the shape of the two obtained distributions massey 1951 the null hypothesis h 0 is that the two distributions are statistically identical while the alternative hypothesis ha is that the two distributions are not statistically identical the test statistic d is the maximum absolute distance between the two cumulative distribution functions the goal of the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test is to check if two sets of samples results of apce and mcs are drawn from populations with the same distribution 4 results 4 1 deterministic prediction and model comparison in this study the mike she model is first employed for streamflow prediction in arb a hybrid framework consisting of one pbm i e mike she and four ddms i e mlp rf knn and svr is then developed and utilized to further improve the streamflow prediction accuracy in this study the results of six models are analyzed including the standalone mike she model i e mike she four hybrid models where mlp rf knn and svr are integrated with mike she i e hybrid mlp hbrid rf hybrid knn and hybrid svr respectively and one ensemble hybrid model where the mean ensemble of mlp rf knn and svr is integrated with mike she i e hybrid ensemble table 3 presents the overall results of these evaluation criteria for the six models during the two validation periods 1984 to 1986 and 2006 to 2007 it is found that while all the models provide satisfactory daily streamflow predictions the five hybrid models comprehensively outperform the standalone mike she model this may be because hybrid models can capture hydrological processes that are confidently captured by pbm as well secondary hydrological processes that are not incorporated in pbm but can be addressed by a ddm to further compare hybrid ensemble and mike she fig 3 a and b show the comparison of observed streamflow versus predicted streamflow obtained from mike she and hybrid ensemble during the two validation periods two scatter plots of observed versus predicted daily streamflow for mike she and the hybrid method across the two validation periods are also presented in fig 3c and d specifically during the 1984 to 1986 period the value of mape rmse r2 and nse obtained from the hybrid model is 23 30 117 77 0 81 and 0 84 respectively while these results from mike she are 43 03 143 84 0 73 and 0 72 respectively in the 2006 to 2007 period the hybrid model results in mape rmse r2 and nse are 42 75 104 66 0 74 and 0 75 respectively and those of mike she are 32 77 115 99 0 68 and 0 65 respectively overall hybrid ensemble provides more accurate streamflow predictions than the mike she model on top of that the mike she model tends to produce more slight underestimations during some low streamflow periods 500 m3 s and high streamflow periods 1500 m3 s as suggested in fig 3 it is noteworthy that for the 2006 to 2007 period both models are found to perform worse than they do for the 1984 to 1986 period this may be because that both models are calibrated using data from 1977 to 1983 which most likely represents the 1984 to 1986 period better than the 2006 to2007 period it implies that the target hydrological processes have changed slightly over time in addition to the hybrid ensemble model results of the other four hybrid models are also analyzed performance comparisons among hybrid rf hybrid mlp hybrid knn and hybrid svr on the two validation datasets is shown in fig 4 it can be observed that hybrid mlp performs the best although all these four models show overall satisfactory predictions it also suggests that hybrid mlp and hybrid svr are able to generate more accurate predictions for extremely high values it might be because knn and rf models are classification algorithms that could not generate predictions exceeding the range of training samples devak et al 2015 buskirk 2018 it is noted that hybrid mlp performed slightly better than hybrid ensemble in terms of the four criteria however the hybrid ensemble model has a well known advantage of robustness wang et al 2021 christiansen et al 2009 it is believed that an ensemble model can make more reliable predictions with low variance than a single model recognized especially when applied to different case studies de coste et al 2021 zhang and ma 2012 the ensemble structure is thus recommended for modeling complex hydrological processes and selected for uncertainty analysis in section 4 2 4 2 uncertainty analysis of model parameters in the hybrid ensemble model selected for uncertainty analysis the hyperparameters of the data driven ensemble are determined through random search and cross validation to quantify the effects of hyperparameter uncertainty the apce method is applied and compared with mcs which is a widely accepted benchmark technique for uncertainty analysis 4 2 1 comparison of inherent probabilistic characteristics for every timestamp two probabilistic outputs can be respectively produced through apce and mcs by varying the hyperparameters to demonstrate the reliability of apce the probabilistic output produced by apce is compared with the probabilistic output produced by mcs at every timestamp during the two validation periods fig 5 shows the interval predictions generated by mcs and apce on the two validation periods the interval predictions are produced based on the probabilistic prediction of both methods the 95 and 5 quantiles are selected from the probabilistic predictions to form an interval prediction at every timestamp it is observed that most observations fall into both mcs and apce interval predictions additionally the differences between mcs interval predictions and apce interval predictions are minor fig 6 shows scatter plots of the mean values of probabilistic outputs produced by apce meanapce versus the mean values of probabilistic outputs produced by mcs meanmcs it can be observed that there is an excellent agreement r2 0 99996 for the 1984 1986 period and r2 0 99995 for the 2016 2017 period between the mean flow rates generated by apce and those generated by mcs to further compare the two probabilistic outputs at every timestamp during the validation periods the error meanapce meanmcs and error percentage meanapce meanmcs meanmcs are calculated and shown in fig 7 during the 1984 to 1986 period the absolute errors on june 30th 1985 and july 8th 1985 when peak flows occurred are the largest the errors are 17 17 m3 s and 11 19 m3 s respectively similarly the largest errors during the period of 2006 to 2007 are found on peak flow days september 5th and 7th 2006 with an error of 9 16 m3 s and 8 58 m3 s respectively it can also be observed that most of the absolute error percentages are less than 2 5 in contrast with absolute errors the biggest absolute error percentages are found on low flow days standard deviation skewness and kurtosis are also important statistics for characterizing a probabilistic output fig 8 presents the errors apce minus mcs in standard deviation skewness and kurtosis overall the errors in these statistics are minor similar to the absolute errors in mean the largest absolute errors in these statistics are observed when the flow rate is high moreover mcs method is likely to generate distributions with a higher standard deviation than apce which indicates that the data points are spread out over a slightly larger range of values and mcs method also generates distributions with higher kurtosis which illustrates that the distributions tend to have heavy tails or outliers this may be because the apce method is built based on using the collocation points which only account for part of the parameter range ghaith and li 2020 the analysis of errors in mean standard deviation skewness and kurtosis show that apce is able to generate consistent results as mcs for quantifying the uncertainty of hyperparameters in the hybrid ensemble model 4 2 2 two sample kolmogorov smirnov test a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test is implemented in this study to compare the probabilistic output produced by apce with that produced by mcs at every timestamp during the validation periods fig 9 shows the p values of the kolmogorov smirnov test at every timestamp during the two validation periods when the significance level α 0 01 it can be observed that p value 0 01 at all timestamps which implies the two distributions from apce and mcs are statistically identical when the significance level α 0 05 it can be noticed that p values 0 05 at most timestamps which verifies the high similarities between the distributions from apce and mcs these results suggest that there is little difference between the probabilistic outputs produced by apce and those produced by mcs at most timestamps and that apce is as reliable and robust as mcs in this study in sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 the probabilistic prediction results of apce are compared with mcs mcs is considered as a robust and reliable uncertainty quantification technique and it has been widely applied in many fields but it can be computationally expensive as the number of hyperparameters increases in this study mcs method is used as a benchmark and the simulation runs are set as 1 000 based on literature and our computation ability cassettari et al 2012 heijungs 2020 khu and werner 2003 the apce method that generates very similar probabilistic results as mcs requires only 100 simulation runs this indicates a 90 efficiency enhancement and proves apce as an efficient alternative to mcs for assessing uncertainties of hyperparameters in hybrid models in addition the proposed apce method can overcome the limitation of conventional pce which requires a continuous distribution of the target uncertain parameter and thus address the lack of efficient tools for assessing uncertainties in hybrid models 5 conclusions in this study a hybrid framework based on the integration of one physically based model pbm and four data driven models ddm was developed to improve hydrological prediction accuracy and a novel arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion apce approach was proposed to assess the propagation of hyperparameter uncertainties in the hybrid model specifically a hybrid model involving mike she multi layer perceptron mlp random forest rf k nearest neighbors knn and support vector regression svr was developed a case study to predict daily streamflow in the anning river in southwest china was conducted elevation land use soil meteorological and hydrological data were used for mike she to represent the catchment heterogeneity and generate preliminary predictions of daily streamflow the obtained preliminary predictions along with meteorological data from four stations upstream of the outlet station were then fed into the ensemble of mlp rf knn and svr to generate the final predictions of daily streamflow the performance of the proposed hybrid models and the standalone mike she model were evaluated by mape rmse r2 and nse the results showed that the hybrid models outperformed the standalone mike she model in addition to address the lack of efficient techniques for analyzing hyperparameter uncertainty in hybrid modeling a novel apce method was introduced to assess the propagation of uncertainties of four hyperparameters in the proposed hybrid model the polynomials used in apce were created from the raw statistical moments of four hyperparameters from mlp rf and knn the distribution of the streamflow at each timestamp was decomposed into these polynomials the monte carlo simulation mcs method was used as a benchmark in this study the results demonstrated that apce can generate uncertainty quantification results very similar to mc but requires much less computational effort it is worth mentioning that the proposed apce can overcome the limitation of conventional pce which requires a predefined continuous distribution of the target uncertain parameters and is not applicable for the uncertain analysis of hyperparameters with a discrete distribution the findings reported in this study shed new light on implementing novel apce for uncertainty analysis of hydrological models it also lays the groundwork for future research into the application of apce on the uncertainty analysis of hyperparameters the study was limited by the use of a single case study further studies need to be carried out to validate the wide applicability of the apce method additionally the proposed apce method relies on observations to quantify the propagation of parameter uncertainties with a model further improvements can be made to expand apce s

203,saline inflows and soluble geological formations outcropped in reservoirs contribute to reservoir water salinization rws we set up 32 laboratory tests to better understand rock water interaction and determination of dissolution rate of gachsaran geological formation ggf in the parsian dam that is currently under the study phase on the fahlian river iran then we used ce qual w2 w2 to simulate ggf dissolution outcropped in some parts of the reservoir finally possible solutions for mitigating the rws were investigated using w2 driven under different scenarios 1 having hamze beigi saline inflow a main tributary of the fahlian river and ggf dissolution 2 removing the saline inflow 3 confining the ggf dissolution and 4 driving w2 in severe floods although the dissolution rates 0 023 0 056 gr cm2 day salinize deep water saline inflow degrades surface waters density gradient in the water depth formed the monimolimnion and mixolimnion separated by a distinct pycnocline in the reservoir the pycnocline established in the early impoundment stage and lasted throughout the study period 2002 2012 leading to a crenogenic meromixis state in the reservoir w2 driven under the 100 year and 1000 year inflows shows salinity up to 2700 mg l in top layers from partial chemical mixing in the reservoir in cold months although no conversion of the lake from the meromixis to holomictic state was observed in warm months the findings suggest that although diversion of the saline inflow satisfies the salinity requirement for hydropower generation peak saline inflow can salinize the reservoir water and downstream river keywords reservoir salinization soluble formation chemical mixing parsian dam 1 introduction water storage in reservoirs usually increases the water residence time that can lead to negative impacts on water quality kadivar 2007 noori et al 2018 noori et al 2019a aradpour et al 2021 reservoir water salinization rws emerges when soluble geological formations outcrop within the reservoir area a relevant threat in many regions of iran naderkhanloo et al 2017 that is poorly understood a recent example of this problem is the salinization of the gotvand dam reservoir located in the southwest of iran due to the presence of halite in the reservoir location which has caused serious concerns about the operation of this dam in the future naderkhanloo et al 2017 jalali et al 2019 the parsian dam as a hydropower dam is currently under the study phase on the fahlian river that flows through gypsum type formation called gachsaran geological formation ggf in iran limestone compounds have been expanded in some parts of the reservoir and their main component is gypsum caso4 2h2o considering the high solubility of caso4 2h2o there are serious concerns regarding the rws when the parsian dam reservoir pdr is impounded baghdardokht and heidari 2005 the problem arises when the ggf dissolution rate is not fully understood on the other hand it is not recommended to use the suggested dissolution rates for different gypsum type geological formations due to the high range of uncertainty reported around the world raines and dewers 1997 klimchouk and aksem 2002 baghdardokht and heidari 2005 aljubouri and al kawaz 2007 mbogoro et al 2011 valor et al 2011 lebedev 2015 domínguez villar et al 2017 feng et al 2017 hong et al 2018 tang et al 2018 therefore attempts to understand the rock water interaction and the ggf dissolution rates in the pdr should be made through laboratory tests or field measurements saline inflow mainly from the hamzeh beigi reach a tributary of the fahlian river can also contribute to the rws once the pdr is impounded therefore the question raised here is how great the effect of ggf dissolution outcropped in the reservoir would be on the rws the next question centers around the impact of hamze beigi saline inflow and its influence on the rws since there is a hydroelectric power plant in parsian dam its activation in the operation phase makes constant oscillation at the higher levels of the reservoir which leads to increasing the vertical velocity at the top layers therefore it is important to address the effect of water oscillation on rws in top layers where the water is released for hydropower generation answering these questions can help decision makers to choose the optimum operation policy and consider the possible change in dam location to avoid the severe rws in practice to answer the questions raised above the salinity distribution should be simulated across the reservoir under different initial and boundary conditions using mathematical models in this study we explored the ggf dissolution rates in the pdr through laboratory tests using a physical model under different conditions of flow velocity that exactly take place in different depths of parsian reservoir then we connected the physical model s results of the specified dissolution rates to ce qual w2 w2 model to further explore the rws under different scenarios of reservoir operation actually the definition of dissolution rate in the w2 is not possible simply and it needs to improve the model s ability using a creative technique here we fed the ggf dissolution as a pollution source through virtual tributary inflows with low flows and high concentrations of total dissolved solids tds to the w2 model it should be noted that we selected the w2 model a well known reservoir hydrodynamic and water quality model cole and wells 2015 as it has been successfully used for water quality simulation in different reservoirs around the world kim and kim 2006 ma et al 2015 noori et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 ji et al 2017 al zubaidi and wells 2017 sadeghian et al 2018 kim et al 2019 lindenschmidt et al 2019 mi et al 2019 2020 al zubaidi and wells 2020 morales marin et al 2020 this work aims to contribute to future recommendation on dam construction to account for saline inflows in regions with soluble geological formations outcropped in the lake area to limit rws 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the parsian dam is planned to be constructed on the fahlian river in the fars province south of iran the main purpose of the dam is hydropower generation as well as some secondary goals including supplying water for agricultural industrial and domestic purposes the geographic location of the dam is 51º 40 e and 29º 45 n fig 1 and movie s1 according to a 43 year historical data the average annual precipitation air temperature and potential evaporation in the study area respectively is 700 mm 20 ºc and 1680 mm january is the wettest total precipitation 156 mm and coldest average air temperature 9 ºc month and june and july are the warmest average air temperature 31 ºc and driest months also average maximum and minimum wind speeds in the study area are 1 7 mainly occurring from march to june 2 7 and 0 6 m s respectively the direction of the dominant wind is often from north to west the climate in this area from north to south and from west to east slowly changes from cold to semi humid and humid to semi dry temperate based on ambergeh and demartonne climate classification the average groundwater level and its tds in the study area are 18 m and 930 mg l respectively maghrebi et al 2021 noori et al 2021a given an extensive decline in groundwater level in the study area during the last decades noori et al 2021a groundwater does not likely charge the pdr this dam has been designed with a clay core with a height of 115 m and a volume of 398 million cubic meters mcm at the normal operating level the area and length of the reservoir at normal water level 1445 m above sea level a s l is 5 48 km2 and 9 8 km respectively this dam will be constructed on the fahlian river which belongs to the zohreh river basin the area of the basin is 1983 km2 and the slope of the basin is about 10 4 the elevation of the basin varies from 1346 to 3718 m a s l the fahlian river is 76 km long and its slope varies between 1 2 and 2 4 the slope of the river in the reservoir is 1 the fahlian river ultimately discharges into the persian gulf the long term mean annual flow data from 1969 to 2017 of the fahlian river at the location of the dam is about 585 mcm 18 m3 s which is based on the observed flow at goosangan gauge 22 km below the dam fig 2 a in addition to the goosangan gauge 10 other temporary stations i e sw1 sw10 fig 1 have been used for tds sampling for the salinity simulation in the pdr of these sw2 is located on tavakol abad tributary sw4 sw6 are located on the hamzeh beigi reach and other stations were positioned on the fahlian river the fahlian flows with an average tds of 350 mg l upstream i e station sw1 in fig 1 and is salinized after joining two saline tributaries causing the average tds to reach up to 1420 mg l in station sw7 fig 2b illustrates the annual variation of tds in the temporary stations the tavakol abad and hamzeh beigi rivers are two main tributaries of the fahlian river with poor water quality and a high amount of salt at almost 3 km upstream from the reservoir tavakol abad with an average tds of 2860 mg l enters the main river as a permanent river the length of the tavakol abad river is about 35 km with a slope of 2 3 this reach originates from ghalat mountain with an elevation of 2300 m a s l and enters the fahlian river at an elevation of 1490 m a s l the mean annual flow in tavakol abad gauge 1999 2017 is around 0 8 m3 s or 25 2 mcm annually another tributary hamzeh beigi river with an average tds of around 8200 mg l meets the reservoir after about 1 km from the beginning of the lake the hamzeh beigi river consists of two fresh and salty tributaries the saline hamzeh beigi tributary originates from two springs chalehkhersi and klikaksofla as the hamzeh beigi river is an ungauged basin both tds and river flow were gathered from field studies the geological morphology of the study area was studied based on the stratigraphic rock units and their resistance to erosion structural and tectonic factors geological morphology units in the reservoir location include asmari bakhtiary gachsaran and razak formations asmari and bakhtiray geological formations are resistant to erosion and mostly combine from medium to thick layers of lime and conglomerates making walls of the reservoir these features cause the valleys and waterways in the region to be u shaped and very steep gachsaran and razak geological formations are mostly erodible owing to their combination of marl marl lime gypsum marl gypsum and siltstone they have been observed on both sides of the reservoir the ggf which is known as a soluble formation in the reservoir has three sections the lower section the middle section and the upper section the lower section is situated on both sides of the river with a thickness of 10 35 m it includes marl gypsum and tiny layers of gypsum with layers of marl and lime marl meaning it has a low to very low permeability the middle section includes the thick layers of gypsum as well as marl and gypsum lime layers the thickness of this section varies from 100 to 150 m with permeability from low to very low the upper section is made from gypsum marl marl and tiny layers of gypsum the thickness of this section in the reservoir varies from 100 to 150 m its permeability is from low to very low 2 2 dissolution mechanism the ggf depends on several factors including the characteristics of solvent and solute the volume and velocity of involved solvent current the level of exposure saturation concentration temperature pressure acidity and the effect of other soluble materials lasaga 1998 the dissolution of gypsum rocks outcropped in the pdr is the main source of rws dissolution is a heterogeneous reaction occurring at the boundary between two phases molecular dissociation of gypsum occurs almost instantaneously so that dissolution is solely controlled by diffusion across the boundary layer dissolution rates depend on the boundary layer conditions and concentration gradients across it lasaga 1998 proposed the general form of eq 1 for the surface dissolution rates of minerals like gypsum rocks 1 r v a d c d t k 1 c c e q n where r dissolution rate at time t mmol cm2 s v volume of circulated water cm3 c total concentration of ca2 in solution at

have shown that the gypsum dissolution rate in the regime of mixed control c 0 9ceq follows a linear equation e g james 1992 while some others have reported a quadratic equation e g raines and dewers 1997 using a rotating disk set up for c 0 6ceq and batch experiments for c 0 94ceq jeschke et al 2001 proposed n 1 2 0 2 they also revealed that n value is approximately equal to 4 5 for c 0 94ceq it has been shown that at c 0 5 c e q the value of k for gypsum rocks is in the order of 10 5 10 4 mmol cm2 s james 1992 raines and dewers 1997 although it is in the order of 10 mmol cm2 s for c 0 94ceq jeschke et al 2001 using rotating disk technique in a mixed flow steady state reactor raines and dewers 1997 suggested second order kinetics with k 3 5 10 4 mmol cm2 s 2 3 experimental setup referring to the available geological maps the estimated area of ggf in the pdr is about 0 87 km2 to estimate the dissolution rate of the ggf in the laboratory some samples were taken from four points of the pdr according to geological studies there are two types of ggf in the pdr a thick layer of gypsum gsg with an area of 0 46 km2 and a composition of marl gypsum and limestone gsmg with an area 0 41 km2 they are expected to have different dissolution mechanisms to find the dissolution mechanism several gsg and gsmg rock samples were collected in appropriate dimensions from different points of the pdr to be representative of all sections the pilot illustrated in fig 3 a and b included two separate plexiglas tanks to save time of 0 6 0 6 0 4 m dimensions and two pumps for the circulation of water therefore the dimensions of the rock samples positioned vertically in tanks were selected to be 0 6 0 6 0 1 m fig 3c in every test two rock samples of both gsg and gsmg were put in the tanks and tds values of the solution were recorded from the test onset until the tds changes were negligible i e saturation concentration of tds the water for running the tests was supplied from the fahlian river to simulate the actual condition of dissolution as much as possible the top layer of the pilot was covered by a piece of glass to prevent evaporation and change in mass four different flow velocities of 0 5 1 5 3 8 and 7 0 mm s were established in the experimental tanks by adjusting flow rates in valves these flow velocities were estimated using the depth area and inflow rates in the pdr noted that water temperature does not significantly influence the gypsum dissolution rate in the range of ambient air temperature klimchouk 1996 flatt et al 2017 therefore we ignored the impact of water temperature on the gypsum dissolution rate in our analyses the tds concentration of water in the experimental tanks was measured every six hours every test was repeated two times for each rock sample considering four different velocities four points of sampling gsg and gsmg and two repetitions of the tests 32 experiments were conducted in total based on the results the ggf dissolution rates were estimated for different flow rates according to temporal tds concentration changes 2 4 numerical simulation parsian reservoir is a long and deep reservoir in such narrow reservoirs the dominant changes in hydrodynamics and water quality usually take place in longitudinal and vertical directions therefore two dimensional laterally averaged mathematical models such as w2 can be considered as the best tool for hydrodynamics and water quality simulation cole and wells 2015 in the current study the w2 model was selected to simulate salinity in terms of tds in the pdr the w2 is a two dimensional laterally averaged water quality model that has been in use for more than 40 years the u s army corps of engineers launched the model in 1975 it can calculate velocity fields and constituents in narrow stratified water bodies such as the pdr this model is based on a finite difference approximation to the laterally averaged equations of fluid dynamics cole and wells 2015 2016 according to the available data salinity simulation in the pdr was performed for 10 years starting from 2002 the input data for the w2 model was the topographic map which gave the reservoir geometry with scale 1 2000 daily inflow at goosangan gauge for 10 years 2002 2012 daily tds hourly meteorological data temperature cloudiness wind speed wind direction and dew point specifications of the dam and related structures location and elevation of the dam intake and withdrawals noori et al 2019b hourly meteorological data was taken from the nearest synoptic weather station doroodzan station which is 50 km away from the dam to model the length of the reservoir was divided into 19 segments varying from 207 m to 1432 m fig 3d the reservoir depth was divided into 1 m layers with the maximum number of layers in the deepest area being 99 layers the parsian dam reservoir has not been impounded yet therefore there are limitations to calibrate the w2 model for salinity simulation in the reservoir paying attention to the unknown behavior of the reservoir in the future the risk of rws is evaluated in w2 model using default values suggested for the parameters of this model table 1 previous applications of w2 model under different conditions have demonstrated the model produces appropriate results by selection of default values if one accurately introduces boundary conditions and reservoir geometry to the model cole and wells 2015 however since the most of our study area in terms of topographic features is mainly open and does not provide shelter from the wind see movie s1 optimum value of 0 9 was used for the wind sheltering coefficient wsc in all segments cole and wells 2015 also we had shade in the last segments of the reservoir segments 14 to 18 due to its v shape in these segments therefore the selected shading coefficient for these shaded segments varied from 0 9 to 0 95 and for other segments segments 2 to 13 was set to be 1 no shade the light extinction coefficient exh2o was also selected to be 0 45 cole and wells 2015 because of relatively poor water quality of the inflow to the pdr based on the geological information ggf is exposed to the water body in 11 segments of the pdr fig 3d the w2 cannot simply consider ggf dissolution process therefore it requires employing an indirect method to simulate the entrance tds concentration induced by the ggf dissolution in practice tds is added to the reservoir throughout the boundaries in exposed locations to simulate ggf dissolution in w2 a virtual tributary inflow directly discharged to the reservoir was used for every boundary cell in direct contact with the ggf then based on the calculated ggf dissolution rate in that segment a virtual inflow qv with a specific tds was defined such that the entered tds load was comparative to that calculated in laboratory tests to satisfy the mass balance it is required to subtract the sum of the virtual flows from the actual inflows to the reservoir note that the exact value of tds in these tributary inflows is not important because the virtual flow would be adjusted following the ggf dissolution rate and the mass of salt which should be added to the reservoir in a time interval it is clear that for the highest tds value the lowest virtual inflow is required to simulate the ggf dissolution in the reservoir through the introduced tributary inflows however the highest measured tds value in the field is preferred here because it results in the lowest virtual inflow which requires less work to establish a mass balance in the reservoir the least changes in the natural condition and it is physically more similar to the dissolution process the flow rate of the assumptive tributary inflows was calculated based on the type of ggf outcropped in different segments proper experimental dissolution rate and contact surface area of the ggf in that segment it should be noted that during the salinity model execution the flow rate of every assumptive tributary inflow was fixed eventually the volumetric virtual flow qv of every tributary inflow is estimated as 2 q v 0 115 a s r t d s where as is the contact surface of the ggf exposed to the water body in each segment m2 and tds is the assumptive tds value for the tributary inflow supposed to be 3000 mg l close to the maximum tds in the pdr inlet because of the different salinity and hydrodynamic conditions in the depth of the reservoir different dissolution processes may be taking place in a segment as the depth varies to simulate this situation the volumetric flow of any assumptive tributary inflow was distributed in the depth of reservoir in this regard each segment was divided into different layers with a depth of 10 m and the qv value of the related tributary inflow was discharged in depth with specified elevations using an incremental linear function overall 74 tributary inflows were considered for 11 segments exposed to ggf in the pdr it should be noted that the sum of the discharges from tributary inflows to the reservoir was then subtracted from the actual reservoir inflow to keep the balance for the reservoir budget equation in fact the main novelty in this work returns to the connection between the physical model s results of the specified dissolution rates and the type of definition of such rates in the mathematical model i e w2 in the pdr 2 5 reservoir operation scenarios the average tds of river flow in the goosangan station is about 1492 mg l this high tds value is due to the high salinity of tavakol abad and especially hamzeh beigi tributaries that flow over the soluble ggf and leave a lot of salt in the water then they meet the fahlian river upstream of the pdr with average tds values of 2850 and 8200 mg l respectively fig 1 it should be noted that they have low flow rates compared to the fahlian river considering the high tds concentration in hamzeh beigi inflow it is clear that this reach plays a significant role in the rws after the reservoir impoundment the ggf dissolution outcropped in the reservoir area may further add to the problem after the reservoir is filled with water by considering the above the question raised here is how great the effect of hamze beigi river discharge would be on the rws the next question refers to ggf dissolution and its influence on the rws finally peak inflows may increase salinity in the upper layers by establishing a chemical mixing in the reservoir noori et al 2021b therefore it is also important to investigate the effects of peak inflows on rws in upper layers where water is usually withdrawn for usage in the reservoir downstream answering these questions may help decision makers to choose the necessary measures in order to mitigate rws in practice or change the reservoir location if no other solution can be found on this basis four scenarios were considered in numerical modeling as follows 1 the first scenario is based on continuing the current situation of inflows to the reservoir considering ggf dissolution based on experimental results in this scenario the numerical model is set up based on the natural rivers flow the total area of the soluble formation in the reservoir and ggf dissolution rate 2 in the second scenario the hamzeh beigi reach is removed to evaluate its effect on the rws 3 in the third scenario soluble ggf outcropped in the reservoir is confined 4 finally the effect of peak inflows on rws in the upper layers is investigated in this regard the calculated 100 year and 1000 year inflows into the reservoir were considered text s1 and fig s1 we ran the w2 model for the selected scenario among the above at the calculated peak inflows into the reservoir the 4th scenario 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of the physical model laboratory tests 3 1 1 tds equilibrium after pilot preparation gsg and gsmg samples were placed in the pilot and water circulation was started tds was recorded every six hours from the test onset until the tds variation was very low i e equilibrium state results showed that 6 8 days of water circulation was enough to reach an equilibrium state due to the number of experiments 32 tests and the two available pilots conducting the tests lasted more than four months the tds changes in the experimental tanks under different flow rates for gsg and gsmg formations are shown in fig 4 a according to fig 4a tds increased dramatically in the first 24 h after that it increased gradually and became stable after four days t 96 h to five days t 120 h the final tds for both gsg and gsmg varies between 1600 and 1700 mg l where the solution is almost saturated 3 1 2 dissolution rates considering the tds concentration changes in time eq 1 the dissolution rate of the gsg and gsmg in the pdr at four different flow rates has been estimated and presented in fig 4b note that dissolution rates in this figure are the average values of several tests which were repeated for every rock sample according to this figure the dissolution rate of formations that is being exposed to freshwater is very high at the onset of the experiment nevertheless the dissolution rate plummets dramatically after 24 h reaching zero after approximately 96 h these diagrams illustrate that the maximum ggf dissolution rate e g for flow rate 7 mm s would be 0 053 to 0 056 gr cm2 day however after 24 h it would be less than 0 01 gr cm2 day after 5 6 days the dissolution rate would be zero the dissolution rate of gsg formation at the start is higher and falls faster than that for the gsmg in the first 24 h the local increase or decrease in fig 4b between 24 and 90 h may be the result of operation conditions also tds change at the start is faster when the flow rate is higher on the other hand as the flow rate increases the stable condition will be reached sooner where the dissolution is stopped a literature review revealed that our findings were within the range of reported results for the dissolution rate of geological rocks around the world in general saturation concentration for gypsum in water was reported to be about 2000 mg l lebedev and kosorukov 2017 which is close to those calculated in fig 4a 1600 1700 mg l gypsum equilibrium concentration in the tang shemiran reservoir iran was estimated to be between 1700 and 2300 mg l baghdardokht and heidari 2005 slightly higher than that observed for gsg and gsmg however baghdardokht and heidari 2005 reported that equilibrium concentration could rise to 6300 mg l when gypsum was exposed to mgso4 and nacl in liquid condition the experiments of raines and dewers 1997 showed a gypsum dissolution rate of about 0 144 gr cm2 day in a solution with an initial tds of 1700 mg l gypsum dissolution rate in an unconfined setting in western ukraine was estimated to be 0 0063 gr cm2 day klimchouk and aksem 2002 the gypsum dissolution rate of fat formation in iraq at a flow rate of 0 0 34 m s varied between 0 195 and 0 472 gr cm2 day aljubouri and al kawaz 2007 valor et al 2011 conducted several laboratory tests to evaluate gypsum dissolution rate in the cof disueri reservoir in sicily and showed that the rate of dissolution changed from 0 094 to 0 3 gr cm2 day for a water velocity range of 0 05 0 2 m s therefore it can be concluded that a wide range for gypsum dissolution rate 0 0063 0 47 gr cm2 day has been suggested a range that covers our findings for both gsg and gsmg formations as shown in fig 4b it should be noted that the wide range suggested is due to different conditions in the conducted studies including purity percentage of gypsum rock flow velocity initial solution tds saturation concentration acidity level of exposure the volume of involved solvent experiment method temperature pressure conditions and fluid type 3 1 3 incorporation of dissolution rates in the w2 model to incorporate the dissolution rate in the w2 model maximum values of dissolution rate i e r early rates were seen in the experiments related to the lowest tds in fig 4b were used however the dissolution rates were not assumed to be the same as the tds and flow velocity variety of pdr for different depths in the upper layers of the reservoir with higher water fluctuation regarding hydropower operation and lower tds the dissolution rates of v 7 mm s were used and for the deepest layer of the reservoir where the water is almost stable and tds is the highest dissolution rates of v 0 5 mm s were used in the same way for the mid layers the dissolution rates of v 3 8 and 1 5 mm s were employed table 2 shows the different dissolution rates that were used for the calculation of virtual flow rates from the assumptive tributaries to the reservoir 3 2 the results of w2 model 3 2 1 results of sensitivity analysis to explore the w2 model sensitivity to the selected default values of some important calibration parameters see table 1 we changed the selected values of wsc to 0 5 and 1 the shading coefficient for those segments receiving shade was decreased by 25 and the exh2o value was also reduced to 0 25 our results revealed no significant change between the model simulation results i e both water temperature and tds for the selected default values and those obtained by the change in these calibration parameters see figs s2 s7 these results properly show the w2 model works well with the selected values of calibration parameters 3 2 2 results of the first to fourth scenarios to simulate water salinity by the w2 model the result of dissolution rate of gsg and gsmg has been introduced to the model as 74 assumptive tributary inflows in 11 segments segments 8 to 18 in fig 3d as shown previously the considered virtual flow rates at assumed tributary inflows using the experimental dissolution rates are shown in table 2 according to this table the area of ggf including both gsg and gsmg in direct contact with water the formation density 2300 kg m3 and the experimental ggf dissolution rates were used to annually calculate the volume and mass of dissolved formation i e tds then the flow rates of the assumptive tributary inflows were calculated using eq 2 and shown in the last column of table 2 fig 5 a illustrates the daily inflow and the changes of tds concentration in the reservoir s outflow in the 1st scenario the first two year period of tds results are for the model s warm up 2002 and 2003 it is clear that the behavior of daily inflow and the changes of tds concentration in the reservoir s outflow are mostly reversed as the inflow increases the tds concentration at the outlet declines and vice versa according to this figure the outlet tds concentration reached a peak of 3335 mg l gradually between day 3200 and 3340 when inflow 10 m3 s then it falls to 814 mg l from day 3406 3408 through the fast enhancement of the inflow to about 97 m3 s a similar trend can be seen when the inflow increases rapidly the biggest flood with peak discharge of about 102 m3 s took place on day 2254 when tds of about 722 mg l was recorded in the pdr outlet w2 results revealed a crenogenic meromictic state initiated in the pdr from its early impoundment stage lasting for the entire study period 2002 2012 this means the pdr is chemically stratified due to a continuous source of dense saline water into the deep layers of the lake resulting from ggf dissolution hutchinson 1937 aradpour et al 2020 to better show the chemical stratification in the pdr tds concentration against the water depth simulated under the 1st to 3rd scenario conditions on january 15th 2012 cold month and july 15th 2012 warm month is given in fig 6 a c according to fig 6a and b in the 1st and 2nd scenarios tds concentration increases up to 3200 mg l in the deep layers although there is a bit of difference between warm july and cold january months the density gradient in the water depth formed the monimolimnion and mixolimnion respectively in deep and top layers separated by a distinct pycnocline pycnocline established due to the vertical density gradient in water column induced by the impacts of water temperature and salinity contributes to different tds concentrations in the surface and bottom layers in the pdr we use pycnocline terminology here to address the simultaneous effects of thermocline and halocline in the pdr in detail stratification and mixing are both important hydrodynamic factors influencing the depth variation of constituents in iran s reservoirs where most of the reservoirs are classified as warm monomictic lakes noori et al 2021b regarding water temperature gradient in depth our results reveal that the reservoir annually experiences a severe stratification in most months of the year april to november and becomes homothermal from december to march fig 5b also the salinity gradient in the water column forms a halocline in the pdr even in cold months when the reservoir is homothermal leading to better water quality in terms of tds in top layers than that in the deep layers in cold months fig 6a and c therefore deep water salinized by ggf dissolution outcropped in the reservoir cannot mix with the top layers due to distinct barriers established by pycnocline and halocline respectively in warm and cold months also homothermal conditions would somewhat bring deep saline waters to the water surface through the attenuation of pycnocline and therefore enhance salinization in top layers of pdr during the cold months in general sharp pycnocline established in the early impoundment stage in the reservoir under the conditions of the 1st and 2nd scenarios lasted through the entire study period 2002 2012 leading to an extreme crenogenic meromixis state in the pdr regarding the 3rd scenario the high concentration of tds in the bottom layers of the reservoir was not recorded as we predicted no ggf outcrop in the pdr fig 6c however the vertical density gradient still exists in the water column due to the establishment of both pycnocline in warm months and halocline in cold months leading to a difference in tds concentration between the top and bottom layers of up to 1200 mg l however pycnocline is somewhat more attenuated in the 3rd scenario than in the 1st and 2nd scenarios especially in cold months leading to a semi meromixis state in the pdr the source of pdr salinization in this scenario is saline inflows from the tavakol abad tributary average tds about 2850 mg l and especially the hamzeh beigi reach average tds about 8200 mg l it is important to mention that the outlet structure is located at an elevation of 1414 m where the water quality in terms of tds is better than that in deep layers in terms of water quality the 2nd scenario is the best as it contains less saline water in top layers than others it means that the hamzeh beigi reach causes water salinization in top layers where the powerplant and other outlets are located on the other hand tds in deep layers of the reservoir is the lowest in the 3rd scenario it means that ggf dissolution mainly results in the rws in deep layers according to the results in the 1st scenario the average tds concentration in the water outlet is 1650 mg l about 10 more than that in the reservoir inflow 1500 mg l fig 6d in the 2nd scenario the average tds concentration in the water outlet of the dam is 900 mg l a decline of about 40 in comparison with that of the reservoir inflow fig 6d it should be noted that in 2nd scenario the inflow tds is different than that shown in this figure due to the removing salt reach of hamzeh beigi river similarly in the 3rd scenario where the ggf dissolution is neglected tds concentration in outflow has decreased just 4 in comparison with the reservoir inflow remarkably the tds values shown in fig 6d are the average of the 10 year tds in the hydropower intake which is simulated by the w2 model the release from the other outlets are excluded in this figure considering the given explanations for safe reservoir operation interception of inflows from hamzeh beigi reach to the pdr i e the 2nd scenario is much more important than the confinement of ggf dissolution outcropped in the reservoir i e the 3rd scenario according to the world health organization 2011 if tds concentration is greater than 1000 mg l it is not suitable for domestic and industrial uses according to fig 6d water can be used in industry and drinking sectors just by omitting the hamzeh beigi tributary i e the 2nd scenario as this figure represents average values it is clear that for some years tds was not in the allowable range but in general it could be said that this scenario is acceptable to satisfy some parts of the reservoirs purpose if tds exceeds 2000 mg l as shown for the 1st scenario fig 6d water will even be inappropriate for agricultural use ayers and westcot 1989 however we tried our best to reduce the uncertainties embedded in both derived experimental and numerical models as much as possible in this regard all ggf samples and water for experiments were directly obtained from the reservoir location also a large number of laboratory tests were conducted 32 experiments to ensure the accuracy of the results in addition we conducted these experiments for different flow rates to make the experiments conducted in the laboratory as similar as possible to those in operating conditions in the pdr however a wide range of factors influences the results of both experiments and the w2 model to show the uncertainties embedded in the calculation of ggf the selected scenario the 2nd scenario was considered in this regard we reran the w2 model by considering 25 change in the ggf dissolution rates figs s8 and s9 it found that 25 change in the ggf dissolution rate has increased and decreased tds value in deep layers although no major impacts were be detected in top layers compared to the 2nd scenario in addition the effects of 25 change in the ggf dissolution rates on the reservoir outflow are shown in fig 6d according to this graph if the ggf dissolution rate increases by 25 the tds concentration in the outlet will be 1000 mg l which is 11 more than that in the 2nd scenario on the other hand if the ggf dissolution rate decrease by 25 the average tds concentration in the outlet will decrease by 780 mg l which is 13 less than that in the 2nd scenario although our findings suggest that removing the saline hamzeh beigi reach would provide a suitable condition for impoundment of the pdr more investigations should be done to ensure the water will satisfy requirements concerning tds in the reservoir outlet with respect to the 2nd scenario selected the extreme crenogenic meromixis state in the pdr can be transitioned to a holomictic state through severe externally driven forces in this situation the saline deep layers with tds of up to 3100 mg l would salinize the surface layers although this was not happening due to the presence of a severe and permanent pycnocline in the pdr during the simulation period 2002 2012 in addition to rws chemical mixing in the reservoir can salinize the downstream river water by increasing the salinity in the dam outlet however we reran the w2 model under the conditions of the 4th scenario i e 100 year and 1000 year inflows fig s1 and text s1 with the tds value being the same as that in the fahlian river 350 mg l to simulate salinity in the reservoir our findings under the 4th scenario condition for the 100 year inflow show a high tds concentration up to 2700 mg l in top layers resulting from a partial chemical mixing with respect to tds in the pdr in cold months fig 7 and movie s2 as shown in this figure the meromixis state has been somewhat transformed to a partial holomictic state in the lake under condition of a 100 year inflow in cold months during the cold months no thermocline exists in the water column and the lake stratification is just supported by halocline as a consequence a 100 year inflow may provide the required energy to become the lake partially holomix in cold months according to fig 7 although a partial holomix condition is created by the 100 year inflow 1 5 h after the peak the reservoir tends to become stratified when the externally driven force is attenuated e g 60 h after the peak therefore this transformation from the meromixis to a partial holomictic state is reversible in the pdr in cold months on the contrary the energy entering the pdr using a 100 year inflow is not sufficient to create even a partial chemical mixing in the lake during the warm months fig 7 and movie s3 the 100 year inflow just circulates the water in mixolimnion for a limited time 200 h after the peak although it does not influence monimolimnion in the lake movie s3 in fact stratification in the pdr is supported by both thermocline and halocline in warm months in this regard more energy is needed to make the lake fully holomix in the warm months compared to that in the cold months therefore no conversion happens from the meromixis to holomictic state in the pdr under the 4th scenario condition with a 100 year inflow in warm months to check the pycnocline response to an increase in energy entering the lake from more severe floods w2 results reran under the 4th scenario condition with a 1000 year inflow fig 7 and movies s4 and s5 as with the 100 year inflow the energy required for conversion of the lake from the meromixis to holomictic state has not been provided even with a 1000 year inflow in warm months this energy has not attenuated pycnocline in warm months to remove monimolimnion by pushing the mixolimnion to the bottom of the lake 4 conclusion the parsian dam is under the study phase in the south of iran given ghachsaran geological formation in the reservoir area and a saline tributary inflow to the dam water salinization is a serious concern for reservoir impoundment due to the importance of this issue a physical pilot was conducted and regular tests were performed to estimate the gachsaran formation dissolution rate in the next step a hydrodynamic and water quality mathematical model ce qual w2 was applied to simulate the reservoir water salinization under different scenarios of dam operations under the normal conditions of river flow soluble formations and the saline tributary into the dam respectively contributed to salinization of deep and surface layers in the reservoir leading to a crenogenic meromixis state in the lake accumulated dissolved solids in deep layers induced by gachsaran formation dissolution may chemically mix the reservoir water under peak inflow events in cold months and salinize the reservoir water as well as the downstream river therefore this study s suggestion is to change the location of the dam so that the reservoir area becomes free of gachsaran geological formation if the necessary actions are not perform the same catastrophic results with respect to water salinization that happened in the gotvand dam is also possible in the case of parsian dam impoundment data availability the raw data used in this study are available via data archive

203,saline inflows and soluble geological formations outcropped in reservoirs contribute to reservoir water salinization rws we set up 32 laboratory tests to better understand rock water interaction

056 gr cm2 day salinize deep water saline inflow degrades surface waters density gradient in the water depth formed the monimolimnion and mixolimnion separated by a distinct pycnocline in the reservoir the pycnocline established in the early impoundment stage and lasted throughout the study period 2002 2012 leading to a crenogenic meromixis state in the reservoir w2 driven under the 100 year and 1000 year inflows shows salinity up to 2700 mg l in top layers from partial chemical mixing in the reservoir in cold months although no conversion of the lake from the meromixis to holomictic state was observed in warm months the findings suggest that although diversion of the saline inflow satisfies the salinity requirement for hydropower generation peak saline inflow can salinize the reservoir water and downstream river keywords reservoir salinization soluble formation chemical mixing parsian dam 1 introduction water storage in reservoirs usually increases the water residence time that can lead to negative impacts on water quality kadivar 2007 noori et al 2018 noori et al 2019a aradpour et al 2021 reservoir water salinization rws emerges when soluble geological formations outcrop within the reservoir area a relevant threat in many regions of iran naderkhanloo et al 2017 that is poorly understood a recent example of this problem is the salinization of the gotvand dam reservoir located in the southwest of iran due to the presence of halite in the reservoir location which has caused serious concerns about the operation of this dam in the future naderkhanloo et al 2017 jalali et al 2019 the parsian dam as a hydropower dam is currently under the study phase on the fahlian river that flows through gypsum type formation called gachsaran geological formation ggf in iran limestone compounds have been expanded in some parts of the reservoir and their main component is gypsum caso4 2h2o considering the high solubility of caso4 2h2o there are serious concerns regarding the rws when the parsian dam reservoir pdr is impounded baghdardokht and heidari 2005 the problem arises when the ggf dissolution rate is not fully understood on the other hand it is not recommended to use the suggested dissolution rates for different gypsum type geological formations due to the high range of uncertainty reported around the world raines and dewers 1997 klimchouk and aksem 2002 baghdardokht and heidari 2005 aljubouri and al kawaz 2007 mbogoro et al 2011 valor et al 2011 lebedev 2015 domínguez villar et al 2017 feng et al 2017 hong et al 2018 tang et al 2018 therefore attempts to understand the rock water interaction and the ggf dissolution rates in the pdr should be made through laboratory tests or field measurements saline inflow mainly from the hamzeh beigi reach a tributary of the fahlian river can also contribute to the rws once the pdr is impounded therefore the question raised here is how great the effect of ggf dissolution outcropped in the reservoir would be on the rws the next question centers around the impact of hamze beigi saline inflow and its influence on the rws since there is a hydroelectric power plant in parsian dam its activation in the operation phase makes constant oscillation at the higher levels of the reservoir which leads to increasing the vertical velocity at the top layers therefore it is important to address the effect of water oscillation on rws in top layers where the water is released for hydropower generation answering these questions can help decision makers to choose the optimum operation policy and consider the possible change in dam location to avoid the severe rws in practice to answer the questions raised above the salinity distribution should be simulated across the reservoir under different initial and boundary conditions using mathematical models in this study we explored the ggf dissolution rates in the pdr through laboratory tests using a physical model under different conditions of flow velocity that exactly take place in different depths of parsian reservoir then we connected the physical model s results of the specified dissolution rates to ce qual w2 w2 model to further explore the rws under different scenarios of reservoir operation actually the definition of dissolution rate in the w2 is not possible simply and it needs to improve the model s ability using a creative technique here we fed the ggf dissolution as a pollution source through virtual tributary inflows with low flows and high concentrations of total dissolved solids tds to the w2 model it should be noted that we selected the w2 model a well known reservoir hydrodynamic and water quality model cole and wells 2015 as it has been successfully used for water quality simulation in different reservoirs around the world kim and kim 2006 ma et al 2015 noori et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 ji et al 2017 al zubaidi and wells 2017 sadeghian et al 2018 kim et al 2019 lindenschmidt et al 2019 mi et al 2019 2020 al zubaidi and wells 2020 morales marin et al 2020 this work aims to contribute to future recommendation on dam construction to account for saline inflows in regions with soluble geological formations outcropped in the lake area to limit rws 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the parsian dam is planned to be constructed on the fahlian river in the fars province south of iran the main purpose of the dam is hydropower generation as well as some secondary goals including supplying water for agricultural industrial and domestic purposes the geographic location of the dam is 51º 40 e and 29º 45 n fig 1 and movie s1 according to a 43 year historical data the average annual precipitation air temperature and potential evaporation in the study area respectively is 700 mm 20 ºc and 1680 mm january is the wettest total precipitation 156 mm and coldest average air temperature 9 ºc month and june and july are the warmest average air temperature 31 ºc and driest months also average maximum and minimum wind speeds in the study area are 1 7 mainly occurring from march to june 2 7 and 0 6 m s respectively the direction of the dominant wind is often from north to west the climate in this area from north to south and from west to east slowly changes from cold to semi humid and humid to semi dry temperate based on ambergeh and demartonne climate classification the average groundwater level and its tds in the study area are 18 m and 930 mg l respectively maghrebi et al 2021 noori et al 2021a given an extensive decline in groundwater level in the study area during the last decades noori et al 2021a groundwater does not likely charge the pdr this dam has been designed with a clay core with a height of 115 m and a volume of 398 million cubic meters mcm at the normal operating level the area and length of the reservoir at normal water level 1445 m above sea level a s l is 5 48 km2 and 9 8 km respectively this dam will be constructed on the fahlian river which belongs to the zohreh river basin the area of the basin is 1983 km2 and the slope of the basin is about 10 4 the elevation of the basin varies from 1346 to 3718 m a s l the fahlian river is 76 km long and its slope varies between 1 2 and 2 4 the slope of the river in the reservoir is 1 the fahlian river ultimately discharges into the persian gulf the long term mean annual flow data from 1969 to 2017 of the fahlian river at the location of the dam is about 585 mcm 18 m3 s which is based on the observed flow at goosangan gauge 22 km below the dam fig 2 a in addition to the goosangan gauge 10 other temporary stations i e sw1 sw10 fig 1 have been used for tds sampling for the salinity simulation in the pdr of these sw2 is located on tavakol abad tributary sw4 sw6 are located on the hamzeh beigi reach and other stations were positioned on the fahlian river the fahlian flows with an average tds of 350 mg l upstream i e station sw1 in fig 1 and is salinized after joining two saline tributaries causing the average tds to reach up to 1420 mg l in station sw7 fig 2b illustrates the annual variation of tds in the temporary stations the tavakol abad and hamzeh beigi rivers are two main tributaries of the fahlian river with poor water quality and a high amount of salt at almost 3 km upstream from the reservoir tavakol abad with an average tds of 2860 mg l enters the main river as a permanent river the length of the tavakol abad river is about 35 km with a slope of 2 3 this reach originates from ghalat mountain with an elevation of 2300 m a s l and enters the fahlian river at an elevation of 1490 m a s l the mean annual flow in tavakol abad gauge 1999 2017 is around 0 8 m3 s or 25 2 mcm annually another tributary hamzeh beigi river with an average tds of around 8200 mg l meets the reservoir after about 1 km from the beginning of the lake the hamzeh beigi river consists of two fresh and salty tributaries the saline hamzeh beigi tributary originates from two springs chalehkhersi and klikaksofla as the hamzeh beigi river is an ungauged basin both tds and river flow were gathered from field studies the geological morphology of the study area was studied based on the stratigraphic rock units and their resistance to erosion structural and tectonic factors geological morphology units in the reservoir location include asmari bakhtiary gachsaran and razak formations asmari and bakhtiray geological formations are resistant to erosion and mostly combine from medium to thick layers of lime and conglomerates making walls of the reservoir these features cause the valleys and waterways in the region to be u shaped and very steep gachsaran and razak geological formations are mostly erodible owing to their combination of marl marl lime gypsum marl gypsum and siltstone they have been observed on both sides of the reservoir the ggf which is known as a soluble formation in the reservoir has three sections the lower section the middle section and the upper section the lower section is situated on both sides of the river with a thickness of 10 35 m it includes marl gypsum and tiny layers of gypsum with layers of marl and lime marl meaning it has a low to very low permeability the middle section includes the thick layers of gypsum as well as marl and gypsum lime layers the thickness of this section varies from 100 to 150 m with permeability from low to very low the upper section is made from gypsum marl marl and tiny layers of gypsum the thickness of this section in the reservoir varies from 100 to 150 m its permeability is from low to very low 2 2 dissolution mechanism the ggf depends on several factors including the characteristics of solvent and solute the volume and velocity of involved solvent current the level of exposure saturation concentration temperature pressure acidity and the effect of other soluble materials lasaga 1998 the dissolution of gypsum rocks outcropped in the pdr is the main source of rws dissolution is a heterogeneous reaction occurring at the boundary between two phases molecular dissociation of gypsum occurs almost instantaneously so that dissolution is solely controlled by diffusion across the boundary layer dissolution rates depend on the boundary layer conditions and concentration gradients across it lasaga 1998 proposed the general form of eq 1 for the surface dissolution rates of minerals like gypsum rocks 1 r v a d c d t k 1 c c e q n where r dissolution rate at time t mmol cm2 s v volume of circulated water cm3 c total concentration of ca2 in solution at time t mmol cm3 a area of stone sample exposed to the circulated water cm2 k effective transport coefficient mmol cm2 s ceq is the saturation concentration mmol cm3 and n is a constant many studies have shown that the gypsum dissolution rate in the regime of mixed control c 0 9ceq follows a linear equation e g james 1992 while some others have reported a quadratic equation e g raines and dewers 1997 using a rotating disk set up for c 0 6ceq and batch experiments for c 0 94ceq jeschke et al 2001 proposed n 1 2 0 2 they also revealed that n value is approximately equal to 4 5 for c 0 94ceq it has been shown that at c 0 5 c e q the value of k for gypsum rocks is in the order of 10 5 10 4 mmol cm2 s james 1992 raines and dewers 1997 although it is in the order of 10 mmol cm2 s for c 0 94ceq jeschke et al 2001 using rotating disk technique in a mixed flow steady state reactor raines and dewers 1997 suggested second order kinetics with k 3 5 10 4 mmol cm2 s 2 3 experimental setup referring to the available geological maps the estimated area of ggf in the pdr is about 0 87 km2 to estimate the dissolution rate of the ggf in the laboratory some samples were taken from four points of the pdr according to geological studies there are two types of ggf in the pdr a thick layer of gypsum gsg with an area of 0 46 km2 and a composition of marl gypsum and limestone gsmg with an area 0 41 km2 they are expected to have different dissolution mechanisms to find the dissolution mechanism several gsg and gsmg rock samples were collected in appropriate dimensions from different points of the pdr to be representative of all sections the pilot illustrated in fig 3 a and b included two separate plexiglas tanks to save time of 0 6 0 6 0 4 m dimensions and two pumps for the circulation of water therefore the dimensions of the rock samples positioned vertically in tanks were selected to be 0 6 0 6 0 1 m fig 3c in every test two rock samples of both gsg and gsmg were put in the tanks and tds values of the solution were recorded from the test onset until the tds changes were negligible i e saturation concentration of tds the water for running the tests was supplied from the fahlian river to simulate the actual condition of dissolution as much as possible the top layer of the pilot was covered by a piece of glass to prevent evaporation and change in mass four different flow velocities of 0 5 1 5 3 8 and 7 0 mm s were established in the experimental tanks by adjusting flow rates in valves these flow velocities were estimated using the depth area and inflow rates in the pdr noted that water temperature does not significantly influence the gypsum dissolution rate in the range of ambient air temperature klimchouk 1996 flatt et al 2017 therefore we ignored the impact of water temperature on the gypsum dissolution rate in our analyses the tds concentration of water in the experimental tanks was measured every six hours every test was repeated two times for each rock sample considering four different velocities four points of sampling gsg and gsmg and two repetitions of the tests 32 experiments were conducted in total based on the results the ggf dissolution rates were estimated for different flow rates according to temporal tds concentration changes 2 4 numerical simulation parsian reservoir is a long and deep reservoir in such narrow reservoirs the dominant changes in hydrodynamics and water quality usually take place in longitudinal and vertical directions therefore two dimensional laterally averaged mathematical models such as w2 can be considered as the best tool for hydrodynamics and water quality simulation cole and wells 2015 in the current study the w2 model was selected to simulate salinity in terms of tds in the pdr the w2 is a two dimensional laterally averaged water quality model that has been in use for more than 40 years the u s army corps of engineers launched the model in 1975 it can calculate velocity fields and constituents in narrow stratified water bodies such as the pdr this model is based on a finite difference approximation to the laterally averaged equations of fluid dynamics cole and wells 2015 2016 according to the available data salinity simulation in the pdr was performed for 10 years starting from 2002 the input data for the w2 model was the topographic map which gave the reservoir geometry with scale 1 2000 daily inflow at goosangan gauge for 10 years 2002 2012 daily tds hourly meteorological data temperature cloudiness wind speed wind direction and dew point specifications of the dam and related structures location and elevation of the dam intake and withdrawals noori et al 2019b hourly meteorological data was taken from the nearest synoptic weather station doroodzan station which is 50 km away from the dam to model the length of the reservoir was divided into 19 segments varying from 207 m to 1432 m fig 3d the reservoir depth was divided into 1 m layers with the maximum number of layers in the deepest area being 99 layers the parsian dam reservoir has not been impounded yet therefore there are limitations to calibrate the w2 model for salinity simulation in the reservoir paying attention to the unknown behavior of the reservoir in the future the risk of rws is evaluated in w2 model using default values suggested for the parameters of this model table 1 previous applications of w2 model under different conditions have demonstrated the model produces appropriate results by selection of default values if one accurately introduces boundary conditions and reservoir geometry to the model cole and wells 2015 however since the most of our study area in terms of topographic features is mainly open and does not provide shelter from the wind see movie s1 optimum value of 0 9 was used for the wind sheltering coefficient wsc in all segments cole and wells 2015 also we had shade in the last segments of the reservoir segments 14 to 18 due to its v shape in these segments therefore the selected shading coefficient for these shaded segments varied from 0 9 to 0 95 and for other segments segments 2 to 13 was set to be 1 no shade the light extinction coefficient exh2o was also selected to be 0 45 cole and wells 2015 because of relatively poor water quality of the inflow to the pdr based on the geological information ggf is exposed to the water body in 11 segments of the pdr fig 3d the w2 cannot simply consider ggf dissolution process therefore it requires employing an indirect method to simulate the entrance tds concentration induced by the ggf dissolution in practice tds is added to the reservoir throughout the boundaries in exposed locations to simulate ggf dissolution in w2 a virtual tributary inflow directly discharged to the reservoir was used for every boundary cell in direct contact with the ggf then based on the calculated ggf dissolution rate in that segment a virtual inflow qv with a specific tds was defined such that the entered tds load was comparative to that calculated in laboratory tests to satisfy the mass balance it is required to subtract the sum of the virtual flows from the actual inflows to the reservoir note that the exact value of tds in these tributary inflows is not important because the virtual flow would be adjusted following the ggf dissolution rate and the mass of salt which should be added to the reservoir in a time interval it is clear that for the highest tds value the lowest virtual inflow is required to simulate the ggf dissolution in the reservoir through the introduced tributary inflows however the highest measured tds value in the field is preferred here because it results in the lowest virtual inflow which requires less work to establish a mass balance in the reservoir the least changes in the natural condition and it is physically more similar to the dissolution process the flow rate of the assumptive tributary inflows was calculated based on the type of ggf outcropped in different segments proper experimental dissolution rate and contact surface area of the ggf in that segment it should be noted that during the salinity model execution the flow rate of every assumptive tributary inflow was fixed eventually the volumetric virtual flow qv of every tributary inflow is estimated as 2 q v 0 115 a s r t d s where as is the contact surface of the ggf exposed to the water body in each segment m2 and tds is the assumptive tds value for the tributary inflow supposed to be 3000 mg l close to the maximum tds in the pdr inlet because of the different salinity and hydrodynamic conditions in the depth of the reservoir different dissolution processes may be taking place in a segment as the depth varies to simulate this situation the volumetric flow of any assumptive tributary inflow was distributed in the depth of reservoir in this regard each segment was divided into different layers with a depth of 10 m and the qv value of the related tributary inflow was discharged in depth with specified elevations using an incremental linear function overall 74 tributary inflows were considered for 11 segments exposed to ggf in the pdr it should be noted that the sum of the discharges from tributary inflows to the reservoir was then subtracted from the actual reservoir inflow to keep the balance for the reservoir budget equation in fact the main novelty in this work returns to the connection between the physical model s results of the specified dissolution rates and the type of definition of such rates in the mathematical model i e w2 in the pdr 2 5 reservoir operation scenarios the average tds of river flow in the goosangan station is about 1492 mg l this high tds value is due to the high salinity of tavakol abad and especially hamzeh beigi tributaries that flow over the soluble ggf and leave a lot of salt in the water then they meet the fahlian river upstream of the pdr with average tds values of 2850 and 8200 mg l respectively fig 1 it should be noted that they have low flow rates compared to the fahlian river considering the high tds concentration in hamzeh beigi inflow it is clear that this reach plays a significant role in the rws after the reservoir impoundment the ggf dissolution outcropped in the reservoir area may further add to the problem after the reservoir is filled with water by considering the above the question raised here is how great the effect of hamze beigi river discharge would be on the rws the next question refers to ggf dissolution and its influence on the rws finally peak inflows may increase salinity in the upper layers by establishing a chemical mixing in the reservoir noori et al 2021b therefore it is also important to investigate the effects of peak inflows on rws in upper layers where water is usually withdrawn for usage in the reservoir downstream answering these questions may help decision makers to choose the necessary measures in order to mitigate rws in practice or change the reservoir location if no other solution can be found on this basis four scenarios were considered in numerical modeling as follows 1 the first scenario is based on continuing the current situation of inflows to the reservoir considering ggf dissolution based on experimental results in this scenario the numerical model is set up based on the natural rivers flow the total area of the soluble formation in the reservoir and ggf dissolution rate 2 in the second scenario the hamzeh beigi reach is removed to evaluate its effect on the rws 3 in the third scenario soluble ggf outcropped in the reservoir is confined 4 finally the effect of peak inflows on rws in the upper layers is investigated in this regard the calculated 100 year and 1000 year inflows into the reservoir were considered text s1 and fig s1 we ran the w2 model for the selected scenario among the above at the calculated peak inflows into the reservoir the 4th scenario 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of the physical model laboratory tests 3 1 1 tds equilibrium after pilot preparation gsg and gsmg samples were placed in the pilot and water circulation was started tds was recorded every six hours from the test onset until the tds variation was very low i e equilibrium state results showed that 6 8 days of water circulation was enough to reach an equilibrium state due to the number of experiments 32 tests and the two available pilots conducting the tests lasted more than four months the tds changes in the experimental tanks under different flow rates for gsg and gsmg formations are shown in fig 4 a according to fig 4a tds increased dramatically in the first 24 h after that it increased gradually and became stable after four days t 96 h to five days t 120 h the final tds for both gsg and gsmg varies between 1600 and 1700 mg l where the solution is almost saturated 3 1 2 dissolution rates considering the tds concentration changes in time eq 1 the dissolution rate of the gsg and gsmg in the pdr at four different flow rates has been estimated and presented in fig 4b note that dissolution rates in this figure are the average values of several tests which were repeated for every rock sample according to this figure the dissolution rate of formations that is being exposed to freshwater is very high at the onset of the experiment nevertheless the dissolution rate plummets dramatically after 24 h reaching zero after approximately 96 h these diagrams illustrate that the maximum ggf dissolution rate e g for flow rate 7 mm s would be 0 053 to 0 056 gr cm2 day however after 24 h it would be less than 0 01 gr cm2 day after 5 6 days the dissolution rate would be zero the dissolution rate of gsg formation at the start is higher and falls faster than that for the gsmg in the first 24 h the local increase or decrease in fig 4b between 24 and 90 h may be the result of operation conditions also tds change at the start is faster when the flow rate is higher on the other hand as the flow rate increases the stable condition will be reached sooner where the dissolution is stopped a literature review revealed that our findings were within the range of reported results for the dissolution rate of geological rocks around the world in general saturation concentration for gypsum in water was reported to be about 2000 mg l lebedev and kosorukov 2017 which is close to those calculated in fig 4a 1600 1700 mg l gypsum equilibrium concentration in the tang shemiran reservoir iran was estimated to be between 1700 and 2300 mg l baghdardokht and heidari 2005 slightly higher than that observed for gsg and gsmg however baghdardokht and heidari 2005 reported that equilibrium concentration could rise to 6300 mg l when gypsum was exposed to mgso4 and nacl in liquid condition the experiments of raines and dewers 1997 showed a gypsum dissolution rate of about 0 144 gr cm2 day in a solution with an initial tds of 1700 mg l gypsum dissolution rate in an unconfined setting in western ukraine was estimated to be 0 0063 gr cm2 day klimchouk and aksem 2002 the gypsum dissolution rate of fat formation in iraq at a flow rate of 0 0 34 m s varied between 0 195 and 0 472 gr cm2 day aljubouri and al kawaz 2007 valor et al 2011 conducted several laboratory tests to evaluate gypsum dissolution rate in the cof disueri reservoir in sicily and showed that the rate of dissolution changed from 0 094 to 0 3 gr cm2 day for a water velocity range of 0 05 0 2 m s therefore it can be concluded that a wide range for gypsum dissolution rate 0 0063 0 47 gr cm2 day has been suggested a range that covers our findings for both gsg and gsmg formations as shown in fig 4b it should be noted that the wide range suggested is due to different conditions in the conducted studies including purity percentage of gypsum rock flow velocity initial solution tds saturation concentration acidity level of exposure the volume of involved solvent experiment method temperature pressure conditions and fluid type 3 1 3 incorporation of dissolution rates in the w2 model to incorporate the dissolution rate in the w2 model maximum values of dissolution rate i e r early rates were seen in the experiments related to the lowest tds in fig 4b were used however the dissolution rates were not assumed to be the same as the tds and flow velocity variety of pdr for different depths in the upper layers of the reservoir with higher water fluctuation regarding hydropower operation and lower tds the dissolution rates of v 7 mm s were used and for the deepest layer of the reservoir where the water is almost stable and tds is the highest dissolution rates of v 0 5 mm s were used in the same way for the mid layers the dissolution rates of v 3 8 and 1 5 mm s were employed table 2 shows the different dissolution rates that were used for the calculation of virtual flow rates from the assumptive tributaries to the reservoir 3 2 the results of w2 model 3 2 1 results of sensitivity analysis to explore the w2 model sensitivity to the selected default values of some important calibration parameters see table 1 we changed the selected values of wsc to 0 5 and 1 the shading coefficient for those segments receiving shade was decreased by 25 and the exh2o value was also reduced to 0 25 our results revealed no significant change between the model simulation results i e both water temperature and tds for the selected default values and those obtained by the change in these calibration parameters see figs s2 s7 these results properly show the w2 model works well with the selected values of calibration parameters 3 2 2 results of the first to fourth scenarios to simulate water salinity by the w2 model the result of dissolution rate of gsg and gsmg has been introduced to the model as 74 assumptive tributary inflows in 11 segments segments 8 to 18 in fig 3d as shown previously the considered virtual flow rates at assumed tributary inflows using the experimental dissolution rates are shown in table 2 according to this table the area of ggf including both gsg and gsmg in direct contact with water the formation density 2300 kg m3 and the experimental ggf dissolution rates were used to annually calculate the volume and mass of dissolved formation i e tds then the flow rates of the assumptive tributary inflows were calculated using eq 2 and shown in the last column of table 2 fig 5 a illustrates the daily inflow and the changes of tds concentration in the reservoir s outflow in the 1st scenario the first two year period of tds results are for the model s warm up 2002 and 2003 it is clear that the behavior of daily inflow and the changes of tds concentration in the reservoir s outflow are mostly reversed as the inflow increases the tds concentration at the outlet declines and vice versa according to this figure the outlet tds concentration reached a peak of 3335 mg l gradually between day 3200 and 3340 when inflow 10 m3 s then it falls to 814 mg l from day 3406 3408 through the fast enhancement of the inflow to about 97 m3 s a similar trend can be seen when the inflow increases rapidly the biggest flood with peak discharge of about 102 m3 s took place on day 2254 when tds of about 722 mg l was recorded in the pdr outlet w2 results revealed a crenogenic meromictic state initiated in the pdr from its early impoundment stage lasting for the entire study period 2002 2012 this means the pdr is chemically stratified due to a continuous source of dense saline water into the deep layers of the lake resulting from ggf dissolution hutchinson 1937 aradpour et al 2020 to better show the chemical stratification in the pdr tds concentration against the water depth simulated under the 1st to 3rd scenario conditions on january 15th 2012 cold month and july 15th 2012 warm month is given in fig 6 a c according to fig 6a and b in the 1st and 2nd scenarios tds concentration increases up to 3200 mg l in the deep layers although there is a bit of difference between warm july and cold january months the density gradient in the water depth formed the monimolimnion and mixolimnion respectively in deep and top layers separated by a distinct pycnocline pycnocline established due to the vertical density gradient in water column induced by the impacts of water temperature and salinity contributes to different tds concentrations in the surface and bottom layers in the pdr we use pycnocline terminology here to address the simultaneous effects of thermocline and halocline in the pdr in detail stratification and mixing are both important hydrodynamic factors influencing the depth variation of constituents in iran s reservoirs where most of the reservoirs are classified as warm monomictic lakes noori et al 2021b regarding water temperature gradient in depth our results reveal that the reservoir annually experiences a severe stratification in most months of the year april to november and becomes homothermal from december to march fig 5b also the salinity gradient in the water column forms a halocline in the pdr even in cold months when the reservoir is homothermal leading to better water quality in terms of tds in top layers than that in the deep layers in cold months fig 6a and c therefore deep water salinized by ggf dissolution outcropped in the reservoir cannot mix with the top layers due to distinct barriers established by pycnocline and halocline respectively in warm and cold months also homothermal conditions would somewhat bring deep saline waters to the water surface through the attenuation of pycnocline and therefore enhance salinization in top layers of pdr during the cold months in general sharp pycnocline established in the early impoundment stage in the reservoir under the conditions of the 1st and 2nd scenarios lasted through the entire study period 2002 2012 leading to an extreme crenogenic meromixis state in the pdr regarding the 3rd scenario the high concentration of tds in the bottom layers of the reservoir was not recorded as we predicted no ggf outcrop in the pdr fig 6c however the vertical density gradient still exists in the water column due to the establishment of both pycnocline in warm months and halocline in cold months leading to a difference in tds concentration between the top and bottom layers of up to 1200 mg l however pycnocline is somewhat more attenuated in the 3rd scenario than in the 1st and 2nd scenarios especially in cold months leading to a semi meromixis state in the pdr the source of pdr salinization in this scenario is saline inflows from the tavakol abad tributary average tds about 2850 mg l and especially the hamzeh beigi reach average tds about 8200 mg l it is important to mention that the outlet structure is located at an elevation of 1414 m where the water quality in terms of tds is better than that in deep layers in terms of water quality the 2nd scenario is the best as it contains less saline water in top layers than others it means that the hamzeh beigi reach causes water salinization in top layers where the powerplant and other outlets are located on the other hand tds in deep layers of the reservoir is the lowest in the 3rd scenario it means that ggf dissolution mainly results in the rws in deep layers according to the results in the 1st scenario the average tds concentration in the water outlet is 1650 mg l about 10 more than that in the reservoir inflow 1500 mg l fig 6d in the 2nd scenario the average tds concentration in the water outlet of the dam is 900 mg l a decline of about 40 in comparison with that of the reservoir inflow fig 6d it should be noted that in 2nd scenario the inflow tds is different than that shown in this figure due to the removing salt reach of hamzeh beigi river similarly in the 3rd scenario where the ggf dissolution is neglected tds concentration in outflow has decreased just 4 in comparison with the reservoir inflow remarkably the tds values shown in fig 6d are the average of the 10 year tds in the hydropower intake which is simulated by the w2 model the release from the other outlets are excluded in this figure considering the given explanations for safe reservoir operation interception of inflows from hamzeh beigi reach to the pdr i e the 2nd scenario is much more important than the confinement of ggf dissolution outcropped in the reservoir i e the 3rd scenario according to the world health organization 2011 if tds concentration is greater than 1000 mg l it is not suitable for domestic and industrial uses according to fig 6d water can be used in industry and drinking sectors just by omitting the hamzeh beigi tributary i e the 2nd scenario as this figure represents average values it is clear that for some years tds was not in the allowable range but in general it could be said that this scenario is acceptable to satisfy some parts of the reservoirs purpose if tds exceeds 2000 mg l as shown for the 1st scenario fig 6d water will even be inappropriate for agricultural use ayers and westcot 1989 however we tried our best to reduce the uncertainties embedded in both derived experimental and numerical models as much as possible in this regard all ggf samples and water for experiments were directly obtained from the reservoir location also a large number of laboratory tests were conducted 32 experiments to ensure the accuracy of the results in addition we conducted these experiments for different flow rates to make the experiments conducted in the laboratory as similar as possible to those in operating conditions in the pdr however a wide range of factors influences the results of both experiments and the w2 model to show the uncertainties embedded in the calculation of ggf the selected scenario the 2nd scenario was considered in this regard we reran the w2 model by considering 25 change in the ggf dissolution rates figs s8 and s9 it found that 25 change in the ggf dissolution rate has increased and decreased tds value in deep layers although no major impacts were be detected in top layers compared to the 2nd scenario in addition the effects of 25 change in the ggf dissolution rates on the reservoir outflow are shown in fig 6d according to this graph if the ggf dissolution rate increases by 25 the tds concentration in the outlet will be 1000 mg l which is 11 more than that in the 2nd scenario on the other hand if the ggf dissolution rate decrease by 25 the average tds concentration in the outlet will decrease by 780 mg l which is 13 less than that in the 2nd scenario although our findings suggest that removing the saline hamzeh beigi reach would provide a suitable condition for impoundment of the pdr more investigations should be done to ensure the water will satisfy requirements concerning tds in the reservoir outlet with respect to the 2nd scenario selected the extreme crenogenic meromixis state in the pdr can be transitioned to a holomictic state through severe externally driven forces in this situation the saline deep layers with tds of up to 3100 mg l would salinize the surface layers although this was not happening due to the presence of a severe and permanent pycnocline in the pdr during the simulation period 2002 2012 in addition to rws chemical mixing in the reservoir can salinize the downstream river water by increasing the salinity in the dam outlet however we reran the w2 model under the conditions of the 4th scenario i e 100 year and 1000 year inflows fig s1 and text s1 with the tds value being the same as that in the fahlian river 350 mg l to simulate salinity in the reservoir our findings under the 4th scenario condition for the 100 year inflow show a high tds concentration up to 2700 mg l in top layers resulting from a partial chemical mixing with respect to tds in the pdr in cold months fig 7 and movie s2 as shown in this figure the meromixis state has been somewhat transformed to a partial holomictic state in the lake under condition of a 100 year inflow in cold months during the cold months no thermocline exists in the water column and the lake stratification is just supported by halocline as a consequence a 100 year inflow may provide the required energy to become the lake partially holomix in cold months according to fig 7 although a partial holomix condition is created by the 100 year inflow 1 5 h after the peak the reservoir tends to become stratified when the externally driven force is attenuated e g 60 h after the peak therefore this transformation from the meromixis to a partial holomictic state is reversible in the pdr in cold months on the contrary the energy entering the pdr using a 100 year inflow is not sufficient to create even a partial chemical mixing in the lake during the warm months fig 7 and movie s3 the 100 year inflow just circulates the water in mixolimnion for a limited time 200 h after the peak although it does not influence monimolimnion in the lake movie s3 in fact stratification in the pdr is supported by both thermocline and halocline in warm months in this regard more energy is needed to make the lake fully holomix in the warm months compared to that in the cold months therefore no conversion happens from the meromixis to holomictic state in the pdr under the 4th scenario condition with a 100 year inflow in warm months to check the pycnocline response to an increase in energy entering the lake from more severe floods w2 results reran under the 4th scenario condition with a 1000 year inflow fig 7 and movies s4 and s5 as with the 100 year inflow the energy required for conversion of the lake from the meromixis to holomictic state has not been provided even with a 1000 year inflow in warm months this energy has not attenuated pycnocline in warm months to remove monimolimnion by pushing the mixolimnion to the bottom of the lake 4 conclusion the parsian dam is under the study phase in the south of iran given ghachsaran geological formation in the reservoir area and a saline tributary inflow to the dam water salinization is a serious concern for reservoir impoundment due to the importance of this issue a physical pilot was conducted and regular tests were performed to estimate the gachsaran formation dissolution rate in the next step a hydrodynamic and water quality mathematical model ce qual w2 was applied to simulate the reservoir water salinization under different scenarios of dam operations under the normal conditions of river flow soluble formations and the saline tributary into the dam respectively contributed to salinization of deep and surface layers in the reservoir leading to a crenogenic meromixis state in the lake accumulated dissolved solids in deep layers induced by gachsaran formation dissolution may chemically mix the reservoir water under peak inflow events in cold months and salinize the reservoir water as well as the downstream river therefore this study s suggestion is to change the location of the dam so that the reservoir area becomes free of gachsaran geological formation if the necessary actions are not perform the same catastrophic results with respect to water salinization that happened in the gotvand dam is also possible in the case of parsian dam impoundment data availability the raw data used in this study are available via data archive

204,to better understand water and energy cycles numerous efforts to partition evapotranspiration et into evaporation e and transpiration t have been made over the recent half century one of the analytical methods is the isotopic approach the isotopic composition of et δet is a crucial parameter in the traditional isotope based et partitioning model which however has considerable uncertainty and high sensitivity here we proposed a modified t fraction in total et ft calculation using keeling plot slope k the atmospheric vapor concentration cv and the isotopic composition of atmospheric vapor δv to avoid the direct use of δet following the traditional method we used the craig gordon model for the isotopic composition of evaporation δe and chamber method for the isotopic composition of transpiration δt in our modified method the modified ft calculation method ft m can be applied at a 15 min time scale using the average values fti mp and at a 1 hz time scale for high frequency method fti the modified method was verified by both theoretical derivations and field observations fti mp was equivalent to those using the traditional isotopic method at a 15 min time scale however fti eliminated the highly sensitive parameter δet and redistributed the sensitivity of δet into three less sensitive parameters additionally fti has two main advantages first the high frequency method avoids the extrapolation of the keeling plot regression line intercept second the high frequency method can produce a 95 confidence interval of ft in a measurement cycle e g 15 min the calculated confidence interval was different from that of traditional uncertainty analysis the high frequency method might be useful when investigating evapotranspiration partitioning under short term extreme weather events and flush agricultural irrigation keywords confidence interval ecohydrology evapotranspiration partitioning high frequency keeling plot stable isotope 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et links water energy and carbon cycles on land surface jung et al 2010 consisting of evaporation e from soil sprenger et al 2016 open water gat et al 1994 and canopy intercepted water stockinger et al 2017 as well as transpiration t from plants wang et al 2012a 2014 the processes and biological controls of e and t are mostly different t is associated with physiological and biochemical reaction during plant carbon sequestration while e does not directly attribute to gross primary production and it is not directly affected by biological processes de deurwaerder et al 2020 scott et al 2006 wang et al 2018 thus accurate quantification of t fraction in total et ft is of great importance to understand water use efficiency wue from the canopy to the ecosystem scales zhou et al 2014 2016 in addition implementing et partitioning improves the understanding of the ecohydrological process and enhances our ability to quantify biological feedbacks on the hydrological cycle newman et al 2006 moreover et partitioning has been used to interpret the vegetation control on et wang et al 2014 and surface soil moisture control on et cui et al 2020 as well as to identify some inaccurate estimation of vegetation and soil parameters in global climate model gcm lawrence et al 2007 peñuelas and filella 2009 therefore et partitioning is an important research topic in ecohydrological studies the attempt to separate e and t began at least in the 1970s ritchie 1972 which initially rely on direct measurements using micro lysimeter measurements for e walker 1984 after shuttleworth and wallace 1985 first published an et partitioning model numerous analytical models including energy and water balance enwatbal model lascano et al 1987 soil water energy and transpiration sweat model daamen and simmonds 1996 two source energy balance tseb model norman et al 1995 fao dual kc model allen et al 1998 and isotope method moreira 1999 yakir and sternberg 2000 were developed to determine ft at plot or field scales meanwhile satellite based estimations made it possible to determine ft at a regional or the global scale martens et al 2017 wei et al 2017 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes are natural components of the hydrological cycle e and t have different isotopic compositions which are caused by different boundary conditions and different system state variables rothfuss et al 2021 using the isotopic compositions of various et components the isotopic approach to estimate ft has been widely used in woodlands sun et al 2014 grasslands cui et al 2020 croplands lu et al 2017 wen et al 2016 and drylands sun et al 2019 ecosystems using the isotopic composition of e δe t δt and et δet ft can be calculated theoretically based on the mass balance yakir and sternberg 2000 yakir and wang 1996 however previous studies suggested that δe δt and δet estimates are subject to large errors xiao et al 2018 resulting in either overestimation sutanto et al 2012 or underestimation wu et al 2017 of ft values compared to direct measurements and other analytical models according to model sensitivity analysis most of the errors associated with isotope derived ft estimates propagate from δet cui et al 2020 as a result accurate quantification of δet is most crucial to obtain accurate ft estimates using the isotopic approach generally δet is estimated by the keeling plot method keeling 1958 yakir and sternberg 2000 the flux gradient method lee et al 2007 and the eddy covariance isotopic flux method griffis et al 2010 however there are limitations to all these three methods variation in the isotopic composition of atmosphere vapor δv may be influenced by air masses advection rather than by et lee et al 2006 which leads to less reliable δet estimates using the keeling plot method over a long period good et al 2012 the representativeness of two heights in the flux gradient method is questionable good et al 2012 as the eddy diffusivity parameter may not be constant at the bottom of the boundary layer where vegetation interacts with turbulent airflow leading to variable vertical meteorological conditions monin and obukhov 1954 large δet uncertainty in the eddy covariance isotopic flux method is due to large uncertainty of the covariance between isotopic ratios and vertical wind speeds good et al 2012 in some case the δet may be underestimated by more than 20 for hydrogen isotope regardless of the methods adopted cui et al 2020 good et al 2012 apart from the large uncertainty of δet the frequency of ft results is typically constrained by the frequency of δet measurements although laser spectrometers have been utilized to performs continuous high frequency 1 hz measurements of δv successfully wang et al 2009 wei et al 2015 obtaining high frequency of ft is unpractical due to the lack of analytical relationships between ft and δv to date previous studies recorded the frequencies ranged from 30 min to daily for keeling plot based δet table 1 using such frequencies of δet researchers calculated ft with similar frequencies however an hourly or sub daily scale of ft results might be not adequate for ecohydrological studies focusing on rapid plant and soil responses in this paper we proposed a modified isotope based ft calculation form without using the δet parameter leading to a high frequency et partitioning method relying on the same measurements used for the traditional keeling plot intercept method this high frequency method can produce a 95 confidence interval of ft the modified ft calculation was evaluated against the traditional keeling plot intercept method using field observations at a 15 min time scale to further assess the high frequency method a sobol based global sensitivity analysis was also conducted 2 materials and methods 2 1 isotope based et partition methods 2 1 1 traditional method traditionally by measuring δe δt and δet ft can be determined as 1 f t t t e t δ e t δ e δ t δ e traditional ft calculations ft t rely on the quantification of a single δet value from one measurement cycle e g 60 min which is often calculated using the keeling plot method keeling 1958 moreira et al 1997 yakir and sternberg 2000 the keeling plot method takes the form as follows 2 δ v c b g δ b g δ e t c v δ e t where cbg and cv are the concentrations of background water vapor and directly measured atmospheric water vapor i e the mixture of background water vapor and et respectively define k cbg δbg δet for a given time period with multiple measurements of cvi and δvi the individual measurement of the vapor concentration and the isotopic composition of water vapor respectively collected at various heights during one measurement cycle the intercept δet for this measurement cycle is estimated based on the ordinary least squares ols by regression of 1 cvi and δvi zhang et al 2011 and assuming the slope k of this ols regression is constant the validity of δet and k relies on the good quality of keeling plot regression lines e g r2 0 6 δe is generally calculated using the craig gordon model craig and gordon 1965 which considers both equilibrium fractionation and kinetic fractionation and considers the diffusion of water vapor from soil surface to the mixed boundary layer 3 δ e δ s α h δ v ε 1 h ε k 1 h 1 h ε k 1000 where h is relative humidity δs is the isotopic composition of soil evaporation front approximated by the isotopic composition of soil surface 0 5 cm water ε and α are the liquid to gaseous equilibrium fractionation value and fractionation factor dimensionless respectively ε and α are related by the equation ε 1000 1 1 α α is estimated by eq 4 with soil temperature t majoube 1971 the kinetic fractionation factor εk is specified by eq 5 gat 1996 wei et al 2015 4 18 o 1 1000 1 137 10 6 t 2 0 4156 10 3 t 2 0667 1 5 ε k n 1 d i d 10 3 where n is the laminar flow between 0 5 and 1 allison et al 1985 gat 1996 it was also explained by merlivat and coantic 1975 that n 2 3 for smooth surface reynolds number 0 13 and n 0 5 for rough surface reynolds number 2 as our study site was located in an arid region we considered a smooth surface n 2 3 in our study di d is the ratio of 1h2 18o molecular diffusion coefficient of water vapor in dry air with a value of 0 9732 for 18o luz et al 2009 following the basic gas exchange principle von caemmerer and farquhar 1981 the chamber method was developed to directly measure δt as follows wang et al 2012b when assuming transpiration rate was constant during the measurement 6 δ t c m δ m c v δ v c m c v where cm and δm are the concentration and isotopic composition of the mixed vapor respectively mixed vapor here is consisted of et and the atmospheric water vapor 2 1 2 modified ft calculations in this study to provide a framework of isotope based et partitioning method without using δet we rearrange eq 2 as follows 7 δ e t δ v k c v though k is assumed to be a constant during a measurement cycle the length of the measurement cycles can be variable combining eq 1 and eq 7 yields to ft formed as 8 f t m 1 c v δ t δ e k δ v δ e δ t δ e the differences between eq 1 and 8 are eq 8 allows ft calculations at multiple time scales and eq 8 differentiates the time scale of k and other parameters two specific applications of eq 8 are shown in the section 2 1 3 and 2 1 4 2 1 3 connection between ft t and ft m at a 15 min time scale if we define δ v and 1 c v i are the mean value of the individual measurement of δvi and 1 cvi respectively the ft m equation can be shown as 9 f t i m p 1 c v δ t δ e k δ v δ e δ t δ e where fti mp represents a certain time scale e g 15 mins ft derived by inserting the mean values of the individual data points 1 cvi δvi at a same time scale k is a constant at a 15 min time scale fti mp and ft t are proved to be equal theoretically see supplement i 2 1 4 high frequency method assuming δe and δt are relatively stable at a certain time scale e g 15 mins and still using the 15 min time scale k inserting each of the individual data point 1 cvi δvi into eq 8 a potential high frequency et partitioning method fti based on ft m equation can be shown as 10 f t i 1 c v i δ t δ e k δ v i δ e δ t δ e there are no direct high frequency field measurements available to confirm the fti calculations however as the mean value of fti at a 15 min time scale f ti is fti mp details are shown in the eq s11 in supplement ii fti mp is a point estimation of fti as a result we are able to compare fti mp with ft t to verify the reliability of fti the time scale of k in the high frequency method will be further discussed in section 3 5 2 2 field evaluation 2 2 1 experimental site to test the reliability of high frequency et partitioning method field evaluation was conducted in shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university it is located in wuwei gansu province northwestern china 37 85 20 n 102 85 10 e altitude 1581 m the average annual sunshine duration is more than 3000 h and the long term average annual temperature is around 8 c the average annual evaporation of 2000 mm from free water surfaces is against with average annual precipitation of 164 mm the groundwater table is more than 30 m below the surface the soil texture in the experimental site is loamy and sandy loam with a field capacity of about 0 28 cm3 cm 3 our modified method was tested using field observations in a maize field 2 2 2 field experiment maize was sowed on 20 april in both 2017 and 2018 and harvested on 15 september in both 2017 and 2018 the total area was about 39 hectares and plant density was around 76 000 maize individuals per hectare maize is the primary crop cultivated in the surrounding area the soil temperature csi109 campbell scientific inc usa was monitored at 5 cm depth relative humidity csi215 campbell scientific inc usa was measured at a 2 meter height with 10 min intervals the sampling of water vapor and soil water were conducted from june to august in both 2017 and 2018 detailed sampling points are shown in table 2 and was measured using a water vapor liquid water isotope analyzer l2130 i picarro inc sunnyvale ca usa vapor was collected by four gas traps from 7 00 am to 7 00 pm with a two hour interval no 1 no 2 and no 3 traps were placed just above the canopy 2 m and 3 m respectively which was used to collect the atmospheric vapor at different heights no 4 gas trap was used to collect the mixed vapor to facilitate a thorough mixing of transpired vapor and atmospheric vapor a fan was installed inside the chamber which followed the design of song et al 2015 the mixed vapor was derived from dynamic plant chamber measurements fig 1 at an air sampling flow rate of 20 l min by a pump rocker r410 rocker scientific co ltd taiwan the structure of the chamber was corresponding to the design of pape et al 2009 the theoretical basis of this design mainly followed wang et al 2012b during each measurement cycle 15 mins four independent measurements were taken corresponding to no 1 no 4 sampling inlets one independent measurement lasted for 225 s the switch between two independent measurements was automatic since the analyzer recorded data every 0 9 1 s about 259 264 values for each inlet were recorded within one measurement cycle for each measurement cycle the data points from the very beginning and very end of the measurement cycle were removed no 195 to no 253 data points were preserved to avoid memory effects and transient pressure variation as a result 177 data points were used as 1 cvi δvi from no 1 no 3 traps and the average values of 59 data points were used as cm and δm from no 4 gas trap respectively the precision is 0 040 0 25 for δ18o zhao et al 2019 our vapor calibration procedure was mainly following yuan et al 2020 the dimension of the chamber was 40 60 180 cm which was made of acrylic glass with an open chamber design soil liquid water was extracted by a cryogenic vacuum extraction system li 2000 lica united technology china from soil samples and the extraction method is guided by orlowski et al 2013 the soil samples were drilled by a soil auger at the depths of 0 5 cm the δs values were measured by the same isotope analyzer l2130 i picarro inc sunnyvale ca usa in the liquid water mode δs calibration process mainly followed wu et al 2017 the isotopic compositions were referenced to the standard mean ocean water v smow the et partition observation was conducted for 12 days on each day the observations started at 7 00 am and ended at 7 00 pm conducting at 2 hour intervals overall we have 84 experimental data sets table 2 to avoid the influence of erratic transpiration flow rate in the chamber on the accuracy of δt measurements with standard deviations of cm being more than twice of the average standard deviations of cvi 13 97 ppm were removed after the quality control 73 experimental data sets remained 2 2 3 sensitivity analysis a global sensitivity analysis was conducted for both the traditional and the modified methods to determine the influence of a set of parameters had on predicted ft t and fti a sobol method based zhang et al 2015 software crystal ball oracle inc redwood city ca was used to quantify the contribution of each input parameter to the change of modeling results the parameter interactions were considered in this approach a monte carlo simulation bhat and kumar 2008 was implemented to provide random variation of each parameter within their observed ranges in the simulation each parameter was subsampled 10 000 times represented by their mean values and standard deviations across all the observations under an assumed normal distribution cui et al 2020 after analyzing the pattern of these 10 000 trials of data derived from monte carlo simulation a distribution of predicted ft t and fti was shown in this study the mean standard deviation of predicted ft t and fti was both 0 02 finally the software produced the contribution of each input parameter to the variability of predicted ft the greater the percentage the more sensitive a model output variable is to that particular parameter 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental verification of the consistency of fti mp and ft t at a 15 min time scale across all the observations the average δet δt δe δ v and c v values were 11 79 2 34 8 29 1 82 26 15 6 97 13 47 2 00 and 21 380 44 6074 63 ppm respectively table 2 after excluding 13 δt values in the quality control procedure see section 2 2 2 there were three data points with ft values outside the 0 1 range we removed these three data points and produced 70 data points overlapping between ft t and fti mp the average ft t and fti mp across all the observations were both 0 80 0 11 the ft at a 15 min time scale from the fti mp method had the same results as those using the traditional method ft t table 2 since the uncertainty analysis is about how the error propagates from cvi and δvi to ft and ft t and fti mp at a 15 min time scale were proved to be the same see eq 1 and eq 9 their uncertainty should be equal the equivalent uncertainty between ft t and fti mp was also proved directly by the error propagation principle in the supplement iii the results and the uncertainties of ft t and fti mp were in an agreement which strengthened the reliability of both fti mp and fti 3 2 the sensitivity of the traditional method and the high frequency method global sensitivity analysis was conducted for both ft t method fig 2 a and fti method fig 2b as for the traditional ft t method δet contributed 60 of the sensitivity to ft significantly larger than those of δt and δe the high sensitivity contribution of δet was also reported by a previous study cui et al 2020 generally great uncertainty of δet was revealed in the keeling plot method the flux gradient method and the eddy covariance isotopic flux method good et al 2012 which resulted in large ft uncertainty when δet was used in the traditional method based on the sensitivity analysis in our study and others cui et al 2020 while in the fti method the parameter with the largest sensitivity contribution was k 46 this result indicated that keeling plot related parameters δet and k brought most sensitivity to estimate ft at the same time using k instead of δet would diminish the sensitivity from keeling plot regression since the individual measurements cvi and δvi from fti were independent from the keeling plot the second largest sensitivity contribution in the modified method was δvi 26 a directly measured parameter instead of a simulated value in the traditional method fti method distributes the sensitivity from intercept δet into three less sensitive parameters k cvi and δvi importantly for the high frequency ft calculation the uncertainty of cvi and δvi is related to the precision of the isotope analyzer which has the potential to keep improving in the future in addition the sensitivity contributions of parameter δe and δt were reduced using the modified method 10 and 16 compared to the traditional method 18 and 22 as more parameters will diminish the sensitivity contributions of each single parameter 3 3 the advantages of the high frequency method the high frequency method has two main advantages first the high frequency method avoids an extrapolation of the keeling plot regression line to produce the intercept one of the limitations of the traditional keeling plot approach is that it requires extrapolation far beyond the measured range to the y axis to obtain the intercept δet pataki et al 2003 this extrapolation would bring an increasing uncertainty of δet rather than k details are shown in the supplement iv geometrically data points 1 cvi δvi are always distributed in a restricted area which is usually far from the intercept point of the keeling plot regression line in some cases the extrapolation distance will be 8 10 times of the observed 1 cvi range under the laboratory settings quade et al 2018 and 6 37 times in the field sun et al 2014 as such small uncertainties in the observations can result in large uncertainties in the intercept δet tans 1998 our result of high sensitivity of δet also supports this point to make matters worse to meet the assumption of constant slope and intercept of the keeling plot regression line within one measurement cycle wang et al 2013 one of the common operations is to shorten the measurement cycle to obtain data points 1 cvi δvi within a relatively short observation period good et al 2012 xiao et al 2018 however a short observation period may also shorten the 1 cvi range further increasing the extrapolation distance to the y axis in such cases it is more dependable to use parameters directly derived from the observed data points 1 cvi δvi than an extrapolated intercept second based on the high frequency method we can obtain a 95 confidence interval of ft t assuming k is constant during a measurement cycle e g 15 min the output frequency of fti could be the same as the output frequency of the in situ isotope analyzer we can not only estimate the distribution of fti but also a 95 confidence interval f t t 1 96 δ t δ e i 1 n r δ v i 2 n 1 f t t 1 96 δ t δ e i 1 n r δ v i 2 n 1 for ft t where n is the number of the observation points 1 cvi δvi and r δ v i is the residuals of the observation points 1 cvi δvi based on the ols derivation details are shown in the supplement v the examples of the fti distribution are shown in fig 3 this is a significant improvement from the traditional method since δet is used as an exact value to determine ft in the traditional method although the equation of the traditional method looks more simplified it does not reveal the relationship between ft and the individual observation point cvi and δvi when mean value point 1 c v δ v was used in the fti equation it will produce the same value as using the traditional method further indicating that the traditional method is a point estimation of ft additionally the ft m form provides an alternative dataset of cv and δv to insert into eq 8 apart from the mean point 1 c v δ v for fti mp and the individual measurement point 1 cvi δvi for fti inserting medians point into eq 8 could be another reasonable option with presence of outliers it would be better to use medians instead of the means 1 c v δ v at a measurement cycle e g 15 mins to strengthen the robustness against outliers hartwig et al 2020 3 4 the differences between ft uncertainty and ft confidence interval the ft uncertainty analysis based on the first order taylor series approximation was widely applied when assuming δe δt and δet were independent phillips and gregg 2001 11 σ f t 2 2 f t 2 δ e t σ δ e t 2 2 f t 2 δ e σ δ e 2 2 f t 2 δ t σ δ t 2 where σ f t 2 σ δ e 2 σ δ t 2 and σ δ e t 2 represent variances of ft δe δt and δet respectively using the uncertainty analysis of ft researchers could calculate the daily or monthly ft uncertainties when using sub daily or sub monthly ft results wang et al 2015 wei et al 2015 wu et al 2017 however this type of uncertainty represents the variations of ft over a fixed time scale rather than the uncertainties of an individual ft result good et al 2012 provided a framework to estimate the uncertainty of ft by accessing the uncertainty of δet δe and δt within an individual ft result however the uncertainty of δet δe and δt was calculated by error propagation of the ols rather than individual δet δe and δt results at a shorter time scale compared with the daily or monthly ft uncertainties our ft confidence interval focused on ft of the 15 minute measurement block compared with error propagation of the ols our ft confidence interval was based on the high frequency ft results which indicated ft variability rather than uncertainty though at a sub minute time scale we are still able to obtain the uncertainty of fti when assuming it is due to the uncertainty of k the average uncertainty of fti at a certain time scale is equal to that time scale of the uncertainty of ft derivation details are shown in the supplement vi 3 5 the potential applications of the high frequency method the et partitioning at a 30 min time scale can be called high frequency et partitioning so far kato et al 2004 wei et al 2015 but we consider a higher frequency of et partitioning method might be useful although the variations of e and t in a short period were both initiated by meteorological conditions su et al 2015 the response time of e and t to meteorological conditions were different scott et al 1997 this sort of difference was also detected in t among different species hatfield and prueger 2015 in addition δt has been found to vary substantially within a short period for example wang et al 2012 showed that δt varies with light condition within minutes lanning et al 2020 reported a significant δt decrease accompanied by substantial increase of vapor pressure deficit vpd within an hour as an important atmospheric constraint to water fluxes novick et al 2016 variable vpd also impacts wue independently of co2 impacts zhang et al 2019 our high frequency et partitioning method potentially offers a field deployable approach to detect the changes in plant water use strategy at a short time scale with global climate change extreme weather events occur more frequently nowadays stott 2016 short term extreme weather events attribute significant effects on the variation of temperature wind speed and precipitation sisco et al 2017 with such variations of meteorological conditions in the short period et partitioning results might be changing within a short time frame apart from some changes in natural conditions anthropogenic actions may also affect the background conditions such as irrigation in agriculture to avoid water percolation and improve the water use efficiency researchers have put forward sprinkle irrigation mantovani et al 1995 furrow irrigation wu et al 2016 and drip irrigation rodrigues et al 2013 to save water resources which leads to shorter time in an individual irrigation event compared with traditional flood irrigation in some cases an individual irrigation event can be restricted in one minute montesano et al 2018 high frequency et partitioning results may be able to provide additional water dynamic information before and right after irrigation although δt and δe are 15 min time scale parameters in our study when calculating fti we are able to obtain higher frequency of δt and δe using the chamber method wang et al 2013 when the input vapor source into the chamber is relatively stable currently k is derived by the data points 1 cvi δvi restricted at a certain time scale e g 15 mins in the keeling plot we should be able to obtain higher frequency of k using data assimilation approaches with variable moving windows this way k value estimate could be more accurate too because the length of assumed stable period could vary and variable moving windows could capture such variation combining chamber method and data assimilation approaches we might be able to obtain more accurate high frequency et partitioning results in the future 4 conclusions in this study we established a modified isotope based et partition method ft m to quantify ft at a 15 min time scale fti mp and with 1 hz high frequency time scale fti the traditional method was the same as fti mp both traditional method and modified method required good quality keeling plots the high frequency method was proved reliable by the agreement between ft t and fti mp without increasing the ft uncertainty the high frequency method distributed the sensitivity of δet into three parameters derived from the keeling plot regression which reduced the effects of the potential error of a single parameter on ft calculations the high frequency method has advantages in avoiding extrapolation of the keeling plot regression line to generate intercept and being capable of obtaining an interval estimation of ft 95 confidence interval is f t t 1 96 δ t δ e i 1 n r δ v i 2 n 1 f t t 1 96 δ t δ e i 1 n r δ v i 2 n 1 rather than a point estimation of ft different from ft uncertainty analysis our 15 min time scale ft 95 confidence interval was based on the high frequency ft

204,to better understand water and energy cycles numerous efforts to partition evapotranspiration et into evaporation e and transpiration t have been made over the recent half century one of the analytical methods is the isotopic approach the isotopic composition of et δet is a crucial parameter in the traditional isotope based et partitioning model which however has considerable uncertainty and high sensitivity here we proposed a modified t fraction in total et ft calculation using keeling plot slope k the atmospheric vapor concentration cv and the isotopic composition of atmospheric vapor δv to avoid the direct use of δet following the traditional method we used the craig gordon model for the isotopic composition of evaporation δe and chamber method for the isotopic composition of transpiration δt in our modified method the modified ft calculation method ft m can be applied at a 15 min time scale using the average values fti mp and at a 1 hz time scale for high frequency method fti the modified method was verified by both theoretical derivations and field observations fti mp was equivalent to those using the traditional isotopic method at a 15 min time scale however fti eliminated the highly sensitive parameter δet and redistributed the sensitivity of δet into three less sensitive parameters additionally fti has two main advantages first the high frequency method avoids the extrapolation of the keeling plot regression line intercept second the high frequency method can produce a 95 confidence interval of ft in a measurement cycle e g 15 min the calculated confidence interval was different from that of traditional uncertainty analysis the high frequency method might be useful when investigating evapotranspiration partitioning under short term extreme weather events and flush agricultural irrigation keywords confidence interval ecohydrology evapotranspiration partitioning high frequency keeling plot stable isotope 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et links water energy and carbon cycles on land surface jung et al 2010 consisting of evaporation e from soil sprenger et al 2016 open water gat et al 1994 and canopy intercepted water stockinger et al 2017 as well as transpiration t from plants wang et al 2012a 2014 the processes and biological controls of e and t are mostly different t is associated with physiological and biochemical reaction during plant carbon sequestration while e does not directly attribute to gross primary production and it is not directly affected by biological processes de deurwaerder et al 2020 scott et al 2006 wang et al 2018 thus accurate quantification of t fraction in total et ft is of great importance to understand water use efficiency wue from the canopy to the ecosystem scales zhou et al 2014 2016 in addition implementing et partitioning improves the understanding of the ecohydrological process and enhances our ability to quantify biological feedbacks on the hydrological cycle newman et al 2006 moreover et partitioning has been used to interpret the vegetation control on et wang et al 2014 and surface soil moisture control on et cui et al 2020 as well as to identify some inaccurate estimation of vegetation and soil parameters in global climate model gcm lawrence et al 2007 peñuelas and filella 2009 therefore et partitioning is an important research topic in ecohydrological studies the attempt to separate e and t began at least in the 1970s ritchie 1972 which initially rely on direct measurements using micro lysimeter measurements for e walker 1984 after shuttleworth and wallace 1985 first published an et partitioning model numerous analytical models including energy and water balance enwatbal model lascano et al 1987 soil water energy and transpiration sweat model daamen and simmonds 1996 two source energy balance tseb model norman et al 1995 fao dual kc model allen et al 1998 and isotope method moreira 1999 yakir and sternberg 2000 were developed to determine ft at plot or field scales meanwhile satellite based estimations made it possible to determine ft at a regional or the global scale martens et al 2017 wei et al 2017 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes are natural components of the hydrological cycle e and t have different isotopic compositions which are caused by different boundary conditions and different system state variables rothfuss et al 2021 using the isotopic compositions of various et components the isotopic approach to estimate ft has been widely used in woodlands sun et al 2014 grasslands cui et al 2020 croplands lu et al 2017 wen et al 2016 and drylands sun et al 2019 ecosystems using the isotopic composition of e δe t δt and et δet ft can be calculated theoretically based on the mass balance yakir and sternberg 2000 yakir and wang 1996 however previous studies suggested that δe δt and δet estimates are subject to large errors xiao et al 2018 resulting in either overestimation sutanto et al 2012 or underestimation wu et al 2017 of ft values compared to direct measurements and other analytical models according to model sensitivity analysis most of the errors associated with isotope derived ft estimates propagate from δet cui et al 2020 as a result accurate quantification of δet is most crucial to obtain accurate ft estimates using the isotopic approach generally δet is estimated by the keeling plot method keeling 1958 yakir and sternberg 2000 the flux gradient method lee et al 2007 and the eddy covariance isotopic flux method griffis et al 2010 however there are limitations to all these three methods variation in the isotopic composition of atmosphere vapor δv may be influenced by air masses advection rather than by et lee et al 2006 which leads to less reliable δet estimates using the keeling plot method over a long period good et al 2012 the representativeness of two heights in the flux gradient method is questionable good et al 2012 as the eddy diffusivity parameter may not be constant at the bottom of the boundary layer where vegetation interacts with turbulent airflow leading to variable vertical meteorological conditions monin and obukhov 1954 large δet uncertainty in the eddy covariance isotopic flux method is due to large uncertainty of the covariance between isotopic ratios and vertical wind speeds good et al 2012 in some case the δet may be underestimated by more than 20 for hydrogen isotope regardless of the methods adopted cui et al 2020 good et al 2012 apart from the large uncertainty of δet the frequency of ft results is typically constrained by the frequency of δet measurements although laser spectrometers have been utilized to performs continuous high frequency 1 hz measurements of δv successfully wang et al 2009 wei et al 2015 obtaining high frequency of ft is unpractical due to the lack of analytical relationships between ft and δv to date previous studies recorded the frequencies ranged from 30 min to daily for keeling plot based δet table 1 using such frequencies of δet researchers calculated ft with similar frequencies however an hourly or sub daily scale of ft results might be not adequate for ecohydrological studies focusing on rapid plant and soil responses in this paper we proposed a modified isotope based ft calculation form without using the δet parameter leading to a high frequency et partitioning method relying on the same measurements used for the traditional keeling plot intercept method this high frequency method can produce a 95 confidence interval of ft the modified ft calculation was evaluated against the traditional keeling plot intercept method using field observations at a 15 min time scale to further assess the high frequency method a sobol based global sensitivity analysis was also conducted 2 materials and methods 2 1 isotope based et partition methods 2 1 1 traditional method traditionally by measuring δe δt and δet ft can be determined as 1 f t t t e t δ e t δ e δ t δ e traditional ft calculations ft t rely on the quantification of a single δet value from one measurement cycle e g 60 min which is often calculated using the keeling plot method keeling 1958 moreira et al 1997 yakir and sternberg 2000 the keeling plot method takes the form as follows 2 δ v c b g δ b g δ e t c v δ e t where cbg and cv are the concentrations of background water vapor and directly measured atmospheric water vapor i e the mixture of background water vapor and et respectively define k cbg δbg δet for a given time period with multiple measurements of cvi and δvi the individual measurement of the vapor concentration and the isotopic composition of water vapor respectively collected at various heights during one measurement cycle the intercept δet for this measurement cycle is estimated based on the ordinary least squares ols by regression of 1 cvi and δvi zhang et al 2011 and assuming the slope k of this ols regression is constant the validity of δet and k relies on the good quality of keeling plot regression lines e g r2 0 6 δe is generally calculated using the craig gordon model craig and gordon 1965 which considers both equilibrium fractionation and kinetic fractionation and considers the diffusion of water vapor from soil surface to the mixed boundary layer 3 δ e δ s α h δ v ε 1 h ε k 1 h 1 h ε k 1000 where h is relative humidity δs is the isotopic composition of soil evaporation front approximated by the isotopic composition of soil surface 0 5 cm water ε and α are the liquid to gaseous equilibrium fractionation value and fractionation factor dimensionless respectively ε and α are related by the equation ε 1000 1 1 α α is estimated by eq 4 with soil temperature t majoube 1971 the kinetic fractionation factor εk is specified by eq 5 gat 1996 wei et al 2015 4 18 o 1 1000 1 137 10 6 t 2 0 4156 10 3 t 2 0667 1 5 ε k n 1 d i d 10 3 where n is the laminar flow between 0 5 and 1 allison et al 1985 gat 1996 it was also explained by merlivat and coantic 1975 that n 2 3 for smooth surface reynolds number 0 13 and n 0 5 for rough surface reynolds number 2 as our study site was located in an arid region we considered a smooth surface n 2 3 in our study di d is the ratio of 1h2 18o molecular diffusion coefficient of water vapor in dry air with a value of 0 9732 for 18o luz et al 2009 following the basic gas exchange principle von caemmerer and farquhar 1981 the chamber method was developed to directly measure δt as follows wang et al 2012b when assuming transpiration rate was constant during the measurement 6 δ t c m δ m c v δ v c m c v where cm and δm are the concentration and isotopic composition of the mixed vapor respectively mixed vapor here is consisted of et and the atmospheric water vapor 2 1 2 modified ft calculations in this study to provide a framework of isotope based et partitioning method without using δet we rearrange eq 2 as follows 7 δ e t δ v k c v though k is assumed to be a constant during a measurement cycle the length of the measurement cycles can be variable combining eq 1 and eq 7 yields to ft formed as 8 f t m 1 c v δ t δ e k δ v δ e δ t δ e the differences between eq 1 and 8 are eq 8 allows ft calculations at multiple time scales and eq 8 differentiates the time scale of k and other parameters two specific applications of eq 8 are shown in the section 2 1 3 and 2 1 4 2 1 3 connection between ft t and ft m at a 15 min time scale if we define δ v and 1 c v i are the mean value of the individual measurement of δvi and 1 cvi respectively the ft m equation can be shown as 9 f t i m p 1 c v δ t δ e k δ v δ e δ t δ e where fti mp represents a certain time scale e g 15 mins ft derived by inserting the mean values of the individual data points 1 cvi δvi at a same time scale k is a constant at a 15 min time scale fti mp and ft t are proved to be equal theoretically see supplement i 2 1 4 high frequency method assuming δe and δt are relatively stable at a certain time scale e g 15 mins and still using the 15 min time scale k inserting each of the individual data point 1 cvi δvi into eq 8 a potential high frequency et partitioning method fti based on ft m equation can be shown as 10 f t i 1 c v i δ t δ e k δ v i δ e δ t δ e there are no direct high frequency field measurements available to confirm the fti calculations however as the mean value of fti at a 15 min time scale f ti is fti mp details are shown in the eq s11 in supplement ii fti mp is a point estimation of fti as a result we are able to compare fti mp with ft t to verify the reliability of fti the time scale of k in the high frequency method will be further discussed in section 3 5 2 2 field evaluation 2 2 1 experimental site to test the reliability of high frequency et partitioning method field evaluation was conducted in shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university it is located in wuwei gansu province northwestern china 37 85 20 n 102 85 10 e altitude 1581 m the average annual sunshine duration is more than 3000 h and the long term average annual temperature is around 8 c the average annual evaporation of 2000 mm from free water surfaces is against with average annual precipitation of 164 mm the groundwater table is more than 30 m below the surface the soil texture in the experimental site is loamy and sandy loam with a field capacity of about 0 28 cm3 cm 3 our modified method was tested using field observations in a maize field 2 2 2 field experiment maize was sowed on 20 april in both 2017 and 2018 and harvested on 15 september in both 2017 and 2018 the total area was about 39 hectares and plant density was around 76 000 maize individuals per hectare maize is the primary crop cultivated in the surrounding area the soil temperature csi109 campbell scientific inc usa was monitored at 5 cm depth relative humidity csi215 campbell scientific inc usa was measured at a 2 meter height with 10 min intervals the sampling of water vapor and soil water were conducted from june to august in both 2017 and 2018 detailed sampling points are shown in table 2 and was measured using a water vapor liquid water isotope analyzer l2130 i picarro inc sunnyvale ca usa vapor was collected by four gas traps from 7 00 am to 7 00 pm with a two hour interval no 1 no 2 and no 3 traps were placed just above the canopy 2 m and 3 m respectively which was used to collect the atmospheric vapor at different heights no 4 gas trap was used to collect the mixed vapor to facilitate a thorough mixing of transpired vapor and atmospheric vapor a fan was installed inside the chamber which followed the design of song et al 2015 the mixed vapor was derived from dynamic plant chamber measurements fig 1 at an air sampling flow rate of 20 l min by a pump rocker r410 rocker scientific co ltd taiwan the structure of the chamber was corresponding to the design of pape et al 2009 the theoretical basis of this design mainly followed wang et al 2012b during each measurement cycle 15 mins four independent measurements were taken corresponding to no 1 no 4 sampling inlets one independent measurement lasted for 225 s the switch between two independent measurements was automatic since the analyzer recorded data every 0 9 1 s about 259 264 values for each inlet were recorded within one measurement cycle for each measurement cycle the data points from the very beginning and very end of the measurement cycle were removed no 195 to no 253 data points were preserved to avoid memory effects and transient pressure variation as a result 177 data points were used as 1 cvi δvi from no 1 no 3 traps and the average values of 59 data points were used as cm and δm from no 4 gas trap respectively the precision is 0 040 0 25 for δ18o zhao et al 2019 our vapor calibration procedure was mainly following yuan et al 2020 the dimension of the chamber was 40 60 180 cm which was made of acrylic glass with an open chamber design soil liquid water was extracted by a cryogenic vacuum extraction system li 2000 lica united technology china from soil samples and the extraction method is guided by orlowski et al 2013 the soil samples were drilled by a soil auger at the depths of 0 5 cm the δs values were measured by the same isotope analyzer l2130 i picarro inc sunnyvale ca usa in the liquid water mode δs calibration process mainly followed wu et al 2017 the isotopic compositions were referenced to the standard mean ocean water v smow the et partition observation was conducted for 12 days on each day the observations started at 7 00 am and ended at 7 00 pm conducting at 2 hour intervals overall we have 84 experimental data sets table 2 to avoid the influence of erratic transpiration flow rate in the chamber on the accuracy of δt measurements with standard deviations of cm being more than twice of the average standard deviations of cvi 13 97 ppm were removed after the quality control 73 experimental data sets remained 2 2 3 sensitivity analysis a global sensitivity analysis was conducted for both the traditional and the modified methods to determine the influence of a set of parameters had on predicted ft t and fti a sobol method based zhang et al 2015 software crystal ball oracle inc redwood city ca was used to quantify the contribution of each input parameter to the change of modeling results the parameter interactions were considered in this approach a monte carlo simulation bhat and kumar 2008 was implemented to provide random variation of each parameter within their observed ranges in the simulation each parameter was subsampled 10 000 times represented by their mean values and standard deviations across all the observations under an assumed normal distribution cui et al 2020 after analyzing the pattern of these 10 000 trials of data derived from monte carlo simulation a distribution of predicted ft t and fti was shown in this study the mean standard deviation of predicted ft t and fti was both 0 02 finally the software produced the contribution of each input parameter to the variability of predicted ft the greater the percentage the more sensitive a model output variable is to that particular parameter 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental verification of the consistency of fti mp and ft t at a 15 min time scale across all the observations the average δet δt δe δ v and c v values were 11 79 2 34 8 29 1 82 26 15 6 97 13 47 2 00 and 21 380 44 6074 63 ppm respectively table 2 after excluding 13 δt values in the quality control procedure see section 2 2 2 there were three data points with ft values outside the 0 1 range we removed these three data points and produced 70 data points overlapping between ft t and fti mp the average ft t and fti mp across all the observations were both 0 80 0 11 the ft at a 15 min time scale from the fti mp method had the same results as those using the traditional method ft t table 2 since the uncertainty analysis is about how the error propagates from cvi and δvi to ft and ft t and fti mp at a 15 min time scale were proved to be the same see eq 1 and eq 9 their uncertainty should be equal the equivalent uncertainty between ft t and fti mp was also proved directly by the error propagation principle in the supplement iii the results and the uncertainties of ft t and fti mp were in an agreement which strengthened the reliability of both fti mp and fti 3 2 the sensitivity of the traditional method and the high frequency method global sensitivity analysis was conducted for both ft t method fig 2 a and fti method fig 2b as for the traditional ft t method δet contributed 60 of the sensitivity to ft significantly larger than those of δt and δe the high sensitivity contribution of δet was also reported by a previous study cui et al 2020 generally great uncertainty of δet was revealed in the keeling plot method the flux gradient method and the eddy covariance isotopic flux method good et al 2012 which resulted in large ft uncertainty when δet was used in the traditional method based on the sensitivity analysis in our study and others cui et al 2020 while in the fti method the parameter with the largest sensitivity contribution was k 46 this result indicated that keeling plot related parameters δet and k brought most sensitivity to estimate ft at the same time using k instead of δet would diminish the sensitivity from keeling plot regression since the individual measurements cvi and δvi from fti were independent from the keeling plot the second largest sensitivity contribution in the modified method was δvi 26 a directly measured parameter instead of a simulated value in the traditional method fti method distributes the sensitivity from intercept δet into three less sensitive parameters k cvi and δvi importantly for the high frequency ft calculation the uncertainty of cvi and δvi is related to the precision of the isotope analyzer which has the potential to keep improving in the future in addition the sensitivity contributions of parameter δe and δt were reduced using the modified method 10 and 16 compared to the traditional method 18 and 22 as more parameters will diminish the sensitivity contributions of each single parameter 3 3 the advantages of the high frequency method the high frequency method has two main advantages first the high frequency method avoids an extrapolation of the keeling plot regression line to produce the intercept one of the limitations of the traditional keeling plot approach is that it requires extrapolation far beyond the measured range to the y axis to obtain the intercept δet pataki et al 2003 this extrapolation would bring an increasing uncertainty of δet rather than k details are shown in the supplement iv geometrically data points 1 cvi δvi are always distributed in a restricted area which is usually far from the intercept point of the keeling plot regression line in some cases the extrapolation distance will be 8 10 times of the observed 1 cvi range under the laboratory settings quade et al 2018 and 6 37 times in the field sun et al 2014 as such small uncertainties in the observations can result in large uncertainties in the intercept δet tans 1998 our result of high sensitivity of δet also supports this point to make matters worse to meet the assumption of constant slope and intercept of the keeling plot regression line within one measurement cycle wang et al 2013 one of the common operations is to shorten the measurement cycle to obtain data points 1 cvi δvi within a relatively short observation period good et al 2012 xiao et al 2018 however a short observation period may also shorten the 1 cvi range further increasing the extrapolation distance to the y axis in such cases it is more dependable to use parameters directly derived from the observed data points 1 cvi δvi than an extrapolated intercept second based on the high frequency method we can obtain a 95 confidence interval of ft t assuming k is constant during a measurement cycle e g 15 min the output frequency of fti could be the same as the output frequency of the in situ isotope analyzer we can not only estimate the distribution of fti but also a 95 confidence interval f t t 1 96 δ t δ e i 1 n r δ v i 2 n 1 f t t 1 96 δ t δ e i 1 n r δ v i 2 n 1 for ft t where n is the number of the observation points 1 cvi δvi and r δ v i is the residuals of the observation points 1 cvi δvi based on the ols derivation details are shown in the supplement v the examples of the fti distribution are shown in fig 3 this is a significant improvement from the traditional method since δet is used as an exact value to determine ft in the traditional method although the equation of the traditional method looks more simplified it does not reveal the relationship between ft and the individual observation point cvi and δvi when mean value point 1 c v δ v was used in the fti equation it will produce the same value as using the traditional method further indicating that the traditional method is a point estimation of ft additionally the ft m form provides an alternative dataset of cv and δv to insert into eq 8 apart from the mean point 1 c v δ v for fti mp and the individual measurement point 1 cvi δvi for fti inserting medians point into eq 8 could be another reasonable option with presence of outliers it would be better to use medians instead of the means 1 c v δ v at a measurement cycle e g 15 mins to strengthen the robustness against outliers hartwig et al 2020 3 4 the differences between ft uncertainty and ft confidence interval the ft uncertainty analysis based on the first order taylor series approximation was widely applied when assuming δe δt and δet were independent phillips and gregg 2001 11 σ f t 2 2 f t 2 δ e t σ δ e t 2 2 f t 2 δ e σ δ e 2 2 f t 2 δ t σ δ t 2 where σ f t 2 σ δ e 2 σ δ t 2 and σ δ e t 2 represent variances of ft δe δt and δet respectively using the uncertainty analysis of ft researchers could calculate the daily or monthly ft uncertainties when using sub daily or sub monthly ft results wang et al 2015 wei et al 2015 wu et al 2017 however this type of uncertainty represents the variations of ft over a fixed time scale rather than the uncertainties of an individual ft result good et al 2012 provided a framework to estimate the uncertainty of ft by accessing the uncertainty of δet δe and δt within an individual ft result however the uncertainty of δet δe and δt was calculated by error propagation of the ols rather than individual δet δe and δt results at a shorter time scale compared with the daily or monthly ft uncertainties our ft confidence interval focused on ft of the 15 minute measurement block compared with error propagation of the ols our ft confidence interval was based on the high frequency ft results which indicated ft variability rather than uncertainty though at a sub minute time scale we are still able to obtain the uncertainty of fti when assuming it is due to the uncertainty of k the average uncertainty of fti at a certain time scale is equal to that time scale of the uncertainty of ft derivation details are shown in the supplement vi 3 5 the potential applications of the high frequency method the et partitioning at a 30 min time scale can be called high frequency et partitioning so far kato et al 2004 wei et al 2015 but we consider a higher frequency of et partitioning method might be useful although the variations of e and t in a short period were both initiated by meteorological conditions su et al 2015 the response time of e and t to meteorological conditions were different scott et al 1997 this sort of difference was also detected in t among different species hatfield and prueger 2015 in addition δt has been found to vary substantially within a short period for example wang et al 2012 showed that δt varies with light condition within minutes lanning et al 2020 reported a significant δt decrease accompanied by substantial increase of vapor pressure deficit vpd within an hour as an important atmospheric constraint to water fluxes novick et al 2016 variable vpd also impacts wue independently of co2 impacts zhang et al 2019 our high frequency et partitioning method potentially offers a field deployable approach to detect the changes in plant water use strategy at a short time scale with global climate change extreme weather events occur more frequently nowadays stott 2016 short term extreme weather events attribute significant effects on the variation of temperature wind speed and precipitation sisco et al 2017 with such variations of meteorological conditions in the short period et partitioning results might be changing within a short time frame apart from some changes in natural conditions anthropogenic actions may also affect the background conditions such as irrigation in agriculture to avoid water percolation and improve the water use efficiency researchers have put forward sprinkle irrigation mantovani et al 1995 furrow irrigation wu et al 2016 and drip irrigation rodrigues et al 2013 to save water resources which leads to shorter time in an individual irrigation event compared with traditional flood irrigation in some cases an individual irrigation event can be restricted in one minute montesano et al 2018 high frequency et partitioning results may be able to provide additional water dynamic information before and right after irrigation although δt and δe are 15 min time scale parameters in our study when calculating fti we are able to obtain higher frequency of δt and δe using the chamber method wang et al 2013 when the input vapor source into the chamber is relatively stable currently k is derived by the data points 1 cvi δvi restricted at a certain time scale e g 15 mins in the keeling plot we should be able to obtain higher frequency of k using data assimilation approaches with variable moving windows this way k value estimate could be more accurate too because the length of assumed stable period could vary and variable moving windows could capture such variation combining chamber method and data assimilation approaches we might be able to obtain more accurate high frequency et partitioning results in the future 4 conclusions in this study we established a modified isotope based et partition method ft m to quantify ft at a 15 min time scale fti mp and with 1 hz high frequency time scale fti the traditional method was the same as fti mp both traditional method and modified method required good quality keeling plots the high frequency method was proved reliable by the agreement between ft t and fti mp without increasing the ft uncertainty the high frequency method distributed the sensitivity of δet into three parameters derived from the keeling plot regression which reduced the effects of the potential error of a single parameter on ft calculations the high frequency method has advantages in avoiding extrapolation of the keeling plot regression line to generate intercept and being capable of obtaining an interval estimation of ft 95 confidence interval is f t t 1 96 δ t δ e i 1 n r δ v i 2 n 1 f t t 1 96 δ t δ e i 1 n r δ v i 2 n 1 rather than a point estimation of ft different from ft uncertainty analysis our 15 min time scale ft 95 confidence interval was based on the high frequency ft results the high frequency method might be useful when partitioning evapotranspiration under short term extreme weather events and flush agricultural irrigation conditions code and data availability
