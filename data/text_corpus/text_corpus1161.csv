5805,in the present study a cost function is developed for the robust training of recurrent neural network models using groundwater level data that are corrupted by outliers and noise the optimal cost function in this study utilizes least trimmed squares lts with asymmetric weighting aw and the whittaker smoother ws which have different outlier or noise rejecting mechanisms the developed cost function is benchmarked with other cost functions in the training of a long short term memory lstm model using data from the gangjin seongjeon and pohang gibuk monitoring wells in south korea the results of which are then compared to the validation data based on comparisons of the validation results it is confirmed that the optimal cost function is the most successful in rejecting the influence of outliers during the training process when applied to data from the gangjin seongjeon monitoring well it is also demonstrated that the estimation results based on this optimal cost function can effectively identify outliers in groundwater level data for the pohang gibuk monitoring well data the optimal cost function without aw exhibits superior regularizing performance by generating the lowest mean estimation error using this cost function the influence of persistent noise is mostly canceled out and the estimation results reflect the regular changes in the water table level of a shallow aquifer over time the developed robust cost function can potentially be employed in many hydrogeological applications such as the monitoring of groundwater resources the prediction and analysis of water table levels and the identification of changes in aquifer processes the cost function is also expected to be useful for many other field applications in which the data are susceptible to external influences keywords groundwater level robust training outliers least trimmed squares whittaker smoother asymmetric weighting 1 introduction a groundwater level time series is the result of a variety of independent time limited processes with natural and non natural origins for this reason interpretations of changes in groundwater level based on known hydrological stresses can provide information on the status of an aquifer when groundwater level data are not significantly corrupted by outliers important information on hydrological processes in the subsurface can be obtained based on calibration using a process based model park et al 2011 park 2012 zhou et al 2014 jeong and park 2017 jeong et al 2017c data driven models that are trained using groundwater level data can also provide estimations of the reference groundwater level zhang et al 2018 jeong and park 2019 that can be compared to the actual level to identify sudden changes in hydraulic processes however minor processes can often significantly affect the groundwater level and create outliers in a time series helsel and hirsch 2002 jeong et al 2017b in the presence of outliers and significant noise groundwater level time series can be difficult to interpret thus restricting the ability to acquire meaningful information for an aquifer by definition noise and outliers are data points that have a low probability of being consistent with the major processes underlying the rest of the data hawkins 1980 and are caused by 1 incorrect data measurement transmission or transcription and or 2 local deviations from the main data processes jeong et al 2017b incorporating noise and outliers may interfere with hydrogeological analysis thus leading to inaccurate interpretations helsel and hirsch 2002 yi and lee 2004 therefore a number of studies have been conducted to limit the influence of noise and outliers during analysis gibbons et al 2009 helsel and hirsch 2002 jeong et al 2017a however outliers may occasionally contain important information regarding fluctuations in the water table level and thus must be separated and analyzed in detail to better understand a hydrogeological system for example sudden physical or chemical changes in groundwater may reflect the adverse effects of situations such as excessive pumping of water from an aquifer or the introduction of contaminants in rare cases these changes may result from variation in the stress field acting on an aquifer which can be used as a potential indicator of an imminent earthquake koizumi et al 2004 a model that can mimic major data generation processes is thus required to denoise data and identify outliers generally a hydrogeological process can be represented by either process based or data driven models process based models are based on partial differential equations in this type of modeling the model parameters relevant to the subsurface media need to be obtained and the model has to be calibrated against observations so that it can provide accurate estimations in contrast data driven models do not require a priori information coulibaly et al 2001 shen 2018 jeong and park 2019 such as model parameters that represent hydraulic properties and boundary conditions therefore a data driven model can be conveniently trained from observed data with less effort compared to process based models in this sense a data driven model can be more efficient especially when the groundwater levels of a large number of observation wells need to be estimated however asymmetrical and heteroscedastic noise and outliers which frequently appear in groundwater data are an obstacle when training conventional data driven models and making estimations based on the trained model in particular conventional data driven models that use a least squares cost function generally do not produce robust estimations in the presence of noise and outliers as an alternative a limited number of cost functions that use least trimmed squares lts algorithms rousseeuw and hubert 2011 have been proposed rusiecki 2007 estimations based on an lts algorithm are robust to the influence of outlying data points by considering the leverage of the data points in the cost function approach to robust time series analysis the conventional least squares function is conveniently substituted by a robust cost function without the requirement of preprocessing for denoising or outlier exclusion purposes in past research the lts approach has been adopted to train simple artificial neural network ann models the performances of which have been verified based on synthetic and real data jeng et al 2011 chang et al 2012 lin et al 2015 however this robust algorithm has not been fully implemented for more complicated natural data such as daily observations of groundwater levels which is the main interest of this study and other cost function approaches beyond the lts method have not yet been explored in this study the lts and whittaker smoother ws eilers 2003 algorithms are considered for use in the cost function of an advanced non linear time series model the present study is believed to be the first to combine multiple robust techniques in the formulation of a cost function for a data driven model that eliminates the effects of noise and outliers during the training process for this purpose the following cost functions are constructed and compared lts lts with asymmetric weighting aw mean squared error mse with the ws and a combination of the ws and lts with aw of these functions the one based on the ws and ltw with aw is proposed as the optimal cost function of this study the developed cost functions are employed in a long short term memory lstm model hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 which is subsequently used for groundwater level estimation two different groundwater data sources characterized by persistent noise and a large number of outliers from two monitoring wells in the national groundwater monitoring system in south korea are used and the robustness of the training process is compared for the different cost functions using this process the superiority of the optimal cost function can thus be demonstrated 2 model development 2 1 long short term memory lstm model the temporal variation in the level of the water table is estimated using the lstm model the lstm model has been employed in recent studies for hydrological estimation applications zhang et al 2018 shen 2018 kratzert et al 2018 jeong and park 2019 bowes et al 2019 with mse or root mean squared error rmse as the cost function and ridge regression drop out or early stopping methods used as a regularizer the lstm model is a type of deep neural network designed to avoid the vanishing and exploding gradient problems hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 that conventional recurrent neural networks are susceptible to by maintaining a portion of a special type of memory cell states throughout a sequence the information transferred throughout a sequence and new information are designed to be regulated by input output and forget gates which are connected to each other to form a directed graph thus historical dependencies between explanatory and response variables are efficiently handled hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 lipton et al 2015 wielgosz et al 2017 a large number of studies have described the mathematical foundation of this model e g hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 so the details will not be reproduced in the present study 2 2 cost function and l1 l2 regularization a common type of cost function in many ann models for time series estimation is mse while mse is commonly used as a cost function for linear estimators for mathematical convenience cost functions that consist solely of mse are often affected by overfitting in highly non linear models such as ann models least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso or l1 and ridge l2 regression are conventional methods used to avoid overfitting by penalizing large coefficients in the present study the cost function combining mse and l1 and l2 regularization is expressed as follows 1 j ω 1 n n 1 n y n o y e t n ω 2 λ 1 k 1 k ω k λ 2 k 1 k ω k 2 in this equation the first term on the right hand side rhs computes the mse between the observed y n o and model estimation of the groundwater level y e t n ω and n is the number of observations the second and third terms on the rhs are the l1 and l2 regularization terms respectively where λ 1 and λ 2 are parameters related to l1 and l2 regularization respectively k is the number of model weights and ω k is the model weight although regularization is designed to produce stable estimations it is not effective for time series data with a large number of outliers this will be discussed further in section 3 2 3 whittaker smoother ws loss function in most corrupted groundwater level time series data outliers generally represent sudden changes in the groundwater level compared to adjacent data points and the data set as a whole the influence of outliers can thus be minimized by penalizing large rates of change in the estimated groundwater level for this purpose the ws can be employed in the cost function the ws is often adopted to estimate baselines using one dimensional data eilers and boelens 2005 he et al 2014 and image processing cobas et al 2006 the mathematical formulation for the ws cost function is as follows 2 j ω 1 n n 1 n y n o y e t n ω 2 λ w n 2 n 1 δ 2 y n e ω 2 where the second term on the rhs is the smoothness term δ 2 y n e y n 1 e 2 y n e y n 1 e similar to the finite difference approximation of the second derivative of the estimation y n e ω is an abbreviation of y e t n ω and λ w is the smoother parameter through this loss function the mse and the summation of the second derivatives at each time step can be minimized simultaneously which results in smooth estimations by regulating the weights of the estimator more smoothed estimations are generated as λ w increases and vice versa the ws has rarely if ever been employed in the cost function of a deep neural network 2 4 least trimmed squares lts loss function lts is a non parametric algorithm that is known to be one of the most robust estimators because of its high breakdown point of 50 rousseeuw and croux 1992 and methodological simplicity the lts algorithm is often adopted for outlier detection rousseeuw and hubert 2011 the lts algorithm has also been incorporated into the cost function of ann models to produce robust estimations rusiecki 2007 lin et al 2015 the mathematical formulation for an lts cost function is given by 3 j ω 1 m n 1 n α s t n ω y n o y e t n ω 2 where m n 1 n α s t n ω and ω is a vector with weights and biases as elements the parameter α s t n ω which is multiplied by the squared difference between the observation and estimation is given by 4 α s t n ω 1 y n o y e t n ω 0 y n o y e t n ω where m e d i a n and y 1 n o y e t 1 n ω using the lts cost function eqs 3 and 4 data with an estimation error greater than the median error is assigned a weight of zero and the influence of outliers is limited by this exclusion process eq 4 based on this outlier exclusion process the resulting model estimation is based on non outlying data 2 5 lts loss function with asymmetric weighting aw the influence of outliers can be minimized using the lts cost function however the remaining non outlying data used for the estimation may have an unbiased distribution from the estimated trend i e a skewed distribution in terms of bias distribution estimations based on the above lts cost function may not be satisfactory to address this limitation aw can be considered instead of symmetric weighting for positive and negative errors eq 4 aw is formulated using the following equations 5 j ω 1 m n 1 n α a t n ω y n o y e t n ω 2 6 α a t n ω β 1 y n o y e t n ω a n d y n o y e t n ω 0 β 2 y n o y e t n ω a n d y n o y e t n ω 0 0 y n o y e t n ω where m n 1 n α a t n ω and β 1 and β 2 are hyperparameters determined by the trial and error method by including the aw scheme in the lts cost function eqs 5 and 6 a biased estimation for non outlying data can be generated with the bias being either positive or negative 2 6 comprehensive regularization the optimal cost function of this study the lts method with or without aw demonstrates robustness in the data selection or exclusion process while the ws enables the robust estimation of the model by regulating the weights because the outlier rejection mechanisms of the two approaches differ they can be jointly adopted to increase the robustness of the estimator therefore this study assumes that the regularization methods discussed previously can be employed together to produce a more robust cost function that improves performance for this purpose the following equation includes all of the above regularization methods 7 j ω 1 m n 1 n α t n ω y n o y e t n ω 2 λ w n 2 n 1 δ 2 y n e ω 2 where either eq 4 α s or eq 6 α a can be used for α depending on the data and the estimation result because of the greater robustness the cost function of eq 7 is expected to be more effective than any of the listed methods alone when estimating groundwater level changes based on training using time series data with a large number of outliers and biased non outlying data thus in section 3 the performance of the individual cost functions will be compared with that of the optimal cost function eq 7 using a validation data set 3 results and discussion 3 1 applying the cost functions to data with outliers the gangjin seongjeon monitoring well field groundwater data from the gangjin seongjeon monitoring well fig 1 gims 2019 and climate data kma 2019 from 2010 to 2016 were used to validate the cost functions discussed in section 2 the estimations from time series models employing these cost functions lts eqs 3 and 4 lts with aw eqs 5 and 6 the ws eq 2 and the ws and lts with aw eq 7 were compared with the results of the conventional lstm approach with and without l1 regularization eq 1 the monitoring well is located in gangjin gun jeollanam do in southwestern korea the mean depth to the water table in the observation well is 2 6 m below the surface from top to bottom the aquifer is composed of sandy loam size unconsolidated sediment and highly fractured crystalline rock granitic gneiss the observation well penetrates up to 67 m below the surface and well screens are installed at intervals of 44 48 52 56 and 60 64 m below the surface the area is mostly agricultural land with two small streams geumgangcheon and weolsungcheon the elevation of the monitoring well is 54 9 m above msl the average annual precipitation in the area during the seven year study period 2010 2016 was 1467 7 mm year and approximately half 55 of the precipitation was concentrated during the wet season from june to september the average monthly precipitation and temperature during the study period is summarized in table 1 based on the precipitation patterns it would be expected that the groundwater level would be highest during the wet season however the mean groundwater level was actually lowest during august 52 m compared to the annual average groundwater level of 52 4 m as shown in fig 2 the groundwater level during the rainy season especially in august exhibited sharp falls given the shallow groundwater level in this area these rapid drops are suspected to be the result of preemptive groundwater pumping to prevent flash flooding therefore the hydrograph suggests that the observations were affected considerably by anthropogenic influences as in this case if data are significantly corrupted by outliers training a data driven model to precisely estimate future changes in groundwater levels becomes difficult some state of the art methods exclude outliers from time series data e g leys et al 2013 after which a data driven model can be trained on the preprocessed data however the discussion surrounding data preprocessing is beyond the scope of this study though it is important to note that the preprocessing of groundwater level data is inherently subjective which can create additional complexity and uncertainty in the subsequent analysis rather the objective of this study was to use corrupted data to estimate future groundwater levels so data preprocessing was not considered here the cost functions defined in section 2 were applied sequentially to the groundwater level data from the gangjin seongjeon monitoring well to verify their characteristics the recurrent neural network was structured to have 24 hidden states that were consistently used as lstm cells with the output cell states processed by the fully connected network which included six hidden layers with 24 nodes to obtain the groundwater level a grid search method was used to determine the remaining hyperparameters a scaled exponential linear unit selu klambauer et al 2017 was also employed as the activation function for the fully connected network the average temperature and precipitation rate of the current day and the nine preceding days i e a total of 10 days were used as input for the network during the training stage additionally the observed groundwater levels for the past 10 days were used as input for the network to produce autoregressive estimations during the estimation stage the observed groundwater levels for autoregressive estimation were fed back into the network by the previously estimated levels for the 10 preceding days this feedback procedure was used to validate the performance of the cost functions in this study we focused solely on whether a trained lstm model based on a cost function can mimic the groundwater level generating process the first 70 jan 2010 to nov 2014 and the final 30 dec 2014 to dec 2016 of the data were used to train and test the data driven model respectively in predictive groundwater level estimation an additional forecasting step based on the trained and validated model through the training and testing processes should be performed at this stage the weather and groundwater level data observed in the past are used as input to the model fig 2 presents the estimation results for the lstm time series model with the various cost functions pure mse fig 2a mse with l1 regularization fig 2b lts fig 2c lts with aw fig 2d mse with the ws fig 2e and a combination of lts aw and the ws fig 2f note the superior predictive performance of eq 7 presented in fig 2f which will be discussed later fig 2a displays the reference results when mse with no regularizing term hereafter j mse was used as the cost function it can be observed in this figure that most of the data were honored during the training period when j mse was used as the cost function in all cases training was terminated when either 10 000 iterations or a tolerance of 0 1 for 0 to 1 normalized groundwater levels were reached as expected the trained lstm model produced dramatically fluctuating groundwater level estimations that did not accurately represent the actual groundwater levels similar results were observed when mse with l1 regularization hereafter j l 1 was employed as the cost function as can be seen in fig 2b the training estimations based on j l 1 were very similar to those using j mse fig 2a with dramatic fluctuations in groundwater level this suggests that l1 regularization alone is ineffective in handling the outliers in the gangjin seongjeon dataset in which a large number of data points significantly deviated from the main data pattern the overfitting problem exhibited by the gangjin seongjeon dataset can be reduced to some extent by using a combination of conventional regularization methods such as l1 regularization dropout and early stopping which is outside the scope of the present study when the lts cost function hereafter j lts was employed fig 2c the influence of the outliers during the wet periods was significantly lower the reduced influence of the outliers can be attributed to the data selection process employed in the lts method with j lts the top 50 of the data when arranged in ascending order of estimation error were used to compute the cost function and optimize the weights of the lstm network while the remaining data which had larger estimation errors were ignored the training results suggest that data points that negatively deviated from the general trend during the wet periods were considered to be the result of relatively minor processes and training that was conditioned on this data was suppressed using the lts method however the influence of outliers was not fully eliminated using the lts method alone although the estimations during the testing period were greatly improved compared to both mse approaches fig 2a and 2b the predicted groundwater levels were consistently lower than the actual levels fig 2c to resolve this consistent underestimation the lts with aw cost function hereafter j ltsaw was employed fig 2d as with j lts the data were arranged in ascending order of estimation error and the top 50 used to compute the cost and optimize the model weights in addition to this estimation errors that were larger than the actual value i e positive errors were multiplied by 1 to penalize underestimations while the estimation errors that were smaller than the actual values were multiplied by 1 7 as determined using the trial and error method using j ltsaw the underestimation during the testing period was clearly improved as illustrated by comparing fig 2c j lts and fig 2d j ltsaw however the estimation during the training period was still affected by outliers negatively deviating data during the wet periods even with aw although the model was trained robustly when j lts and j ltsaw were employed during the training period actual water table data were used as input for the trained lstm model and the estimated water table levels fluctuated when the outlying data were fed into the trained model however during the testing period all of the water table level data fed into the trained model were previously estimated thus there were no abnormal fluctuations to completely eliminate the influence of outliers the mse with the ws cost function hereafter j ws was adopted fig 2e the ws produces robust estimation by regulating the lstm weights which is a different process from that used in the lts method by regulating the weights the influence of the outliers fed into the trained model can be canceled out a small number 0 0001 was used as the multiplier for the ws term to avoid excessive smoothing when the number was empirically determined in fig 2e abrupt changes in the estimated groundwater levels during the wet periods were successfully eliminated by suppressing the magnitude of the second derivatives however slight and consistent underestimation was observed during the training period and this underestimation became more severe during the testing period as with the use of j lts fig 2c this underestimation can be attributed to the smoothing term suppressing the magnitude of the second derivatives of the estimates with respect to time thus many of the estimated groundwater levels could not reach the actual peak levels especially for positive values these observations indicate that the ws is effective when estimating baseline fluctuations but has limitations in predicting peak levels the overall result for j ws suggests that an adjustment for the consistent underestimation is necessary as was the case for j lts based on all previous observations estimation was performed using the cost function that included both the ws and lts with aw hereafter j ltsaw w s as stated earlier the joint adoption of the lts with or without aw and ws is expected to increase the robustness of the estimator because their outlier rejection mechanisms differ fig 2f presents the results for j ltsaw w s it can be observed that the estimates provide the best fit for the major groundwater level patterns when compared to the other cost functions fig 2a 2f for j ltsaw w s the data were arranged in ascending order of estimation error and the top 50 used to compute the cost with positive errors multiplied by 1 and negative errors multiplied by 2 for asymmetrical penalization the same ws multiplier as that used for j ws 0 0001 was employed from the estimation results in fig 2f both the training and testing periods exhibited a reasonable fit to the actual groundwater level data and no substantial influence from outliers during the wet periods was observed this observation suggests that the optimal cost function which combines lts with aw and the ws performs reasonably well when making predictive estimations based on severely corrupted groundwater level data from the gangjin seongjeon monitoring well the performance of the optimal cost function also indicates that outliers can be effectively identified for a more comparative and quantitative evaluation of the cost functions developed in the present study outliers were identified and eliminated from the main data set using j ltsaw w s the rmse was then obtained for the estimations for each cost function and compared fig 3 presents the identified outliers with actual data points negatively deviating by more than an empirically determined value of 0 25 m from the corresponding estimated groundwater level considered to be outliers however a few data points appearing to be outliers that had been flagged as outliers using the cut off value were observed these outliers could be eliminated manually because the number of outliers had been significantly reduced fig 3 in this outlier identification and elimination process the entire data set was used as training data and the same hyperparameters as those used for j ltsaw w s fig 2f were used as shown in fig 3 the majority of the data points that were likely to have been influenced by anthropogenic stress were successfully identified as outliers red crosses and were eliminated from the trimmed data using the trimmed data the rmse of each cost function was obtained for the estimated groundwater levels for the testing period the computed rmses were 0 760 0 616 0 167 0 099 0 150 and 0 097 m for j mse j l 1 j lts j ltsaw j ws and j ltsaw w s respectively these results are generally in accordance with the qualitative comparisons presented in fig 2a 2f as expected j ltsaw w s exhibited the best performance followed by j ltsaw the larger rmses for j lts and j ws were due to their underestimations as shown in fig 2c and 2e based on these qualitative and quantitative analyses the optimal cost function eq 7 was confirmed to be the most effective of the tested functions in terms of excluding the influence of outliers when training the lstm time series model thus changes in groundwater resources can be monitored more efficiently using the combined cost function j ltsaw w s even with the use of corrupted data and without data preprocessing 3 2 applying the cost functions to noisy data the pohang gibuk monitoring well water table level data from the pohang gibuk monitoring well fig 1 gims 2019 and climate data kma 2019 for the 2005 2013 period were used to validate the cost functions in the validation the same process used in the gangjin seongjeon case was adopted to illustrate the robust training capability of the optimal cost function the monitoring well is located in pohang gyeongsangbuk do in southeastern korea the mean depth to the water table in the observation well is 4 8 m below the surface the well was drilled to 70 m below the surface and screens were installed at intervals of 50 54 58 62 and 66 70 m below the surface the aquifer consists of fractured shale and the unsaturated zone is mostly composed of sand and gravel the monitoring well is located approximately 150 m away from a rill gigyecheon and the elevation is 121 1 m above msl the average annual precipitation of the study area during the nine year study period 2005 for the 2005 2013 period 2013 was 1118 6 mm year and more than a half 63 2 of the precipitation occurred during the wet season from june to september the average monthly precipitation and temperature during the study period is summarized in table 1 in fig 4 the water table level shows seasonal variation with a one year period with a high water table in the wet season and a low water table in the other periods following the pattern of precipitation however the water table level data are strongly corrupted by persistent noise the source of which has not been identified if a data set includes significant persistent noise the training of a data driven model generally leads to overfitting and the estimation of future changes in the groundwater level using the model becomes highly unstable to ensure the robust training of a data driven model using noisy groundwater level data the developed cost functions were applied and the results were compared a network structure identical to that used for the gangjin seongjeon data set was adopted to estimate the groundwater level and the same structure was also used for the explanatory data additionally during the estimation stage the observed groundwater levels for autoregressive estimation were fed back into the network by previously estimated levels for the 10 preceding days the first 55 6 jan 2005 to dec 2009 and the last 44 4 jan 2010 to dec 2013 of the data were used to train and test the data driven model respectively fig 4 presents the estimation results for the lstm model using pure mse fig 4a mse with l1 regularization fig 4b lts fig 4c mse with the ws fig 4d and a combination of lts and the ws fig 4e as cost functions fig 4a acts as a reference in which j mse is used as the cost function according to fig 4a most of the data were honored during the training period with the trained lstm model producing wildly fluctuating water table level estimations that did not accurately represent the actual water table fluctuations a similar result was observed when j l 1 was used as the cost function as can be seen in fig 4b the training estimations were similar to those presented in fig 4a this suggests that l1 regularization was ineffective in resolving the overfitting problem caused by persistent noise in the data from the pohang gibuk monitoring well for the lts cost function j lts fig 4c fewer data points were honored during the training period compared to either j mse or j l 1 in addition the fluctuation in the estimations during the testing period was considerably lower for j lts the estimated water table level represents regular seasonal variation during the testing period however short term noisy fluctuations remained suggesting that the overfitting problem had not been completely resolved when j ws was adopted with a multiplier for the ws term of 0 0001 significantly less data were honored during the training period than for the previous cost functions furthermore seasonal variation in the water table level was more evident fig 4d with the short term noisy fluctuations clearly weaker than when j lts was employed this indicates that j ws has a greater regularizing capability than does j lts however the estimations during the testing period were not completely stable due to the continued presence of some short term noisy fluctuations all of the above observations highlight the requirement of a more robust cost function such as the one proposed in this study to further regularize the estimation process the cost function with both the ws and lts hereafter j lts w s eq 7 without aw was adopted and the estimation results presented in fig 4e in this cost function the aw technique was not applied because outliers which are largely biased toward one side i e higher or lower groundwater levels were not evident it can be observed in fig 4e that the estimations did not honor specific data points and followed the general pattern of water table level fluctuation over time during both the training and testing periods most notably the use of j lts w s did not produce the short term noisy fluctuations that were found when the earlier cost functions were employed thus the estimation pattern was similar to the regular groundwater level time series commonly observed in shallow unconfined aquifers overall the results indicate that the optimal cost function eq 7 was the most desirable in terms of its regularization capability when applied to noisy data from the pohang gibuk monitoring well this would be beneficial when analyses based on the water table level such as the water table fluctuation method for recharge rate estimation healy and cook 2002 park 2012 are conducted using noisy time series data 4 summary and conclusion under realistic conditions groundwater level data are often corrupted due to a variety of natural and anthropogenic causes for this reason in this study a cost function that employs both least trimmed squares lts with asymmetric weighting aw and the whittaker smoother ws was proposed for robust predictive estimation based on data containing significant noise and a large number of outliers a long short term memory model was selected as the estimation model and the performance of the following cost functions were tested lts lts with aw mean squared error mse with the ws and the optimal cost function of mse with the ws and lts with aw the estimation results were also compared to the results from two conventional cost functions pure mse and mse with an l1 regularization term to compare these cost functions we used seven years of groundwater level data from the gangjin seongjeon monitoring well containing a large number of outliers during the wet periods and nine years of data from the pohang gibuk monitoring well that contained persistent noise after training the model with each cost function it was found that the influence of outliers on the resulting groundwater level estimations was successfully controlled by the optimal cost function mse with the ws and lts with aw while the other cost functions were affected by the outliers and noise based on the comparisons it was confirmed that the optimal cost function most effectively excluded the influence of outliers and noise and produced the most precise estimations for the respective test data because of its practicality the optimal cost function can be effectively applied to the monitoring of groundwater resources by eliminating the necessity for cumbersome data preprocessing to remove noise and outliers the estimations using the optimal cost function have various practical applications in hydrogeological fields such as groundwater resource monitoring predictive water table level estimation the identification of changes in aquifer processes and water table level analysis furthermore the developed cost function is expected to be useful for many other fields that employ natural data that are susceptible to variance caused by external factors 5 data availability all of the software programs were written in python and tensorflow the sample data that were used in this study are available

5805,in the present study a cost function is developed for the robust training of recurrent neural network models using groundwater level data that are corrupted by outliers and noise the optimal cost function in this study utilizes least trimmed squares lts with asymmetric weighting aw and the whittaker smoother ws which have different outlier or noise rejecting mechanisms the developed cost function is benchmarked with other cost functions in the training of a long short term memory lstm model using data from the gangjin seongjeon and pohang gibuk monitoring wells in south korea the results of which are then compared to the validation data based on comparisons of the validation results it is confirmed that the optimal cost function is the most successful in rejecting the influence of outliers during the training process when applied to data from the gangjin seongjeon monitoring well it is also demonstrated that the estimation results based on this optimal cost function can effectively identify outliers in groundwater level data for the pohang gibuk monitoring well data the optimal cost function without aw exhibits superior regularizing performance by generating the lowest mean estimation error using this cost function the influence of persistent noise is mostly canceled out and the estimation results reflect the regular changes in the water table level of a shallow aquifer over time the developed robust cost function can potentially be employed in many hydrogeological applications such as the monitoring of groundwater resources the prediction and analysis of water table levels and the identification of changes in aquifer processes the cost function is also expected to be useful for many other field applications in which the data are susceptible to external influences keywords groundwater level robust training outliers least trimmed squares whittaker smoother asymmetric weighting 1 introduction a groundwater level time series is the result of a variety of independent time limited processes with natural and non natural origins for this reason interpretations of changes in groundwater level based on known hydrological stresses can provide information on the status of an aquifer when groundwater level data are not significantly corrupted by outliers important information on hydrological processes in the subsurface can be obtained based on calibration using a process based model park et al 2011 park 2012 zhou et al 2014 jeong and park 2017 jeong et al 2017c data driven models that are trained using groundwater level data can also provide estimations of the reference groundwater level zhang et al 2018 jeong and park 2019 that can be compared to the actual level to identify sudden changes in hydraulic processes however minor processes can often significantly affect the groundwater level and create outliers in a time series helsel and hirsch 2002 jeong et al 2017b in the presence of outliers and significant noise groundwater level time series can be difficult to interpret thus restricting the ability to acquire meaningful information for an aquifer by definition noise and outliers are data points that have a low probability of being consistent with the major processes underlying the rest of the data hawkins 1980 and are caused by 1 incorrect data measurement transmission or transcription and or 2 local deviations from the main data processes jeong et al 2017b incorporating noise and outliers may interfere with hydrogeological analysis thus leading to inaccurate interpretations helsel and hirsch 2002 yi and lee 2004 therefore a number of studies have been conducted to limit the influence of noise and outliers during analysis gibbons et al 2009 helsel and hirsch 2002 jeong et al 2017a however outliers may occasionally contain important information regarding fluctuations in the water table level and thus must be separated and analyzed in detail to better understand a hydrogeological system for example sudden physical or chemical changes in groundwater may reflect the adverse effects of situations such as excessive pumping of water from an aquifer or the introduction of contaminants in rare cases these changes may result from variation in the stress field acting on an aquifer which can be used as a potential indicator of an imminent earthquake koizumi et al 2004 a model that can mimic major data generation processes is thus required to denoise data and identify outliers generally a hydrogeological process can be represented by either process based or data driven models process based models are based on partial differential equations in this type of modeling the model parameters relevant to the subsurface media need to be obtained and the model has to be calibrated against observations so that it can provide accurate estimations in contrast data driven models do not require a priori information coulibaly et al 2001 shen 2018 jeong and park 2019 such as model parameters that represent hydraulic properties and boundary conditions therefore a data driven model can be conveniently trained from observed data with less effort compared to process based models in this sense a data driven model can be more efficient especially when the groundwater levels of a large number of observation wells need to be estimated however asymmetrical and heteroscedastic noise and outliers which frequently appear in groundwater data are an obstacle when training conventional data driven models and making estimations based on the trained model in particular conventional data driven models that use a least squares cost function generally do not produce robust estimations in the presence of noise and outliers as an alternative a limited number of cost functions that use least trimmed squares lts algorithms rousseeuw and hubert 2011 have been proposed rusiecki 2007 estimations based on an lts algorithm are robust to the influence of outlying data points by considering the leverage of the data points in the cost function approach to robust time series analysis the conventional least squares function is conveniently substituted by a robust cost function without the requirement of preprocessing for denoising or outlier exclusion purposes in past research the lts approach has been adopted to train simple artificial neural network ann models the performances of which have been verified based on synthetic and real data jeng et al 2011 chang et al 2012 lin et al 2015 however this robust algorithm has not been fully implemented for more complicated natural data such as daily observations of groundwater levels which is the main interest of this study and other cost function approaches beyond the lts method have not yet been explored in this study the lts and whittaker smoother ws eilers 2003 algorithms are considered for use in the cost function of an advanced non linear time series model the present study is believed to be the first to combine multiple robust techniques in the formulation of a cost function for a data driven model that eliminates the effects of noise and outliers during the training process for this purpose the following cost functions are constructed and compared lts lts with asymmetric weighting aw mean squared error mse with the ws and a combination of the ws and lts with aw of these functions the one based on the ws and ltw with aw is proposed as the optimal cost function of this study the developed cost functions are employed in a long short term memory lstm model hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 which is subsequently used for groundwater level estimation two different groundwater data sources characterized by persistent noise and a large number of outliers from two monitoring wells in the national groundwater monitoring system in south korea are used and the robustness of the training process is compared for the different cost functions using this process the superiority of the optimal cost function can thus be demonstrated 2 model development 2 1 long short term memory lstm model the temporal variation in the level of the water table is estimated using the lstm model the lstm model has been employed in recent studies for hydrological estimation applications zhang et al 2018 shen 2018 kratzert et al 2018 jeong and park 2019 bowes et al 2019 with mse or root mean squared error rmse as the cost function and ridge regression drop out or early stopping methods used as a regularizer the lstm model is a type of deep neural network designed to avoid the vanishing and exploding gradient problems hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 that conventional recurrent neural networks are susceptible to by maintaining a portion of a special type of memory cell states throughout a sequence the information transferred throughout a sequence and new information are designed to be regulated by input output and forget gates which are connected to each other to form a directed graph thus historical dependencies between explanatory and response variables are efficiently handled hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 lipton et al 2015 wielgosz et al 2017 a large number of studies have described the mathematical foundation of this model e g hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 so the details will not be reproduced in the present study 2 2 cost function and l1 l2 regularization a common type of cost function in many ann models for time series estimation is mse while mse is commonly used as a cost function for linear estimators for mathematical convenience cost functions that consist solely of mse are often affected by overfitting in highly non linear models such as ann models least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso or l1 and ridge l2 regression are conventional methods used to avoid overfitting by penalizing large coefficients in the present study the cost function combining mse and l1 and l2 regularization is expressed as follows 1 j ω 1 n n 1 n y n o y e t n ω 2 λ 1 k 1 k ω k λ 2 k 1 k ω k 2 in this equation the first term on the right hand side rhs computes the mse between the observed y n o and model estimation of the groundwater level y e t n ω and n is the number of observations the second and third terms on the rhs are the l1 and l2 regularization terms respectively where λ 1 and λ 2 are parameters related to l1 and l2 regularization respectively k is the number of model weights and ω k is the model weight although regularization is designed to produce stable estimations it is not effective for time series data with a large number of outliers this will be discussed further in section 3 2 3 whittaker smoother ws loss function in most corrupted groundwater level time series data outliers generally represent sudden changes in the groundwater level compared to adjacent data points and the data set as a whole the influence of outliers can thus be minimized by penalizing large rates of change in the estimated groundwater level for this purpose the ws can be employed in the cost function the ws is often adopted to estimate baselines using one dimensional data eilers and boelens 2005 he et al 2014 and image processing cobas et al 2006 the mathematical formulation for the ws cost function is as follows 2 j ω 1 n n 1 n y n o y e t n ω 2 λ w n 2 n 1 δ 2 y n e ω 2 where the second term on the rhs is the smoothness term δ 2 y n e y n 1 e 2 y n e y n 1 e similar to the finite difference approximation of the second derivative of the estimation y n e ω is an abbreviation of y e t n ω and λ w is the smoother parameter through this loss function the mse and the summation of the second derivatives at each time step can be minimized simultaneously which results in smooth estimations by regulating the weights of the estimator more smoothed estimations are generated as λ w increases and vice versa the ws has rarely if ever been employed in the cost function of a deep neural network 2 4 least trimmed squares lts loss function lts is a non parametric algorithm that is known to be one of the most robust estimators because of its high breakdown point of 50 rousseeuw and croux 1992 and methodological simplicity the lts algorithm is often adopted for outlier detection rousseeuw and hubert 2011 the lts algorithm has also been incorporated into the cost function of ann models to produce robust estimations rusiecki 2007 lin et al 2015 the mathematical formulation for an lts cost function is given by 3 j ω 1 m n 1 n α s t n ω y n o y e t n ω 2 where m n 1 n α s t n ω and ω is a vector with weights and biases as elements the parameter α s t n ω which is multiplied by the squared difference between the observation and estimation is given by 4 α s t n ω 1 y n o y e t n ω 0 y n o y e t n ω where m e d i a n and y 1 n o y e t 1 n ω using the lts cost function eqs 3 and 4 data with an estimation error greater than the median error is assigned a weight of zero and the influence of outliers is limited by this exclusion process eq 4 based on this outlier exclusion process the resulting model estimation is based on non outlying data 2 5 lts loss function with asymmetric weighting aw the influence of outliers can be minimized using the lts cost function however the remaining non outlying data used for the estimation may have an unbiased distribution from the estimated trend i e a skewed distribution in terms of bias distribution estimations based on the above lts cost function may not be satisfactory to address this limitation aw can be considered instead of symmetric weighting for positive and negative errors eq 4 aw is formulated using the following equations 5 j ω 1 m n 1 n α a t n ω y n o y e t n ω 2 6 α a t n ω β 1 y n o y e t n ω a n d y n o y e t n ω 0 β 2 y n o y e t n ω a n d y n o y e t n ω 0 0 y n o y e t n ω where m n 1 n α a t n ω and β 1 and β 2 are hyperparameters determined by the trial and error method by including the aw scheme in the lts cost function eqs 5 and 6 a biased estimation for non outlying data can be generated with the bias being either positive or negative 2 6 comprehensive regularization the optimal cost function of this study the lts method with or without aw demonstrates robustness in the data selection or exclusion process while the ws enables the robust estimation of the model by regulating the weights because the outlier rejection mechanisms of the two approaches differ they can be jointly adopted to increase the robustness of the estimator therefore this study assumes that the regularization methods discussed previously can be employed together to produce a more robust cost function that improves performance for this purpose the following equation includes all of the above regularization methods 7 j ω 1 m n 1 n α t n ω y n o y e t n ω 2 λ w n 2 n 1 δ 2 y n e ω 2 where either eq 4 α s or eq 6 α a can be used for α depending on the data and the estimation result because of the greater robustness the cost function of eq 7 is expected to be more effective than any of the listed methods alone when estimating groundwater level changes based on training using time series data with a large number of outliers and biased non outlying data thus in section 3 the performance of the individual cost functions will be compared with that of the optimal cost function eq 7 using a validation data set 3 results and discussion 3 1 applying the cost functions to data with outliers the gangjin seongjeon monitoring well field groundwater data from the gangjin seongjeon monitoring well fig 1 gims 2019 and climate data kma 2019 from 2010 to 2016 were used to validate the cost functions discussed in section 2 the estimations from time series models employing these cost functions lts eqs 3 and 4 lts with aw eqs 5 and 6 the ws eq 2 and the ws and lts with aw eq 7 were compared with the results of the conventional lstm approach with and without l1 regularization eq 1 the monitoring well is located in gangjin gun jeollanam do in southwestern korea the mean depth to the water table in the observation well is 2 6 m below the surface from top to bottom the aquifer is composed of sandy loam size unconsolidated sediment and highly fractured crystalline rock granitic gneiss the observation well penetrates up to 67 m below the surface and well screens are installed at intervals of 44 48 52 56 and 60 64 m below the surface the area is mostly agricultural land with two small streams geumgangcheon and weolsungcheon the elevation of the monitoring well is 54 9 m above msl the average annual precipitation in the area during the seven year study period 2010 2016 was 1467 7 mm year and approximately half 55 of the precipitation was concentrated during the wet season from june to september the average monthly precipitation and temperature during the study period is summarized in table 1 based on the precipitation patterns it would be expected that the groundwater level would be highest during the wet season however the mean groundwater level was actually lowest during august 52 m compared to the annual average groundwater level of 52 4 m as shown in fig 2 the groundwater level during the rainy season especially in august exhibited sharp falls given the shallow groundwater level in this area these rapid drops are suspected to be the result of preemptive groundwater pumping to prevent flash flooding therefore the hydrograph suggests that the observations were affected considerably by anthropogenic influences as in this case if data are significantly corrupted by outliers training a data driven model to precisely estimate future changes in groundwater levels becomes difficult some state of the art methods exclude outliers from time series data e g leys et al 2013 after which a data driven model can be trained on the preprocessed data however the discussion surrounding data preprocessing is beyond the scope of this study though it is important to note that the preprocessing of groundwater level data is inherently subjective which can create additional complexity and uncertainty in the subsequent analysis rather the objective of this study was to use corrupted data to estimate future groundwater levels so data preprocessing was not considered here the cost functions defined in section 2 were applied sequentially to the groundwater level data from the gangjin seongjeon monitoring well to verify their characteristics the recurrent neural network was structured to have 24 hidden states that were consistently used as lstm cells with the output cell states processed by the fully connected network which included six hidden layers with 24 nodes to obtain the groundwater level a grid search method was used to determine the remaining hyperparameters a scaled exponential linear unit selu klambauer et al 2017 was also employed as the activation function for the fully connected network the average temperature and precipitation rate of the current day and the nine preceding days i e a total of 10 days were used as input for the network during the training stage additionally the observed groundwater levels for the past 10 days were used as input for the network to produce autoregressive estimations during the estimation stage the observed groundwater levels for autoregressive estimation were fed back into the network by the previously estimated levels for the 10 preceding days this feedback procedure was used to validate the performance of the cost functions in this study we focused solely on whether a trained lstm model based on a cost function can mimic the groundwater level generating process the first 70 jan 2010 to nov 2014 and the final 30 dec 2014 to dec 2016 of the data were used to train and test the data driven model respectively in predictive groundwater level estimation an additional forecasting step based on the trained and validated model through the training and testing processes should be performed at this stage the weather and groundwater level data observed in the past are used as input to the model fig 2 presents the estimation results for the lstm time series model with the various cost functions pure mse fig 2a mse with l1 regularization fig 2b lts fig 2c lts with aw fig 2d mse with the ws fig 2e and a combination of lts aw and the ws fig 2f note the superior predictive performance of eq 7 presented in fig 2f which will be discussed later fig 2a displays the reference results when mse with no regularizing term hereafter j mse was used as the cost function it can be observed in this figure that most of the data were honored during the training period when j mse was used as the cost function in all cases training was terminated when either 10 000 iterations or a tolerance of 0 1 for 0 to 1 normalized groundwater levels were reached as expected the trained lstm model produced dramatically fluctuating groundwater level estimations that did not accurately represent the actual groundwater levels similar results were observed when mse with l1 regularization hereafter j l 1 was employed as the cost function as can be seen in fig 2b the training estimations based on j l 1 were very similar to those using j mse fig 2a with dramatic fluctuations in groundwater level this suggests that l1 regularization alone is ineffective in handling the outliers in the gangjin seongjeon dataset in which a large number of data points significantly deviated from the main data pattern the overfitting problem exhibited by the gangjin seongjeon dataset can be reduced to some extent by using a combination of conventional regularization methods such as l1 regularization dropout and early stopping which is outside the scope of the present study when the lts cost function hereafter j lts was employed fig 2c the influence of the outliers during the wet periods was significantly lower the reduced influence of the outliers can be attributed to the data selection process employed in the lts method with j lts the top 50 of the data when arranged in ascending order of estimation error were used to compute the cost function and optimize the weights of the lstm network while the remaining data which had larger estimation errors were ignored the training results suggest that data points that negatively deviated from the general trend during the wet periods were considered to be the result of relatively minor processes and training that was conditioned on this data was suppressed using the lts method however the influence of outliers was not fully eliminated using the lts method alone although the estimations during the testing period were greatly improved compared to both mse approaches fig 2a and 2b the predicted groundwater levels were consistently lower than the actual levels fig 2c to resolve this consistent underestimation the lts with aw cost function hereafter j ltsaw was employed fig 2d as with j lts the data were arranged in ascending order of estimation error and the top 50 used to compute the cost and optimize the model weights in addition to this estimation errors that were larger than the actual value i e positive errors were multiplied by 1 to penalize underestimations while the estimation errors that were smaller than the actual values were multiplied by 1 7 as determined using the trial and error method using j ltsaw the underestimation during the testing period was clearly improved as illustrated by comparing fig 2c j lts and fig 2d j ltsaw however the estimation during the training period was still affected by outliers negatively deviating data during the wet periods even with aw although the model was trained robustly when j lts and j ltsaw were employed during the training period actual water table data were used as input for the trained lstm model and the estimated water table levels fluctuated when the outlying data were fed into the trained model however during the testing period all of the water table level data fed into the trained model were previously estimated thus there were no abnormal fluctuations to completely eliminate the influence of outliers the mse with the ws cost function hereafter j ws was adopted fig 2e the ws produces robust estimation by regulating the lstm weights which is a different process from that used in the lts method by regulating the weights the influence of the outliers fed into the trained model can be canceled out a small number 0 0001 was used as the multiplier for the ws term to avoid excessive smoothing when the number was empirically determined in fig 2e abrupt changes in the estimated groundwater levels during the wet periods were successfully eliminated by suppressing the magnitude of the second derivatives however slight and consistent underestimation was observed during the training period and this underestimation became more severe during the testing period as with the use of j lts fig 2c this underestimation can be attributed to the smoothing term suppressing the magnitude of the second derivatives of the estimates with respect to time thus many of the estimated groundwater levels could not reach the actual peak levels especially for positive values these observations indicate that the ws is effective when estimating baseline fluctuations but has limitations in predicting peak levels the overall result for j ws suggests that an adjustment for the consistent underestimation is necessary as was the case for j lts based on all previous observations estimation was performed using the cost function that included both the ws and lts with aw hereafter j ltsaw w s as stated earlier the joint adoption of the lts with or without aw and ws is expected to increase the robustness of the estimator because their outlier rejection mechanisms differ fig 2f presents the results for j ltsaw w s it can be observed that the estimates provide the best fit for the major groundwater level patterns when compared to the other cost functions fig 2a 2f for j ltsaw w s the data were arranged in ascending order of estimation error and the top 50 used to compute the cost with positive errors multiplied by 1 and negative errors multiplied by 2 for asymmetrical penalization the same ws multiplier as that used for j ws 0 0001 was employed from the estimation results in fig 2f both the training and testing periods exhibited a reasonable fit to the actual groundwater level data and no substantial influence from outliers during the wet periods was observed this observation suggests that the optimal cost function which combines lts with aw and the ws performs reasonably well when making predictive estimations based on severely corrupted groundwater level data from the gangjin seongjeon monitoring well the performance of the optimal cost function also indicates that outliers can be effectively identified for a more comparative and quantitative evaluation of the cost functions developed in the present study outliers were identified and eliminated from the main data set using j ltsaw w s the rmse was then obtained for the estimations for each cost function and compared fig 3 presents the identified outliers with actual data points negatively deviating by more than an empirically determined value of 0 25 m from the corresponding estimated groundwater level considered to be outliers however a few data points appearing to be outliers that had been flagged as outliers using the cut off value were observed these outliers could be eliminated manually because the number of outliers had been significantly reduced fig 3 in this outlier identification and elimination process the entire data set was used as training data and the same hyperparameters as those used for j ltsaw w s fig 2f were used as shown in fig 3 the majority of the data points that were likely to have been influenced by anthropogenic stress were successfully identified as outliers red crosses and were eliminated from the trimmed data using the trimmed data the rmse of each cost function was obtained for the estimated groundwater levels for the testing period the computed rmses were 0 760 0 616 0 167 0 099 0 150 and 0 097 m for j mse j l 1 j lts j ltsaw j ws and j ltsaw w s respectively these results are generally in accordance with the qualitative comparisons presented in fig 2a 2f as expected j ltsaw w s exhibited the best performance followed by j ltsaw the larger rmses for j lts and j ws were due to their underestimations as shown in fig 2c and 2e based on these qualitative and quantitative analyses the optimal cost function eq 7 was confirmed to be the most effective of the tested functions in terms of excluding the influence of outliers when training the lstm time series model thus changes in groundwater resources can be monitored more efficiently using the combined cost function j ltsaw w s even with the use of corrupted data and without data preprocessing 3 2 applying the cost functions to noisy data the pohang gibuk monitoring well water table level data from the pohang gibuk monitoring well fig 1 gims 2019 and climate data kma 2019 for the 2005 2013 period were used to validate the cost functions in the validation the same process used in the gangjin seongjeon case was adopted to illustrate the robust training capability of the optimal cost function the monitoring well is located in pohang gyeongsangbuk do in southeastern korea the mean depth to the water table in the observation well is 4 8 m below the surface the well was drilled to 70 m below the surface and screens were installed at intervals of 50 54 58 62 and 66 70 m below the surface the aquifer consists of fractured shale and the unsaturated zone is mostly composed of sand and gravel the monitoring well is located approximately 150 m away from a rill gigyecheon and the elevation is 121 1 m above msl the average annual precipitation of the study area during the nine year study period 2005 for the 2005 2013 period 2013 was 1118 6 mm year and more than a half 63 2 of the precipitation occurred during the wet season from june to september the average monthly precipitation and temperature during the study period is summarized in table 1 in fig 4 the water table level shows seasonal variation with a one year period with a high water table in the wet season and a low water table in the other periods following the pattern of precipitation however the water table level data are strongly corrupted by persistent noise the source of which has not been identified if a data set includes significant persistent noise the training of a data driven model generally leads to overfitting and the estimation of future changes in the groundwater level using the model becomes highly unstable to ensure the robust training of a data driven model using noisy groundwater level data the developed cost functions were applied and the results were compared a network structure identical to that used for the gangjin seongjeon data set was adopted to estimate the groundwater level and the same structure was also used for the explanatory data additionally during the estimation stage the observed groundwater levels for autoregressive estimation were fed back into the network by previously estimated levels for the 10 preceding days the first 55 6 jan 2005 to dec 2009 and the last 44 4 jan 2010 to dec 2013 of the data were used to train and test the data driven model respectively fig 4 presents the estimation results for the lstm model using pure mse fig 4a mse with l1 regularization fig 4b lts fig 4c mse with the ws fig 4d and a combination of lts and the ws fig 4e as cost functions fig 4a acts as a reference in which j mse is used as the cost function according to fig 4a most of the data were honored during the training period with the trained lstm model producing wildly fluctuating water table level estimations that did not accurately represent the actual water table fluctuations a similar result was observed when j l 1 was used as the cost function as can be seen in fig 4b the training estimations were similar to those presented in fig 4a this suggests that l1 regularization was ineffective in resolving the overfitting problem caused by persistent noise in the data from the pohang gibuk monitoring well for the lts cost function j lts fig 4c fewer data points were honored during the training period compared to either j mse or j l 1 in addition the fluctuation in the estimations during the testing period was considerably lower for j lts the estimated water table level represents regular seasonal variation during the testing period however short term noisy fluctuations remained suggesting that the overfitting problem had not been completely resolved when j ws was adopted with a multiplier for the ws term of 0 0001 significantly less data were honored during the training period than for the previous cost functions furthermore seasonal variation in the water table level was more evident fig 4d with the short term noisy fluctuations clearly weaker than when j lts was employed this indicates that j ws has a greater regularizing capability than does j lts however the estimations during the testing period were not completely stable due to the continued presence of some short term noisy fluctuations all of the above observations highlight the requirement of a more robust cost function such as the one proposed in this study to further regularize the estimation process the cost function with both the ws and lts hereafter j lts w s eq 7 without aw was adopted and the estimation results presented in fig 4e in this cost function the aw technique was not applied because outliers which are largely biased toward one side i e higher or lower groundwater levels were not evident it can be observed in fig 4e that the estimations did not honor specific data points and followed the general pattern of water table level fluctuation over time during both the training and testing periods most notably the use of j lts w s did not produce the short term noisy fluctuations that were found when the earlier cost functions were employed thus the estimation pattern was similar to the regular groundwater level time series commonly observed in shallow unconfined aquifers overall the results indicate that the optimal cost function eq 7 was the most desirable in terms of its regularization capability when applied to noisy data from the pohang gibuk monitoring well this would be beneficial when analyses based on the water table level such as the water table fluctuation method for recharge rate estimation healy and cook 2002 park 2012 are conducted using noisy time series data 4 summary and conclusion under realistic conditions groundwater level data are often corrupted due to a variety of natural and anthropogenic causes for this reason in this study a cost function that employs both least trimmed squares lts with asymmetric weighting aw and the whittaker smoother ws was proposed for robust predictive estimation based on data containing significant noise and a large number of outliers a long short term memory model was selected as the estimation model and the performance of the following cost functions were tested lts lts with aw mean squared error mse with the ws and the optimal cost function of mse with the ws and lts with aw the estimation results were also compared to the results from two conventional cost functions pure mse and mse with an l1 regularization term to compare these cost functions we used seven years of groundwater level data from the gangjin seongjeon monitoring well containing a large number of outliers during the wet periods and nine years of data from the pohang gibuk monitoring well that contained persistent noise after training the model with each cost function it was found that the influence of outliers on the resulting groundwater level estimations was successfully controlled by the optimal cost function mse with the ws and lts with aw while the other cost functions were affected by the outliers and noise based on the comparisons it was confirmed that the optimal cost function most effectively excluded the influence of outliers and noise and produced the most precise estimations for the respective test data because of its practicality the optimal cost function can be effectively applied to the monitoring of groundwater resources by eliminating the necessity for cumbersome data preprocessing to remove noise and outliers the estimations using the optimal cost function have various practical applications in hydrogeological fields such as groundwater resource monitoring predictive water table level estimation the identification of changes in aquifer processes and water table level analysis furthermore the developed cost function is expected to be useful for many other fields that employ natural data that are susceptible to variance caused by external factors 5 data availability all of the software programs were written in python and tensorflow the sample data that were used in this study are available

5806,understanding the mechanism of the interactions between vegetation dynamics and the water cycle is rather important for determining global and regional water and carbon budgets in this paper a physically based model integrating land surface hydrological and biogeochemical processes by coupling a hydrological model and a biogeochemical model is developed to simulate the water energy and carbon fluxes the model is validated against observed biometric eddy covariance flux soil moisture and temperature data over two different ecosystems results show that the model could simulate the vegetation physiological and hydrological processes satisfactorily including net radiation latent heat gross primary production gpp net ecosystem exchange and soil moisture and temperature sensitivity analysis illustrates that evapotranspiration gpp net ecosystem production are quite sensitive to plant physiological controls such as the maximum electron transport rate quantum efficiency of electron transport and runoff parameter moreover results show that a close relationship between photosynthesis and transpiration water use efficiency shows a u bend curve at different time steps and it also indicates a higher value in forest ecosystem than that of grass ecosystem in the forest ecosystem evapotranspiration is higher and the surface runoff is lower meanwhile it is almost carbon sink during the whole year while in the grass ecosystem it shows a carbon source during may to september this study could provide an effective model for the simulation of water carbon cycles keywords hydrological biogeochemical dtvgm casacnp coupling 1 introduction the bidirectional effects of vegetation dynamics and hydrologic balance are well known and have received much attention in both hydrological and ecological research arora 2002 wagener et al 2010 shen et al 2013 for example regarding the interactions between vegetation and soil moisture via transpiration water extraction by plant roots affects soil moisture transport and then runoff generation and the influences are various from different species moreover the feedback of soil moisture through its stress effects on transpiration photosynthesis and respiration affect plant growth and the carbon cycle the leaf area index lai also affects solar radiation transfer and rainfall interception by the canopy subsequently affects the evapotranspiration runoff etc in addition nutrient limitation on carbon assimilation affects vegetation growth and the water balance several studies have shown that under climate change condition with increasing carbon dioxide co2 levels plants tend to reduce stomatal conductance suppress transpiration and enhance carbon uptake which implies increases in plant biomass pritchard et al 1999 water use efficiency and soil moisture volk et al 2000 moreover the increases in plant biomass may not be sustainable in the long term due to nutrient limitation mcmurtrie and comins 1996 these findings suggest that it is necessary to consider the interactions between carbon nutrient dynamics and hydrological processes to better understand vegetation growth and hydrologic balance physically based hydrological models derived deductively from fundamental physical laws beven 2002 have successfully been used to explain complex hydrological processes such as the rainfall runoff relationship exchanges between surface and subsurface water and flood routing however these physically based models often have not considered the effects of biogeochemical changes in vegetation such as lai dynamics root growth and stomatal conductance on hydrological balance biogeochemical models have used to characterize the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and simulate carbon nitrogen phosphorus transfer between different pools however the hydrological processes in most biogeochemical models are simplified and the effects of the water cycle on biogeochemical processes are not well understood from a modeling perspective the coupling of physically based hydrological models and biogeochemical models that characterize vegetation dynamics and related carbon nutrition cycles is required to explore the interactions between vegetation and hydrology park et al 2011 and it is currently receiving much attention manzoni and porporato 2009 riveros iregui et al 2012 wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 2019 for example park et al 2011 developed a coupled hydrological and biogeochemical model and applied it to a larch forest in eastern siberia the authors found that soil water is the determinant that influences co2 fluxes shen et al 2013 coupled the process based adaptive watershed simulator and community land model and studied the complex effects of key controls of nitrogen groundwater and soil water content on evapotranspiration net primary productivity and other important water carbon flux variables in a humid continental climate watershed in the great lakes region of north america they found that nitrogen significantly controls transpiration and then influences other hydrologic fluxes however hydrological models still have rarely considered biogeochemical processes the distributed time variant gain model dtvgm developed by xia et al 2005 is an extension of a nonlinear approach derived from volterra function xia et al 1997 xia 2002 coupled hydrological processes based on geographic information system and remote sensing platform the dtvgm has been applied to many basins in china and has achieved good performance wang et al 2009 li et al 2010 zhan et al 2013 the model includes several components of hydro information analysis and modeling such as data processing snow melt the evapotranspiration and runoff generation on each grid and flow routing between adjacent concentration belts the model has smaller parameter sets for runoff generation and the parameters can be estimated in terms of system identification approach to reduce uncertainty xia et al 2005 casacnp carnegie ames stanford approach carbon nitrogen phosphorous is a process based biogeochemical model that was developed by wang et al 2007 and houlton et al 2008 from the carnegie ames stanford approach casa model randerson et al 1997 this model has been well calibrated and used in several previous studies to study global and regional carbon cycles randerson et al 2002 wang et al 2010 the model can simulate vegetation dynamics including those of leaves wood and root and the carbon cycle in litter and soil organic matter the model also considers the coupling of the biogeochemical cycles of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus based on the coupling the model can be used to examine the nutrition limit on vegetation productivity and growth which is not considered in most other terrestrial biogeochemical models wang et al 2007 however casacnp rarely considers hydrological processes or energy transfer for example soil moisture and soil temperature should be prepared as inputs to drive the model shi et al 2011 that is the bidirectional effects of water and carbon are not well simulated besides the accuracy of the simulation for photosynthesis affected by physiological characteristics and environmental factors is significant to carbon assimilation in the casa model the net primary production is estimated simplified by the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation which ignores the complex physiological and environmental effects which may bring certain error in the simulation of carbon assimilation from the above descriptions neither of the hydrological or biogeochemical models could meet the requirement of studying interactions between vegetation and hydrological balance for these reasons we integrated casacnp with carbon assimilation modules modified to dtvgm in our research to enhance the ability and adaptability in simulating water energy and carbon fluxes in this study the coupled dtvgm casacnp model is introduced to study water energy and carbon fluxes over two different ecosystems the objectives of this study are 1 to describe the physical processes of the model 2 to evaluate the performance of the coupled model in simulating water energy and carbon fluxes soil moisture and temperature and 3 to study the coupling characteristic of vegetation and hydrological processes 2 model description the coupling of the hydrological model i e dtvgm and biogeochemical model i e casacnp is described below and the schematic of the coupled model is shown in fig 1 the coupled model consists of three main modules the land surface hydrological module included in the dtvgm the carbon assimilation module based on farquhar et al 1980 and biogeochemical cycle module based on casacnp 2 1 land surface hydrological processes 2 1 1 water budget the coupled model solves the water budget for both the canopy and soil including rainfall interception evaporation of intercepted water from the canopy transpiration soil evaporation surface runoff subsurface runoff vertical movement of soil water groundwater recharge and base flow interception by the canopy plays an important role in redistributing water components including evapotranspiration infiltration and surface runoff and even the deposition of solutes such as dissolved organic carbon and organic nitrogen lohse et al 2009 the intercepted water wc can be obtained by determining difference in gross precipitation p arriving at the top of the canopy and the throughfall pd stemflow pa and evaporation e c from the intercepted water following rutter et al 1972 as

water uptake by plant roots is assumed to be the accumulation of water extraction from each soil layer where plant roots appear it is influenced by the degree of stomatal opening and the atmosphere surrounding the canopy including the absorbed net irradiation and aerodynamics factors soil water content and soil temperature also affect transpiration by controlling stomatal conductance es is controlled by the net radiation absorbed by the soil surface aerodynamics factors and soil surface resistance determined by soil moisture and soil texture the major equations for estimating et are

this study the stomata model and photosynthesis model are coupled to simulate photosynthesis and stomatal conductance by solving eqs 14 19 iteratively until convergence for the accuracy of the simulation the stomata model and photosynthesis model should be run at sub daily timestep 2 3 biogeochemical cycles 2 3 1 carbon cycle in the casacnp model there are nine carbon pools consist of three plant pools leaf root and wood three litter pools structural metabolic and coarse woody and three soil organic pools microbial biomass slow and passive pools the carbon is transferred from plant pools to litter pools and from litter pools to soil pools meanwhile carbon is also turnover among different pools in litter and soil pools individually the major equations of carbon cycle are as followings wang et al 2010 22 d c i dt a c i f c μ i c i i leaf wood or root 23 d c j dt i b j i μ i c i m n μ j c j j metabolic structural or coarse woody 24 d c k dt j c k j m n μ j c j kk d k k k μ kk c kk μ

ecosystem function parmesan and yohe 2003 phenology dynamics including the time of budburst and blossom of different species are measured and simulated and have been widely used to study responses to climate change at different site however individual phenology dynamics can only work well at the local scale and for a few kinds of vegetation and do not satisfy the differences for different ecosystems zhang et al 2006 according to moulin et al 1997 and zhang et al 2006 using vegetation index measurements can be an alternative approach to identify vegetation phenology with this approach phenology is divided into four phases by greenness which is quantified using a vegetation index 1 greenup the date of onset of greenness increase 2 maturity the date when greenness reaches the maximum degree 3 senescence the date when greenness begins to decrease 4 dormancy the date when greenness is lowest in this study the phenology characteristics are derived from the remote sensing observations by zhang et al 2006 in different phenology phases the allocations of npp to plant pools differ in phase 1 the fraction of npp allocated to leaf is set to 0 8 root is 0 1 and wood is 0 and 0 2 respectively for woody and non woody vegetation in phase 2 the fractions of allocation are constant but vary between different vegetation types and the values follow fung et al 2005 during phases 3 and 4 the fraction of allocation to leaf is set to 0 and the allocation coefficient in phase 2 is allocated to wood and root 3 sites and model initialization 3 1 sites dataset this research was performed in the loblolly pine lp site and open field of site in the blackwood division of the duke forest near durham north carolina 35 98 n 79 09 w this area has a moderate climate with warm and humid summers and mild winters the mean annual precipitation is approximately 1117 6 mm and is well distributed throughout the year the mean annual temperature ranges from 21 7 c to 9 0 c in the growing and nongrowing seasons respectively the soils are low fertility acidic hapludalf in the enon series with clay loam in the upper 0 3 m and clay below down to the bedrock at 0 7 m in the lp site the surrounding dominant stand is a uniform age loblolly pine forest that was planted in 1983 the understory is diverse and includes more than 26 species dominated by sweetgum red maple winged elm and flowering dogwood which utilize the c3 photosynthesis pathway the growing season occurs from march to mid october and the leaf area index ranges from 2 0 to 5 0 in all phases in the of site the dominant stand is the c3 grass festuca arundinacea shreb and few plants use the c4 photosynthesis pathways the leaf area index ranges from 1 0 to 3 0 in all growth phases it should be noted that the field is mowed once or twice each summer since 1992 information of the two sites is shown in table 1 the data used in this study were downloaded from the ameriflux site and data exploration system at the site http ameriflux ornl gov the lp site is equipped with seven 20 m aluminum walkup towers the flux and radiation instruments are set at 20 m from the ground surface and other instruments such as temperature probe are set at 20 m and relative humidity probe is set at 7 m the of site is equipped with 4 8 m walkup towers and the eddy covariance flux observation system is set at 2 8 m the meteorological data including precipitation atmospheric pressure air temperature relative humidity wind speed and incoming solar radiation at 30 min time step are used to drive the coupled model to simulate the water energy and carbon fluxes other meteorological data such as the net radiation sensible heat latent heat and evapotranspiration and biological data such as gross primary productivity are used to validate the model the goodness of energy balance closure i e net radiation equals the sum of the sensible heat latent heat and ground heat flux is an indicator of observed data quality because the ground heat flux was not available therefore the observed net radiation is compared to the sum of the sensible heat and latent heat as shown in fig 2 the correlation coefficients are 0 76 and 0 91 for the lp site and of site respectively the average relative error of energy are 6 2 w m 2 and 15 2 w m 2 for the two sites 3 2 model initialization in order to get more accurate water energy and carbon fluxes at higher time resolution the simulation is conducted at a time step of 30 min using half hourly measured meteorological data including air pressure temperature vapor pressure wind speed precipitation and downward short and long wave radiation to drive the coupled model the co2 concentration is dynamically set during the simulation periods using the measured ambient co2 concentration above the vegetation the average ambient co2 concentration is about 375 ppmv the main parameterization of the model consists of soil physical parameters runoff parameters eco physiological and biogeochemical parameters the key parameters for the simulation are listed in table 2 the soil physical parameters are based on the united states department of agriculture usda classification system the soil moisture and temperature are calculated for 50 layers from the ground surface to a depth of 2 m most of the eco physiological and biogeochemical parameters are according to the previous studies in this study we mainly calibrate the runoff photosynthetic and stomatal conductance parameters manually to evaluate the model performance the total root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe and coefficient of determination r2 are used the lower of the values of mbe and rmse and the higher of the values of r2 near 1 0 the better the model performs 4 results 4 1 diurnal cycle of energy fluxes ten day time series of the diurnal cycle of simulated and observed net radiation rn latent heat le and sensible heat h in the two ecosystems are shown in fig 3 results show that the energy is mostly used in the form of evaporative flux and the le is much greater than h for the two sites the coupled model simulates the magnitude and pattern of diurnal cycle for rn le and h relatively well for both the two sites and extremely well for rn the simulated rn captures the diurnal variation quite well agree with the observation while rn is overestimated at noon in some days with the maximum error of 61 82 w m 2 the le is also simulated quite well except for some errors at noon and overestimation after 6 00 pm the h is not modeled as satisfactorily as le in some of the days the h is overestimated or underestimated at noon and the maximum bias is around 50 the simulation error of h may be related to the estimation of canopy and ground surface temperature for the reason that h is determined by the difference of air temperature and canopy or ground surface temperature besides the energy imbalance of flux measurements may also contribute to some bias in the simulation mo et al 2012 indicate that the possible reason is that the sensible heat is usually fluctuates irregularly over canopy and less efficient to capture its variation the simulated rn is not imbalance with the combination of simulated le and h the possible reason is that the residual energy is partitioned into soil heat flux which increases the soil temperature and the overestimated rn due to low albedo the half hourly values of observed energy fluxes are compared with the simulated values by the coupled model in the lp and of sites shown in fig 4 in the lp site results show that net radiation is predicted quite satisfactorily table 3 comparing to the observed rn the mbe is 10 15 w m 2 the r2 between the observed and simulated series is quite high with the value of 0 99 and the rmse value is 56 08 w m 2 for the heat components the mbe is 0 34 w m 2 for the simulated mean le with the rmse value 40 18 w m 2 while the r2 value is a little lower than that of rn with the value about 0 93 the sensible heat h is modeled not as well as the le the mbe is about 1 78 w m 2 and the r2 and rmse values are 0 90 and 45 47 w m 2 respectively in the of site the coupled model performs quite well in simulating rn and le while h is not simulated as well as the other two fluxes the mbe of rn is 8 86 w m 2 comparing to the observed value the r2 value is 0 99 and the rmse value is 34 52 w m 2 for the heat components the simulated le is also generally consistent with the observation with a low mbe value of 13 85 w m 2 the r2 value is 0 92 and the rmse value is 40 26 w m 2 comparing to the observation the mbe of the simulated h is higher with a value of 30 35 w m 2 while the r2 value is 0 94 and the rmse value is 43 43 w m 2 4 2 diurnal cycle of net ecosystem exchange the coupled model simulates the carbon fluxes of photosynthesis plants including leaf wood and root respiration and litter and soil respiration for the lack of the detail observation the half hourly values of observed gross primary production gpp and net ecosystem exchange nee are compared with the simulated values by the coupled model in the lp and of sites shown in fig 5 in the lp site the mbe value between simulated and observed nee is 0 43 μmol c m 2 s 1 the r2 and rmse are 0 76 and 5 54 μmol c m 2 s 1 respectively the mbe for the simulated gpp is 2 90 μmol c m 2 s 1 and the r2 and rmse are 0 83 and 6 25 μmol c m 2 s 1 respectively in the of site the mbe is higher than that of lp site and the value is 1 47 μmol c m 2 s 1 the r2 and rmse are 0 88 and 2 68 μmol c m 2s 1 respectively for gpp the mbe is lower than that of lp site with the value of 1 74 μmol c m 2 s 1 the r2 value is 0 89 and the rmse value is 3 57 μmol c m 2s 1 as shown in fig 5 the agreement between the simulation and observation of nee and gpp is generally satisfactory from the results of nee we can see it is underestimated in the night which is due to the bias of the simulation of respiration which was reported in numbers of studies baldocchi 1997 baldocchi 2003 for gpp it is overestimated in the daytime especially at noon in the of site this may be due to the overestimation of observed solar radiation for photosynthesis 4 3 diurnal cycle of evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et including transpiration soil evaporation and canopy interception evaporation are simulated and the comparisons of the results to observed evapotranspiration are shown in fig 6 in the lp site the mbe is 0 01 mm the r2 and rmse between predicted and observed et series are 0 95 and 0 02 mm respectively in the of site the mbe value is 0 01 mm the r2 and rmse comparing the simuated and observed et series are 0 92 and 0 03 mm respectively the results indicate that the model could capture the et diurnal variation quite well fig 6 also shows that the coupled model overestimates et at noon in some days which maybe relating to a higher absorption simulation of solar radiation or lower canopy resistance for water flux 4 4 seasonal cycle of energy fluxes fig 7 shows the seasonal cycle of daily averaged energy fluxes in the lp site and the results are shown in table 4 the agreement between predicted and observed rn is quite good with a small rmse value of 17 01 w m 2 mbe value of 2 36 w m 2 and a high r2 value of 0 97 the simulated rn is lightly overestimated with a 2 31 bias the seasonal variation in rn throughout the whole year indicates that the variations of observed and simulated values are quite consistent the performances of le and h are not as good as rn while le is simulated better than h the mbe between the simulation and observation of le and h are 1 75 w m 2 and 11 52 w m 2 respectively the rmse values for the two energy components are 15 02 w m 2 and 25 07 w m 2 respectively and the r2 values are 0 94 and 0 70 respectively fig 7 also shows that le is generally overestimated in nongrowing season while it underestimated in the growing season as less energy is allocated to le in the simulation h is overestimated particularly from august to october fig 8 shows the seasonal cycle of daily averaged energy fluxes in the of site the seasonal simulated rn is also quite consistent with the observation with a small rmse value of 11 80 w m 2 a high r2 of 0 98 and mbe value of 5 30 w m 2 the simulation of le and h is also relatively well during the period comparing to the observed le the mbe is 5 51 w m 2 the r2 is 0 84 and rmse value is 19 18 w m 2 for the sensible heat h the mbe is 15 77 w m 2 the r2 is 0 75 and rmse value is 21 65 w m 2 fig 8 also shows le is generally underestimated in non growing season but overestimated during august to october while h is generally overestimated during the simulation period 4 5 seasonal cycle of net ecosystem exchange fig 9 a and b presents the comparison of daily observed and simulated gpp and nee in the lp site the mbe is 0 03 μmol c m 2 s 1 comparing to the observed gpp values the r2 and rmse are 0 86 and 1 68 μmol c m 2 s 1 respectively the mbe value is 1 56 μmol c m 2 s 1 between simulated and observed nee the r2 and rmse are 0 62 and 1 81 μmol c m 2 s 1 respectively the comparison of daily observed and simulated gpp and nee in the of site are shown in fig 9 c and d the mbe of simulated and observed gpp is 0 31 μmol c m 2 s 1 the r2 is relatively lower than that of lp site with the value of 0 83 while the rmse value is 1 23 μmol c m 2 s 1 compare of the simulated and observed mean nee the mbe is 0 15 μmol c m 2 s 1 the r2 value is 0 64 and the rmse value is 1 27 μmol c m 2 s 1 respectively from the results the model could capture the transition between the carbon source and carbon sink quite well with a good agreement with the observation except for some large errors in certain month in january and march nee at the lp site is underestimated which may relate to the underestimation of soil temperature and soil moisture that stressed nee which has been well known in forest ecosystem ohta et al 2008 while in october november and december the nee is overestimated is also related to the overestimation of soil moisture that reduce the stress on nee in addition uncertainties in the plant physiology and soil carbon parameters would also bring errors in the simulated nee generally nee in the of site is underestimated in nongrowing season and overestimated in the growing season 4 6 seasonal cycle of evapotranspiration the variations of daily simulated and observed evapotranspiration in the two sites are shown in fig 10 in the lp site the mbe between the simulated and observed et is 0 11 mm and the r2 and rmse values are 0 94 and 0 48 mm respectively the comparison between observed and simulated et series show overestimation in non growing season and underestimation in growing season in the of site the mbe for et is 0 02 mm the r2 and rmse values are 0 90 and 0 51 mm respectively different from the lp site the seasonal changes show the et is underestimated in nongrowing season and overestimated in growing season the bias of the simulation of et may be attributed to the estimation stomatal conductance lai and soil resistance 4 7 soil moisture and soil temperature the simulation of soil moisture and soil temperature is important for determining the water and carbon budgets such as evapotranspiration and soil respiration the simulated soil moisture and temperature at different soil depths in the two sites are shown in fig 11 from the results the most sensitive soil layers are in the upper 0 3 m the soil moisture and temperature changes exhibit a time lag as the soil depth increases the seasonal changes of soil moisture θ30cm and soil temperature ts 30cm in 30 cm depth at daily time step for the two sites are shown in fig 12 the results show that the simulation for soil moisture and temperature are quite effective for the two sites in the lp site the mbe values are about 0 01 m3 m 3 and 0 39 c the rmse values are also small at 0 03 m3 m 3 and 1 91 c and the r2 values are 0 90 and 0 99 respectively in the of site the mbe values are about 0 03 m3 m 3 and 0 47 c the r2 values are 0 92 and 0 99 the rmse values are also small at 0 08 m3 m 3 and 2 02 c respectively in the two sites θ30cm is underestimated during january february and march which is related to the bias of simulation of evapotranspiration and runoff in these months from the perspective of water balance in addition the heterogeneity in the soil structure and physical properties also result in complex distributions of soil water cuenca et al 1997 which increase the uncertainties of soil moisture simulation there is a satisfactory agreement between the observed and simulated ts 30cm from march to october in other months ts 30cm is underestimated especially in january and february the maximum error is 6 1 c which result in less soil respiration and may be the reason for the underestimation of nee overall the model reasonably captures the variations in soil moisture and temperature 5 discussion 5 1 sensitivities to parameters in general the coupled model could simulate the water energy and carbon fluxes well over the period in this study however previous studies argue that despite close agreement between simulated and measured data one cannot claim complete success of the model for the reason that there may be numerous sources of errors including errors in the model parameters the forcing variable inadequate representation of physical processes and the flux underestimation problem therefore the coupled model needs to be investigated to further analyze the applicability in this section the model sensitivities to the parameters due to parameterization are analyzed the mono factor analysis is used to analyze the sensitivities of et gpp and net ecosystem production nep nep nee to certain parameters i e the analyzed parameter is selected in a reasonable range from the lower value to upper value while other parameters are fixed the analyzed parameters are shown in table 1 the sensitivities of et gpp and nep to the main runoff photosynthetic and stomatal conductance parameters including g1 g2 vcmax jmax α and a1 are shown in fig 13 the results shown that while g1 varies from 0 and 1 the total et and gpp changes about 1 3 and 4 6 while the total nep shows a big change the runoff parameter g2 varies from 0 to 1 the total et gpp and nep all show small changes lower than 5 the photosynthetic parameter vcmax varies between 50 and 150 all the three elements show small changes however the photosynthetic parameter jmax varies from 50 to 100 could result in large changes for et about 17 4 and gpp about 37 3 especially for nep nearly six times higher the stomatal conductance parameter α changes from 0 05 to 0 2 could also result in large changes approximately 131 287 and 126 for et gpp and nep respectively the parameter a1 ranges between 15 and 18 could result in 6 8 2 0 and 6 9 changes for et gpp and nep respectively the results above show that the water and carbon fluxes are quite sensitive to plant physiological controls such as the maximum electron transport rate quantum efficiency of electron transport and runoff parameter 5 2 anaysis of water use efficiency wue water use efficiency wue the ratio of water loss to carbon gain is a key characteristic of ecosystem function that is central to the water energy and carbon cycles beer et al 2009 wue is defined as the ratio of photosynthesis and transpiration rates the relationships between photosynthesis and transpiration are investigated firstly fig 14 shows the relationship between photosynthesis and transpiration in the lp and of sites the results show a close relationship between the two elements with high correlation coefficients of 0 9742 and 0 9259 respectively the photosynthesis increases and reaches a convergence as the increase of transpiration at both sites fig 15 shows the wue in diurnal and seasonal changes for the two sites the diurnal variation of the wue at half hourly time step shows a u bend curve in fig 15 a in the night time wue is zero without carbon assimilation it reaches a peak value after the sunrise and then reduces to a valley value at noon after that it increases and reaches another peak value which is mostly lower than the peak value in the morning this is due to the reason that changing rate of transpiration is faster than that of photosynthesis fig 15 b shows that seasonal variation of the daily wue with the values mostly between 5 and 10 mmol c mol h2o the results show that the wue reduces firstly and then increases around july indicating a high value in winter and a low value in summer showing an opposite changing trends of temperature evapotranspiration and net radiation comparing of the two sites in fig 16 generally the wue is higher in the loblolly pine site than that of the open field site which indicates a higher water use efficiency of forest ecosystem than grass ecosystem 5 3 comparisons of water energy and carbon fluxes over the two sites comparisons of water energy and carbon fluxes over the lp site and of site are shown in fig 17 the hydrological components in the lp site and of site including transpiration tr evaporation from canopy intercepted water ec soil evaporation es and surface runoff rs are shown in fig 17 a and fig 17 b respectively total surface runoff and soil evaporation in the of site are much higher than those in the lp site while transpiration and the total et in the lp site is much higher than that in the of site fig 17 c and d are the energy components including sensible h and latent heat le fluxes soil heat flux g in the lp site and of site respectively the le in the lp site is higher than that in the of site which is caused by the higher evapotranspiration absorbing more heat in the lp site correspondingly the h is higher in the of site from the perspective of energy balance th soil heat fluxes have small differences in the two sites are the monthly variances of soil heat fluxes show that during september to january the soil heat flux are negative which indicating a output heat to the air fig 17 e and f are the carbon fluxes including ecosystem respiration re and net ecosystem production nep nep nee gpp nep re in the lp site and of site respectively positive value of nep indicates carbon sink and the negative value indicates carbon source from the results we can find that the total gpp and re are higher in the lp site than those in the of site the lp site ecosystem are almost carbon sink during the whole year while in the of site it shows a carbon source during may to september 5 4 comparisons between coupled model with single models in order to validate the importance of the coupling of hydrological processes and biogeochemical processes comparisons of the simulation of water energy and carbon fluxes by coupled model and single model are conducted to analyze the improvement of the coupled model the loblolly pine site is taken as the example in this section results of the single model simulation sim s and the coupled model simulation sim c are compared and analyzed the comparisons of simulated evapotranspiration et soil moisture and gpp which are three main elements of water carbon cycles are conducted by the sim s and sim c fig 18 shows the comparisons of simulated et soil moisture and gpp by sim s and sim c via observed values the results show that the simulated et and gpp are overestimated about 35 7 and 29 6 while soil moisture is underestimated about 10 3 by sim s and the relative error reduce to 5 6 0 6 and 2 7 for et gpp and soil moisture by sim c the r 2 between simulated and observed values of et gpp and soil moisture by sim s are 0 83 0 75 and 0 82 respectively and the r 2 values increase to 0 94 0 86 and 0 90 by sim c the rmse between simulated and observed values of et gpp and soil moisture by sim s are 1 2 mm 2 9 μmol c m 2 s 1 and 0 06 m3 m 3 respectively and the rmse values reduce to 0 48 mm 1 68 μmol c m 2 s 1 and 0 03 m3 m 3 by sim c the mbe between simulated and observed values of total et gpp and soil moisture by sim s are 0 72 mm 1 7 μmol c m 2 s 1 and 0 04 m3 m 3 respectively and the mbe values reduce to 0 11 mm 0 03 μmol c m 2 s 1 and 0 01 m3 m 3 by sim c from the results above we find that the coupled model could improve the performances in simulating water and carbon fluxes obviously than the single models the main reason is that the coupled model could characterize the relationship of transpiration and photosynthesis the single model could not capture the effects of stomatal behavior on evapotranspiration and evapotranspiration is mainly estimated via climate conditions and soil moisture without considering the vegetation effects meanwhile the effects of land surface hydrological processes on carbon assimilation could also not be considered in the single model which would also bring systematic error in simulating the carbon flux 6 conclusions the hydrological cycle and vegetation dynamics carbon cycle interact strongly with each other we developed a physical process based model by coupling a hydrological model dtvgm and a biogeochemical model casacnp to simulate the water energy and carbon fluxes and analyze their relationships over two different ecosystems the coupled model dtvgm casacnp is tested well at both sites the results show that the coupled model could simulate net radiation latent and sensible heat fluxes evapotranspiration gpp nee soil moisture and soil temperature quite well at both the diurnal and seasonal scales by comparing the measured and simulated water energy and carbon fluxes sensitivity analysis illustrates that evapotranspiration gpp net ecosystem production are quite sensitive to plant physiological controls such as the maximum electron transport rate quantum efficiency of electron transport and runoff parameter the coupling characteristics of water and carbon cycles are also investigated by analyzing the water use efficiency wue at different time scales and the water energy and carbon fluxes are compared over the two ecosystems since the complexity of the hydrological and ecological processes the coupled model still needs to be further improved by including the phenology and dynamic root growth at different soil depths etc parameterization is still need to be further investigated for the applications of the coupled model in addition the coupled model is only tested at two sites the results obtained in this study may not represent sites with different environment conditions at other sites and regional verification is still need to be conducted over different ecosystems in further

5806,understanding the mechanism of the interactions between vegetation dynamics and the water cycle is rather important for determining global and regional water and carbon budgets in this paper a physically based model integrating land surface hydrological and biogeochemical processes by coupling a hydrological model and a biogeochemical model is developed to simulate the water energy and carbon fluxes the model is validated against observed biometric eddy covariance flux soil moisture and temperature data over two different ecosystems results show that the model could simulate the vegetation physiological and hydrological processes satisfactorily including net radiation latent heat gross primary production gpp net ecosystem exchange and soil moisture and temperature sensitivity analysis illustrates that evapotranspiration gpp net ecosystem production are quite sensitive to plant physiological controls such as the maximum electron transport rate quantum efficiency of electron transport and runoff parameter moreover results show that a close relationship between photosynthesis and transpiration water use efficiency shows a u bend curve at different time steps and it also indicates a higher value in forest ecosystem than that of grass ecosystem in the forest ecosystem evapotranspiration is higher and the surface runoff is lower meanwhile it is almost carbon sink during the whole year while in the grass ecosystem it shows a carbon source during may to september this study could provide an effective model for the simulation of water carbon cycles keywords hydrological biogeochemical dtvgm casacnp coupling 1 introduction the bidirectional effects of vegetation dynamics and hydrologic balance are well known and have received much attention in both hydrological and ecological research arora 2002 wagener et al 2010 shen et al 2013 for example regarding the interactions between vegetation and soil moisture via transpiration water extraction by plant roots affects soil moisture transport and then runoff generation and the influences are various from different species moreover the feedback of soil moisture through its stress effects on transpiration photosynthesis and respiration affect plant growth and the carbon cycle the leaf area index lai also affects solar radiation transfer and rainfall interception by the canopy subsequently affects the evapotranspiration runoff etc in addition nutrient limitation on carbon assimilation affects vegetation growth and the water balance several studies have shown that under climate change condition with increasing carbon dioxide co2 levels plants tend to reduce stomatal conductance suppress transpiration and enhance carbon uptake which implies increases in plant biomass pritchard et al 1999 water use efficiency and soil moisture volk et al 2000 moreover the increases in plant biomass may not be sustainable in the long term due to nutrient limitation mcmurtrie and comins 1996 these findings suggest that it is necessary to consider the interactions between carbon nutrient dynamics and hydrological processes to better understand vegetation growth and hydrologic balance physically based hydrological models derived deductively from fundamental physical laws beven 2002 have successfully been used to explain complex hydrological processes such as the rainfall runoff relationship exchanges between surface and subsurface water and flood routing however these physically based models often have not considered the effects of biogeochemical changes in vegetation such as lai dynamics root growth and stomatal conductance on hydrological balance biogeochemical models have used to characterize the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and simulate carbon nitrogen phosphorus transfer between different pools however the hydrological processes in most biogeochemical models are simplified and the effects of the water cycle on biogeochemical processes are not well understood from a modeling perspective the coupling of physically based hydrological models and biogeochemical models that characterize vegetation dynamics and related carbon nutrition cycles is required to explore the interactions between vegetation and hydrology park et al 2011 and it is currently receiving much attention manzoni and porporato 2009 riveros iregui et al 2012 wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 2019 for example park et al 2011 developed a coupled hydrological and biogeochemical model and applied it to a larch forest in eastern siberia the authors found that soil water is the determinant that influences co2 fluxes shen et al 2013 coupled the process based adaptive watershed simulator and community land model and studied the complex effects of key controls of nitrogen groundwater and soil water content on evapotranspiration net primary productivity and other important water carbon flux variables in a humid continental climate watershed in the great lakes region of north america they found that nitrogen significantly controls transpiration and then influences other hydrologic fluxes however hydrological models still have rarely considered biogeochemical processes the distributed time variant gain model dtvgm developed by xia et al 2005 is an extension of a nonlinear approach derived from volterra function xia et al 1997 xia 2002 coupled hydrological processes based on geographic information system and remote sensing platform the dtvgm has been applied to many basins in china and has achieved good performance wang et al 2009 li et al 2010 zhan et al 2013 the model includes several components of hydro information analysis and modeling such as data processing snow melt the evapotranspiration and runoff generation on each grid and flow routing between adjacent concentration belts the model has smaller parameter sets for runoff generation and the parameters can be estimated in terms of system identification approach to reduce uncertainty xia et al 2005 casacnp carnegie ames stanford approach carbon nitrogen phosphorous is a process based biogeochemical model that was developed by wang et al 2007 and houlton et al 2008 from the carnegie ames stanford approach casa model randerson et al 1997 this model has been well calibrated and used in several previous studies to study global and regional carbon cycles randerson et al 2002 wang et al 2010 the model can simulate vegetation dynamics including those of leaves wood and root and the carbon cycle in litter and soil organic matter the model also considers the coupling of the biogeochemical cycles of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus based on the coupling the model can be used to examine the nutrition limit on vegetation productivity and growth which is not considered in most other terrestrial biogeochemical models wang et al 2007 however casacnp rarely considers hydrological processes or energy transfer for example soil moisture and soil temperature should be prepared as inputs to drive the model shi et al 2011 that is the bidirectional effects of water and carbon are not well simulated besides the accuracy of the simulation for photosynthesis affected by physiological characteristics and environmental factors is significant to carbon assimilation in the casa model the net primary production is estimated simplified by the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation which ignores the complex physiological and environmental effects which may bring certain error in the simulation of carbon assimilation from the above descriptions neither of the hydrological or biogeochemical models could meet the requirement of studying interactions between vegetation and hydrological balance for these reasons we integrated casacnp with carbon assimilation modules modified to dtvgm in our research to enhance the ability and adaptability in simulating water energy and carbon fluxes in this study the coupled dtvgm casacnp model is introduced to study water energy and carbon fluxes over two different ecosystems the objectives of this study are 1 to describe the physical processes of the model 2 to evaluate the performance of the coupled model in simulating water energy and carbon fluxes soil moisture and temperature and 3 to study the coupling characteristic of vegetation and hydrological processes 2 model description the coupling of the hydrological model i e dtvgm and biogeochemical model i e casacnp is described below and the schematic of the coupled model is shown in fig 1 the coupled model consists of three main modules the land surface hydrological module included in the dtvgm the carbon assimilation module based on farquhar et al 1980 and biogeochemical cycle module based on casacnp 2 1 land surface hydrological processes 2 1 1 water budget the coupled model solves the water budget for both the canopy and soil including rainfall interception evaporation of intercepted water from the canopy transpiration soil evaporation surface runoff subsurface runoff vertical movement of soil water groundwater recharge and base flow interception by the canopy plays an important role in redistributing water components including evapotranspiration infiltration and surface runoff and even the deposition of solutes such as dissolved organic carbon and organic nitrogen lohse et al 2009 the intercepted water wc can be obtained by determining difference in gross precipitation p arriving at the top of the canopy and the throughfall pd stemflow pa and evaporation e c from the intercepted water following rutter et al 1972 as follows 1 d w c dt p p d p a e c evapotranspiration et is the link between the water budget and energy balance in this study it consists of three components evaporation from canopy intercepted water e

water uptake by plant roots is assumed to be the accumulation of water extraction from each soil layer where plant roots appear it is influenced by the degree of stomatal opening and the atmosphere surrounding the canopy including the absorbed net irradiation and aerodynamics factors soil water content and soil temperature also affect transpiration by controlling stomatal conductance es is controlled by the net radiation absorbed by the soil surface aerodynamics factors and soil surface resistance determined by soil moisture and soil texture the major equations for estimating et are

this study the stomata model and photosynthesis model are coupled to simulate photosynthesis and stomatal conductance by solving eqs 14 19 iteratively until convergence for the accuracy of the simulation the stomata model and photosynthesis model should be run at sub daily timestep 2 3 biogeochemical cycles 2 3 1 carbon cycle in the casacnp model there are nine carbon pools consist of three plant pools leaf root and wood three litter pools structural metabolic and coarse woody and three soil organic pools microbial biomass slow and passive pools the carbon is transferred from plant pools to litter pools and from litter pools to soil pools meanwhile carbon is also turnover among different pools in litter and soil pools individually the major equations of carbon cycle are as followings

ecosystem function parmesan and yohe 2003 phenology dynamics including the time of budburst and blossom of different species are measured and simulated and have been widely used to study responses to climate change at different site however individual phenology dynamics can only work well at the local scale and for a few kinds of vegetation and do not satisfy the differences for different ecosystems zhang et al 2006 according to moulin et al 1997 and zhang et al 2006 using vegetation index measurements can be an alternative approach to identify vegetation phenology with this approach phenology is divided into four phases by greenness which is quantified using a vegetation index 1 greenup the date of onset of greenness increase 2 maturity the date when greenness reaches the maximum degree 3 senescence the date when greenness begins to decrease 4 dormancy the date when greenness is lowest in this study the phenology characteristics are derived from the remote sensing observations by zhang et al 2006 in different phenology phases the allocations of npp to plant pools differ in phase 1 the fraction of npp allocated to leaf is set to 0 8 root is 0 1 and wood is 0 and 0 2 respectively for woody and non woody vegetation in phase 2 the fractions of allocation are constant but vary between different vegetation types and the values follow fung et al 2005 during phases 3 and 4 the fraction of allocation to leaf is set to 0 and the allocation coefficient in phase 2 is allocated to wood and root 3 sites and model initialization 3 1 sites dataset this research was performed in the loblolly pine lp site and open field of site in the blackwood division of the duke forest near durham north carolina 35 98 n 79 09 w this area has a moderate climate with warm and humid summers and mild winters the mean annual precipitation is approximately 1117 6 mm and is well distributed throughout the year the mean annual temperature ranges from 21 7 c to 9 0 c in the growing and nongrowing seasons respectively the soils are low fertility acidic hapludalf in the enon series with clay loam in the upper 0 3 m and clay below down to the bedrock at 0 7 m in the lp site the surrounding dominant stand is a uniform age loblolly pine forest that was planted in 1983 the understory is diverse and includes more than 26 species dominated by sweetgum red maple winged elm and flowering dogwood which utilize the c3 photosynthesis pathway the growing season occurs from march to mid october and the leaf area index ranges from 2 0 to 5 0 in all phases in the of site the dominant stand is the c3 grass festuca arundinacea shreb and few plants use the c4 photosynthesis pathways the leaf area index ranges from 1 0 to 3 0 in all growth phases it should be noted that the field is mowed once or twice each summer since 1992 information of the two sites is shown in table 1 the data used in this study were downloaded from the ameriflux site and data exploration system at the site http ameriflux ornl gov the lp site is equipped with seven 20 m aluminum walkup towers the flux and radiation instruments are set at 20 m from the ground surface and other instruments such as temperature probe are set at 20 m and relative humidity probe is set at 7 m the of site is equipped with 4 8 m walkup towers and the eddy covariance flux observation system is set at 2 8 m the meteorological data including precipitation atmospheric pressure air temperature relative humidity wind speed and incoming solar radiation at 30 min time step are used to drive the coupled model to simulate the water energy and carbon fluxes other meteorological data such as the net radiation sensible heat latent heat and evapotranspiration and biological data such as gross primary productivity are used to validate the model the goodness of energy balance closure i e net radiation equals the sum of the sensible heat latent heat and ground heat flux is an indicator of observed data quality because the ground heat flux was not available therefore the observed net radiation is compared to the sum of the sensible heat and latent heat as shown in fig 2 the correlation coefficients are 0 76 and 0 91 for the lp site and of site respectively the average relative error of energy are 6 2 w m 2 and 15 2 w m 2 for the two sites 3 2 model initialization in order to get more accurate water energy and carbon fluxes at higher time resolution the simulation is conducted at a time step of 30 min using half hourly measured meteorological data including air pressure temperature vapor pressure wind speed precipitation and downward short and long wave radiation to drive the coupled model the co2 concentration is dynamically set during the simulation periods using the measured ambient co2 concentration above the vegetation the average ambient co2 concentration is about 375 ppmv the main parameterization of the model consists of soil physical parameters runoff parameters eco physiological and biogeochemical parameters the key parameters for the simulation are listed in table 2 the soil physical parameters are based on the united states department of agriculture usda classification system the soil moisture and temperature are calculated for 50 layers from the ground surface to a depth of 2 m most of the eco physiological and biogeochemical parameters are according to the previous studies in this study we mainly calibrate the runoff photosynthetic and stomatal conductance parameters manually to evaluate the model performance the total root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe and coefficient of determination r2 are used the lower of the values of mbe and rmse and the higher of the values of r2 near 1 0 the better the model performs 4 results 4 1 diurnal cycle of energy fluxes ten day time series of the diurnal cycle of simulated and observed net radiation rn latent heat le and sensible heat h in the two ecosystems are shown in fig 3 results show that the energy is mostly used in the form of evaporative flux and the le is much greater than h for the two sites the coupled model simulates the magnitude and pattern of diurnal cycle for rn le and h relatively well for both the two sites and extremely well for rn the simulated rn captures the diurnal variation quite well agree with the observation while rn is overestimated at noon in some days with the maximum error of 61 82 w m 2 the le is also simulated quite well except for some errors at noon and overestimation after 6 00 pm the h is not modeled as satisfactorily as le in some of the days the h is overestimated or underestimated at noon and the maximum bias is around 50 the simulation error of h may be related to the estimation of canopy and ground surface temperature for the reason that h is determined by the difference of air temperature and canopy or ground surface temperature besides the energy imbalance of flux measurements may also contribute to some bias in the simulation mo et al 2012 indicate that the possible reason is that the sensible heat is usually fluctuates irregularly over canopy and less efficient to capture its variation the simulated rn is not imbalance with the combination of simulated le and h the possible reason is that the residual energy is partitioned into soil heat flux which increases the soil temperature and the overestimated rn due to low albedo the half hourly values of observed energy fluxes are compared with the simulated values by the coupled model in the lp and of sites shown in fig 4 in the lp site results show that net radiation is predicted quite satisfactorily table 3 comparing to the observed rn the mbe is 10 15 w m 2 the r2 between the observed and simulated series is quite high with the value of 0 99 and the rmse value is 56 08 w m 2 for the heat components the mbe is 0 34 w m 2 for the simulated mean le with the rmse value 40 18 w m 2 while the r2 value is a little lower than that of rn with the value about 0 93 the sensible heat h is modeled not as well as the le the mbe is about 1 78 w m 2 and the r2 and rmse values are 0 90 and 45 47 w m 2 respectively in the of site the coupled model performs quite well in simulating rn and le while h is not simulated as well as the other two fluxes the mbe of rn is 8 86 w m 2 comparing to the observed value the r2 value is 0 99 and the rmse value is 34 52 w m 2 for the heat components the simulated le is also generally consistent with the observation with a low mbe value of 13 85 w m 2 the r2 value is 0 92 and the rmse value is 40 26 w m 2 comparing to the observation the mbe of the simulated h is higher with a value of 30 35 w m 2 while the r2 value is 0 94 and the rmse value is 43 43 w m 2 4 2 diurnal cycle of net ecosystem exchange the coupled model simulates the carbon fluxes of photosynthesis plants including leaf wood and root respiration and litter and soil respiration for the lack of the detail observation the half hourly values of observed gross primary production gpp and net ecosystem exchange nee are compared with the simulated values by the coupled model in the lp and of sites shown in fig 5 in the lp site the mbe value between simulated and observed nee is 0 43 μmol c m 2 s 1 the r2 and rmse are 0 76 and 5 54 μmol c m 2 s 1 respectively the mbe for the simulated gpp is 2 90 μmol c m 2 s 1 and the r2 and rmse are 0 83 and 6 25 μmol c m 2 s 1 respectively in the of site the mbe is higher than that of lp site and the value is 1 47 μmol c m 2 s 1 the r2 and rmse are 0 88 and 2 68 μmol c m 2s 1 respectively for gpp the mbe is lower than that of lp site with the value of 1 74 μmol c m 2 s 1 the r2 value is 0 89 and the rmse value is 3 57 μmol c m 2s 1 as shown in fig 5 the agreement between the simulation and observation of nee and gpp is generally satisfactory from the results of nee we can see it is underestimated in the night which is due to the bias of the simulation of respiration which was reported in numbers of studies baldocchi 1997 baldocchi 2003 for gpp it is overestimated in the daytime especially at noon in the of site this may be due to the overestimation of observed solar radiation for photosynthesis 4 3 diurnal cycle of evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et including transpiration soil evaporation and canopy interception evaporation are simulated and the comparisons of the results to observed evapotranspiration are shown in fig 6 in the lp site the mbe is 0 01 mm the r2 and rmse between predicted and observed et series are 0 95 and 0 02 mm respectively in the of site the mbe value is 0 01 mm the r2 and rmse comparing the simuated and observed et series are 0 92 and 0 03 mm respectively the results indicate that the model could capture the et diurnal variation quite well fig 6 also shows that the coupled model overestimates et at noon in some days which maybe relating to a higher absorption simulation of solar radiation or lower canopy resistance for water flux 4 4 seasonal cycle of energy fluxes fig 7 shows the seasonal cycle of daily averaged energy fluxes in the lp site and the results are shown in table 4 the agreement between predicted and observed rn is quite good with a small rmse value of 17 01 w m 2 mbe value of 2 36 w m 2 and a high r2 value of 0 97 the simulated rn is lightly overestimated with a 2 31 bias the seasonal variation in rn throughout the whole year indicates that the variations of observed and simulated values are quite consistent the performances of le and h are not as good as rn while le is simulated better than h the mbe between the simulation and observation of le and h are 1 75 w m 2 and 11 52 w m 2 respectively the rmse values for the two energy components are 15 02 w m 2 and 25 07 w m 2 respectively and the r2 values are 0 94 and 0 70 respectively fig 7 also shows that le is generally overestimated in nongrowing season while it underestimated in the growing season as less energy is allocated to le in the simulation h is overestimated particularly from august to october fig 8 shows the seasonal cycle of daily averaged energy fluxes in the of site the seasonal simulated rn is also quite consistent with the observation with a small rmse value of 11 80 w m 2 a high r2 of 0 98 and mbe value of 5 30 w m 2 the simulation of le and h is also relatively well during the period comparing to the observed le the mbe is 5 51 w m 2 the r2 is 0 84 and rmse value is 19 18 w m 2 for the sensible heat h the mbe is 15 77 w m 2 the r2 is 0 75 and rmse value is 21 65 w m 2 fig 8 also shows le is generally underestimated in non growing season but overestimated during august to october while h is generally overestimated during the simulation period 4 5 seasonal cycle of net ecosystem exchange fig 9 a and b presents the comparison of daily observed and simulated gpp and nee in the lp site the mbe is 0 03 μmol c m 2 s 1 comparing to the observed gpp values the r2 and rmse are 0 86 and 1 68 μmol c m 2 s 1 respectively the mbe value is 1 56 μmol c m 2 s 1 between simulated and observed nee the r2 and rmse are 0 62 and 1 81 μmol c m 2 s 1 respectively the comparison of daily observed and simulated gpp and nee in the of site are shown in fig 9 c and d the mbe of simulated and observed gpp is 0 31 μmol c m 2 s 1 the r2 is relatively lower than that of lp site with the value of 0 83 while the rmse value is 1 23 μmol c m 2 s 1 compare of the simulated and observed mean nee the mbe is 0 15 μmol c m 2 s 1 the r2 value is 0 64 and the rmse value is 1 27 μmol c m 2 s 1 respectively from the results the model could capture the transition between the carbon source and carbon sink quite well with a good agreement with the observation except for some large errors in certain month in january and march nee at the lp site is underestimated which may relate to the underestimation of soil temperature and soil moisture that stressed nee which has been well known in forest ecosystem ohta et al 2008 while in october november and december the nee is overestimated is also related to the overestimation of soil moisture that reduce the stress on nee in addition uncertainties in the plant physiology and soil carbon parameters would also bring errors in the simulated nee generally nee in the of site is underestimated in nongrowing season and overestimated in the growing season 4 6 seasonal cycle of evapotranspiration the variations of daily simulated and observed evapotranspiration in the two sites are shown in fig 10 in the lp site the mbe between the simulated and observed et is 0 11 mm and the r2 and rmse values are 0 94 and 0 48 mm respectively the comparison between observed and simulated et series show overestimation in non growing season and underestimation in growing season in the of site the mbe for et is 0 02 mm the r2 and rmse values are 0 90 and 0 51 mm respectively different from the lp site the seasonal changes show the et is underestimated in nongrowing season and overestimated in growing season the bias of the simulation of et may be attributed to the estimation stomatal conductance lai and soil resistance 4 7 soil moisture and soil temperature the simulation of soil moisture and soil temperature is important for determining the water and carbon budgets such as evapotranspiration and soil respiration the simulated soil moisture and temperature at different soil depths in the two sites are shown in fig 11 from the results the most sensitive soil layers are in the upper 0 3 m the soil moisture and temperature changes exhibit a time lag as the soil depth increases the seasonal changes of soil moisture θ30cm and soil temperature ts 30cm in 30 cm depth at daily time step for the two sites are shown in fig 12 the results show that the simulation for soil moisture and temperature are quite effective for the two sites in the lp site the mbe values are about 0 01 m3 m 3 and 0 39 c the rmse values are also small at 0 03 m3 m 3 and 1 91 c and the r2 values are 0 90 and 0 99 respectively in the of site the mbe values are about 0 03 m3 m 3 and 0 47 c the r2 values are 0 92 and 0 99 the rmse values are also small at 0 08 m3 m 3 and 2 02 c respectively in the two sites θ30cm is underestimated during january february and march which is related to the bias of simulation of evapotranspiration and runoff in these months from the perspective of water balance in addition the heterogeneity in the soil structure and physical properties also result in complex distributions of soil water cuenca et al 1997 which increase the uncertainties of soil moisture simulation there is a satisfactory agreement between the observed and simulated ts 30cm from march to october in other months ts 30cm is underestimated especially in january and february the maximum error is 6 1 c which result in less soil respiration and may be the reason for the underestimation of nee overall the model reasonably captures the variations in soil moisture and temperature 5 discussion 5 1 sensitivities to parameters in general the coupled model could simulate the water energy and carbon fluxes well over the period in this study however previous studies argue that despite close agreement between simulated and measured data one cannot claim complete success of the model for the reason that there may be numerous sources of errors including errors in the model parameters the forcing variable inadequate representation of physical processes and the flux underestimation problem therefore the coupled model needs to be investigated to further analyze the applicability in this section the model sensitivities to the parameters due to parameterization are analyzed the mono factor analysis is used to analyze the sensitivities of et gpp and net ecosystem production nep nep nee to certain parameters i e the analyzed parameter is selected in a reasonable range from the lower value to upper value while other parameters are fixed the analyzed parameters are shown in table 1 the sensitivities of et gpp and nep to the main runoff photosynthetic and stomatal conductance parameters including g1 g2 vcmax jmax α and a1 are shown in fig 13 the results shown that while g1 varies from 0 and 1 the total et and gpp changes about 1 3 and 4 6 while the total nep shows a big change the runoff parameter g2 varies from 0 to 1 the total et gpp and nep all show small changes lower than 5 the photosynthetic parameter vcmax varies between 50 and 150 all the three elements show small changes however the photosynthetic parameter jmax varies from 50 to 100 could result in large changes for et about 17 4 and gpp about 37 3 especially for nep nearly six times higher the stomatal conductance parameter α changes from 0 05 to 0 2 could also result in large changes approximately 131 287 and 126 for et gpp and nep respectively the parameter a1 ranges between 15 and 18 could result in 6 8 2 0 and 6 9 changes for et gpp and nep respectively the results above show that the water and carbon fluxes are quite sensitive to plant physiological controls such as the maximum electron transport rate quantum efficiency of electron transport and runoff parameter 5 2 anaysis of water use efficiency wue water use efficiency wue the ratio of water loss to carbon gain is a key characteristic of ecosystem function that is central to the water energy and carbon cycles beer et al 2009 wue is defined as the ratio of photosynthesis and transpiration rates the relationships between photosynthesis and transpiration are investigated firstly fig 14 shows the relationship between photosynthesis and transpiration in the lp and of sites the results show a close relationship between the two elements with high correlation coefficients of 0 9742 and 0 9259 respectively the photosynthesis increases and reaches a convergence as the increase of transpiration at both sites fig 15 shows the wue in diurnal and seasonal changes for the two sites the diurnal variation of the wue at half hourly time step shows a u bend curve in fig 15 a in the night time wue is zero without carbon assimilation it reaches a peak value after the sunrise and then reduces to a valley value at noon after that it increases and reaches another peak value which is mostly lower than the peak value in the morning this is due to the reason that changing rate of transpiration is faster than that of photosynthesis fig 15 b shows that seasonal variation of the daily wue with the values mostly between 5 and 10 mmol c mol h2o the results show that the wue reduces firstly and then increases around july indicating a high value in winter and a low value in summer showing an opposite changing trends of temperature evapotranspiration and net radiation comparing of the two sites in fig 16 generally the wue is higher in the loblolly pine site than that of the open field site which indicates a higher water use efficiency of forest ecosystem than grass ecosystem 5 3 comparisons of water energy and carbon fluxes over the two sites comparisons of water energy and carbon fluxes over the lp site and of site are shown in fig 17 the hydrological components in the lp site and of site including transpiration tr evaporation from canopy intercepted water ec soil evaporation es and surface runoff rs are shown in fig 17 a and fig 17 b respectively total surface runoff and soil evaporation in the of site are much higher than those in the lp site while transpiration and the total et in the lp site is much higher than that in the of site fig 17 c and d are the energy components including sensible h and latent heat le fluxes soil heat flux g in the lp site and of site respectively the le in the lp site is higher than that in the of site which is caused by the higher evapotranspiration absorbing more heat in the lp site correspondingly the h is higher in the of site from the perspective of energy balance th soil heat fluxes have small differences in the two sites are the monthly variances of soil heat fluxes show that during september to january the soil heat flux are negative which indicating a output heat to the air fig 17 e and f are the carbon fluxes including ecosystem respiration re and net ecosystem production nep nep nee gpp nep re in the lp site and of site respectively positive value of nep indicates carbon sink and the negative value indicates carbon source from the results we can find that the total gpp and re are higher in the lp site than those in the of site the lp site ecosystem are almost carbon sink during the whole year while in the of site it shows a carbon source during may to september 5 4 comparisons between coupled model with single models in order to validate the importance of the coupling of hydrological processes and biogeochemical processes comparisons of the simulation of water energy and carbon fluxes by coupled model and single model are conducted to analyze the improvement of the coupled model the loblolly pine site is taken as the example in this section results of the single model simulation sim s and the coupled model simulation sim c are compared and analyzed the comparisons of simulated evapotranspiration et soil moisture and gpp which are three main elements of water carbon cycles are conducted by the sim s and sim c fig 18 shows the comparisons of simulated et soil moisture and gpp by sim s and sim c via observed values the results show that the simulated et and gpp are overestimated about 35 7 and 29 6 while soil moisture is underestimated about 10 3 by sim s and the relative error reduce to 5 6 0 6 and 2 7 for et gpp and soil moisture by sim c the r 2 between simulated and observed values of et gpp and soil moisture by sim s are 0 83 0 75 and 0 82 respectively and the r 2 values increase to 0 94 0 86 and 0 90 by sim c the rmse between simulated and observed values of et gpp and soil moisture by sim s are 1 2 mm 2 9 μmol c m 2 s 1 and 0 06 m3 m 3 respectively and the rmse values reduce to 0 48 mm 1 68 μmol c m 2 s 1 and 0 03 m3 m 3 by sim c the mbe between simulated and observed values of total et gpp and soil moisture by sim s are 0 72 mm 1 7 μmol c m 2 s 1 and 0 04 m3 m 3 respectively and the mbe values reduce to 0 11 mm 0 03 μmol c m 2 s 1 and 0 01 m3 m 3 by sim c from the results above we find that the coupled model could improve the performances in simulating water and carbon fluxes obviously than the single models the main reason is that the coupled model could characterize the relationship of transpiration and photosynthesis the single model could not capture the effects of stomatal behavior on evapotranspiration and evapotranspiration is mainly estimated via climate conditions and soil moisture without considering the vegetation effects meanwhile the effects of land surface hydrological processes on carbon assimilation could also not be considered in the single model which would also bring systematic error in simulating the carbon flux 6 conclusions the hydrological cycle and vegetation dynamics carbon cycle interact strongly with each other we developed a physical process based model by coupling a hydrological model dtvgm and a biogeochemical model casacnp to simulate the water energy and carbon fluxes and analyze their relationships over two different ecosystems the coupled model dtvgm casacnp is tested well at both sites the results show that the coupled model could simulate net radiation latent and sensible heat fluxes evapotranspiration gpp nee soil moisture and soil temperature quite well at both the diurnal and seasonal scales by comparing the measured and simulated water energy and carbon fluxes sensitivity analysis illustrates that evapotranspiration gpp net ecosystem production are quite sensitive to plant physiological controls such as the maximum electron transport rate quantum efficiency of electron transport and runoff parameter the coupling characteristics of water and carbon cycles are also investigated by analyzing the water use efficiency wue at different time scales and the water energy and carbon fluxes are compared over the two ecosystems since the complexity of the hydrological and ecological processes the coupled model still needs to be further improved by including the phenology and dynamic root growth at different soil depths etc parameterization is still need to be further investigated for the applications of the coupled model in addition the coupled model is only tested at two sites the results obtained in this study may not represent sites with different environment conditions at other sites and regional verification is still need to be conducted over different ecosystems in further

in chief with the assistance of habib basha associate editor continuous time random walks ctrw multi rate mass transfer mrmt and fractional advection dispersion equations fades are three promising models of anomalous transport as commonly found in natural streams although these paradigms are mathematically related understanding their advantages and limitations poses a challenge for model selection in this paper we quantitatively evaluate the advection dispersion equation ade fractional mobile immobile fmim fractional in space ade sfade fractional in space transient storage fsts truncated time fractional model ttfm and ctrw models with truncated power law waiting time distribution ctrw tpl by fitting them first to synthetic data we then applied these models to observations from tracer experiments conducted in several rivers based on the extensive analysis we conclude that the performance of the fsts model in particular the model with negative skewness β 1 is comparable or superior to the other nonlocal models evaluated in the paper therefore the model represents an alternative to existing models for simulating stream solute transport for spatially homogeneous flows keywords transient storage fractional derivative hyporheic zone continuous time random walk 1 introduction anomalous or non fickian transport of solutes is often found in streams at all scales burnell et al 2017 edery et al 2010 liu et al 2017 shen and phanikumar 2009 vishal and leung 2015 exchange of water and solutes with the hyporheic zone produces delays in transport relative to the mainstream flow often leading to long or heavy tails in concentration breakthrough curves btcs boano et al 2007 after decades of effort modeling of non fickian transport of tracers continues to be a challenging problem beyond being a purely academic problem observed heavy tails play a critical role in the transport of toxic chemicals where underestimation poses more risk while overestimation can increase cleanup costs de barros et al 2013 among many others three anomalous nonlocal models are most widely used in hydrology these are continuous time random walks ctrw multi rate mass transfer mrmt and fractional advection dispersion equations fade these models are mathematically interrelated as reviewed in the supplementary material si for example an analytical relationship between mrmt and ctrw is established in dentz and berkowitz 2003 the fractional in time and fractional in space ades are limit forms of ctrws metzler and klafter 2000 schumer et al 2009 the fractional in time ade can be shown to be mathematically equivalent to the fractional in space ade via space time duality kelly and meerschaert 2017 2019 in addition the fractional mobile immobile model fmim is derived from the mrmt with a special memory function schumer et al 2003 while the overarching frameworks are related choices of special memory functions or residence time distributions rtds have resulted in particularly popular sub models such as the ctrw with a truncated power law waiting time distribution function ctrw tpl the single rate mrmt model mrmt 1 hereafter the lognormal diffusion rate mrmt mrmt 2 hereafter and the power law distribution of mass exchange rates mrmt model mrmt 3 hereafter in addition new forms of fades were introduced in hydrology such as the fractional mobile immobile fmim model the truncated time fractional model ttfm and the fractional in space transient storage model fsts the governing equations and nonlocal characteristics of the above models are summarized in table 1 the models in table 1 are based on different underlying physical assumptions most obviously they have different parameters each of which has a different physical interpretation and ranges of values despite significant progress in application of these models to describe solute transport in streams the wide range of available sub models and the complex relationships among them can be sources of confusion for selecting the best model for a given situation e g solute transport in a river with significant hyporheic effect she that follows either a power law or an exponential rtd in particular models with a large number of parameters also present the problem that they are difficult to optimize and could suffer from equifinality therefore one of the objectives of this work was to address the following question taking the number of model parameters into account which model best captures btcs with heavy tails to address this question we briefly review the interrelations between the different models first see si then we generate synthetic data corresponding to different residence time distributions using the mrmt 1 mrmt 2 and mrmt 3 models and test the ability of the other non local models to reproduce the synthetic data finally we further evaluate all the models using tracer data from rivers with and without she this paper further explores the connection between space fractional equations and other ctrw and mrmt approaches using numerical simulations and fits to observed tracer data to provide a clear physical and stochastic interpretation for space fractional models in river flow hydrology the fsts model considered in our work is essentially the well known transient storage ts model bencala and walters 1983 runkel and chapra 1993 runkel 1998 with the second order dispersion term in the ts model replaced with a more general fractional derivative term that includes positive and negative skewness terms the ts model was applied extensively to address questions involving conservative and reactive transport in streams and rivers in the past a major advantage of the model is that its parameters can be directly measured in the field using detailed velocity measurements or tracer studies or both carr and rehmann 2007 shen et al 2010 phanikumar et al 2007 the second order dispersion term in the ts model has been a source of some confusion in the ts modeling literature as some researchers found that a dispersion term was not needed to describe solute transport in some stream reaches gupta and cvetkovic 2000 wörman 1998 the analytical solution of the ts model de smedt et al 2005 follows an exponential residence time distribution representing solute retention in either surface storage zones or shallow hyporheic regions but not in deep hyporheic zones this separation of surface and deep hyporheic storage contributions is important for biogeochemical processes within streams e g denitrification and has been the focus of previous research e g briggs et al 2009 one of the objectives of the paper is to further evaluate the fsts model for its ability to represent both surface and hyporheic storages within a stream reach and to compare the performance of this model with other nonlocal approaches in section 2 we describe the different models considered in this paper to understand the physical meaning of different parameters in the models we evaluate the models using synthetic data generated using the three synthetic mrmt cases in addition we also compare parameter estimates based on the sfade fsts fmim ttfm ctrw tpl mrmt 1 and mrmt 3 models with rhodamine wt rwt and sodium chloride tracer data collected in a total of 17 reaches in 4 different rivers we also examine the physical interpretation of the backward dispersion term in the fsts and sfade models given there is a debate related to previous studies as to whether this reflects a true physical process or an unphysical mathematical representation zhang et al 2009 in addition we compare the sfade and fsts models to understand if there is any advantage of fsts over sfade and other time non local models finally we summarize our results and findings in the conclusion section 2 methods 2 1 the fsts and sfade model the fsts model deng et al 2006 shen and phanikumar 2009 assumes a first order mass exchange between the main channel and a storage zones eqs t1 and t2 in table 1 c is the solute concentration in the main channel m l 3 l is the unit of distance c s is the concentration in the storage zone m l 3 v is the average water velocity l t 1 d is the coefficient of longitudinal dispersion l α t 1 x is the space coordinate in the flow direction l t is time t ɛ is a first order exchange coefficient t 1 a is the main channel cross sectional area l 2 a s is the size of the storage zones l 2 c l is the concentration associated with lateral inflow and q l l 3 t 1 l 1 is the lateral inflow rate the order of the fractional riemann liouville rl derivative in 1 is α 1 2 while the parameter β 1 1 controls the skewness when β 0 dispersion in the main channel is symmetric when β 0 the solution of the fsts is skewed backward while when β 0 the solution is skewed forward zhang et al 2005 when α 2 the fsts reduces to the classical ts model for any choice of skewness β the fractional in space advection dispersion equation sfade is a special case of the fsts with ɛ q l 0 which only includes the mobile channel concentration eq t3 in table 1 the analytical solution for sfade with a pulse injection in an infinite domain i e no boundary condition benson et al 2000 is used in this study since the rl derivative of a constant is not zero specifying boundary conditions for the continuous slug release and pulse injection of a tracer of a known constant concentration in a stream is problematic baeumer et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 to mitigate this in this work the fsts model is formulated by using the caputo definition the fsts models were implemented using a mass conserving control volume method based on the caputo fractional derivative as described in zhang et al 2005 2007 boundary conditions for the fsts model at the inlet and outlet correspond to a specified concentration and free drainage zero flux conditions respectively see eq 18 in zhang et al 2007 computational domain lengths of each case are summarized in table s1 supplementary material 2 2 fmim model to explicitly model the mobile main channel and immobile storage zones using fractional calculus schumer et al 2003 developed the fractional mobile immobile fmim model eq t4 in table 1 c m is the main channel mobile zone concentration γ is the fractional derivative order and β s t γ is the fractional capacity coefficient the term γ t γ is the fractional rl derivative on the half axis v is velocity l t 1 and d l 2 t 1 is the dispersion coefficient when γ 1 the fmim reduces to the classic ade with a retardation factor 1 β s an analytical solution to 5 with a pulse initial condition on an unbounded domain can be computed using a stable subordinator density schumer et al 2003 and is implemented in fracfit kelly et al 2017 the fmim is a different model from the fractional in time ade ftade γ p t γ v p x d 2 p x 2 which is a limit form the ctrw metzler and klafter 2000 the stochastic process of the fmim can be viewed as a power law residence time immobile state among the brownian motion with drift mobile process mobile state benson and meerschaert 2009 2 3 the ttfm model exponentially tempering heavy tailed power law distributions in fmim produces a residence time distribution with a finite mean yielding a truncated time fractional ade i e the ttfm meerschaert et al 2008 see eq t5 in table 1 in ttfm γ is functionally equivalent to that in fmim λ 0 is the truncation parameter that controls the rtd transition from a power law to an exponential when t 1 λ the mobile zone concentration decays as power law as in fmim at later times t 1 λ the tail of the mobile phase btc decays exponentially 2 4 mrmt model the basic form of mrmt can be expressed as haggerty and gorelick 1995 1 c m t i 1 n β i c im i t v c m x d 2 c m x 2 2 c im i t ɛ i

this form b ɛ is the pdf of the first order exchange rate coefficients and β tot 0 b ɛ d ɛ denotes the capacity coefficient stammt l is a code for the mrmt model and offers user specified mass exchange rate coefficients in this study we choose the single rate mass transfer model the lognormal distribution diffusion rate model haggerty and gorelick 1998 and the power law distribution of first order mass transfer rates model to generate the synthetic data sets in appendix b we show their specific functional forms 2 5 ctrw model continuous time random walk ctrw formulations have been widely used to quantify non fickian transport berkowitz et al 2006 burnell et al 2017 muljadi et al 2017 russian et al 2016 scher et al 2010 in the ctrw framework transport processes are conceptualized as a series of temporal transitions om space of particles in one dimension the laplace transformed concentration c x u can be expressed as eq t10 in table 1 the memory function m s t s ϕ s 1 ϕ s accounts for delays here the notation denotes that the term is laplace transformed s t 1 is the laplace variable c 0 is the initial concentration t is the characteristic time v ϕ and d ϕ are the transport velocity and generalized dispersion coefficient respectively the general ctrw model can show to be equivalent to the general mrmt model dentz and berkowitz 2003 yielding a one to one relationship between the waiting time distribution ϕ t and the memory function g t si the pdf ϕ t is the waiting time density and can be regarded as the heart of the ctrw formulation while ctrw and mrmt are mathematically equivalent practical differences exist in typically applied formulations e g the ctrw tpl and the mrmt 3 which will both be used in this study each have specific forms of ϕ t and g t so they are not the same model for the ctrw tpl ϕ s has the form 3 ϕ s 1 τ 2 s t 1 δ exp t 1 s γ δ τ 2 1 t 1 s γ δ τ 2 1 0 δ 2 where γ a z is the incomplete gamma function δ is the power law constant that denotes the proxy for the degree of velocity field heterogeneity t 1 is a characteristic transition time that governs the onset of power law region and t 2 is a cut off time that governs the crossover from power law to a decreasing exponential function τ 2 t 2 t 1 for t 1 t t 2 ϕ t t t 1 1 δ the memory function is determined by substitution of the expression above into eq t11 in table 1 with t t 1 2 6 model parameter estimation the log based root mean squared error rmse was computed for each model simulation run as 4 rmse i 1 n log 10 c sim x t i log 10 c obs x t i 2 n where n is the number of time samples in each btc to provide a measure of goodness of fit gof as a result areas of lower concentration in btcs receive greater weight than in the absence of log transformation which is important for assessing anomalous transport characteristics where heavy tails occur at lower concentrations smaller rmse values indicate better agreement between simulated and observed datasets because of the characteristics of the logarithmic function the absolute values of log 10 c sim and log 10 c obs become large when c obs and c sim get close to zero thus we eliminate data points where c sim and corresponding c obs are less than 10 6 when calculating rmse based on the shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm duan et al 1993 muttil et al 2007 we developed the parallel version of sce for parameter estimation in all presented cases the parameters optimized with different models are shown in table 1 the ade model was only applied to the synthetic data due to its poor performance in simulating the late time behavior of btcs the small sample corrected akaike information metric aicc that takes both gof and the number of parameters into account is an effective parameter for model comparison and evaluation for models with varying number of parameters and is given by akpa and unuabonah 2011 anderson and phanikumar 2011 saffron et al 2006 xia et al 2018 5 aicc aic 2 m m 1 n m 1 where aic is the akaike information criterion given by 6 aic n ln s n 2 m n is the number of data points m is the number of model parameters s is the error sum of squares which is log transformed similar to log based rmse to give the same weight to the tails smaller aicc values may be negative indicate better models justified by the data 2 7 sites description the models examined in the present work were evaluated against synthetic breakthrough data generated using the stammt l code for different models mrmt 1 mrmt 2 and mrmt 3 in the synthetic data breakthrough curves were generated at 360 m downstream from the injection location and a value of 0 3 m3s 1 was used for the discharge q in addition field tracer data collected from natural streams were also used to test the models data from both large and small rivers were also used including the red cedar river rcr michigan usa the grand river gr michigan usa uvas creek uc california usa and the ohio river or ohio usa the tracer study of rcr was reported in phanikumar et al 2007 rcr a fourth order stream in south central michigan originates as an outflow from cedar lake michigan and flows through east lansing the study reach is between hagadorn bridge on the east and the kalamazoo street bridge on the west the rcr meanders through the michigan state university msu campus over a stretch of approximately 5 km tracers were released at hagadorn bridge and samples were collected at three downstream sites farm lane kellogg and kalamazoo bridges whose distances from the injection point are 1 4 km 3 1 km and 5 08 km respectively gr is a 420 km long tributary to lake michigan it originates from the city of grand rapids and extends to coopersville the tracer study was conducted on a 40 km stretch of the main stem the ann street bridge near downtown grand rapids was selected as the injection point sampling was carried out at four downstream sites the distances from the injection site are 4 558 km 13 678 km 28 357 km and 37 608 km respectively more details are given in shen et al 2008 uc is a small cobble bed stream located on the eastern slopes of the santa cruz mountains in california the experiment was conducted near the headwaters of uc the experimental reach includes a background monitoring station 15 m above the injection point and five observation stations that are

stammt l are shown in table s2 and the corresponding btcs in fig 1 concentration peaks and peak times of all btcs are approximately equal the btc from mrmt 3 model has the heaviest tail which characterizes the long term mass exchange between the mainstream and hyporheic zones the aicc values are summarized in table 2 and the calibrated parameters are presented in tables s3 s7 since the results from the sfade simulation show negative skewness with β values very close to 1 see tables s7 s11 s14 and s19 we present results mainly for fsts β 1 but also those for fsts β 1 for comparison fig 2 shows the comparison between simulated btcs and synthetic data generated by mrmt 1 as we can see all models reproduced the synthetic btc well both the rmse and aicc values indicate that the fsts model with β 1 shows the best agreement and the fsts β 1 model also produces a good agreement the optimized α values of fsts and sfade are very close to 2 tables s5 and s7 meaning that they both reduce to the traditional ts and ade model for this case parameter β cancels out when α 2 in the fsts and the sfade in general although the rmse values are slightly different all the models fit the exponential case well for the dataset generated by the mrmt 2 fig 3 both the rmse and aicc values indicate that the fsts β 1 performs best aicc 2 1721e3 the fsts β 1 however shows the worst performance the fmim overestimates the tail of the btc compared to fmim the ttfm yields a better simulation but still overestimates the tail the estimated parameter values for fmim are very similar to those of the ttfm table s3 and the better fitting of the tail for ttfm is due to the truncating effect by λ significantly the ctrw tpl and ade do not describe the btc tail well in this case for the dataset generated by mrmt 3 fig 4 whose btc has the most flattened tail the simulation results of ttfm fit the data best aicc 1 8586e3 followed by the fmim the better simulation result of ttfm over the fmim can be attributed to the truncation effect it should be pointed out that the fsts model with β 1 also gives comparable performance the sfade overestimates the late time concentration on the other hand the ade and ctrw tpl underestimate the late time part of the btc in general the fsts model with β 1 captures btcs with different types of heavy tails well in the mrmt 2 case fsts β 1 performs best and the ttfm fits the synthetic data better than did the fmim due to the truncating effect in the power law case even though the ttfm and the fmim give better results the fsts with β 1 also performs well and results in comparable accuracy the fsts with β 1 the ade and the ctrw tpl however did not effectively capture the heavy tailing cases 3 2 comparisons with tracer studies in natural stream 3 2 1 red cedar river optimal parameter values of sfade fmim ttfm ctrw tpl mrmt 1 mrmt 3 and fsts models estimated for tracer experiments conducted on the rcr are presented in tables s8 s12 figs 5 9 show the comparisons between model fits and the observed data the aicc values are summarized in table s13 phanikumar et al 2007 combined tracer data with wavelet decomposition of acoustic doppler current profiler data to separate surface storage from hyporheic storage and indicated that reach 1 was dominated by surface storage in contrast hyporheic exchange mainly contributed to transient storage in reach 3 of the rcr meanwhile reach 2 has comparable contributions of both surface storage and hyporheic exchange consistent with this performance of mrmt 1 is superior to mrmt 3 in reach 1 fig 7 for reach 3 the mrmt 3 fits the tail of btc well but overestimates the leading edge which is better simulated by mrmt 1 however mrmt 1 underestimates the late time concentrations due to the limitation of an exponential rtd similar observations were also made by gooseff et al 2003 for stream reaches in oregon usa both the fsts β 1 and the fsts β 1 fit the observed tracer concentration in reaches 1 and 2 of the rcr well fig 8 for reach 3 the positive skewness β 1 of fsts fits the observed data well for early times from the start of tracer arrival through the passage of the tracer peak but it fits the data poorly at late time t 4 hours however the fsts model with negative skewness β 1 fits the data better over the late time portion of the btc for rcr reach 3 the sfade fits the leading edge well for all the three reaches but predicts longer residence times than the observed data in reach 1 and reach 2 for reach 3 the sfade fits both the early and late time concentration well similarly the fmim overestimates the tail in reach 1 and reach 2 but fits the tailing of btc in reach 3 well compared to the fmim the ttfm yields a better simulation especially for the late time concentration but still overestimates the tails in reach 1 and reach 2 the ctrw tpl fig 9 overestimates late time concentrations lower than 100 but slightly underestimates the concentrations between 100 101 in reach 1 the truncation time t 2 is very large indicating that transition to an exponential tail has not yet occurred in reach 2 and reach 3 the ctrw tpl fits the tail well but overestimates the leading edge the rmse values show that the fsts model with β 1 has the best accuracy over all three reaches one the other hand the aicc values indicate that the fsts β 1 only performs best in reach 1 and reach 2 for reach 3 however the fmim is the best model as it has fewer parameters than the fsts for comparable accuracy 3 2 2 grand river the gr is a relatively large river and the tracer data does not show significant hyporheic storage effects therefore the btcs of the observed data do not show heavy tailing figs s1 s5 show comparisons between the simulation results and observed data optimal parameter values for these simulations are listed in tables s14 s18 and the aicc values are shown in table s19 all models fit reach 3 and reach 4 data well except the ctrw tpl fig s5 and mrmt 3 fig s3 which overestimate the early time concentrations for reach 1 and reach 2 however the mrmt 1 underestimates the late time concentrations while the mrmt 3 model overestimates similarly the sfade fig s1 and the fmim fig s2 models overestimate the late time btc in reach 1 and reach 2 the ttfm gives a better match than fmim since it can better capture the tail of the btc similarly the ctrw tpl fig s5 fits the tail well but shows a deviation at early times the aicc values suggest that the fsts model both β 1 and β 1 performs better than the other models given that the α values are very close to 2 for the fsts the better performance may be mainly attributed to the ts term which is consistent with the mrmt 1 outperforming the mrmt 3 the limited resolution of the observations especially at lower concentrations can lead to underestimation of hyporheic exchange drummond et al 2012 this prevents us from drawing a strong conclusion on which fsts model is best between β 1 and β 1 but for the gr the fsts β 1 is still a promising model 3 2 3 ohio river figs s6 s8 show the simulation of or tracer data best fitting parameters for these simulations are presented in tables s20 s22 the or tracer data are best simulated by the fsts model the optimized velocity values in sfade and fmim 3 0 5 0 ms 1 are significantly larger than observations 0 044 0 065 ms 1 wiley 1997 suggesting perhaps an issue of equifinality the fsts simulations with positive and negative skewness fit the data well except for reach 1 fig s8 where the case with positive skewness underestimates the late time concentration while fsts β 1 gives a better fit meanwhile the α values for both models are very close to 2 except for reach 1 for fsts β 1 indicating that the tails are mainly explained by the ts term for reach 1 part of the tailing phenomenon of the btc is explained by the space fractional term in fsts β 1 both the sfade and the fmim tend to overestimate the tail of the btcs 3 2 4 uvas creek for further comparison between the fsts β 1 and β 1 we only use these two models to fit the uc experimental data as we can see from fig s9 fsts with both positive and negative skewness fit observed data of uc well in reaches 3 4 and 5 however fsts with negative skewness reproduces the observed data better than did the same model with positive skewness especially for the peak and late time portions of btcs the calibrated parameters are listed in table s23 this may indicate that as the center of tracer mass moves downstream with flowing water more tracer particles experience retention in either the surface or subsurface storage zones and appear to have jumped to the upstream direction relative to the plume center of mass the additional storage of solutes i e in addition to storage included in the mobile portion of the fsts model with a first order exchange term can be better described by the fsts negative skewness term with β 1 3 3 model properties to further explore the heavy tail characteristics exhibited by each model the sensitivity of the btc tails was tested fig s10 shows the btcs generated by the sfade with different α values the other parameter values are fixed as β 1 v 1 and d 5 smaller values of α correspond to a heavier tail fig s11 shows the btcs generated by the fsts with different ɛ values the other parameter values are fixed as β 1 d 5 v 0 8 α 1 6 and a s 3 this model assumes backward lévy jumps relative to mass center with the exponential rtd for the tracer transport compared to no storage ɛ 0 this mixed transport makes more mass concentrated in the middle of the tail rather than at late time this is an important characteristic since the ctrw tpl and sfade underestimate the middle portions of btc tails in gr reach 2 which were well simulated by the fsts thus the fsts β 1 is more flexible when simulating late time concentrations the non fickian nature of fmim is governed by two independent parameters β s and γ with different β s values fig s12 the other parameters are set as d 2 v 0 4 and γ 0 63 the slope of the tail does not change but the power law tail appears at lower concentrations as β s decreases for β s 0 the btc will have no heavy tail i e the fmim reduces to the ade on the other hand for different γ values fig s13 other parameters are fixed as d 2 v 0 4 and β s 1 the slope of the tail changes significantly which is similar to the function of α in the sfade and fsts models in the mrmt 3 k is the main parameter that governs the non fickian transport feature fig s14 shows the btcs from mrmt 3 with different values of k other parameters are fixed as v 0 8 d 1 β tot 1 ɛ max 0 5 and ɛ min 1 e 6 as we can see the tail is heavier as k decreases the heavy tails also appear at significantly different concentrations for different k i e k can influence both the slope and the concentrations of the tail in the ctrw tpl the power law constant δ is the main factor that governs the non local feature however as we can see from fig s15 other parameters are set as v 0 8 d 1 log 10 t 1 5 and log 10 t 2 8 the slope of the tail is not very sensitive to the value of δ although the parameter can cansignificantly influence both the peak concentration and the peak time in general the truncation parameter λ in ttfm the ɛ min in mrmt 3 and the t 2 in ctrw tpl all have similar functions i e determining the transition time from power law to exponential decay for example consider the ctrw tpl fit of the synthetic data generated by mrmt 2 by varying the truncating time t 2 the other parameter values are the same as those estimated for mrmt 2 synthetic data the tails of btcs decrease sharply at different times fig s16 4 discussion 4 1 the physical interpretation of β in fsts and sfade the stochastic models underlying the fsts and the sfade equations are solute particles undergoing deterministic drift with random heavy tailed jumps superimposed when solute particles are mobile to date a controversy associated with such heavy tailed random jumps is that long distance and long term backward dispersion i e negative skewness in the fsts and sfade are unphysical zhang et al 2009 that is the physical interpretation of this backward skewness when applied to streamflow remains controversial deng et al 2004 zhang et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 as it does not make sense for particles to make such large upstream jumps traveling against the mean flow our results which are consistent with other studies chakraborty et al 2009 kelly and meerschaert 2017 show that the optimal values of β are very close to 1 indicating that models with negative skewness may be suitable for solute transport modeling particularly for cases with she in order to reconcile this we must understand the physical meaning of the parameter β to this end we present btcs generated by the fsts model for different values of β in appendix b in an open channel system many factors including channel morphology can affect transport of solutes the existence of hyporheic zones solutes moving into and out of near bed sediments or surface transient storage ensign and doyle 2005 such as side pools and other in channel features can both retain solutes other immobile objects can also hinder the migration of solutes in the mobile phase such as fallen trees vegetation large stones in the river bottom and organic debris briggs et al 2009 kelly and meerschaert 2017 2019 argued that when the bulk of the plume travels downstream since the center of mass moves downstream while the solute particles remain at rest for a relatively long time due to retention the particles seem to be displaced in the upstream direction relative to the plume center of mass kelly and meerschaert 2017 2019 mathematically proved that long upstream particle jumps described by negative skewed space fractional models and long resting times described by time fractional models are two sides of the same coin by using space time duality appendix a our results further reinforce this message via fitting of real world data thus if we accept this physical and mathematical interpretation the fsts model with β 1 is a valid representation of the underlying physics 4 2 analysis of model performance 4 2 1 the sfade model based on our results the sfade tends to overestimate the late time concentration in the natural stream reaches without she in the heavy tailing synthetic cases i e data from mrmt 2 and mrmt 3 the sfade shows poorer performance than the fmim as is known a smaller α corresponds to a higher probability of long distance jumps i e a flatter tail compared to the fmim the major limitation of the sfade is that it does not explicitly distinguish mobile and immobile phases boano et al 2007 zhang et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 pointed out that the fmim can explain mass decline as it describes the dynamic partitioning of solute mass into the immobile phase and the rate coefficient between the mobile and immobile phases was described by the fractional derivative in time while the simpler sfade model eq t3 in table 1 cannot account for the loss of mobile mass this loss of mass is captured by the fsts eqs t1 and t2 in table 1 which uses a first order mass transfer between mobile and immobile regions but one of the advantages of the sfade over the time nonlocal methods is that it can simulate early arrivals for β 0 zhang et al 2009 4 2 2 the fmim and ttfm models as presented in section 3 3 the fmim has two independent parameters β s and γ that characterize nonlocal behavior a larger value of β s and a smaller γ correspond to a flatter tail the parameter β s in fmim has a physical interpretation and it can be defined as the ratio of volume of the immobile to mobile zones schumer et al 2003 or as the ratio of expected time in the immobile versus mobile zones benson and meerschaert 2009 γ denotes the power law decay rate of concentration with time we find that the fmim fits the cases with she reach 3 in rcr and the synthetic case corresponding to mrmt 3 very well but tends to overestimate tailing in cases without she the ttfm provides additional flexibility by exponentially truncating the tail via an additional parameter λ meerschaert et al 2008 which is functionally equivalent to ɛ min note however that the gain may be minimal although the rmse values show a slightly better performance of ttfm the aicc indicates that the fmim is better due to lesser number of parameters 4 2 3 the ctrw tpl model for the synthetic cases the ctrw tpl performs poorly particularly in capturing heavy tailing when fitting the observed data it tends to overestimate the leading edge of btcs three additional parameters over an ade are of interest t 1 t 2 and δ t 1 roughly sets a starting point for power law tailing that is cut off at t 2 but as pointed out by haggerty et al 2000 t 1 is of minor importance when capturing the late time tailing in our tests the slope of the btc tail does not change significantly fig s15 this may be due to the fact that the power law regime from t 1 to t 2 is not long enough however a tempered power law can have an observed or inferred slope due to the interaction of the tempering time when truncated at a specific time t 2 the tail of btc declines rapidly exponentially when t t 2 see fig s16 but this decrease is too quick to effectively capture the tail from the synthetic btc thus in this context it appears that the ctrw tpl has limited ability to effectively capture different types of heavy tails although it has had much success in other applications e g burnell et al 2017 4 2 4 the mrmt 1 and mrmt 3 models in the cases without she the mrmt 1 performs well but it underestimates the tail of the btc significantly in the mrmt 1 rtd of the solute in storage is assumed to be exponential wagener et al 2002 this is a significant limitation since the exponential rtd is not appropriate for characterizing late time behaviors which are better characterized by power law tailing as solutes are retained in the storage zones for prolonged periods of time aubeneau et al 2014 gooseff et al 2003 the mrmt 3 can give a better match for the late time data but presents higher concentrations for early arrivals which are still better simulated by mrmt 1 in mrmt 3 the parameter k governs the power law distribution of mass exchange rate in the range of ɛ min ɛ ɛ max ɛ min and ɛ max are functionally equivalent to the inverse of the t 2 and t 1 lu et al 2018 thus k can control the slope of the late time btc in a log log plot a larger k leads to a faster decline of the late time btc however k also impacts the concentration values at which the heavy tail appears in our tests the concentration value where the heavy tail occurs increase as k decreases in the range from 3 5 to 2 0 fig s14 when k 2 0 the tails of btcs are flatter as k decreases however more solute mass is concentrated in the peaks and heavy tails appear at significantly lower concentrations with the enhancement of trapping effects more solute tends to be distributed in the tail rather than the peak of the btc so heavier trailing is more likely to begin at higher concentrations similar to the effect of the α in sfade fig s10 and γ in fmim fig s13 thus the changes of k in the mrmt 3 produce an irregular variation of the btc tail 4 2 5 the fsts model with β 1 in our study both the rmse and the aicc values indicate that the fsts β 1 model performs well in all cases the fsts is an extension of the ts model with a fractional dispersion term in the mobile zone in the fsts the tracer particles experience lévy jumps while mobile and exponential rtds when trapped when β 1 the space fractional term predicts large distance of upstream migrations but this upstream migration is relative to the center of mass that moves downstream with flowing water rather than a stationary river bed in this context it can be regarded as backward migration relative to the center of mass of the migrating tracer plume when part of the tracer mass has a lower velocity relative to the center of mass see fig 10 in rivers turbulent eddies meander bends and pools side pockets local scale river bed topography variations fallen trees within a channel could all lead to lower transport velocity of the trapped solutes relative to the center of mass of the tracer plume additionally zhang et al 2019 showed that the negatively skewed sfade is also physically meaningful when describing the non fickan transport in a river and could capture the heavy tail in a btc similar to the time fractional ade thus when trapping in the physical system is short term retention exponential rtd it can be explicitly modeled in the fsts using a first order exchange with an immobile region as in the classic ts model e g reach 1 and reach 2 in rcr for the long term trapping e g larger hyporheic zones or deep hyporheic flow paths heavy tails are captured by the space fractional term with β 1 e g reach 1 in ohio river and reach 3 in rcr again here we invoke the mathematical equivalence and interpretation of kelly and meershaert 2017 2019 that the fractional in space jumps are equivalent to heavy tailing waiting due to space time duality the fsts seems to hit the sweet spot between other models only having surface transient storage ts in a model typically underestimates late time concentrations in cases with she in the fsts these two types of storage seem to be better balanced whether the negative skewness term in the model is the correct way to represent the physics is likely still open to debate and comes down to whether one accepts the interpretation of the backward skewed space fractional term as representing lower velocities relative to the center of mass of the tracer plume rather than upstream jumps of tracer particles relative to the river bed regardless the fsts was able to describe different types of observed tailing behaviors although the parameters in a model may have interactions with one another the sensitivity analysis of the btc tails can also explain the characteristics of the models used in this study 4 3 comparison of the fsts β 1 and the ttfm although the ttfm truncates the power law tail the resulting model can be used to represent transport in streams however as we can see from fig s16 the truncation can lead to a decay of tracer mass that is too fast compared to the tail of the synthetic data generated using mrmt 2 the rationale behind truncation of tails in the ttfm is that natural rivers are finite systems and transport of tracers must eventually converge to a finite mean and variance aubeneau et al 2014 2016 even at very late times but when tracers are trapped in immobile zones and never come out i e infinite residence time those assumptions are violated exchanges of water and solutes with the immobile zone will produce a delay in solute transport relative to the channel flow and lead to long tails in concentration btcs boano et al 2007 different storage zones e g surface storage zones and deep hyporheic zones can also lead to different types of rtd the power law tail mathematically represented by the space fractional term in the fsts balanced by the exponential rtd term in the fsts performs better in capturing the btcs 5 conclusions although a rigorous but complex mathematical interrelation exists between ctrw mrmt and fade models in their most commonly applied forms differences in memory or rtd functions lead to different classes of non fickian sub models in general these models have different numbers of parameters with varying physical interpretations the highlight of this study is a comparison and evaluation of seven anomalous transport models summarized in table 1 parameter estimation for these seven models was performed with both synthetic and field data and the fits were quantitatively compared with a log based rmse and corrected aic aicc metrics compared to the sfade ctrw tpl and mrmt 3 the fmim performs better while the fmim can overestimate late time tailing in concentrations improvements with the truncating scheme in ttfm appear limited as the truncating time may lead to a decay of concentrations that is too fast in contrast the fsts β 1 modeling upstream jumps mathematically equivalent to power law waiting times due to space time duality see appendix a and balanced by an exponential rtd better estimates both early and late time portions of the btcs both the rmse and aicc indicate that the fsts with negative skewness estimates the btcs with greater fidelity both with and without she in addition the fsts model could also serve as a useful and efficient diagnostic tool to assess the nature of storage in a stream reach surface versus deep hyporheic thus by fitting the tracer data to the fsts model with positive β 1 and negative β 1 skewness values users can quickly assess the relative importance of hyporheic storage in a given reach so that more appropriate models can be selected for further analysis however whether the negatively skewed space fractional term is truly physically meaningful is open to debate and depends on whether one accepts the interpretation of this term as representing a slower transport velocity or waiting relative to the mass center rather than upstream jumps relative to the river bed additionally our current conclusions should only be applied in the context of conservative transport as non conservative reactive transport in systems displaying anomalous transport can be very different from those predicted by naively adding chemical reaction terms to the governing equations bolster et al 2010 bolster et al 2017 credit authorship contribution

and acknowledges support of the chief of naval research via the base 6 1 support program appendix a space time duality the negatively skewed derivative in the sfade and fsts models with β 1 models long power law upstream jumps as noted by zhang et al 2009 these upstream jumps or negative dispersion appear unphysical however due to the advection term in the sfade these upstream jumps are relative to the center of mass in the underlying random walk hence in the sfade model a particle moves downstream due to advection and then may jump back upstream in the fractional in time ade model the particle remains upstream while the bulk of the plume moves downstream in both models the particle ends up behind the plume center of mass resulting in an effective delay or retention hence there are two separate and equivalent descriptions for the same underlying mechanism retention thus resolving the controversy between the sfade and the fractional time ade for river flows this simple observation may be understood mathematically using space time duality baeumer et al 2009 kelly and meerschaert 2017 2019 for simplicity consider the sfade t3 with β 1 v 0 and d 1 a1 t c x t α x α c x t applying a fourier transform ft with respect to both x and t yields a2 i ω i k α c k ω 0 where k is the wave number and ω is the angular frequency the bracketed dispersion relationship is equivalent to i ω γ i k where γ 1 α substituting back into a 1 and inverting the fourier transform leads to the dual equation a3 γ t γ c x t x c x t which is a special case of the fractional in time ade with v 1 and d 0 where the left hand side uses a caputo derivative note that the order of the time fractional derivative γ ranges from 0 5 to 1 this may be made rigorous using a complex plane argument kelly and meerschaert 2017 if the advection term in the sfade is retained it is shown in kelly and meerschaert 2017 that the dual time fractional pde involves the fractional material derivative sokolov and metzler 2003 the resulting coupled space time fractional pde see eq 28 in kelly and meerschaert 2017 governs power law waiting times in a moving reference frame or retention relative to plume center of mass using this duality analysis negative derivative term in the sfade and the fsts can effectively model power law retention we note that this analysis is restricted to fractional models with constant coefficients in either an unbounded domain or a reflecting boundary at x 0 appendix b btcs generated by the fsts model with different values of β the btcs generated by the fsts model with different values of β are presented in fig b1 other parameters were fixed as d 0 7 α 1 9 v 1 2 a s 5 and ɛ 3 10 3 the total mass under each of the btcs is the same for all values of β as we can see from fig b1 when β 1 the btc shows a flattened tail at late times and a sharp leading edge when β 1 however the resulting btc has a flattened leading edge and the tail is steep instead fig s4 also shows similar phenomenon thus a larger β value results in a btc with a more flattened leading edge when β 0 the btc is approximately symmetric with heavy leading edge and tailing on both sides in addition we note that the peaks of all btcs are almost synchronous regardless of the value of β as these are dictated mostly by the deterministic drift appendix c supplementary data supplementary data

in chief with the assistance of habib basha associate editor continuous time random walks ctrw multi rate mass transfer mrmt and fractional advection dispersion equations fades are three promising models of anomalous transport as commonly found in natural streams although these paradigms are mathematically related understanding their advantages and limitations poses a challenge for model selection in this paper we quantitatively evaluate the advection dispersion equation ade fractional mobile immobile fmim fractional in space ade sfade fractional in space transient storage fsts truncated time fractional model ttfm and ctrw models with truncated power law waiting time distribution ctrw tpl by fitting them first to synthetic data we then applied these models to observations from tracer experiments conducted in several rivers based on the extensive analysis we conclude that the performance of the fsts model in particular the model with negative skewness β 1 is comparable or superior to the other nonlocal models evaluated in the paper therefore the model represents an alternative to existing models for simulating stream solute transport for spatially homogeneous flows keywords transient storage fractional derivative hyporheic zone continuous time random walk 1 introduction anomalous or non fickian transport of solutes is often found in streams at all scales burnell et al 2017 edery et al 2010 liu et al 2017 shen and phanikumar 2009 vishal and leung 2015 exchange of water and solutes with the hyporheic zone produces delays in transport relative to the mainstream flow often leading to long or heavy tails in concentration breakthrough curves btcs boano et al 2007 after decades of effort modeling of non fickian transport of tracers continues to be a challenging problem beyond being a purely academic problem observed heavy tails play a critical role in the transport of toxic chemicals where underestimation poses more risk while overestimation can increase cleanup costs de barros et al 2013 among many others three anomalous nonlocal models are most widely used in hydrology these are continuous time random walks ctrw multi rate mass transfer mrmt and fractional advection dispersion equations fade these models are mathematically interrelated as reviewed in the supplementary material si for example an analytical relationship between mrmt and ctrw is established in dentz and berkowitz 2003 the fractional in time and fractional in space ades are limit forms of ctrws metzler and klafter 2000 schumer et al 2009 the fractional in time ade can be shown to be mathematically equivalent to the fractional in space ade via space time duality kelly and meerschaert 2017 2019 in addition the fractional mobile immobile model fmim is derived from the mrmt with a special memory function schumer et al 2003 while the overarching frameworks are related choices of special memory functions or residence time distributions rtds have resulted in particularly popular sub models such as the ctrw with a truncated power law waiting time distribution function ctrw tpl the single rate mrmt model mrmt 1 hereafter the lognormal diffusion rate mrmt mrmt 2 hereafter and the power law distribution of mass exchange rates mrmt model mrmt 3 hereafter in addition new forms of fades were introduced in hydrology such as the fractional mobile immobile fmim model the truncated time fractional model ttfm and the fractional in space transient storage model fsts the governing equations and nonlocal characteristics of the above models are summarized in table 1 the models in table 1 are based on different underlying physical assumptions most obviously they have different parameters each of which has a different physical interpretation and ranges of values despite significant progress in application of these models to describe solute transport in streams the wide range of available sub models and the complex relationships among them can be sources of confusion for selecting the best model for a given situation e g solute transport in a river with significant hyporheic effect she that follows either a power law or an exponential rtd in particular models with a large number of parameters also present the problem that they are difficult to optimize and could suffer from equifinality therefore one of the objectives of this work was to address the following question taking the number of model parameters into account which model best captures btcs with heavy tails to address this question we briefly review the interrelations between the different models first see si then we generate synthetic data corresponding to different residence time distributions using the mrmt 1 mrmt 2 and mrmt 3 models and test the ability of the other non local models to reproduce the synthetic data finally we further evaluate all the models using tracer data from rivers with and without she this paper further explores the connection between space fractional equations and other ctrw and mrmt approaches using numerical simulations and fits to observed tracer data to provide a clear physical and stochastic interpretation for space fractional models in river flow hydrology the fsts model considered in our work is essentially the well known transient storage ts model bencala and walters 1983 runkel and chapra 1993 runkel 1998 with the second order dispersion term in the ts model replaced with a more general fractional derivative term that includes positive and negative skewness terms the ts model was applied extensively to address questions involving conservative and reactive transport in streams and rivers in the past a major advantage of the model is that its parameters can be directly measured in the field using detailed velocity measurements or tracer studies or both carr and rehmann 2007 shen et al 2010 phanikumar et al 2007 the second order dispersion term in the ts model has been a source of some confusion in the ts modeling literature as some researchers found that a dispersion term was not needed to describe solute transport in some stream reaches gupta and cvetkovic 2000 wörman 1998 the analytical solution of the ts model de smedt et al 2005 follows an exponential residence time distribution representing solute retention in either surface storage zones or shallow hyporheic regions but not in deep hyporheic zones this separation of surface and deep hyporheic storage contributions is important for biogeochemical processes within streams e g denitrification and has been the focus of previous research e g briggs et al 2009 one of the objectives of the paper is to further evaluate the fsts model for its ability to represent both surface and hyporheic storages within a stream reach and to compare the performance of this model with other nonlocal approaches in section 2 we describe the different models considered in this paper to understand the physical meaning of different parameters in the models we evaluate the models using synthetic data generated using the three synthetic mrmt cases in addition we also compare parameter estimates based on the sfade fsts fmim ttfm ctrw tpl mrmt 1 and mrmt 3 models with rhodamine wt rwt and sodium chloride tracer data collected in a total of 17 reaches in 4 different rivers we also examine the physical interpretation of the backward dispersion term in the fsts and sfade models given there is a debate related to previous studies as to whether this reflects a true physical process or an unphysical mathematical representation zhang et al 2009 in addition we compare the sfade and fsts models to understand if there is any advantage of fsts over sfade and other time non local models finally we summarize our results and findings in the conclusion section 2 methods 2 1 the fsts and sfade model the fsts model deng et al 2006 shen and phanikumar 2009 assumes a first order mass exchange between the main channel and a storage zones eqs t1 and t2 in table 1 c is the solute concentration in the main channel m l 3 l is the unit of distance c s is the concentration in the storage zone m l 3 v is the average water velocity l t 1 d is the coefficient of longitudinal dispersion l α t 1 x is the space coordinate in the flow direction l t is time t ɛ is a first order exchange coefficient t 1 a is the main channel cross sectional area l 2 a s is the size of the storage zones l 2 c l is the concentration associated with lateral inflow and q l l 3 t 1 l 1 is the lateral inflow rate the order of the fractional riemann liouville rl derivative in 1 is α 1 2 while the parameter β 1 1 controls the skewness when β 0 dispersion in the main channel is symmetric when β 0 the solution of the fsts is skewed backward while when β 0 the solution is skewed forward zhang et al 2005 when α 2 the fsts reduces to the classical ts model for any choice of skewness β the fractional in space advection dispersion equation sfade is a special case of the fsts with ɛ q l 0 which only includes the mobile channel concentration eq t3 in table 1 the analytical solution for sfade with a pulse injection in an infinite domain i e no boundary condition benson et al 2000 is used in this study since the rl derivative of a constant is not zero specifying boundary conditions for the continuous slug release and pulse injection of a tracer of a known constant concentration in a stream is problematic baeumer et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 to mitigate this in this work the fsts model is formulated by using the caputo definition the fsts models were implemented using a mass conserving control volume method based on the caputo fractional derivative as described in zhang et al 2005 2007 boundary conditions for the fsts model at the inlet and outlet correspond to a specified concentration and free drainage zero flux conditions respectively see eq 18 in zhang et al 2007 computational domain lengths of each case are summarized in table s1 supplementary material 2 2 fmim model to explicitly model the mobile main channel and immobile storage zones using fractional calculus schumer et al 2003 developed the fractional mobile immobile fmim model eq t4 in table 1 c m is the main channel mobile zone concentration γ is the fractional derivative order and β s t γ is the fractional capacity coefficient the term γ t γ is the fractional rl derivative on the half axis v is velocity l t 1 and d l 2 t 1 is the dispersion coefficient when γ 1 the fmim reduces to the classic ade with a retardation factor 1 β s an analytical solution to 5 with a pulse initial condition on an unbounded domain can be computed using a stable subordinator density schumer et al 2003 and is implemented in fracfit kelly et al 2017 the fmim is a different model from the fractional in time ade ftade γ p t γ v p x d 2 p x 2 which is a limit form the ctrw metzler and klafter 2000 the stochastic process of the fmim can be viewed as a power law residence time immobile state among the brownian motion with drift mobile process mobile state benson and meerschaert 2009 2 3 the ttfm model exponentially tempering heavy tailed power law distributions in fmim produces a residence time distribution with a finite mean yielding a truncated time fractional ade i e the ttfm meerschaert et al 2008 see eq t5 in table 1 in ttfm γ is functionally equivalent to that in fmim λ 0 is the truncation parameter that controls the rtd transition from a power law to an exponential when t 1 λ the mobile zone concentration decays as power law as in fmim at later times t 1 λ the tail of the mobile phase btc decays exponentially 2 4 mrmt model the basic form of mrmt can be expressed as haggerty and gorelick 1995 1 c m t i 1 n β i c im i t v c m x d 2 c m x 2 2 c im i t ɛ i c m c im i where c m is the concentration of the mobile zone c im i is the concentration of the i th immobile zone ɛ i is the first order rate coefficient of between the i th immobile zone and mobile zone when i 1 the mrmt reduces to the single rate mass exchange model eqs t6 and t7 in table 1 for the case of a continuous distribution of rate coefficients eq 1 can be written as eq t8 in table 1 in this form b ɛ is the pdf of the first order exchange rate coefficients and β tot 0 b ɛ d ɛ denotes the capacity coefficient stammt l is a code for the mrmt model and offers user specified mass exchange rate coefficients in this study we choose the single rate mass transfer model the lognormal distribution diffusion rate model haggerty and gorelick 1998 and the power law distribution of first order mass transfer rates model to generate the synthetic data sets in appendix b we show their specific functional forms 2 5 ctrw model continuous time random walk ctrw formulations have been widely used to quantify non fickian transport berkowitz et al 2006 burnell et al 2017 muljadi et al 2017 russian et al 2016 scher et al 2010 in the ctrw framework transport processes are conceptualized as a series of temporal transitions om space of particles in one dimension the laplace transformed concentration c x u can be expressed as eq t10 in table 1 the memory function m s t s ϕ s 1 ϕ s accounts for delays here the notation denotes that the term is laplace transformed s t 1 is the laplace variable c 0 is the initial concentration t is the characteristic time v ϕ and d ϕ are the transport velocity and generalized dispersion coefficient respectively the general ctrw model can show to be equivalent to the general mrmt model dentz and berkowitz 2003 yielding a one to one relationship between the waiting time distribution ϕ t and the memory function g t si the pdf ϕ t is the waiting time density and can be regarded as the heart of the ctrw formulation while ctrw and mrmt are mathematically equivalent practical differences exist in typically applied formulations e g the ctrw tpl and the mrmt 3 which will both be used in this study each have specific forms of ϕ t and g t so they are not the same model for the ctrw tpl ϕ s has the form 3 ϕ s 1 τ 2 s t 1 δ exp t 1 s γ δ τ 2 1 t 1 s γ δ τ 2 1 0 δ 2 where γ a z is the incomplete gamma function δ is the power law constant that denotes the proxy for the degree of velocity field heterogeneity t 1 is a characteristic transition time that governs the onset of power law region and t 2 is a cut off time that governs the crossover from power law to a decreasing exponential function τ 2 t 2 t 1 for t 1 t t 2 ϕ t t t 1 1 δ the memory function is determined by substitution of the expression above into eq t11 in table 1 with t t 1 2 6 model parameter estimation the log based root mean squared error rmse was computed for each model simulation run as 4 rmse i 1 n log 10 c sim x t i log 10 c obs x t i 2 n where n is the number of time samples in each btc to provide a measure of goodness of fit gof as a result areas of lower concentration in btcs receive greater weight than in the absence of log transformation which is important for assessing anomalous transport characteristics where heavy tails occur at lower concentrations smaller rmse values indicate better agreement between simulated and observed datasets because of the characteristics of the logarithmic function the absolute values of log 10 c sim and log 10 c obs become large when c obs and c sim get close to zero thus we eliminate data points where c sim and corresponding c obs are less than 10 6 when calculating rmse based on the shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm duan et al 1993 muttil et al 2007 we developed the parallel version of sce for parameter estimation in all presented cases the parameters optimized with different models are shown in table 1 the ade model was only applied to the synthetic data due to its poor performance in simulating the late time behavior of btcs the small sample corrected akaike information metric aicc that takes both gof and the number of parameters into account is an effective parameter for model comparison and evaluation for models with varying number of parameters and is given by akpa and unuabonah 2011 anderson and phanikumar 2011 saffron et al 2006 xia et al 2018 5 aicc aic 2 m m 1 n m 1 where aic is the akaike information criterion given by 6 aic n ln s n 2 m n is the number of data points m is the number of model parameters s is the error sum of squares which is log transformed similar to log based rmse to give the same weight to the tails smaller aicc values may be negative indicate better models justified by the data 2 7 sites description the models examined in the present work were evaluated against synthetic breakthrough data generated using the stammt l code for different models mrmt 1 mrmt 2 and mrmt 3 in the synthetic data breakthrough curves were generated at 360 m downstream from the injection location and a value of 0 3 m3s 1 was used for the discharge q in addition field tracer data collected from natural streams were also used to test the models data from both large and small rivers were also used including the red cedar river rcr michigan usa the grand river gr michigan usa uvas creek uc california usa and the ohio river or ohio usa the tracer study of rcr was reported in phanikumar et al 2007 rcr a fourth order stream in south central michigan originates as an outflow from cedar lake michigan and flows through east lansing the study reach is between hagadorn bridge on the east and the kalamazoo street bridge on the west the rcr meanders through the michigan state university msu campus over a stretch of approximately 5 km tracers were released at hagadorn bridge and samples were collected at three downstream sites farm lane kellogg and kalamazoo bridges whose distances from the injection point are 1 4 km 3 1 km and 5 08 km respectively gr is a 420 km long tributary to lake michigan it originates from the city of grand rapids and extends to coopersville the tracer study was conducted on a 40 km stretch of the main stem the ann street bridge near downtown grand rapids was selected as the injection point sampling was carried out at four downstream sites the distances from the injection site are 4 558 km 13 678 km 28 357 km and 37 608 km respectively more details are given in shen et al 2008 uc is a small cobble bed stream located on the eastern slopes of the santa cruz mountains in california the experiment was conducted near the headwaters of uc the experimental reach includes a background monitoring station 15 m above the injection point and five observation stations that are 38 m 105 m 281 m 433 m 619 m downstream from the injection point respectively details are available in avanzino et al 1984 or originates at the confluence of the allegheny and monongahela rivers and flows westward to the border of pennsylvania ohio and west virginia and then flows southwest ward along the ohio and west virginia border the observation sites were at 21 405 km 51 017 km 64 697 km 87 549 km and 135 508 km from the injection point respectively see wilely 1997 for details 3 results 3 1 comparisons with synthetic data parameter values used to generate the synthetic datasets with stammt l are shown in table s2 and the corresponding btcs in fig 1 concentration peaks and peak times of all btcs are approximately equal the btc from mrmt 3 model has the heaviest tail which characterizes the long term mass exchange between the mainstream and hyporheic zones the aicc values are summarized in table 2 and the calibrated parameters are presented in tables s3 s7 since the results from the sfade simulation show negative skewness with β values very close to 1 see tables s7 s11 s14 and s19 we present results mainly for fsts β 1 but also those for fsts β 1 for comparison fig 2 shows the comparison between simulated btcs and synthetic data generated by mrmt 1 as we can see all models reproduced the synthetic btc well both the rmse and aicc values indicate that the fsts model with β 1 shows the best agreement and the fsts β 1 model also produces a good agreement the optimized α values of fsts and sfade are very close to 2 tables s5 and s7 meaning that they both reduce to the traditional ts and ade model for this case parameter β cancels out when α 2 in the fsts and the sfade in general although the rmse values are slightly different all the models fit the exponential case well for the dataset generated by the mrmt 2 fig 3 both the rmse and aicc values indicate that the fsts β 1 performs best aicc 2 1721e3 the fsts β 1 however shows the worst performance the fmim overestimates the tail of the btc compared to fmim the ttfm yields a better simulation but still overestimates the tail the estimated parameter values for fmim are very similar to those of the ttfm table s3 and the better fitting of the tail for ttfm is due to the truncating effect by λ significantly the ctrw tpl and ade do not describe the btc tail well in this case for the dataset generated by mrmt 3 fig 4 whose btc has the most flattened tail the simulation results of ttfm fit the data best aicc 1 8586e3 followed by the fmim the better simulation result of ttfm over the fmim can be attributed to the truncation effect it should be pointed out that the fsts model with β 1 also gives comparable performance the sfade overestimates the late time concentration on the other hand the ade and ctrw tpl underestimate the late time part of the btc in general the fsts model with β 1 captures btcs with different types of heavy tails well in the mrmt 2 case fsts β 1 performs best and the ttfm fits the synthetic data better than did the fmim due to the truncating effect in the power law case even though the ttfm and the fmim give better results the fsts with β 1 also performs well and results in comparable accuracy the fsts with β 1 the ade and the ctrw tpl however did not effectively capture the heavy tailing cases 3 2 comparisons with tracer studies in natural stream 3 2 1 red cedar river optimal parameter values of sfade fmim ttfm ctrw tpl mrmt 1 mrmt 3 and fsts models estimated for tracer experiments conducted on the rcr are presented in tables s8 s12 figs 5 9 show the comparisons between model fits and the observed data the aicc values are summarized in table s13 phanikumar et al 2007 combined tracer data with wavelet decomposition of acoustic doppler current profiler data to separate surface storage from hyporheic storage and indicated that reach 1 was dominated by surface storage in contrast hyporheic exchange mainly contributed to transient storage in reach 3 of the rcr meanwhile reach 2 has comparable contributions of both surface storage and hyporheic exchange consistent with this performance of mrmt 1 is superior to mrmt 3 in reach 1 fig 7 for reach 3 the mrmt 3 fits the tail of btc well but overestimates the leading edge which is better simulated by mrmt 1 however mrmt 1 underestimates the late time concentrations due to the limitation of an exponential rtd similar observations were also made by gooseff et al 2003 for stream reaches in oregon usa both the fsts β 1 and the fsts β 1 fit the observed tracer concentration in reaches 1 and 2 of the rcr well fig 8 for reach 3 the positive skewness β 1 of fsts fits the observed data well for early times from the start of tracer arrival through the passage of the tracer peak but it fits the data poorly at late time t 4 hours however the fsts model with negative skewness β 1 fits the data better over the late time portion of the btc for rcr reach 3 the sfade fits the leading edge well for all the three reaches but predicts longer residence times than the observed data in reach 1 and reach 2 for reach 3 the sfade fits both the early and late time concentration well similarly the fmim overestimates the tail in reach 1 and reach 2 but fits the tailing of btc in reach 3 well compared to the fmim the ttfm yields a better simulation especially for the late time concentration but still overestimates the tails in reach 1 and reach 2 the ctrw tpl fig 9 overestimates late time concentrations lower than 100 but slightly underestimates the concentrations between 100 101 in reach 1 the truncation time t 2 is very large indicating that transition to an exponential tail has not yet occurred in reach 2 and reach 3 the ctrw tpl fits the tail well but overestimates the leading edge the rmse values show that the fsts model with β 1 has the best accuracy over all three reaches one the other hand the aicc values indicate that the fsts β 1 only performs best in reach 1 and reach 2 for reach 3 however the fmim is the best model as it has fewer parameters than the fsts for comparable accuracy 3 2 2 grand river the gr is a relatively large river and the tracer data does not show significant hyporheic storage effects therefore the btcs of the observed data do not show heavy tailing figs s1 s5 show comparisons between the simulation results and observed data optimal parameter values for these simulations are listed in tables s14 s18 and the aicc values are shown in table s19 all models fit reach 3 and reach 4 data well except the ctrw tpl fig s5 and mrmt 3 fig s3 which overestimate the early time concentrations for reach 1 and reach 2 however the mrmt 1 underestimates the late time concentrations while the mrmt 3 model overestimates similarly the sfade fig s1 and the fmim fig s2 models overestimate the late time btc in reach 1 and reach 2 the ttfm gives a better match than fmim since it can better capture the tail of the btc similarly the ctrw tpl fig s5 fits the tail well but shows a deviation at early times the aicc values suggest that the fsts model both β 1 and β 1 performs better than the other models given that the α values are very close to 2 for the fsts the better performance may be mainly attributed to the ts term which is consistent with the mrmt 1 outperforming the mrmt 3 the limited resolution of the observations especially at lower concentrations can lead to underestimation of hyporheic exchange drummond et al 2012 this prevents us from drawing a strong conclusion on which fsts model is best between β 1 and β 1 but for the gr the fsts β 1 is still a promising model 3 2 3 ohio river figs s6 s8 show the simulation of or tracer data best fitting parameters for these simulations are presented in tables s20 s22 the or tracer data are best simulated by the fsts model the optimized velocity values in sfade and fmim 3 0 5 0 ms 1 are significantly larger than observations 0 044 0 065 ms 1 wiley 1997 suggesting perhaps an issue of equifinality the fsts simulations with positive and negative skewness fit the data well except for reach 1 fig s8 where the case with positive skewness underestimates the late time concentration while fsts β 1 gives a better fit meanwhile the α values for both models are very close to 2 except for reach 1 for fsts β 1 indicating that the tails are mainly explained by the ts term for reach 1 part of the tailing phenomenon of the btc is explained by the space fractional term in fsts β 1 both the sfade and the fmim tend to overestimate the tail of the btcs 3 2 4 uvas creek for further comparison between the fsts β 1 and β 1 we only use these two models to fit the uc experimental data as we can see from fig s9 fsts with both positive and negative skewness fit observed data of uc well in reaches 3 4 and 5 however fsts with negative skewness reproduces the observed data better than did the same model with positive skewness especially for the peak and late time portions of btcs the calibrated parameters are listed in table s23 this may indicate that as the center of tracer mass moves downstream with flowing water more tracer particles experience retention in either the surface or subsurface storage zones and appear to have jumped to the upstream direction relative to the plume center of mass the additional storage of solutes i e in addition to storage included in the mobile portion of the fsts model with a first order exchange term can be better described by the fsts negative skewness term with β 1 3 3 model properties to further explore the heavy tail characteristics exhibited by each model the sensitivity of the btc tails was tested fig s10 shows the btcs generated by the sfade with different α values the other parameter values are fixed as β 1 v 1 and d 5 smaller values of α correspond to a heavier tail fig s11 shows the btcs generated by the fsts with different ɛ values the other parameter values are fixed as β 1 d 5 v 0 8 α 1 6 and a s 3 this model assumes backward lévy jumps relative to mass center with the exponential rtd for the tracer transport compared to no storage ɛ 0 this mixed transport makes more mass concentrated in the middle of the tail rather than at late time this is an important characteristic since the ctrw tpl and sfade underestimate the middle portions of btc tails in gr reach 2 which were well simulated by the fsts thus the fsts β 1 is more flexible when simulating late time concentrations the non fickian nature of fmim is governed by two independent parameters β s and γ with different β s values fig s12 the other parameters are set as d 2 v 0 4 and γ 0 63 the slope of the tail does not change but the power law tail appears at lower concentrations as β s decreases for β s 0 the btc will have no heavy tail i e the fmim reduces to the ade on the other hand for different γ values fig s13 other parameters are fixed as d 2 v 0 4 and β s 1 the slope of the tail changes significantly which is similar to the function of α in the sfade and fsts models in the mrmt 3 k is the main parameter that governs the non fickian transport feature fig s14 shows the btcs from mrmt 3 with different values of k other parameters are fixed as v 0 8 d 1 β tot 1 ɛ max 0 5 and ɛ min 1 e 6 as we can see the tail is heavier as k decreases the heavy tails also appear at significantly different concentrations for different k i e k can influence both the slope and the concentrations of the tail in the ctrw tpl the power law constant δ is the main factor that governs the non local feature however as we can see from fig s15 other parameters are set as v 0 8 d 1 log 10 t 1 5 and log 10 t 2 8 the slope of the tail is not very sensitive to the value of δ although the parameter can cansignificantly influence both the peak concentration and the peak time in general the truncation parameter λ in ttfm the ɛ min in mrmt 3 and the t 2 in ctrw tpl all have similar functions i e determining the transition time from power law to exponential decay for example consider the ctrw tpl fit of the synthetic data generated by mrmt 2 by varying the truncating time t 2 the other parameter values are the same as those estimated for mrmt 2 synthetic data the tails of btcs decrease sharply at different times fig s16 4 discussion 4 1 the physical interpretation of β in fsts and sfade the stochastic models underlying the fsts and the sfade equations are solute particles undergoing deterministic drift with random heavy tailed jumps superimposed when solute particles are mobile to date a controversy associated with such heavy tailed random jumps is that long distance and long term backward dispersion i e negative skewness in the fsts and sfade are unphysical zhang et al 2009 that is the physical interpretation of this backward skewness when applied to streamflow remains controversial deng et al 2004 zhang et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 as it does not make sense for particles to make such large upstream jumps traveling against the mean flow our results which are consistent with other studies chakraborty et al 2009 kelly and meerschaert 2017 show that the optimal values of β are very close to 1 indicating that models with negative skewness may be suitable for solute transport modeling particularly for cases with she in order to reconcile this we must understand the physical meaning of the parameter β to this end we present btcs generated by the fsts model for different values of β in appendix b in an open channel system many factors including channel morphology can affect transport of solutes the existence of hyporheic zones solutes moving into and out of near bed sediments or surface transient storage ensign and doyle 2005 such as side pools and other in channel features can both retain solutes other immobile objects can also hinder the migration of solutes in the mobile phase such as fallen trees vegetation large stones in the river bottom and organic debris briggs et al 2009 kelly and meerschaert 2017 2019 argued that when the bulk of the plume travels downstream since the center of mass moves downstream while the solute particles remain at rest for a relatively long time due to retention the particles seem to be displaced in the upstream direction relative to the plume center of mass kelly and meerschaert 2017 2019 mathematically proved that long upstream particle jumps described by negative skewed space fractional models and long resting times described by time fractional models are two sides of the same coin by using space time duality appendix a our results further reinforce this message via fitting of real world data thus if we accept this physical and mathematical interpretation the fsts model with β 1 is a valid representation of the underlying physics 4 2 analysis of model performance 4 2 1 the sfade model based on our results the sfade tends to overestimate the late time concentration in the natural stream reaches without she in the heavy tailing synthetic cases i e data from mrmt 2 and mrmt 3 the sfade shows poorer performance than the fmim as is known a smaller α corresponds to a higher probability of long distance jumps i e a flatter tail compared to the fmim the major limitation of the sfade is that it does not explicitly distinguish mobile and immobile phases boano et al 2007 zhang et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 pointed out that the fmim can explain mass decline as it describes the dynamic partitioning of solute mass into the immobile phase and the rate coefficient between the mobile and immobile phases was described by the fractional derivative in time while the simpler sfade model eq t3 in table 1 cannot account for the loss of mobile mass this loss of mass is captured by the fsts eqs t1 and t2 in table 1 which uses a first order mass transfer between mobile and immobile regions but one of the advantages of the sfade over the time nonlocal methods is that it can simulate early arrivals for β 0 zhang et al 2009 4 2 2 the fmim and ttfm models as presented in section 3 3 the fmim has two independent parameters β s and γ that characterize nonlocal behavior a larger value of β s and a smaller γ correspond to a flatter tail the parameter β s in fmim has a physical interpretation and it can be defined as the ratio of volume of the immobile to mobile zones schumer et al 2003 or as the ratio of expected time in the immobile versus mobile zones benson and meerschaert 2009 γ denotes the power law decay rate of concentration with time we find that the fmim fits the cases with she reach 3 in rcr and the synthetic case corresponding to mrmt 3 very well but tends to overestimate tailing in cases without she the ttfm provides additional flexibility by exponentially truncating the tail via an additional parameter λ meerschaert et al 2008 which is functionally equivalent to ɛ min note however that the gain may be minimal although the rmse values show a slightly better performance of ttfm the aicc indicates that the fmim is better due to lesser number of parameters 4 2 3 the ctrw tpl model for the synthetic cases the ctrw tpl performs poorly particularly in capturing heavy tailing when fitting the observed data it tends to overestimate the leading edge of btcs three additional parameters over an ade are of interest t 1 t 2 and δ t 1 roughly sets a starting point for power law tailing that is cut off at t 2 but as pointed out by haggerty et al 2000 t 1 is of minor importance when capturing the late time tailing in our tests the slope of the btc tail does not change significantly fig s15 this may be due to the fact that the power law regime from t 1 to t 2 is not long enough however a tempered power law can have an observed or inferred slope due to the interaction of the tempering time when truncated at a specific time t 2 the tail of btc declines rapidly exponentially when t t 2 see fig s16 but this decrease is too quick to effectively capture the tail from the synthetic btc thus in this context it appears that the ctrw tpl has limited ability to effectively capture different types of heavy tails although it has had much success in other applications e g burnell et al 2017 4 2 4 the mrmt 1 and mrmt 3 models in the cases without she the mrmt 1 performs well but it underestimates the tail of the btc significantly in the mrmt 1 rtd of the solute in storage is assumed to be exponential wagener et al 2002 this is a significant limitation since the exponential rtd is not appropriate for characterizing late time behaviors which are better characterized by power law tailing as solutes are retained in the storage zones for prolonged periods of time aubeneau et al 2014 gooseff et al 2003 the mrmt 3 can give a better match for the late time data but presents higher concentrations for early arrivals which are still better simulated by mrmt 1 in mrmt 3 the parameter k governs the power law distribution of mass exchange rate in the range of ɛ min ɛ ɛ max ɛ min and ɛ max are functionally equivalent to the inverse of the t 2 and t 1 lu et al 2018 thus k can control the slope of the late time btc in a log log plot a larger k leads to a faster decline of the late time btc however k also impacts the concentration values at which the heavy tail appears in our tests the concentration value where the heavy tail occurs increase as k decreases in the range from 3 5 to 2 0 fig s14 when k 2 0 the tails of btcs are flatter as k decreases however more solute mass is concentrated in the peaks and heavy tails appear at significantly lower concentrations with the enhancement of trapping effects more solute tends to be distributed in the tail rather than the peak of the btc so heavier trailing is more likely to begin at higher concentrations similar to the effect of the α in sfade fig s10 and γ in fmim fig s13 thus the changes of k in the mrmt 3 produce an irregular variation of the btc tail 4 2 5 the fsts model with β 1 in our study both the rmse and the aicc values indicate that the fsts β 1 model performs well in all cases the fsts is an extension of the ts model with a fractional dispersion term in the mobile zone in the fsts the tracer particles experience lévy jumps while mobile and exponential rtds when trapped when β 1 the space fractional term predicts large distance of upstream migrations but this upstream migration is relative to the center of mass that moves downstream with flowing water rather than a stationary river bed in this context it can be regarded as backward migration relative to the center of mass of the migrating tracer plume when part of the tracer mass has a lower velocity relative to the center of mass see fig 10 in rivers turbulent eddies meander bends and pools side pockets local scale river bed topography variations fallen trees within a channel could all lead to lower transport velocity of the trapped solutes relative to the center of mass of the tracer plume additionally zhang et al 2019 showed that the negatively skewed sfade is also physically meaningful when describing the non fickan transport in a river and could capture the heavy tail in a btc similar to the time fractional ade thus when trapping in the physical system is short term retention exponential rtd it can be explicitly modeled in the fsts using a first order exchange with an immobile region as in the classic ts model e g reach 1 and reach 2 in rcr for the long term trapping e g larger hyporheic zones or deep hyporheic flow paths heavy tails are captured by the space fractional term with β 1 e g reach 1 in ohio river and reach 3 in rcr again here we invoke the mathematical equivalence and interpretation of kelly and meershaert 2017 2019 that the fractional in space jumps are equivalent to heavy tailing waiting due to space time duality the fsts seems to hit the sweet spot between other models only having surface transient storage ts in a model typically underestimates late time concentrations in cases with she in the fsts these two types of storage seem to be better balanced whether the negative skewness term in the model is the correct way to represent the physics is likely still open to debate and comes down to whether one accepts the interpretation of the backward skewed space fractional term as representing lower velocities relative to the center of mass of the tracer plume rather than upstream jumps of tracer particles relative to the river bed regardless the fsts was able to describe different types of observed tailing behaviors although the parameters in a model may have interactions with one another the sensitivity analysis of the btc tails can also explain the characteristics of the models used in this study 4 3 comparison of the fsts β 1 and the ttfm although the ttfm truncates the power law tail the resulting model can be used to represent transport in streams however as we can see from fig s16 the truncation can lead to a decay of tracer mass that is too fast compared to the tail of the synthetic data generated using mrmt 2 the rationale behind truncation of tails in the ttfm is that natural rivers are finite systems and transport of tracers must eventually converge to a finite mean and variance aubeneau et al 2014 2016 even at very late times but when tracers are trapped in immobile zones and never come out i e infinite residence time those assumptions are violated exchanges of water and solutes with the immobile zone will produce a delay in solute transport relative to the channel flow and lead to long tails in concentration btcs boano et al 2007 different storage zones e g surface storage zones and deep hyporheic zones can also lead to different types of rtd the power law tail mathematically represented by the space fractional term in the fsts balanced by the exponential rtd term in the fsts performs better in capturing the btcs 5 conclusions although a rigorous but complex mathematical interrelation exists between ctrw mrmt and fade models in their most commonly applied forms differences in memory or rtd functions lead to different classes of non fickian sub models in general these models have different numbers of parameters with varying physical interpretations the highlight of this study is a comparison and evaluation of seven anomalous transport models summarized in table 1 parameter estimation for these seven models was performed with both synthetic and field data and the fits were quantitatively compared with a log based rmse and corrected aic aicc metrics compared to the sfade ctrw tpl and mrmt 3 the fmim performs better while the fmim can overestimate late time tailing in concentrations improvements with the truncating scheme in ttfm appear limited as the truncating time may lead to a decay of concentrations that is too fast in contrast the fsts β 1 modeling upstream jumps mathematically equivalent to power law waiting times due to space time duality see appendix a and balanced by an exponential rtd better estimates both early and late time portions of the btcs both the rmse and aicc indicate that the fsts with negative skewness estimates the btcs with greater fidelity both with and without she in addition the fsts model could also serve as a useful and efficient diagnostic tool to assess the nature of storage in a stream reach surface versus deep hyporheic thus by fitting the tracer data to the fsts model with positive β 1 and negative β 1 skewness values users can quickly assess the relative importance of hyporheic storage in a given reach so that more appropriate models can be selected for further analysis however whether the negatively skewed space fractional term is truly physically meaningful is open to debate and depends on whether one accepts the interpretation of this term as representing a slower transport velocity or waiting relative to the mass center rather than upstream jumps relative to the river bed additionally our current conclusions should only be applied in the context of conservative transport as non conservative reactive transport in systems displaying anomalous transport can be very different from those predicted by naively adding chemical reaction terms to the governing equations bolster et al 2010 bolster et al 2017 credit authorship contribution

and acknowledges support of the chief of naval research via the base 6 1 support program appendix a space time duality the negatively skewed derivative in the sfade and fsts models with β 1 models long power law upstream jumps as noted by zhang et al 2009 these upstream jumps or negative dispersion appear unphysical however due to the advection term in the sfade these upstream jumps are relative to the center of mass in the underlying random walk hence in the sfade model a particle moves downstream due to advection and then may jump back upstream in the fractional in time ade model the particle remains upstream while the bulk of the plume moves downstream in both models the particle ends up behind the plume center of mass resulting in an effective delay or retention hence there are two separate and equivalent descriptions for the same underlying mechanism retention thus resolving the controversy between the sfade and the fractional time ade for river flows this simple observation may be understood mathematically using space time duality baeumer et al 2009 kelly and meerschaert 2017 2019 for simplicity consider the sfade t3 with β 1 v 0 and d 1 a1 t c x t α x α c x t applying a fourier transform ft with respect to both x and t yields a2 i ω i k α c k ω 0 where k is the wave number and ω is the angular frequency the bracketed dispersion relationship is equivalent to i ω γ i k where γ 1 α substituting back into a 1 and inverting the fourier transform leads to the dual equation a3 γ t γ c x t x c x t which is a special case of the fractional in time ade with v 1 and d 0 where the left hand side uses a caputo derivative note that the order of the time fractional derivative γ ranges from 0 5 to 1 this may be made rigorous using a complex plane argument kelly and meerschaert 2017 if the advection term in the sfade is retained it is shown in kelly and meerschaert 2017 that the dual time fractional pde involves the fractional material derivative sokolov and metzler 2003 the resulting coupled space time fractional pde see eq 28 in kelly and meerschaert 2017 governs power law waiting times in a moving reference frame or retention relative to plume center of mass using this duality analysis negative derivative term in the sfade and the fsts can effectively model power law retention we note that this analysis is restricted to fractional models with constant coefficients in either an unbounded domain or a reflecting boundary at x 0 appendix b btcs generated by the fsts model with different values of β the btcs generated by the fsts model with different values of β are presented in fig b1 other parameters were fixed as d 0 7 α 1 9 v 1 2 a s 5 and ɛ 3 10 3 the total mass under each of the btcs is the same for all values of β as we can see from fig b1 when β 1 the btc shows a flattened tail at late times and a sharp leading edge when β 1 however the resulting btc has a flattened leading edge and the tail is steep instead fig s4 also shows similar phenomenon thus a larger β value results in a btc with a more flattened leading edge when β 0 the btc is approximately symmetric with heavy leading edge and tailing on both sides in addition we note that the peaks of all btcs are almost synchronous regardless of the value of β as these are dictated mostly by the deterministic drift appendix c supplementary data supplementary data

5808,riverine transport of carbon and nitrogen strongly impacts terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem functions but is itself affected by changes in land cover and land use china s nen river basin has experienced widespread conversion from forest to cropland in the past century making it representative of similar global land use changes we assessed organic carbon and nitrogen transport in this basin during 2018 and 2019 using water samples collected at one hour intervals during the twelve flood events in two sub basins the yalu and yin rivers dominated by forests and cropland respectively we also assessed dissolved organic carbon doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn concentrations from 19 sampling sites distributed throughout the nen river basin in combination with hydrological records to investigate the impacts of land cover on riverine carbon and nitrogen fluxes the forested yalu river basin showed significantly higher doc content and lower tdn content than yin river basin riverine doc concentrations during non flood periods in the forested yalu river basin were significantly higher than in the cultivated yin river basin but riverine tdn concentrations were lower throughout the nen river basin and its sub basins riverine tdn content was proportional to cropland area during the twelve flood events riverine doc and tdn varied widely over time in the yin and yalu river basins possibly due to dilution effects of water originating from different land covers within the basins our results demonstrate that land cover is the principal cause of changes in riverine

in regulating terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem functions battin et al 2009 cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 recent estimates show that 5 10 pg c yr 1 of soil carbon enters water bodies from the land drake et al 2018 exceeding the global terrestrial carbon sink 1 71 pg c yr 1 le quéré et al 2017 more than half of this eventually enters marine ecosystems 0 95 pg c yr 1 regnier et al 2013 this directly affects carbon cycles and significantly changes the intensity and direction of global carbon sinks battin et al 2009 tranvik et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 the lateral transfer of terrestrial soc by erosion results in a 17 26 change in the carbon sources and sinks of terrestrial ecosystems worldwide chappell et al 2016 at the same time labile fractions of soc entering rivers or oceans exhibits a greater rate of decomposition than on land lal 2019 the co2 partial pressure method has been used to estimated that global terrestrial water bodies lakes reservoirs and rivers release 1 20 1 40 pg c yr 1of co2 to the atmosphere battin et al 2009 tranvik et al 2009 meanwhile n transport in stream flow can account for up to 20 of changes in basin n storage mulholland et al 2008 suddick et al 2013 anthropogenic activities such as urban development and widespread fertilizer use in industrial agriculture have led to increased transfers of nutrients to surface waters often resulting in aquatic eutrophication at great economic cost carpenter et al 1998 dodds et al 2009 while changes in the absolute amount of nutrient influx can influence the productivity of aquatic ecosystems alterations in n export can influence community structure elser and sterner 2002 potentially favoring toxic species of cyanobacteria scott et al 2013 van de waal et al 2014 although previous studies have explored how climate geomorphology or land use affect the delivery of n downstream harrison et al 2009 howarth et al 2012 seitzinger et al 2010 few have specifically identified the importance of these features on the relative rates of n transport characterizing how different landscape and climatic features act as control points bernhardt et al 2017 defined here as features that disproportionally transport or retain one nutrient over another within watersheds could provide guidance for maintaining water quality by clarifying how different features influence n export organic c and n transport in rivers is driven by complex interactions involving multiple factors and land use may be the most dominant lauerwald et al 2012 longworth et al 2007 because it can affect soil properties and runoff as well as the concentrations fluxes and geochemistry of riverine c and n chantigny 2003 guo and gifford 2002 lauerwald et al 2017 longworth et al 2007 nakhavali et al 2018 sickman et al 2010 most of these studies agree that the expansion of agricultural land at the expense of vegetation cover markedly increases the runoff potential in a given watershed dong et al 2015 fang et al 2013 gashaw et al 2018 worku et al 2017 in a natural forest ecosystem the soil erosion intensity is generally low compared to the adjacent cropland ecosystem for example the net soil erosion rates were estimated about 8 5 and 6 0 t ha 1 yr 1 in cereal crop and arboriculture systems respectively whereas in the forest the net erosion rate was lower at about 4 2 t ha 1 yr 1 meliho et al 2019 previous studies have showed larger soil erosion in cropland ecosystems compared to forest ecosystems kassa et al 2019 shi et al 2019 vanacker et al 2019 deforestation can disrupt soil aggregate structure making previously sequestered carbon more available kalbitz et al 2000 quideau and bockheim 1996 and increase the potentials of surface discharge by reducing the vegetation cover on the land surface wang et al 2015 therefore deforestation drastically enhance the soil erosion rate and lead to the loss of soil c and n increasing the transport of sediment c and n to rivers montgomery 2007 van oost et al 2009 wang et al 2003 multiple studies have reported severe leaching of doc and don from agricultural soil kindler et al 2011 liu et al 2010 but deforestation and agriculture may reduce doc export cronan et al 1999 guo and gifford 2002 lauerwald et al 2012 after the conversion of forest to cropland riverine carbon concentration and flux may increase in the short term but decrease in the long term chantigny 2003 a recent synthesis concluded that anthropogenic perturbations involving land use change soil erosion fertilizer use and municipal sewage water inputs were major factors in stimulating doc export through enhancement of both doc source inputs and river discharge regnier et al 2013 a model study showed land use and cover change accounted for 33 increase in doc export to mississippi river ren et al 2016 as rapid crop expansion and reforestation occurred in the mississippi river basin foley et al 2004 turner and rabalais 2003 however other studies showed the complicate changes if doc export after land use and cover change bauer and bianchi 2011 for example a large amount of doc was observed tore lease during the initial stages of forest clearing for agriculture delprat et al 1997 during later stages as the original organic matter is stabilized doc concentrations decrease with duration of cultivation other lines of evidence support this conclusion that reforestation in the upper and lower ohio basins is believed to have contributed to an increase in doc export due to higher doc leaching in forest land compared to other systems foley et al 2004 pandey and pandey 2013 therefore a lack of long term monitoring data makes it difficult to draw clear conclusions regarding the influence of land use change on riverine carbon even at the basin scale climate change is another main factor influencing the lateral movement of soc in terrestrial ecosystems olaya abril et al 2017 precipitation is the primary meteorological element influencing soil erosion and the subsequent lateral movement of soc kim et al 2009 nastos et al 2010 xu 2005 globally high runoff and correspondingly high carbon flux are associated with river basins having high precipitation meybeck 1982 for example in northern europe every 10 increase in annual precipitation results in a 30 increase in organic carbon transported from land to water de wit et al 2016 at the same time large individual rain events have significantly increased the transport of c and n to rivers and other water bodies in terrestrial ecosystems guo et al 2016 although such short term events represent only a limited proportion of total precipitation their resulting carbon flux from land to water accounts for a disproportionately large percentage of total annual carbon flux hilton et al 2008 for example rainstorm events in europe that accounted for only 22 of the study period resulted in poc and doc fluxes accounting for 80 and 70 of the study period respectively oeurng et al 2011 the nen river in northeastern china drains the most fertile and organic rich black soil region in the country this basin has undergone significant land cover change due to massive human migration and intense reclamation over the last century yang and zhang 2018 much of the area has been converted to cultivated from a formerly pristine state over the past 50 years ye and chen 1992 fortunately some mid sized and small sub basins remain naturally forested and mostly undisturbed in this study we comprehensively surveyed c and n in sub basins of the nen river with different levels of cultivation and disturbance including temporal variations in these factors during several flood events to explore the regional effects of land use on riverine nutrient transport and the implications for the carbon cycle 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the nen river basin is the seventh largest in china covering 280 000 km2 119 48 36 to 127 52 34 e 45 0 29 to 51 40 12 n fig 1 a the

yan 2009 we focused on two tributaries of the nen river the yin river basin fig 1b is flat and primarily devoted to intensive cultivation of soybean maize and rice with some remaining forest in the upstream most part of the basin cropland accounts for 41 19 and forests for 16 98 of the total land area in contrast the yalu river basin fig 1c is mountainous and mostly forested 78 02 with only

results 3 1 soil c and n content the soc and doc of top soil layers in the forested yalu river basin were significantly higher than in the cultivated yin river basin fig 2 a b the soc and doc of the bottom layer 30 40 cm in the yalu river basin is close to those in the yin river basin mostly because of shallow soil layer at the study area in contrast the soil tdn averaged 34 95 8 39 mgkg 1 in the cultivated yin river basin 3 times that in the forested yalu river basin average 11 67 2 93 mgkg 1 fig 2c both areas showed similar declines in c and n with soil depth other than a temporary increase

patterns were similar in the yalu and yin river basins fig 3 a b but the mean annual precipitation in the latter was 25 higher than in the former fig 3c in contrast the yalu river s discharge was 6 8 times that of the yin river fig 3d both basins experienced a rainstorm event from august 2 3 2018 during which precipitation totaled 28 3 mm and 70 mm in the yalu and yin river basins respectively as a result the yalu river s discharge reached 32 7 m3 s 1 but the yin river only increased slightly similarly at the summer of 2019 there is large rainstorm occurring at these two river basins and the

et al 2006 xu et al 2010 for example a study in small agricultural watersheds noted elevated base flow doc concentrations relative to other streams in the same region vidon et al 2008 however we found larger riverine doc content in the forested yalu river basin during non flood periods fig 4a likely due to higher soc and doc in forested ecosystems as compared to cropland fig 2a haynes 2000 a previous study also showed a strong correlation between riverine doc and soc within the river basin li et al 2017 the forested yalu river basin had a much higher discharge than the cultivated yin river basin due to cropland irrigation in the yin river basin fig 3d implying that a higher doc flux was transferred from forested land to river systems than from cropland changes in land use and land

confirmed that the two most important factors influencing the release of doc during storm events are the flood magnitude and soil water flow oeurng et al 2011 pointed out that the relationship between doc and discharge showed clockwise anticlockwise and mixed patterns determined by the water content of doc entering runoff therefore basin land cover which has an important influence on soil doc content may be a major factor controlling riverine doc many studies have shown that cropland has lower doc than forest delprat et al 1997 haynes 2000 consistent with our results fig 2a thus in basins like the yin river where cropland dominates the lower reaches and forest is only present upstream rainfall on cropland results in low doc runoff initially reaching rivers followed by higher doc runoff from upstream producing the rising doc trend observed in our results in contrast the tdn concentrations in both the yin and yalu river showed a decreasing trend cropland near the sampling sites had more n content than forested areas due to fertilization fig 2c water flowing through cropland transports significant n to rivers contributing to higher n contents during the early portions of precipitation events for example mattsson et al 2009 found that don in river water increased significantly with cropland area many studies have also reported that tdn concentrations increase with cropland area owing to anthropogenic n sources petrone 2010 stanley and maxted 2008 zampella et al 2007 similar to our results showing that tdn content was proportional to cropland area fig 5b seasonal variability of temperature and precipitation has been found to be responsible for variability in riverine c and n concentrations hytteborn et al 2015 tian et al 2015 in this study the largest riverine c concentrations in yin and yalu river were observed in june in 2018 and july in 2019 respectively fig 4a previous study supported this result that seasonal doc patterns were driven by soil moisture and temperature in a small boreal river basin and the largest measurements showed in the summer futter and de wit 2008 the same conclusion has been arrived based on measurements from 136 streams in sweden and discharge and temperature were found to be the main drivers of doc seasonal variability winterdahl et al 2014 the higher temperature in summer stimulates the decomposition of soil organic and metabolic processes a bear et al 2014 releasing more doc to the river marescaux et al 2018 the riverine n concentrations were influenced by net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs exported

significant upward trend due to ongoing changes in climate and land use monteith et al 2007 for example de wit et al 2016 surveyed 474 rivers and lakes in northern europe to show that the lateral movement of organic carbon from land to water increased from 1990 to 2013 organic carbon content in water increased by an average of 1 4 per year and lateral carbon transfer from land to oceans will continue to increase current assessments of global carbon sources and sinks do not account for the impact of lateral soc transfer or increasing riverine carbon emissions ciais et al 2013 leading to uncertainty in future modeling the ipcc assessment report and the global carbon plan gcp indicate that the difference between global emissions of co2 including industrial greenhouse gas emissions and land use change emissions and the sum of carbon sinks for the atmosphere ocean and land is 0 60 pg c yr 1 le quéré et al 2017 lateral movement of terrestrial carbon is the most likely explanation for this missing carbon sink bianchi et al 2018 during the past decades numerous attempts have been conducted to develop process based models to simulate the lateral transfer of soil organic carbon and nitrogen from land to aquatic ecosystems xu et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 previous study integrates comprehensively several important processes such as doc production by vegetation and soil compounds soil profile transport into a process based ecosystem model to simulate doc transport neff and asner 2001 lumsdon et al 2005 used a function of competitive cation adsorption and hydrophobicity to simulate soil organic carbon solubility although these studies improve the ability of simulating soil doc dynamics they currently fail to investigate the potential impacts of land use and cover change on the doc transport such as land cover change between forest and cropland wu et al 2014 our results reported significant differences of riverine soc and tdn between cultivated and forest river basins and especially found the larger riverine doc over the forested river basin than that of cultivated basin this study implies that it is very urgent task to integrate the impacts of land use and cover change into the current estimates zhang et al 2014 5 conclusion river basin land cover plays a critical role in controlling riverine doc and tdn concentrations the c and n content of different land covers may result in adverse change trends in the riverine doc and tdn concentrations during rainfall events in the nen river basin the riverine doc concentrations were controlled by a combination of environmental factors such as temperature and human activity riverine tdn concentrations were proportional to cropland area possibly due to excessive nitrogen fertilizer use thus changes in land cover can influence changes in the flux of n and c in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems further research is needed to better assess the effects of other land cover types on the release of doc and tdn into river systems and to improve our understanding of n and c biogeochemical cycling across heterogeneous landscapes and spatial scales author contributions wenping yuan conceived and designed the study

5808,riverine transport of carbon and nitrogen strongly impacts terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem functions but is itself affected by changes in land cover and land use china s nen river basin has experienced widespread conversion from forest to cropland in the past century making it representative of similar global land use changes we assessed organic carbon and nitrogen transport in this basin during 2018 and 2019 using water samples collected at one hour intervals during the twelve flood events in two sub basins the yalu and yin rivers dominated by forests and cropland respectively we also assessed dissolved organic carbon doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn concentrations from 19 sampling sites distributed throughout the nen river basin in combination with hydrological records to investigate the impacts of land cover on riverine carbon and nitrogen fluxes the forested yalu river basin showed significantly higher doc content and lower tdn content than yin river basin riverine doc concentrations during non flood periods in the forested yalu river basin were significantly higher than in the cultivated yin river basin but riverine tdn concentrations were lower throughout the nen river basin and its sub basins riverine tdn content was proportional to cropland area during the twelve flood events riverine doc and tdn varied widely over time in the yin and yalu river basins possibly due to dilution effects of water originating from different land covers within the basins our results demonstrate that land cover is the principal cause of changes in riverine

in regulating terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem functions battin et al 2009 cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 recent estimates show that 5 10 pg c yr 1 of soil carbon enters water bodies from the land drake et al 2018 exceeding the global terrestrial carbon sink 1 71 pg c yr 1 le quéré et al 2017 more than half of this eventually enters marine ecosystems 0 95 pg c yr 1 regnier et al 2013 this directly affects carbon cycles and significantly changes the intensity and direction of global carbon sinks battin et al 2009 tranvik et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 the lateral transfer of terrestrial soc by erosion results in a 17 26 change in the carbon sources and sinks of terrestrial ecosystems worldwide chappell et al 2016 at the same time labile fractions of soc entering rivers or oceans exhibits a greater rate of decomposition than on land lal 2019 the co2 partial pressure method has been used to estimated that global terrestrial water bodies lakes reservoirs and rivers release 1 20 1 40 pg c yr 1of co2 to the atmosphere battin et al 2009 tranvik et al 2009 meanwhile n transport in stream flow can account for up to 20 of changes in basin n storage mulholland et al 2008 suddick et al 2013 anthropogenic activities such as urban development and widespread fertilizer use in industrial agriculture have led to increased transfers of nutrients to surface waters often resulting in aquatic eutrophication at great economic cost carpenter et al 1998 dodds et al 2009 while changes in the absolute amount of nutrient influx can influence the productivity of aquatic ecosystems alterations in n export can influence community structure elser and sterner 2002 potentially favoring toxic species of cyanobacteria scott et al 2013 van de waal et al 2014 although previous studies have explored how climate geomorphology or land use affect the delivery of n downstream harrison et al 2009 howarth et al 2012 seitzinger et al 2010 few have specifically identified the importance of these features on the relative rates of n transport characterizing how different landscape and climatic features act as control points bernhardt et al 2017 defined here as features that disproportionally transport or retain one nutrient over another within watersheds could provide guidance for maintaining water quality by clarifying how different features influence n export organic c and n transport in rivers is driven by complex interactions involving multiple factors and land use may be the most dominant lauerwald et al 2012 longworth et al 2007 because it can affect soil properties and runoff as well as the concentrations fluxes and geochemistry of riverine c and n chantigny 2003 guo and gifford 2002 lauerwald et al 2017 longworth et al 2007 nakhavali et al 2018 sickman et al 2010 most of these studies agree that the expansion of agricultural land at the expense of vegetation cover markedly increases the runoff potential in a given watershed dong et al 2015 fang et al 2013 gashaw et al 2018 worku et al 2017 in a natural forest ecosystem the soil erosion intensity is generally low compared to the adjacent cropland ecosystem for example the net soil erosion rates were estimated about 8 5 and 6 0 t ha 1 yr 1 in cereal crop and arboriculture systems respectively whereas in the forest the net erosion rate was lower at about 4 2 t ha 1 yr 1 meliho et al 2019 previous studies have showed larger soil erosion in cropland ecosystems compared to forest ecosystems kassa et al 2019 shi et al 2019 vanacker et al 2019 deforestation can disrupt soil aggregate structure making previously sequestered carbon more available kalbitz et al 2000 quideau and bockheim 1996 and increase the potentials of surface discharge by reducing the vegetation cover on the land surface wang et al 2015 therefore deforestation drastically enhance the soil erosion rate and lead to the loss of soil c and n increasing the transport of sediment c and n to rivers montgomery 2007 van oost et al 2009 wang et al 2003 multiple studies have reported severe leaching of doc and don from agricultural soil kindler et al 2011 liu et al 2010 but deforestation and agriculture may reduce doc export cronan et al 1999 guo and gifford 2002 lauerwald et al 2012 after the conversion of forest to cropland riverine carbon concentration and flux may increase in the short term but decrease in the long term chantigny 2003 a recent synthesis concluded that anthropogenic perturbations involving land use change soil erosion fertilizer use and municipal sewage water inputs were major factors in stimulating doc export through enhancement of both doc source inputs and river discharge regnier et al 2013 a model study showed land use and cover change accounted for 33 increase in doc export to mississippi river ren et al 2016 as rapid crop expansion and reforestation occurred in the mississippi river basin foley et al 2004 turner and rabalais 2003 however other studies showed the complicate changes if doc export after land use and cover change bauer and bianchi 2011 for example a large amount of doc was observed tore lease during the initial stages of forest clearing for agriculture delprat et al 1997 during later stages as the original organic matter is stabilized doc concentrations decrease with duration of cultivation other lines of evidence support this conclusion that reforestation in the upper and lower ohio basins is believed to have contributed to an increase in doc export due to higher doc leaching in forest land compared to other systems foley et al 2004 pandey and pandey 2013 therefore a lack of long term monitoring data makes it difficult to draw clear conclusions regarding the influence of land use change on riverine carbon even at the basin scale climate change is another main factor influencing the lateral movement of soc in terrestrial ecosystems olaya abril et al 2017 precipitation is the primary meteorological element influencing soil erosion and the subsequent lateral movement of soc kim et al 2009 nastos et al 2010 xu 2005 globally high runoff and correspondingly high carbon flux are associated with river basins having high precipitation meybeck 1982 for example in northern europe every 10 increase in annual precipitation results in a 30 increase in organic carbon transported from land to water de wit et al 2016 at the same time large individual rain events have significantly increased the transport of c and n to rivers and other water bodies in terrestrial ecosystems guo et al 2016 although such short term events represent only a limited proportion of total precipitation their resulting carbon flux from land to water accounts for a disproportionately large percentage of total annual carbon flux hilton et al 2008 for example rainstorm events in europe that accounted for only 22 of the study period resulted in poc and doc fluxes accounting for 80 and 70 of the study period respectively oeurng et al 2011 the nen river in northeastern china drains the most fertile and organic rich black soil region in the country this basin has undergone significant land cover change due to massive human migration and intense reclamation over the last century yang and zhang 2018 much of the area has been converted to cultivated from a formerly pristine state over the past 50 years ye and chen 1992 fortunately some mid sized and small sub basins remain naturally forested and mostly undisturbed in this study we comprehensively surveyed c and n in sub basins of the nen river with different levels of cultivation and disturbance including temporal variations in these factors during several flood events to explore the regional effects of land use on riverine nutrient transport and the implications for the carbon cycle 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the nen river basin is the seventh largest in china covering 280 000 km2 119 48 36 to 127 52 34 e 45 0 29 to 51 40 12 n fig 1 a the

yan 2009 we focused on two tributaries of the nen river the yin river basin fig 1b is flat and primarily devoted to intensive cultivation of soybean maize and rice with some remaining forest in the upstream most part of the basin cropland accounts for 41 19 and forests for 16 98 of the total land area in contrast the yalu river basin fig 1c is mountainous and mostly forested 78 02 with only

installed along the river bank and collected water samples hourly when the river level rose during rainfall events samples were taken at 10 50 cm depth below the surface in addition manual samples were taken using a 2 l bottle at monthly intervals when water levels were not markedly different a total of 510 water samples were taken by automatic and manual sampling during the whole study period all samples were stored at in a refrigerator at under 5 for less than 7 days and were transferred to a laboratory using a cooler at 0 soil samples were collected from 0 to 40 cm depth in both forests yalu river basin and croplands yin river basin in june 2018 samples were dissolved in pure water and the solution was used to measure soc doc and tdn we also collected river water samples at 19 sites within the nen river basin in september 2018 including 15 sites along tributaries and 4 sites along the mainstream fig 1 table 1 sites were chosen to be as far from urban areas as possible the yin and yalu river basins were sampled on september 28 and 8 respectively and all other sites from september 17 23 all samples were analyzed for soc doc and tdn concentrations vegetation cover was determined

bottom layer 30 40 cm in the yalu river basin is close to those in the yin river basin mostly because of shallow soil layer at the study area in contrast the soil tdn averaged 34 95 8 39 mgkg 1 in the

land use change emissions and the sum of carbon sinks for the atmosphere ocean and land is 0 60 pg c yr 1 le quéré et al 2017 lateral movement of terrestrial carbon is the most likely explanation for this missing carbon sink bianchi et al 2018 during the past decades numerous attempts have been conducted to develop process based models to simulate the lateral transfer of soil organic carbon and nitrogen from land to aquatic ecosystems xu et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 previous study integrates comprehensively several important processes such as doc production by vegetation and soil compounds soil profile transport into a process based ecosystem model to simulate doc transport neff and asner 2001 lumsdon et al 2005 used a function of competitive cation adsorption and hydrophobicity to simulate soil organic carbon solubility although these studies improve the ability of simulating soil doc dynamics they currently fail to investigate the potential impacts of land use and cover change on the doc transport such as land cover change between forest and cropland wu et al 2014 our results reported significant differences of riverine soc and tdn between cultivated and forest river basins and especially found the larger riverine doc over the forested river basin than that of cultivated basin this study implies that it is very urgent task to integrate the impacts of land use and cover change into the current estimates zhang et al 2014 5 conclusion river basin land cover plays a critical role in controlling riverine doc and tdn concentrations the c and n content of different land covers may result in adverse change trends in the riverine doc and tdn concentrations during rainfall events in the nen river basin the riverine doc concentrations were controlled by a combination of environmental factors such as temperature and human activity riverine tdn concentrations were proportional to cropland area possibly due to excessive nitrogen fertilizer use thus changes in land cover can influence changes in the flux of n and c in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems further research is needed to better assess the effects of other land cover types on the release of doc and tdn into river systems and to improve our understanding of n and c biogeochemical cycling across heterogeneous landscapes and spatial scales author contributions wenping yuan conceived and designed the study

controlling role in earthquake induced water level and tidal behavior changes 2 tectonic background and data collection the study area is located in the middle of shanxi province north of china in a large scale cenozoic rift basin of taiyuan fig 1 tectonically taiyuan basin is surrounded by the lvliang moutains to the west and by the taihang mountains to the east the surrounding mountains are high with elevation of 3000 m and the basin is quite flat with elevation from 735 m to 830 m han et al 2008 tang et al 2018 the basin is bounded by the jiaocheng fault to the northwest and taigu fault to the southeast the two boundary faults control the shape evolution history and hydro geological settings of the basin the basin is about 150 km length from northeast to southwest and 40 km width from northwest to southeast with an area of about 6000 km2 xie et al 2008 in geology the basin was characterized by thick cenozoic strata with a depth of about 1000 2000 m the exposed and deeply buried stratums around it were mainly comprised of paleozoic ordovician carboniferous permian and triassic strata the bottom of the basin was characterized by permian and triassic sandy shale which was covered by loose rock groups of the tertiary and quaternary systems in which the quaternary strata were deeply buried and gradually become shallower from northwest 500 m to southeast 100 200 m the climate is of a semiarid type with a mean annual air temperature varying from 4 c to 13 c annual rainfall amounts is about 400 650 mm which mainly occurs between june and september tang et al 2013 the fenhe river and its tributary is the major surface water source running through the middle section of the basin flowing from northeast to southwest guo et al 2019 hydro geologically groundwater in the basin is mainly supplied by surrounding mountains through lateral recharge the aquifers in the basin is mainly composed of the quaternary holocene unconfined aquifer group 0 50 m the quaternary late and middle pleistocene confined aquifer group 50 200 m the quaternary early pleistocene lacustrine alluvial weak aquifer group 200 400 m and the neogene red soil with thin layers of sandy gravel lacustrine weak confined aquifer group guo et al 2007 in the last few decades increasing human activity and continuing over exploitation of groundwater have caused groundwater level declines accompanied by land subsidence and developed earth fissures in this work we examine the relationship between groundwater level and tidal behavior changes induced by far field large earthquakes four groundwater monitoring wells were constructed in taiyuan basin as part of the groundwater dynamic monitoring network in mainland china for monitoring pore pressure changes in confined aquifers which was believed to be associated with possible earthquake precursor all four wells were drilled into consolidated rocks in 1970s or 1980s and all wells are open well depths range from 315 m to 765 78 m two of the monitoring wells ty and qx are located within the fault damage zone or earth fissure area the ty well is located at the northwestern edge of the taiyuan basin it is 765 78 m deep and screened at the depth interval of 480 765 m where it penetrates the damage zone of jiaochen faults rock type of the aquifer is limestone with dolomite the qx well is located in the taigu qixian earth fissure area of central taiyuan basin peng et al 2018 depth of the borehole are 442 19 m and rock types of the aquifers are mainly metamorphic volcaniclastic rock and bedded tuff the other two wells xy and jx are located in the southern section of the taiyuan basin the xy well is 502 93 m deep and screened at the depth interval of 403 502 m the jx well is located in a groundwater depression cone of the southern taiyuan basin one of the major coal producing areas the jx well is 315 m deep and screened at six different depths in the interval of 77 58 301 64 m rock types of aquifer in the open intervals of both wells are mainly sandstone or consolidated sand gravel table 1 lists basic well construction information fig 1 shows locations of each well and the study area fig 2 shows geochronology and lithology information of the aquifer in the wells water level in the four wells are recorded by an ln 3a digital piezometer sensor developed by the institute of earthquake science china earthquake administration cea at a sampling interval of 1 min from may 2007 the digital piezometer readings are converted into groundwater level with a resolution of 1 mm in the range between 0 and 10 m the absolute accuracy is 0 2 percent of full scale to identify water level changes induced by earthquakes barometric pressure and rainfall data near the wells were collected to clarify their influence on water levels in our analysis fig 3 shows the time series of water level changes recorded from 2007 to 2019 additionally in order to examine the relationship between earthquake induced groundwater level changes and regional groundwater flow field we further collected the data of deep groundwater level contours constructed by almost 100 hydrological well data fig 1 cyan dots which

changes induced by earthquakes are related to seismic energy density a threshold value of 10 3 j m3 of seismic energy density is required to initiate sustained water level changes wang and manga 2010b yan et al 2014 to identify potentially earthquake induced water level changes the energy densities j m3 of worldwide earthquakes were calculated according to log r 0 48 m 0 33 log e 0 4 where m is the magnitude of the event r is the epicenter distance in km wang and manga 2010a the neic national earthquake information center http earthquake usgs gov earthquakes search earthquake catalog was used in order to not miss any earthquake we lower the threshold value to 10 4 j m3 then we examine whether these events induced any water level changes in the four wells totally two types of earthquake induced water level changes were identified transient dynamic oscillations and sustained changes here we mainly focus on sustained water level changes which were induced by 5 events with epicentral distance from 1035 to 4824 km seismic energy density of the 5 events ranged from 9 94 10 4 to 6 72 10 2 j m3 the maximum energy density was caused by the 2011 tohoku m w 9 0 earthquake which occurred at a distance of 2613 km from the monitoring site ty table 2 lists the 5 events used in this study their geographic locations magnitude epicentral distance and energy density at the studied wells the distribution of the earthquake epicenters are showed in fig 1 3 2 tidal analysis of groundwater level temporal variations of the tidal parameters reflect changes in an aquifer s hydraulic properties specifically phase shifts are sensitive to permeability changes and the amplitude changes can be caused by small storage changes hsieh et al 1987 doan et al 2006 so tidal parameter can be used to constrain parameters of the formation and to draw inferences about which of those properties changed after earthquakes elkhoury et al 2006 xue et al 2013 in this work tidal signal were decomposed from the observed water level data and the tidal parameters were calculated with the program baytap g ishiguro and tamura 1985 tamura et al 1991 the program baytap g can identify four components from water level and barometric pressures irregular noise long period trend barometric response and observed tides before doing the tidal analysis possible steps and spikes caused by instrument malfunctions or maintenance works were removed manually the water level data were resampled as hourly data from minute sample a sliding window window length 31 days step 4 days was used for analyzing the time dependent earth tide parameters the theoretical volumetric strain tides were selected to calibrate the water level tides the tidal factors phases and amplitudes of the tidal constituents m2 s2 o1 s1 k1 were selected from the baytap g output where tidal factor is defined as the amplitude ratio of observed water pressure to theoretical volumetric strain tide negative phases correspond to time lags the calculating error was given as root mean square error rmse it should be noted that s1 k1 and s2 are not pure gravitational tides but also contain an unknown contribution of radiational sometimes called thermal tides agnew 2007 the m2 wave is more stable with larger amplitude and less rmse than o1 thus for the discussion with respect to earth tides the focus of this work is on the purely gravitational tidal bands m2 and o1 4 results 4 1 water level changes induced by earthquakes in term of water level changes induced by the 5 events detail information was listed in table 3 both co seismic offset changes rise and fall and oscillations without persistent changes were induced during the passage of seismic waves offset rise or fall co seismic water level changes were induced by all of the 5 earthquakes in ty qx and xy wells and were induced by one earthquake in jx well the offset amplitudes range from 0 01 to 0 99 m with recovery periods of several hours to tens of days oscillations were recorded in jx well after the occurrence of 4 earthquakes the oscillations maintained several minutes with small amplitudes 0 1 2 cm for the same earthquake epicentral distances and seismic energy density did not show any obvious difference between the offset and oscillation changes 4 2 tidal behavior changes induced by earthquakes fig 4 shows that the m2 tidal parameters varies from may 2007 to may 2019 in the 4 wells tidal behavior changes induced by earthquakes only occurred in ty and qx wells table 4 listed detailed information of tidal behavior changes induced by earthquakes in ty and qx wells in ty well the m2 tidal factor and phase shift showed opposite changes character i e tidal factor of water level decreased after 4 earthquakes with amplitudes ranged from 0 29 to 2 55 gpa at the same time phase shift increased with amplitudes ranged from 2 89 to 42 88 the maximum tidal change was induced by the 2011 tohoku m w 9 0 earthquake in qx well tidal factor and phase shift showed significant changes in the same sign after 5 earthquakes synchronous increase of tidal factor and phase shift were recorded after two earthquakes i e the 2007 sumatra m w 8 5 and the 2012 sumatra m w 8 6 earthquake synchronous decrease of tidal factor and phase shift were recorded after three earthquakes i e the 2008 wenchuan m w 7 9 the 2011 tohoku m w 9 0 and the 2015 nepal m w 7 8 earthquake the increase tidal factor ranged from 0 88 to 6 27 gpa and the phases shift ranged from 16 to 75 the decrease tidal factor ranged from 1 67 to 5 88 gpa and the phase shifts ranged from 23 35 to 79 78 after each earthquake the tidal parameters stayed at high or low level and did not recover to pre earthquake level except following the 2015 nepal m w 7 8 earthquake an additional change of unidentified reason in tidal behavior occurred in 2009 showed the same pattern of changes induced by earthquakes in xy and jx wells the temporal variation of the tidal signal was relatively stable no any significant change was recorded after each earthquake 5 discussion in this work we have presented water level changes caused by five large earthquakes in four wells in a rift basin both oscillations and offset rise and fall changes in water level were recorded after multiple large earthquakes the tides were decomposed from well water level and the tidal factors and phase shift were calculated with baytap g program while tidal behavior and water level changes did not always occurred simultaneously in terms of the five earthquakes since the static strain caused by the slipping of faults cannot induce such large changes in water level even for the nearest 2008 wenchuan m w7 9 earthquake and for the largest 2011 tohoku m w 9 0 earthquake the static strain caused by the wenchuan and the tohoku earthquake is about 7 9 10 10 and 3 1 10 9 respectively which could cause several millimeters of water level changes far smaller than the observed water level changes the dynamic strain is a possible candidate in terms of the same earthquake epicentral distance and seismic energy density did not show significant difference while different wells recorded water level changes of different polarities for instance after the 2011 tohoku m w 9 0 earthquake rise and recovery changes in water level were recorded in qx wells fall of water level were recorded in ty and xy wells and oscillations were recorded in jx well according to earthquake induced permeability changes model the polarities may be related to local hydraulic gradient wang and manga 2010b co seismic rise of water level will occur if the permeability enhanced in the up gradient of the well and co seismic drop of water level if permeability enhanced in the down gradient of the well shi et al 2015 to examine the relationship between local hydraulic gradient and earthquake induced water level changes we collected the groundwater flow field data before 28 february 2011 and after 30 march 2011 the 2011 tohoku m w 9 0 earthquake fig 1 shows the contour map of groundwater level height relative to sea level fig 5 shows the corresponding cross section through qx xy and jx well the results show that qx well is located in the center of the basin with flat landform and less local hydraulic gradient xy and jx wells are located in the margin of the basin with steep terrain and large local hydraulic gradients it is noted that the aquifer material in jx is mainly sandstone and gravel which is different from other wells with solid rocks the depth of penetration in jx is higher than other wells relative to mean sea level the shock waves from earthquakes will travel faster in solid rock than sandy gravels and clayey soils hence more new fractures can occur along paths of solid rock this can lead to falling or rising of water levels depending on whether the new fractures are dry or wet from table 3 all the water level variations in all the wells except jx undergo falling and rising changes so different aquifer material and local hydraulic gradients could be the reason why different water level responses were recorded in the four wells in addition jx well is located in a groundwater depression cone up gradient area hence the water level is always rising slightly obvious rising of water level was recorded at center of the depression cone after the 2011 tohoku m w 9 0 earthquake fig 5 cc profile tidal factor and phase shift between the water level and the earth tides were used as a proxy for storativity and permeability changes in the well aquifer system doan et al 2006 elkhoury et al 2006 xue et al 2013 the results of water level tidal response showed that the jx well has the smallest mean tidal factor of 1 4 gpa and mean phase shift of 11 9 the smaller tidal factor and negative phase shift means higher storativity and higher horizontal permeability cooper et al 1965 acworth et al 2017 shih 2017 in such situation the well hydraulically coupled to the formation the higher the permeability of the aquifer is the easier oscillations occurred during the passage of seismic waves the better the storativity of a reservoir is the smaller the response amplitude of tidal and seismic waves would be this may result in higher shaking energy required for offset water level changes than oscillations thus earthquake tends to induced water level oscillational changes in jx well the ranges of tidal factor and phase shift are 4 5 7 5 gpa and 8 5 to 40 1 in ty well 1 0 8 8 gpa and 79 9 to 23 7 in qx well 4 3 6 7 gpa and 8 2 to 16 8 in xy well respectively earthquake induced water level and tidal behavior changes did not occurred simultaneously for instance offset water level changes occurred without tidal behavior changes after five earthquakes in xy well the amplitudes of offset water level changes ranged from 0 01 to 0 75 m in xy well while offset water level and tidal behavior changes were recorded after multiple earthquakes in ty well with offset water level changes of 0 01 0 06 m and in qx well with offset water level changes of 0 02 0 99 m which means that these two wells are sensitive to seismically dynamic strain in terms of tides the tidal factor and phase shift in the ty qx and xy well had no obvious difference during the period of no earthquakes which means that other local hydro geological structure may affect water and tidal behavior it is noteworthy that ty well penetrates the damage zone of jiaochen faults which is a listric faults on the northwestern edges of the taiyuan basin playing a controlling role in the rift basin the qx well is located in the taigu qixian developed earth fissure area of taiyuan rift basin the fissures are connected to deep hidden faults and their average annual active rate is 1 3 cm peng et al 2018 tang et al 2018 recent studies indicated that hydraulic properties inferred from tidal behavior within fault damage zone are more sensitive and vulnerable than that away from the fault damage zone xue et al 2016 yan et al 2016 in this study the two wells of ty and qx well located in the fault or earth fissure area showed significant changes in tidal factors and phase shifts after multiple earthquakes indicating that permeability and storativity changed after the passage of seismic waves while the xy wells away from active fault did not show any significant change the different response patterns to seismically dynamic strain indicate that fault and earth fissure may be the reason of sensitive water level and tidal behavior changes in terms of earthquake induced tidal change there are three types of plausible physical mechanisms barbour et al 2019 1 radial flow model suggests that m2 tides should have negative phase shift and positive correlation between tidal factor and phase shift hsieh et al 1987 2 vertical flow leakage model suggests that m2 tides should have positive phase shift and negative correlation between tidal factor and phase shift roeloffs et al 1996 wang et al 2018 3 fracture dominated flow model suggests that m2 and o1 tides have phases of opposite sign bower 1983 for the four wells in this work m2 and o1 tides do not have phases of opposite sign figs 4 and 6 the single fracture dominated flow model was firstly excluded for the ty well the m2 tides induced by earthquakes have positive phase shift and negative correlation between tidal factor and phase shift which suggests that earthquakes induced vertical flow changes for the qx well the m2 tides induced by earthquakes have negative or positive phase shift and positive correlation between tidal factor and phase shift which suggests that earthquakes induced mixture flow both vertical and radial flow changes fig 7 another interesting issue is that both increase and decrease of tidal factor and phase shift were recorded in the qx well following some earthquakes clogging or unclogging of fractures due to earthquakes could not explain such large changes in earth tides the qx well is located in the developed earth fissure area and the screened interval is very long hence there could be non equilibrium between some intervals of the wellbore partial clogging of the screened interval or communication between the screened interval and the overlying gravel aquifer or even the surface could be the explanation for such large changes in tidal parameters the fact that a non earthquake tidal changes in 2009 also led to similar tidal behavior related to earthquakes which could be evidence that earthquakes affected the near wellbore environment the earthquake induced well water level and tidal behavior changes may be correlated with the hydrogeological condition fault systems geometry of well aquifer system and local stress state but at this stage no clear models was proposed further research or predictive models are required to predict situations in areas without monitoring data 6 conclusions in this work we analyzed water level and tidal behavior changes caused by five large earthquakes in four wells in the taiyuan rift basin from 2007 to 2019 different water level and tidal behaviors were recorded in the wells after multiple large earthquakes the jx well with higher storativity and higher permeability mainly recorded oscillation changes which suggests that higher seismic energy density might be required to cause sustained water level changes in such wells the other three wells ty qx and xy recorded sustained water level changes after multiple large earthquakes in which tidal behavior changed in the ty and qx wells after some large earthquakes the ty well penetrates the damage zone of the listric jiaochen faults playing a controlling role in the taiyuan rift basin the qx well is located in the taigu qixian developed earth fissure area both wells located in fault damage zone or developed earth fissure area showed synchronized water level and tidal behavior changes after multiple earthquakes which suggested that fissures play an important controlling effect to earthquake induced water level and tidal behavior changes different tidal behavior were recorded in the ty and qx well after earthquakes in the ty well m2 tides induced by earthquakes have positive phase shift and negative correlation between tidal factor and phase shift which suggests that earthquakes induced vertical flow changes in the qx well m2 tides induced by earthquakes have negative or positive phase shift and positive correlation between tidal factor and phase shift which suggests that earthquakes induced mixture of both

from northwest to southeast with an area of about 6000 km2 xie et al 2008 in geology the basin was characterized by thick cenozoic strata with a depth of about 1000 2000 m the exposed and deeply buried stratums around it were mainly comprised of paleozoic ordovician carboniferous permian and triassic strata the bottom of the basin was characterized by permian and triassic sandy shale which was covered by loose rock groups of the tertiary and quaternary systems in which the quaternary strata were deeply buried and gradually become shallower from northwest 500 m to southeast 100 200 m the climate is of a semiarid type with a mean annual air temperature varying from 4 c to 13 c annual rainfall amounts is about 400 650 mm which mainly occurs between june and september tang et al 2013 the fenhe river and its tributary is the major surface water source running through the middle section of the basin flowing from northeast to southwest guo et al 2019 hydro geologically groundwater in the basin is mainly supplied by surrounding mountains through lateral recharge the aquifers in the basin is mainly composed of the quaternary holocene unconfined aquifer group 0 50 m the quaternary late and middle pleistocene confined aquifer group 50 200 m the quaternary early pleistocene lacustrine alluvial weak aquifer group 200 400 m and the neogene red soil with thin layers of sandy gravel lacustrine weak confined aquifer group guo et al 2007 in the last few decades increasing human activity and continuing over exploitation of groundwater have caused groundwater level declines accompanied by land subsidence and developed earth fissures in this work we examine the relationship between groundwater level and tidal behavior changes induced by far field large earthquakes four groundwater monitoring wells were constructed in taiyuan basin as part of the groundwater dynamic monitoring network in mainland china for monitoring pore pressure changes in confined aquifers which was believed to be associated with possible earthquake precursor all four wells were drilled into consolidated rocks in 1970s or 1980s and all wells are open well depths range from 315 m to 765 78 m two of the monitoring wells ty and qx are located within the fault damage zone or earth fissure area the ty well is located at the northwestern edge of the taiyuan basin it is 765 78 m deep and screened at the depth interval of 480 765 m where it penetrates the damage zone of jiaochen faults rock type of the aquifer is limestone with dolomite the qx well is located in the taigu qixian earth fissure area of central taiyuan basin peng et al 2018 depth of the borehole are 442 19 m and rock types of the aquifers are mainly metamorphic volcaniclastic rock and bedded tuff the other two wells xy and jx are located in the southern section of the taiyuan basin the xy well is 502 93 m deep and screened at the depth interval of 403 502 m the jx well is located in a groundwater depression cone of the southern taiyuan basin one of the major coal producing areas the jx well is 315 m deep and screened at six different depths in the interval of 77 58 301 64 m rock types of aquifer in the open intervals of both wells are mainly sandstone or consolidated sand gravel table 1 lists basic well construction information fig 1 shows locations of each well and the study area fig 2 shows geochronology and lithology information of the aquifer in the wells water level in the four wells are recorded by an ln 3a digital piezometer sensor developed by the institute of earthquake science china earthquake administration cea at a sampling interval of 1 min from may 2007 the digital piezometer readings are converted into groundwater level with a resolution of 1 mm in the range between 0 and 10 m the absolute accuracy is 0 2 percent of full scale to identify water level changes induced by earthquakes barometric pressure and rainfall data near the wells were collected to clarify their influence on water levels in our analysis fig 3 shows the time series of water level changes recorded from 2007 to 2019 additionally in order to examine the relationship between earthquake induced groundwater level changes and regional groundwater flow field we further collected the data of deep groundwater level contours constructed by almost 100 hydrological well data fig 1 cyan dots which were published by shanxi geological environment monitoring center china geological survey of ministry of land and resources on 2011 february 28 and march 30 respectively http www cgs gov cn xwl ddyw

changes induced by earthquakes are related to seismic energy density a threshold value of 10 3 j m3 of seismic energy density is required to initiate sustained water level changes wang and manga 2010b yan et al 2014 to identify potentially earthquake induced water level changes the energy densities j m3 of worldwide earthquakes were calculated according to log r 0 48 m 0 33 log e 0 4 where m is the magnitude of the event r is the epicenter distance in km wang and manga 2010a the neic national earthquake information center http earthquake usgs gov earthquakes search earthquake catalog was used in order to not miss any earthquake we lower the threshold value to 10 4 j m3 then we examine whether these events induced any water level changes in the four wells totally two types of earthquake induced water level changes were identified transient dynamic oscillations and sustained changes here we mainly focus on sustained water level changes which were induced by 5 events with epicentral distance from 1035 to 4824 km seismic energy density of the 5 events ranged from 9 94 10 4 to 6 72 10 2 j m3 the maximum energy density was caused by the 2011 tohoku m w 9 0 earthquake which occurred at a distance of 2613 km from the monitoring site ty table 2 lists the 5 events used in this study their geographic locations magnitude epicentral distance and energy density at the studied wells the distribution of the earthquake epicenters are showed in fig 1 3 2 tidal analysis of groundwater level temporal variations of the tidal parameters reflect changes in an aquifer s hydraulic properties specifically phase shifts are sensitive to permeability changes and the amplitude changes can be caused by small storage changes hsieh et al 1987 doan et al 2006 so tidal parameter can be used to constrain parameters of the formation and to draw inferences about which of those properties changed after earthquakes elkhoury et al 2006 xue et al 2013 in this work tidal signal were decomposed from the observed water level data and the tidal parameters were calculated with the program baytap g ishiguro and tamura 1985 tamura et al 1991 the program baytap g can identify four components from water level and barometric pressures irregular noise long period trend barometric response and observed tides before doing the tidal analysis possible steps and spikes caused by instrument malfunctions or maintenance works were removed manually the water level data were resampled as hourly data from minute sample a sliding window window length 31 days step 4 days was used for analyzing the time dependent earth tide parameters the theoretical volumetric strain tides were selected to calibrate the water level tides the tidal factors phases and amplitudes of the tidal constituents m2 s2 o1 s1 k1 were selected from the baytap g output where tidal factor is defined as the amplitude ratio of observed water pressure to theoretical volumetric strain tide negative phases correspond to time lags the calculating error was given as root mean square error rmse it should be noted that s1 k1 and s2 are not pure gravitational tides but also contain an unknown contribution of radiational sometimes called thermal tides agnew 2007 the m2 wave is more stable with larger amplitude and less rmse than o1 thus for the discussion with respect to earth tides the focus of this work is on the purely gravitational tidal bands m2 and o1 4 results 4 1 water level changes induced by earthquakes in term of water level changes induced by the 5 events detail information was listed in table 3 both co seismic offset changes rise and fall and oscillations without persistent changes were induced during the passage of seismic waves offset rise or fall co seismic water level changes were induced by all of the 5 earthquakes in ty qx and xy wells and were induced by one earthquake in jx well the offset amplitudes range from 0 01 to 0 99 m with recovery periods of several hours to tens of days oscillations were recorded in jx well after the occurrence of 4 earthquakes the oscillations maintained several minutes with small amplitudes 0 1 2 cm for the same earthquake epicentral distances and seismic energy density did not show any obvious difference between the offset and oscillation changes 4 2 tidal behavior changes induced by earthquakes fig 4 shows that the m2 tidal parameters varies from may 2007 to may 2019 in the 4 wells tidal behavior changes induced by earthquakes only occurred in ty and qx wells table 4 listed detailed information of tidal behavior changes induced by earthquakes in ty and qx wells in ty well the m2 tidal factor and phase shift showed opposite changes character i e tidal factor of water level decreased after 4 earthquakes with amplitudes ranged from 0 29 to 2 55 gpa at the same time phase shift increased with amplitudes ranged from 2 89 to 42 88 the maximum tidal change was induced by the 2011 tohoku m w 9 0 earthquake in qx well tidal factor and phase shift showed significant changes in the same sign after 5 earthquakes synchronous increase of tidal factor and phase shift were recorded after two earthquakes i e the 2007 sumatra m w 8 5 and the 2012 sumatra m w 8 6 earthquake synchronous decrease of tidal factor and phase shift were recorded after three earthquakes i e the 2008 wenchuan m w 7 9 the 2011 tohoku m w 9 0 and the 2015 nepal m w 7 8 earthquake the increase tidal factor ranged from 0 88 to 6 27 gpa and the phases shift ranged from 16 to 75 the decrease tidal factor ranged from 1 67 to 5 88 gpa and the phase shifts ranged from 23 35 to 79 78 after each earthquake the tidal parameters stayed at high or low level and did not recover to pre earthquake level except following the 2015 nepal m w 7 8 earthquake an additional change of unidentified reason in tidal behavior occurred in 2009 showed the same pattern of changes induced by earthquakes in xy and jx wells the temporal variation of the tidal signal was relatively stable no any significant change was recorded after each earthquake 5 discussion in this work we have presented water level changes caused by five large earthquakes in four wells in a rift basin both oscillations and offset rise and fall changes in water level were recorded after multiple large earthquakes the tides were decomposed from well water level and the tidal factors and phase shift were calculated with baytap g program while tidal behavior and water level changes did not always occurred simultaneously in terms of the five earthquakes since the static strain caused by the slipping of faults cannot induce such large changes in water level even for the nearest 2008 wenchuan m w7 9 earthquake and for the largest 2011 tohoku m w 9 0 earthquake the static strain caused by the wenchuan and the tohoku earthquake is about 7 9 10 10 and 3 1 10 9 respectively which could cause several millimeters of water level changes far smaller than the observed water level changes the dynamic strain is a possible candidate in terms of the same earthquake epicentral distance and seismic energy density did not show significant difference while different wells recorded water level changes of different polarities for instance after the 2011 tohoku m w 9 0 earthquake rise and recovery changes in water level were recorded in qx wells fall of water level were recorded in ty and xy wells and oscillations were recorded in jx well according to earthquake induced permeability changes model the polarities may be related to local hydraulic gradient wang and manga 2010b co seismic rise of water level will occur if the permeability enhanced in the up gradient of the well and co seismic drop of water level if permeability enhanced in the down gradient of the well shi et al 2015 to examine the relationship between local hydraulic gradient and earthquake induced water level changes we collected the groundwater flow field data before 28 february 2011 and after 30 march 2011 the 2011 tohoku m w 9 0 earthquake fig 1 shows the contour map of groundwater level height relative to sea level fig 5 shows the corresponding cross section through qx xy and jx well the results show that qx well is located in the center of the basin with flat landform and less local hydraulic gradient xy and jx wells are located in the margin of the basin with steep terrain and large local hydraulic gradients it is noted that the aquifer material in jx is mainly sandstone and gravel which is different from other wells with solid rocks the depth of penetration in jx is higher than other wells relative to mean sea level the shock waves from earthquakes will travel faster in solid rock than sandy gravels and clayey soils hence more new fractures can occur along paths of solid rock this can lead to falling or rising of water levels depending on whether the new fractures are dry or wet from table 3 all the water level variations in all the wells except jx undergo falling and rising changes so different aquifer material and local hydraulic gradients could be the reason why different water level responses were recorded in the four wells in addition jx well is located in a groundwater depression cone up gradient area hence the water level is always rising slightly obvious rising of water level was recorded at center of the depression cone after the 2011 tohoku m w 9 0 earthquake fig 5 cc profile tidal factor and phase shift between the water level and the earth tides were used as a proxy for storativity and permeability changes in the well aquifer system doan et al 2006 elkhoury et al 2006 xue et al 2013 the results of water level tidal response showed that the jx well has the smallest mean tidal factor of 1 4 gpa and mean phase shift of 11 9 the smaller tidal factor and negative phase shift means higher storativity and higher horizontal permeability cooper et al 1965 acworth et al 2017 shih 2017 in such situation the well hydraulically coupled to the formation the higher the permeability of the aquifer is the easier oscillations occurred during the passage of seismic waves the better the storativity of a reservoir is the smaller the response amplitude of tidal and seismic waves would be this may result in higher shaking energy required for offset water level changes than oscillations thus earthquake tends to induced water level oscillational changes in jx well the ranges of tidal factor and phase shift are 4 5 7 5 gpa and 8 5 to 40 1 in ty well 1 0 8 8 gpa and 79 9 to 23 7 in qx well 4 3 6 7 gpa and 8 2 to 16 8 in xy well respectively earthquake induced water level and tidal behavior changes did not occurred simultaneously for instance offset water level changes occurred without tidal behavior changes after five earthquakes in xy well the amplitudes of offset water level changes ranged from 0 01 to 0 75 m in xy well while offset water level and tidal behavior changes were recorded after multiple earthquakes in ty well with offset water level changes of 0 01 0 06 m and in qx well with offset water level changes of 0 02 0 99 m which means that these two wells are sensitive to seismically dynamic strain in terms of tides the tidal factor and phase shift in the ty qx and xy well had no obvious difference during the period of no earthquakes which means that other local hydro geological structure may affect water and tidal behavior it is noteworthy that ty well penetrates the damage zone of jiaochen faults which is a listric faults on the northwestern edges of the taiyuan basin playing a controlling role in the rift basin the qx well is located in the taigu qixian developed earth fissure area of taiyuan rift basin the fissures are connected to deep hidden faults and their average annual active rate is 1 3 cm peng et al 2018 tang et al 2018 recent studies indicated that hydraulic properties inferred from tidal behavior within fault damage zone are more sensitive and vulnerable than that away from the fault damage zone xue et al 2016 yan et al 2016 in this study the two wells of ty and qx well located in the fault or earth fissure area showed significant changes in tidal factors and phase shifts after multiple earthquakes indicating that permeability and storativity changed after the passage of seismic waves while the xy wells away from active fault did not show any significant change the different response patterns to seismically dynamic strain indicate that fault and earth fissure may be the reason of sensitive water level and tidal behavior changes in terms of earthquake induced tidal change there are three types of plausible physical mechanisms barbour et al 2019 1 radial flow model suggests that m2 tides should have negative phase shift and positive correlation between tidal factor and phase shift hsieh et al 1987 2 vertical flow leakage model suggests that m2 tides should have positive phase shift and negative correlation between tidal factor and phase shift roeloffs et al 1996 wang et al 2018 3 fracture dominated flow model suggests that m2 and o1 tides have phases of opposite sign bower 1983 for the four wells in this work m2 and o1 tides do not have phases of opposite sign figs 4 and 6 the single fracture dominated flow model was firstly excluded for the ty well the m2 tides induced by earthquakes have positive phase shift and negative correlation between tidal factor and phase shift which suggests that earthquakes induced vertical flow changes for the qx well the m2 tides induced by earthquakes have negative or positive phase shift and positive correlation between tidal factor and phase shift which suggests that earthquakes induced mixture flow both vertical and radial flow changes fig 7 another interesting issue is that both increase and decrease of tidal factor and phase shift were recorded in the qx well following some earthquakes clogging or unclogging of fractures due to earthquakes could not explain such large changes in earth tides the qx well is located in the developed earth fissure area and the screened interval is very long hence there could be non equilibrium between some intervals of the wellbore partial clogging of the screened interval or communication between the screened interval and the overlying gravel aquifer or even the surface could be the explanation for such large changes in tidal parameters the fact that a non earthquake tidal changes in 2009 also led to similar tidal behavior related to earthquakes which could be evidence that earthquakes affected the near wellbore environment the earthquake induced well water level and tidal behavior changes may be correlated with the hydrogeological condition fault systems geometry of well aquifer system and local stress state but at this stage no clear models was proposed further research or predictive models are required to predict situations in areas without monitoring data 6 conclusions in this work we analyzed water level and tidal behavior changes caused by five large earthquakes in four wells in the taiyuan rift basin from 2007 to 2019 different water level and tidal behaviors were recorded in the wells after multiple large earthquakes the jx well with higher storativity and higher permeability mainly recorded oscillation changes which suggests that higher seismic energy density might be required to cause sustained water level changes in such wells the other three wells ty qx and xy recorded sustained water level changes after multiple large earthquakes in which tidal behavior changed in the ty and qx wells after some large earthquakes the ty well penetrates the damage zone of the listric jiaochen faults playing a controlling role in the taiyuan rift basin the qx well is located in the taigu qixian developed earth fissure area both wells located in fault damage zone or developed earth fissure area showed synchronized water level and tidal behavior changes after multiple earthquakes which suggested that fissures play an important controlling effect to earthquake induced water level and tidal behavior changes different tidal behavior were recorded in the ty and qx well after earthquakes in the ty well m2 tides induced by earthquakes have positive phase shift and negative correlation between tidal factor and phase shift which suggests that earthquakes induced vertical flow changes in the qx well m2 tides induced by earthquakes have negative or positive phase shift and positive correlation between tidal factor and phase shift which suggests that earthquakes induced mixture of both vertical and radial flow declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the
