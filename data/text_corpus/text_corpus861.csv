4305,characteristics of the water distribution and film thickness within pores control co2 transport and determine the effectiveness of geologic storage although studies of adsorbed water films on solid surfaces are abundant reports about the dependence of co2 transport behavior on film thickness under geologic co2 storage conditions are still lacking in this study the water film thickness was estimated through water adsorption equilibrium experiments on four tight sandstone samples at varying relative humidities the calculated results reveal that the adsorbed water exerts a greater influence on smaller pores as micro and mesopores are first filled with condensed water while macropores only contain absorbed water films and that the measured critical brine film thicknesses are strongly controlled by the clay mineral content the influence of water film thickness on co2 transport was evaluated based on the dlvo theory for cylindrical pores considering the mobility difference of water films in different pores the effective disjoining pressure measured by the most probable pore radius can be regarded as the preliminary basis for the selection of reservoir or caprock and evaluation of the sealing performance of rock increasing the water film thickness results in a smaller effective pore radius and flowable pore space and the movement of water in pore channel causes an electroviscous effect both conditions have a negative effect on co2 movement and eventually decrease the co2 effective permeability keywords water adsorption water film thickness effective disjoining pressure permeability co2 geologic storage 1 introduction co2 has gradually become a hot issue of common concern in earth and environmental sciences the close relationship between the atmospheric co2 content and the global greenhouse effect has attracted extensive attention ipcc 2005 bachu 2000 li et al 2013 yang and yu 2020 the geologic storage of co2 has been widely recognized as an important method to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions juanes et al 2006 and the safety of co2 geological storage is the focus of attention tight rocks such as shale and tight sandstone are regarded as good caprocks for co2 storage because of their low permeability porosity and diffusion coefficient liu et al 2014 espinoza santamarina 2017 and their sealing performance is related to the safety and effectiveness of storage tight rocks have complex pore structures which are rich in micro and nanoscale pores javadpour 2009 clarkson solano 2016 zhao yu b 2017a the water in micro and nanopores is mostly in the form of bound water and the thickness of the bound water film cannot be ignored over the pore radius the moisture content of the rock directly affects the water distribution in its pores and the thickness of the irreducible water film hence the water film reduces the effective pore radius seriously influencing the gas mobility and reservoir storage capacities tokunaga 2012 gas permeability is a key parameter that represents the gas flow characteristics of porous media combined with the breakthrough pressure they are two important indexes for the study of gas transport and storage processes which are greatly affected by the water distribution in rock pores the results of a gas water two phase flow experiment in nanopores 100 nm by wu et al 2014 revealed that at a water saturation of 20 the gas flow capacity is approximately 10 lower than that under dry conditions at a water saturation of 40 the gas flow capacity is reduced by approximately 20 in addition previous studies have investigated the permeability and gas breakthrough in compacted bentonite with water saturations ranging from 0 to 80 tanai et al 2012 in synthetic ca smectite clay at water saturations from 70 to 100 galle 2000 and in shale and tight sandstone with saturations varying between 0 and 100 zhang et al 2016 zhang and yu 2019 these experimental studies demonstrated that the water saturation and clay swelling highly affect the gas permeability and breakthrough pressure however zhao and yu 2017a determined that when the average pore radius is 0 151 μm the breakthrough pressure is scarcely influenced by the increasing water saturation it should be attributed to the difference in the thickness and stability of water film in pores of different sizes the movability of bound water is very different from that of free water in unsaturated rocks the strong bound water is strongly adsorbed on the rock surface and the disjoining pressures of bound water is approximately 45 47 mpa in yang and yu 2020 with the increasing pore radius the properties and structure of the outer layer bound water is generally consistent with free water which is potentially movable regardless of how small a pressure gradient is applied thus understanding how adsorbed water film thickness depends on physicochemical properties of porous media will be useful for more mechanistic predictions of co2 transport in unsaturated tight rocks numerous studies of the basic characteristics and conceptual modeling of water films on mineral surfaces within porous have been completed under atmospheric pressure conditions or and tuller 1999 tokunaga et al 2000 tuller and or 2002 it is suggested that the water films strongly influence multiphase fluid flow and transport under the conditions of coexistence of the water phase and nonwetting phase although studies of adsorbed water films on solid surfaces are abundant experimental data on water film thicknesses under geologic co2 storage conditions are rarely reported tokunaga 2012 considered the problem of adsorbed water film thicknesses on flat mineral surfaces in the presence of co2 kim et al 2012 conducted brine film thickness measurements on silica surfaces of moderate to high permeability under geologic co2 sequestration conditions therefore an in depth study for higher capillary pressures associated with high levels of co2 phase saturation inside cylindrical pores of lower permeability formations is needed for a better understanding of co2 transport in geologic storage thus in this work a water adsorption equilibrium experiment is performed to determine the water distribution inside different pores the water film thickness at various relative humidity rh levels is subsequently investigated using four tight sandstone samples and a new calculation method of the film thickness is established we then carry out the force analysis of water film thickness under various water saturation conditions based on the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory inside cylindrical pores the effect of the water film thickness on co2 breakthrough pressure and effective permeability is discussed this work attempts to reveal the water film thickness in pores of different sizes to provide better insights into the impact of the water film thickness on co2 transport in tight rocks and to offer useful information for the optimization of reservoirs and caprocks as well as the evaluation of the effectiveness of co2 storage 2 experimental samples 2 1 core samples the ordos basin has been considered a potential prospect for large scale co2 capture and storage ccs deployment at the shenhua group ccs site multiple sandstone formations with a relatively low permeability are used for co2 injection and storage zhang et al 2016 five cylindrical sandstone cores from the ordos basin were obtained for gas breakthrough experiments by zhao and yu 2017a 2017b four parallel samples of the above cores were employed in our study these four cores were obtained from the triassic and permian sandstone formations of the zhifang heshangou liujiagou and shiqianfeng groups and they are referred to as samples 1 2 3 and 4 respectively fig 1 table 1 summarizes the depth and dimensional specifications diameter and length of these core samples as the most widely applied method to quantitatively analyze the mineral composition wang et al 2016a x ray diffraction xrd analysis was chosen in our present study all samples were prepared and relevant analytical processes were completed following the sy t 5163 2010 standard with a d max ra x ray diffractometer table 2 lists the main mineral composition of each core 2 2 pore structure analysis the cores selected in this study are all tight sandstones with a low porosity and permeability understanding the micropore structure of the above cores is of great importance for the examination of their gas flow behavior and breakthrough characteristics according to the classification standards of the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac rouquerol et al 1994 pores can be divided into three categories micropores pore size 2 nm mesopores pore size between 2 and 50 nm and macropores pore size 50 nm the high pressure mercury injection capillary pressure micp method is usually applied to determine the pore structure of macropores bustin et al 2008 peng et al 2012 while low pressure adsorption lpa experiments with co2 and n2 are often employed to characterize the pore structure of micro and mesopores clarkson et al 2013 labani et al 2013 the pore distribution curves at the above three different scales are shown in fig 2 in this study we adopt density functional theory dft and barret joyner halenda bjh models to analyze the co2 and n2 adsorption data to obtain the pore size distribution of the micro and mesopores moreover we apply the brunauer emmett teller bet model to calculate the specific surface area ssa of the samples table 3 lists the average radius r pore volume pv and ssa of the micro meso and macropores according to the test results in tables 3 and a1 these four cores with low porosities contain abundant micron and nanoscale pores especially for samples 1 and 4 the ratioof the micro and mesopores to the total pv ranges from 36 to 45 which is 2 3 times that for the other two cores 3 experimental theory and method 3 1 dlvo theory the thicknesses of water films adsorbed on a flat interface with co2 as the confining fluid can be estimated in an application of dlvo analysis using the disjoining pressure tuller or 2003 israelachvili 2011 lebeau konrad 2010 tadros 2013 li et al 2016 the dependence of adsorbed film thickness h on disjoining pressure π is taken as the sum of pressure contributions from van der waals force πm and electrostatic force πm as tuller or 2003 tokunaga 2012 kim et al 2012 1 π h π m h π e h for water vapor adsorption on a solid surface the van der waals force between the solid water interface and the gas water interface can be expressed as 2 π m h a 132 6 π h 3 where a132 is the hamaker constant for the interactions among 1 solid substrate 2 water film and 3 co2 the characteristic value of a132 is 10 20 10 21 j israelachvilli 1991 in the case of the solid water interface and gas water interface separated by water film without added electrolytes the electrostatic pressure is given by 3 π e h ε 0 ε r 2 π k b t ez 2 1 h 2 where ε0 is the permittivity in vacuum εr is the relative permittivity of media kb is the boltzmann constant t is the temperature e is the electron charge and z is the ion valence in this study the water film absorbed in the cylindrical pore of sandstone which is very different from the water film adsorption on a flat surface should be discussed the significant feature of water films adsorbed inside cylindrical pores is that the wetting film has been curved li et al 2017 therefore the effective disjoining pressure πeff caused by a pore surface is different from that caused by a planar surface and the additional cylindrical capillary pressure pc caused by the curved wetting film should also be considered the disjoining pressure inside capillaries is r r h π h rather than π h due to the curved wetting film mattia et al 2012 therefore the effective disjoining pressure inside capillaries is given by 4 π e f f h r r h π h σ r h in this case eq b1 as shown in appendix b is extended to mattia et al 2012 5 p c p g p w r r h π h σ r h the interfacial tension σ can be calculated according to the following equation sutton 2009 6 σ 1 58 10 3 ρ w ρ g 1 76 t r 0 3125 4 10 3 where ρw and ρg are the density of water and the density of gas respectively tr is the reduced temperature of gas 3 2 experimental method the water adsorption equilibrium method is a reliable way to acquire the water saturation of low permeability samples especially for the cores in our study which are low and ultralow permeability sandstone cores the determination of the saturated weight of a sample is the premise to calculate the water saturation so fully water saturated core samples are prepared with high pressure helium after the water adsorption equilibrium experiments 3 2 1 water adsorption equilibrium method the water adsorption equilibrium experiment was conducted in a constant temperature and constant humidity incubator fig 3 the temperature and humidity inside the incubator could be adjusted to different values and maintained constantduring the experimental process the accuracy of temperature and humidity is 5 and 1 respectively the incubator included a sample container a heating system a humidification system a refrigeration system a sensor system an air loop system and a control system first the samples were dried in the sample container for 24 h at 105 c to obtain the dry weight m0 under these conditions any pre existing bound moisture was removed while avoiding irreversible changes in the microstructure of the cores then by setting appropriate humidity and temperature levels water adsorption equilibrium experiments were performed on the core samples the experiments were conducted at seven different relative humidities including 15 35 55 65 75 85 and 95 in addition to examine the effect of the water distribution and water film thickness on the gas transport the results of previous breakthrough experiments zhao yu 2017a and our study should be combined for comprehensive analysis therefore the temperature during the water adsorption process was kept at 40 in keeping with the breakthrough experiments all core samples were allowed to equilibrate under each rh condition over 7 days until adsorption equilibrium was reached when the sample weight remained constant then the weights of the samples were measured at each specific humidity and thereafter the samples were transferred to higher humidity conditions throughout the adsorption process the sample weight was recorded 8 9 times to monitor the adsorption equilibrium progression 3 2 2 preparation of the saturated cores the experimental apparatus as shown in fig 4 was adopted to prepare fully water saturated core samples this apparatus consists of a core container a liquid injection system a gas injection system a gas compression system and a vacuum pump system the core container could be placed under vacuum by the vacuum pump system and the liquid injection system allowed deionized water to enter the core container and saturate the core sample inside gas could be pressurized to the desired value by the gas compression system and injected into the core container by the gas injection system the pressure gauge connected to the core container showed the interior pressure first each core sample was dried at 105 c for 8 h to determine the dry weight m0 then the sample was placed under vacuum for 12 h next distilled water was injected and the sample was completely submerged in water to ensure uniform saturation the system was then pressurized with helium to 10 mpa for at least 12 h until no weight increase was observed next the core was removed and weighed and the saturated weight m1 of the sample was obtained table 4 helium was applied to avoid gas water mineral interactions and the sorption capacity of helium is considered to be negligible zhao yu 2017b wang et al 2016b 4 results and discussion 4 1 water vapor adsorption isotherm 4 1 1 water adsorption characteristics the water adsorption equilibrium experiments on the four samples were conducted at an rh ranging from 15 to 95 and the adsorption isotherms are shown in fig 5 we measured the dry weight m0 of each core as well as the final unsaturated weight m at each rh therefore the moisture content m is given by 7 m m m 0 m 0 100 the four samples exhibited similar adsorption isotherms they could be divided into three stages at stage ι rh 0 15 there is a rapid increase in absorbed water with increased rh and then a moderate increase follows over the range of 0 15 rh 0 75 at stage ii next at stage iii rh 0 75 the adsorbed water increased with rh in a much higher rate according to the iupac classification the adsorption isotherms of all four samples exhibited a shape similar to that of sigmoid type ii this type of isotherm indicates an indefinite multilayer formation after completion of the monolayer shen et al 2018 and is found in adsorbents with a wide distribution of pore size dosunmu okoro 2012 the influence of pv and ssa on the water adsorption capacity is obvious as shown in fig 6 the variation trend of the water adsorption characteristics is basically consistent with that of the pore structure especially with that of the pv and ssa of the micro and mesopores the core samples with a large pv or ssa exhibited relatively high water adsorption capacities and rates conversely the water adsorption capacity and rate of the core samples with a small pv and ssa were low in contrast the impact of the macropores on the water adsorption capacity or rate was weak which may occur because there was only little or no adsorbed water in the macropores even at rh 95 the water amount within pores at the beginning of the water adsorption process is generally small and may first occur on the surfaces of small pores over time when the micro and mesopores become filled with moisture water then begins to accumulate in the macropores li et al 2018 in addition the effect of the mineral composition on water adsorption is mainly manifested in the clay mineral content especially when more montmorillonite occurs the core sample attains a highwater adsorptioncapacity and the water adsorption rate varies greatly in the water adsorption process dong et al 2017 the water adsorption performance of sample 1 suitably validates the above theory sample 1 contains 14 montmorillonite and 2 kaolinite resulting in the maximum water adsorption capacity and water adsorption rate comparing samples 1 and 4 as shown in fig 6 it is observed that although the pvs of these two cores are veryclose the water adsorption capacity of the former is much higher we suspect that this could be attributed to its highest clay mineral content although kerisit and parker 2004 rahaman et al 2008 and schultz et al 2013 proposed that calcite is characterized by a high surface area and weak affinity for water sample 1 which contains 24 calcite still attained the highest water capacity mainly because the wettability of clay minerals is greater than that of calcite and the contact angle of the sample decreases with an increasing hydrophilic mineral content especially with an increasing montmorillonite content yang yu 2020 the sample with a strongly hydrophilic clay mineral content tends to have a relatively higher water capacity therefore it could be considered that the clay mineral content is the primary factor influencing water adsorption followed by the pore structure 4 1 2 rh sw relationship at different relative humidities the water saturation distribution is highly affected by the pore size and the micro and mesopores are filled with water under certain conditions while the macropores only contain bound water films pore structure analysis reveals that all four samples contain a certain proportion of macro meso and micropores table 3 therefore the water adsorption process in our study is a very complex process as it evolves through monolayer adsorption multilayer adsorption and capillary condensation fig 7 shows the relationship between the rh and water saturation the water saturation sw corresponding to the different relative humidities can be determined by the following equation 8 s w m m o m 1 m o 100 sample 1 attains the highest water saturation which approaches nearly 80 followed by sample 4 with a water saturation close to 60 in addition the water saturation of samples 2 and 3 only approaches 7 and the change in water saturation for samples 2 and 3 is slow with the increasing rh in conventional sandstone reservoirs the unsaturated phenomenon is primarily caused by a displacement of reservoir water by the gas phase during the co2 geological storage process thus samples 2 and 3 are more similar to these conventional sandstone reservoirs conversely in tight sandstone formation an ultralow water saturation is the result of water evaporation during the hydrocarbon generation process further the low permeability characteristics of tight formation make displacement behavior difficult to occur therefore the water adsorption equilibrium method is a more reliable way to acquire the water saturation of tight formation samples such as samples 1 and 4 which are more suitable as caprock for co2 geological storage 4 2 water film thickness 4 2 1 water film thickness in the different pore sizes previous studies have demonstrated that the amount of water within pores at the beginning of the water saturation process is small and occurs on the surfaces of small pores wu et al 2001 cieslinski mosdorf 2005 in the thermodynamic system of water film adsorption on a flat substrate the relationship between disjoining pressure and rh can be described as tuller et al 1999 9 π e f f h v r t ln p m p o 10 π eff h rt v l n r h eqs 9 and 10 indicate that the relationship between the water film thickness and rh in pores with different sizes as shown in fig 8 the variation in water film thickness for different pore sizes is significant with the same rh the smaller the pore radius is the larger the water film thickness with an increase in rh the small pores will be filled first to reveal the water film thickness in the different pore sizes a new calculation method is proposed according to the water distribution at the various rhs we assume that only after the micro to mesopores have been filled does water begin to accumulate in the macropores therefore the water amount occurring in the different pores is proportional to their pv the volume fraction of the different pore sizes is the ratio of their pv table 3 to the total pv again we determined the surface area a as the product of the ssa table 3 and the dry weight of the sample table 4 the water amount in the different pore sizes is calculated with eq 11 and the average water film thickness h in the different pore sizes is obtained by eq 12 11 v w m w ρ w p 12 h v w a where vw is the water volume mw is the water mass in the pores ρw is the density of water i e 0 99 g cm3 and p is the volume fraction table 5 provides the water film thickness in the three different types of pores at the seven rh levels the micropores of all samples are almost blocked even at a low rh as the average water film thickness in the micropores approaches or exceeds the average micropore radius with increasing rh the water film thickness in the mesopores of samples 2 and 3 gradually increases and the maximum water saturation in the mesopores reaches 31 and 37 respectively additionally the mesopores of sample 4 are blocked when the rh 55 while the mesopores of sample 1 are blocked except at an rh of 15 in regard to the macropores water films only form in samples 1 and 4 and the maximum water saturation reaches 59 and 33 respectively the calculation results quantify the distribution characteristics of the water saturation at the different pore scales at a certain rh differences occur in the water saturation between the different pore scales as the micropores and some of the mesopores are filled with capillary water while the macropores only contain bound water films 4 2 2 critical water film thickness as shown in fig 9 a and b with increasing water saturation the absorbed water film experiences a progressive process from monolayer adsorption to multilayer adsorption when the water film thickness reaches the critical condition fig 9 c the water film forms a liquid bridge and water begins to condense in fig 9 c hc is the critical water film thickness for condensation which can be identified as the sum of the film thickness values in three different pore sizes by comparing the hc values in table 5 the critical water film thickness of sample 1 is 3 6 times that of the other samples under the same rh conditions it is likely that the positive effect of clay minerals on water film formation is obvious as the high clay mineral content of sample 1 leads to the maximum critical water film thickness sample 1 contains a high content of clay minerals especially montmorillonite which has a large ssa and exhibits a high hydrophilicity when the sample is in contact with water water molecules will enter the crystal interlayer of montmorillonite the accumulation of water molecules will cause the expansion of the interlayer spacing leading to an increase in the amount of water entering the interlayer during the water adsorption experimental process we found that the influence of the micro and mesopore structures on the water adsorption process is obvious fig 10 confirms this standpoint since the water film thickness is positively correlated with the pv and ssa of the micro and mesopores while the correlation with the pv of the macropores is poor in other words the effect of the water saturation on the micro to mesopores is more notable at the same water saturation almost all the micropores and some mesopores of the samples may be blocked by capillary water while only a little or no adsorbed water occurs in the macropores the relationship between the critical water film thickness and corresponding water saturation is shown in fig 11 the hc value increased in the form of a power function as the water saturation increased the correlation coefficients r2 are 0 9996 0 9971 0 9992 and 0 9954 indicating their close relationship 4 3 effect of the water film thickness on co2 transport co2 breakthrough experiments conducted at various water saturations on these four parallel core samples were performed by zhao and yu 2017a as described in zhao and yu 2017a the breakthrough pressure of sample 1 at sw 37 2 was 7 83 mpa which indicates that the injection gas pressure already reached 16 33 mpa even though the inlet pressure approached the instrument limitation 20 mpa co2 still failed to break through therefore only two groups of breakthrough experiments were carried out for sample 1 for the other three samples the co2 breakthrough pressure pbt and effective permeability keff was obtained under four different water saturation conditions the experimental results are presented in table 6 with the critical water film thickness at each water saturation for all samples determined with the fitting equations in the hc sw relationship in fig 11 4 3 1 effect of the water film thickness on co2 breakthrough pressure zhao and yu 2017a demonstrated that the breakthrough pressure for dry samples decreases with an increase in the average pore radius in the power function however since the change in water film thickness with an increase in water saturation is not distinct the relationship between pore size and breakthrough pressure under unsaturation conditions cannot be described quantitatively as described in table 6 the breakthrough pressure of samples 2 and 3 hardly changes with water saturation which can be attributed to the great influence of critical pore radius critical water film thickness on co2 transport as previously noted the movability of water film in different pore sizes is very variable according to the distance from the solid surface and the magnitude of the interfacial forces between the water molecules and the solid surface the movability of water film with different thicknesses can be investigated li et al 2019 woodruff revil 2012 as wetting films grows with water saturation the pressure caused by curved wetting films becomes significant which will dominate the instability of the films therefore the pore radius is the primary reason affecting the stability of water films in cylindrical pores li et al 2017 fig 12 illustrates the effective disjoining pressure acting on the water film inside cylindrical pores with different radii taking sample 4 as an example it can be seen that the pressure variation is remarkable when the film thickness is close to the pore radius for example when the critical water film thickness is 2 44 nm at sw 16 6 with an increase in the pore radius from 3 to 5 nm the pressure decreases significantly by 65 when r hc there is no significant pressure change based on dlvo theory inside cylindrical pores the effective disjoining pressure of different critical water film thicknesses under various water saturation can be measured considering that eq 4 describes the stability of water film with uniform thickness the most probable pore radius pore radius which has maximal probability is chosen to represent r in eq 4 according to micp measurements the calculated values of r for samples 1 2 3 and 4 are 0 014 0 713 1 760 and 0 028 nm respectively other values of physical constants needed for the calculation are listed in table 7 the comparisons between the effective disjoining pressure calculated using dlvo theory and the experimental results of breakthrough pressure in zhao yu 2017a are illustrated in fig 13 although the order of magnitude of these two pressures is consistent in fig 13 there is still a gap between their values the effective disjoining pressure measured by eq 4 based on the most probable pore radius can be regarded as the basis for evaluating the sealing performance of rocks in the case of high water saturation co2 can enter samples 2 and 3 only by overcoming low capillary pressure 0 1 mpa which means that this kind of sandstone with a large pore radius is more suitable as the target reservoir for co2 storage when it is covered with suitable caprock coincidentally tight sandstone such as sample 1 can be utilized as a suitable caprock as much larger capillary pressure should be conquered for co2 to breakthrough even at lower water saturation for sample 4 the pore size distribution is more uniform than that of the other three cores as the trend line of sample 4 in fig 2 is gentle and its peak value is the lowest as a result the effective disjoining pressure that was calculated using the most probable pore radius will have a relatively large deviation from the experimental results with an increase in hc the difference in the effective pore size distribution is narrowed resulting in the gradual elimination of the deviation 4 3 2 effect of the water film thickness on co2 permeability the regularity of the change in co2 effective permeability and critical water film thickness with water saturation for all samples is illustrated in fig 14 at the same water saturation the critical water film thicknesses of samples 2 and 3 are much larger than those of samples 1 and 4 while the effective permeabilities of the latter two aremuchlowerthanthose of the former two the thicker water film seems to have resulted in a higher gas permeability in fact thecauseofthisphenomenonis the disregard of the inherent pore size distribution characteristics compared to the average pore radius and pv values listed in table 3 it is found that the proportion of micro and mesopores only amounts to approximately 19 and 17 for samples 2 and 3 respectively but reaches as high as 45 and 36 for samples 1 and 4 respectively moreover the three average pore radii of samples 2 and 3 are all larger than those of samples 1 and 4 therefore at the same water saturation the number of pores filled with condensed water in samples 1 and 4 is much larger than that filled with condensed water in samples 2 and 3 in other words a relatively small critical water film thickness could block a high proportion of micro to mesopores in samples 1 and 4 furthermore with continuously increasing water saturation water films are formed in the remaining macropores hence in samples 2 and 3 co2 will easily flow through macropores with large average radii and high proportions leading to high gas permeabilities as shown in table c1 the relationships between effective permeability and water saturation for the three samples were represented by an exponential model in zhao and yu 2017a except for sample 1 which occurs due to incomplete data therefore when the water saturation ranges from 10 to 90 at intervals of 10 the relationship between the critical water film thickness and co2 effective permeability for these three core samples is presented in fig 15 the fitting curves in fig 15 indicate that the relationship can be represented by an exponential model and a high correlation coefficient indicates a goodness of fit the thicker the water film is the lower the gas permeability is on the one hand this negative effect occurs because the thicker critical water film causes a limited flowable pore space as a higher proportion of pores have been filled with water on the other hand in unsaturated pores a thicker critical water film leads to a smaller effective pore radius although the effective disjoining pressure hardly changes with an increase in water film for samples 2 and 3 the movement of water will lead to the transport of net charge resulting in an electroviscous effect that would reduce the net flow rate yang yu 2020 for pure water in small channels the flow resistance caused by the electroviscous effect could reach 20 li 2001 accordingly the electroviscous effect will have a more predominant negative effect on the movement of co2 resulting in a decrease in co2 effective permeability 5 conclusions in this paper we first investigated the water adsorption characteristics of four samples with different pore structures and mineral compositions and proposed a calculation method to quantify the absorbed water film thickness inside the various pore sizes afterwards the effects of the water saturation distribution and water film thickness on gas transport based on the dlvo theory were analyzed according to this study the following main conclusions are obtained 1 the adsorption isotherms indicate that all four sandstone samples have a wide distribution of pore size and experienced mono to multilayer adsorption with increasing rh the main factor influencing the water adsorption behavior is the clay mineral content followed by the pv and ssa of the micro and mesopores the impact of the macropores on the water adsorption characteristics and film thickness is weak 2 a new calculation method is proposed to measure the water film thickness in different pore sizes which confirms that the micro and mesopores are initially filled with condensed water while the macropores only contain absorbed water films and the critical water film thickness increased in the form of a power function as the water saturation increased it also reveals that clay minerals with a high hydrophilicity dominate the water adsorption behavior and impose an obvious influence on the water film thickness the critical water film thickness of the sandstone sample with a high montmorillonite content can reach 3 6 times that of other samples at the same rh 3 the influence of water film thickness on co2 transport was evaluated based on the dlvo theory inside cylindrical pores considering the mobility difference in the water film of different pores the effective disjoining pressure measured by the most probable pore radius can be regarded as the preliminary basis for the selection of reservoir or caprock and the evaluation of the sealing performance of rock as co2 can enter samples 2 and 3 only by overcoming low capillary pressure and the stability of water film is almost unaffected by an increase in water saturation it is proven that sandstone with a large pore radius is more suitable as the target reservoir for co2 storage in contrast the effective disjoining pressure of water film increases significantly with water saturation for samples 1 and 4 which can be regarded as caprock for co2 storage 4 for sandstone samples with known pore size distribution characteristics the thicker the water film is the lower the co2 permeability is and their relationship is represented by an exponential model with increasing water film thickness the percentage of pores blocked by condensed water greatly increases resulting in a smaller effective pore radius and flowable pore space on the other hand the movement of water in the pore channel will lead to the transport of net charge resulting in an electroviscous effect that would have a negative effect on the co2 movement both of them eventually lead to a decrease in co2 effective permeability further experimental and computational studies on water films wetting different lithological rocks over wider ranges of disjoining pressures are needed to better understand film behavior and its influence on gas transport under geologic co2 sequestration conditions notation π h disjoining pressure of liquid

and porosity were measured by helium to significantly reduce possible measurement errors from gas adsorption in addition the measurements with gas avoid changes in the pore structure which may be caused by water rock interactions when measuring the permeability with water the equipment and experimental procedures for the permeability and porosity measurements were provided by zhao and yu 2017a three measurements were conducted to test the accuracy and the average value of kabs and porosity table a1 were acquired by averaging the results of three identical experiments on each dried core sample furthermore the correlation analysis results between the porosity and permeability are shown in fig a1 the correlation between these parameters is very poor because the permeability is determined by both the porosity and pore structure moreover cores with high porosities even exhibit lower permeabilities this is exactly a manifestation of the pore structure differences among low permeability rocks the shape size and connectivity of pores in tight formation rocks greatly influence the permeability as a result the variation in the water bearing characteristics at the different pore scales is considerable which has tremendous consequences for the gas flow capacity li et al 2016 appendix b young laplace equation a meniscus interface at the gas water contact surface and the fluid pressure on both sides of the meniscus interface are discontinuous which generates capillary pressure the capillary pressure is an important driving force for water flow in unsaturated pores kopp et al 2009 bergmo et al 2011 it is equal to the difference between the internal pressures of the water pw and the internal pressures of the gas phases pg young 1805 b1 p c p g p w according to the young laplace equation eq b2 the magnitude of the capillary pressure depends on the curvature of the meniscus and interfacial tension ift b2 p c 2 σ r where σ is the ift and r is the average radius of the curvature as shown in fig b1 it is generally assumed that the meniscus interface is a spherical surface therefore the young laplace equation can be expressed as b3 p c 2 σ cos θ r c where θ is the contact angle and rc is the critical pore radius of the rock washburn 1921 dake 1978 tokunaga et al 2013 the young laplace equation can also be expressed as eq b4 when the pore radius r is smaller than the critical radius pores will be filled with condensed water conversely if r rc the middle part of a pore is filled with gas and the pore wall is covered by a water film b4 r c 2 σ cos θ p c with the use of p0 to represent the saturated vapor pressure of water and pm to represent the saturated vapor pressure on the meniscus interface the well known kelvin equation can be expressed as b5 ln p m p 0 2 σ c o s θ rt r c v where v is the molar volume of water r is the gas constant and rh is the ratio of pm to p0 thus the kelvin equation can be rewritten as b6 r c 2 σ c o s θ v rt 1 l n r h thus the critical pore radius is largely related to the rock properties and rh the critical condition of the adsorbed water film transition into spontaneous condensation can be predicted with eq b6 considering that the contact angle of the pore surface with the water film is difficult to quantify the critical pore radius is measured by water adsorption experiments in this study and the value is represented by the critical water film thickness appendix c table c1 
4305,characteristics of the water distribution and film thickness within pores control co2 transport and determine the effectiveness of geologic storage although studies of adsorbed water films on solid surfaces are abundant reports about the dependence of co2 transport behavior on film thickness under geologic co2 storage conditions are still lacking in this study the water film thickness was estimated through water adsorption equilibrium experiments on four tight sandstone samples at varying relative humidities the calculated results reveal that the adsorbed water exerts a greater influence on smaller pores as micro and mesopores are first filled with condensed water while macropores only contain absorbed water films and that the measured critical brine film thicknesses are strongly controlled by the clay mineral content the influence of water film thickness on co2 transport was evaluated based on the dlvo theory for cylindrical pores considering the mobility difference of water films in different pores the effective disjoining pressure measured by the most probable pore radius can be regarded as the preliminary basis for the selection of reservoir or caprock and evaluation of the sealing performance of rock increasing the water film thickness results in a smaller effective pore radius and flowable pore space and the movement of water in pore channel causes an electroviscous effect both conditions have a negative effect on co2 movement and eventually decrease the co2 effective permeability keywords water adsorption water film thickness effective disjoining pressure permeability co2 geologic storage 1 introduction co2 has gradually become a hot issue of common concern in earth and environmental sciences the close relationship between the atmospheric co2 content and the global greenhouse effect has attracted extensive attention ipcc 2005 bachu 2000 li et al 2013 yang and yu 2020 the geologic storage of co2 has been widely recognized as an important method to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions juanes et al 2006 and the safety of co2 geological storage is the focus of attention tight rocks such as shale and tight sandstone are regarded as good caprocks for co2 storage because of their low permeability porosity and diffusion coefficient liu et al 2014 espinoza santamarina 2017 and their sealing performance is related to the safety and effectiveness of storage tight rocks have complex pore structures which are rich in micro and nanoscale pores javadpour 2009 clarkson solano 2016 zhao yu b 2017a the water in micro and nanopores is mostly in the form of bound water and the thickness of the bound water film cannot be ignored over the pore radius the moisture content of the rock directly affects the water distribution in its pores and the thickness of the irreducible water film hence the water film reduces the effective pore radius seriously influencing the gas mobility and reservoir storage capacities tokunaga 2012 gas permeability is a key parameter that represents the gas flow characteristics of porous media combined with the breakthrough pressure they are two important indexes for the study of gas transport and storage processes which are greatly affected by the water distribution in rock pores the results of a gas water two phase flow experiment in nanopores 100 nm by wu et al 2014 revealed that at a water saturation of 20 the gas flow capacity is approximately 10 lower than that under dry conditions at a water saturation of 40 the gas flow capacity is reduced by approximately 20 in addition previous studies have investigated the permeability and gas breakthrough in compacted bentonite with water saturations ranging from 0 to 80 tanai et al 2012 in synthetic ca smectite clay at water saturations from 70 to 100 galle 2000 and in shale and tight sandstone with saturations varying between 0 and 100 zhang et al 2016 zhang and yu 2019 these experimental studies demonstrated that the water saturation and clay swelling highly affect the gas permeability and breakthrough pressure however zhao and yu 2017a determined that when the average pore radius is 0 151 μm the breakthrough pressure is scarcely influenced by the increasing water saturation it should be attributed to the difference in the thickness and stability of water film in pores of different sizes the movability of bound water is very different from that of free water in unsaturated rocks the strong bound water is strongly adsorbed on the rock surface and the disjoining pressures of bound water is approximately 45 47 mpa in yang and yu 2020 with the increasing pore radius the properties and structure of the outer layer bound water is generally consistent with free water which is potentially movable regardless of how small a pressure gradient is applied thus understanding how adsorbed water film thickness depends on physicochemical properties of porous media will be useful for more mechanistic predictions of co2 transport in unsaturated tight rocks numerous studies of the basic characteristics and conceptual modeling of water films on mineral surfaces within porous have been completed under atmospheric pressure conditions or and tuller 1999 tokunaga et al 2000 tuller and or 2002 it is suggested that the water films strongly influence multiphase fluid flow and transport under the conditions of coexistence of the water phase and nonwetting phase although studies of adsorbed water films on solid surfaces are abundant experimental data on water film thicknesses under geologic co2 storage conditions are rarely reported tokunaga 2012 considered the problem of adsorbed water film thicknesses on flat mineral surfaces in the presence of co2 kim et al 2012 conducted brine film thickness measurements on silica surfaces of moderate to high permeability under geologic co2 sequestration conditions therefore an in depth study for higher capillary pressures associated with high levels of co2 phase saturation inside cylindrical pores of lower permeability formations is needed for a better understanding of co2 transport in geologic storage thus in this work a water adsorption equilibrium experiment is performed to determine the water distribution inside different pores the water film thickness at various relative humidity rh levels is subsequently investigated using four tight sandstone samples and a new calculation method of the film thickness is established we then carry out the force analysis of water film thickness under various water saturation conditions based on the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory inside cylindrical pores the effect of the water film thickness on co2 breakthrough pressure and effective permeability is discussed this work attempts to reveal the water film thickness in pores of different sizes to provide better insights into the impact of the water film thickness on co2 transport in tight rocks and to offer useful information for the optimization of reservoirs and caprocks as well as the evaluation of the effectiveness of co2 storage 2 experimental samples 2 1 core samples the ordos basin has been considered a potential prospect for large scale co2 capture and storage ccs deployment at the shenhua group ccs site multiple sandstone formations with a relatively low permeability are used for co2 injection and storage zhang et al 2016 five cylindrical sandstone cores from the ordos basin were obtained for gas breakthrough experiments by zhao and yu 2017a 2017b four parallel samples of the above cores were employed in our study these four cores were obtained from the triassic and permian sandstone formations of the zhifang heshangou liujiagou and shiqianfeng groups and they are referred to as samples 1 2 3 and 4 respectively fig 1 table 1 summarizes the depth and dimensional specifications diameter and length of these core samples as the most widely applied method to quantitatively analyze the mineral composition wang et al 2016a x ray diffraction xrd analysis was chosen in our present study all samples were prepared and relevant analytical processes were completed following the sy t 5163 2010 standard with a d max ra x ray diffractometer table 2 lists the main mineral composition of each core 2 2 pore structure analysis the cores selected in this study are all tight sandstones with a low porosity and permeability understanding the micropore structure of the above cores is of great importance for the examination of their gas flow behavior and breakthrough characteristics according to the classification standards of the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac rouquerol et al 1994 pores can be divided into three categories micropores pore size 2 nm mesopores pore size between 2 and 50 nm and macropores pore size 50 nm the high pressure mercury injection capillary pressure micp method is usually applied to determine the pore structure of macropores bustin et al 2008 peng et al 2012 while low pressure adsorption lpa experiments with co2 and n2 are often employed to characterize the pore structure of micro and mesopores clarkson et al 2013 labani et al 2013 the pore distribution curves at the above three different scales are shown in fig 2 in this study we adopt density functional theory dft and barret joyner halenda bjh models to analyze the co2 and n2 adsorption data to obtain the pore size distribution of the micro and mesopores moreover we apply the brunauer emmett teller bet model to calculate the specific surface area ssa of the samples table 3 lists the average radius r pore volume pv and ssa of the micro meso and macropores according to the test results in tables 3 and a1 these four cores with low porosities contain abundant micron and nanoscale pores especially for samples 1 and 4 the ratioof the micro and mesopores to the total pv ranges from 36 to 45 which is 2 3 times that for the other two cores 3 experimental theory and method 3 1 dlvo theory the thicknesses of water films adsorbed on a flat interface with co2 as the confining fluid can be estimated in an application of dlvo analysis using the disjoining pressure tuller or 2003 israelachvili 2011 lebeau konrad 2010 tadros 2013 li et al 2016 the dependence of adsorbed film thickness h on disjoining pressure π is taken as the sum of pressure contributions from van der waals force πm and electrostatic force πm as tuller or 2003 tokunaga 2012 kim et al 2012 1 π h π m h π e h for water vapor adsorption on a solid surface the van der waals force between the solid water interface and the gas water interface can be expressed as 2 π m h a 132 6 π h 3 where a132 is the hamaker constant for the interactions among 1 solid substrate 2 water film and 3 co2 the characteristic value of a132 is 10 20 10 21 j israelachvilli 1991 in the case of the solid water interface and gas water interface separated by water film without added electrolytes the electrostatic pressure is given by 3 π e h ε 0 ε r 2 π k b t ez 2 1 h 2 where ε0 is the permittivity in vacuum εr is the relative permittivity of media kb is the boltzmann constant t is the temperature e is the electron charge and z is the ion valence in this study the water film absorbed in the cylindrical pore of sandstone which is very different from the water film adsorption on a flat surface should be discussed the significant feature of water films adsorbed inside cylindrical pores is that the wetting film has been curved li et al 2017 therefore the effective disjoining pressure πeff caused by a pore surface is different from that caused by a planar surface and the additional cylindrical capillary pressure pc caused by the curved wetting film should also be considered the disjoining pressure inside capillaries is r r h π h rather than π h due to the curved wetting film mattia et al 2012 therefore the effective disjoining pressure inside capillaries is given by 4 π e f f h r r h π h σ r h in this case eq b1 as shown in appendix b is extended to mattia et al 2012 5 p c p g p w r r h π h σ r h the interfacial tension σ can be calculated according to the following equation sutton 2009 6 σ 1 58 10 3 ρ w ρ g 1 76 t r 0 3125 4 10 3 where ρw and ρg are the density of water and the density of gas respectively tr is the reduced temperature of gas 3 2 experimental method the water adsorption equilibrium method is a reliable way to acquire the water saturation of low permeability samples especially for the cores in our study which are low and ultralow permeability sandstone cores the determination of the saturated weight of a sample is the premise to calculate the water saturation so fully water saturated core samples are prepared with high pressure helium after the water adsorption equilibrium experiments 3 2 1 water adsorption equilibrium method the water adsorption equilibrium experiment was conducted in a constant temperature and constant humidity incubator fig 3 the temperature and humidity inside the incubator could be adjusted to different values and maintained constantduring the experimental process the accuracy of temperature and humidity is 5 and 1 respectively the incubator included a sample container a heating system a humidification system a refrigeration system a sensor system an air loop system and a control system first the samples were dried in the sample container for 24 h at 105 c to obtain the dry weight m0 under these conditions any pre existing bound moisture was removed while avoiding irreversible changes in the microstructure of the cores then by setting appropriate humidity and temperature levels water adsorption equilibrium experiments were performed on the core samples the experiments were conducted at seven different relative humidities including 15 35 55 65 75 85 and 95 in addition to examine the effect of the water distribution and water film thickness on the gas transport the results of previous breakthrough experiments zhao yu 2017a and our study should be combined for comprehensive analysis therefore the temperature during the water adsorption process was kept at 40 in keeping with the breakthrough experiments all core samples were allowed to equilibrate under each rh condition over 7 days until adsorption equilibrium was reached when the sample weight remained constant then the weights of the samples were measured at each specific humidity and thereafter the samples were transferred to higher humidity conditions throughout the adsorption process the sample weight was recorded 8 9 times to monitor the adsorption equilibrium progression 3 2 2 preparation of the saturated cores the experimental apparatus as shown in fig 4 was adopted to prepare fully water saturated core samples this apparatus consists of a core container a liquid injection system a gas injection system a gas compression system and a vacuum pump system the core container could be placed under vacuum by the vacuum pump system and the liquid injection system allowed deionized water to enter the core container and saturate the core sample inside gas could be pressurized to the desired value by the gas compression system and injected into the core container by the gas injection system the pressure gauge connected to the core container showed the interior pressure first each core sample was dried at 105 c for 8 h to determine the dry weight m0 then the sample was placed under vacuum for 12 h next distilled water was injected and the sample was completely submerged in water to ensure uniform saturation the system was then pressurized with helium to 10 mpa for at least 12 h until no weight increase was observed next the core was removed and weighed and the saturated weight m1 of the sample was obtained table 4 helium was applied to avoid gas water mineral interactions and the sorption capacity of helium is considered to be negligible zhao yu 2017b wang et al 2016b 4 results and discussion 4 1 water vapor adsorption isotherm 4 1 1 water adsorption characteristics the water adsorption equilibrium experiments on the four samples were conducted at an rh ranging from 15 to 95 and the adsorption isotherms are shown in fig 5 we measured the dry weight m0 of each core as well as the final unsaturated weight m at each rh therefore the moisture content m is given by 7 m m m 0 m 0 100 the four samples exhibited similar adsorption isotherms they could be divided into three stages at stage ι rh 0 15 there is a rapid increase in absorbed water with increased rh and then a moderate increase follows over the range of 0 15 rh 0 75 at stage ii next at stage iii rh 0 75 the adsorbed water increased with rh in a much higher rate according to the iupac classification the adsorption isotherms of all four samples exhibited a shape similar to that of sigmoid type ii this type of isotherm indicates an indefinite multilayer formation after completion of the monolayer shen et al 2018 and is found in adsorbents with a wide distribution of pore size dosunmu okoro 2012 the influence of pv and ssa on the water adsorption capacity is obvious as shown in fig 6 the variation trend of the water adsorption characteristics is basically consistent with that of the pore structure especially with that of the pv and ssa of the micro and mesopores the core samples with a large pv or ssa exhibited relatively high water adsorption capacities and rates conversely the water adsorption capacity and rate of the core samples with a small pv and ssa were low in contrast the impact of the macropores on the water adsorption capacity or rate was weak which may occur because there was only little or no adsorbed water in the macropores even at rh 95 the water amount within pores at the beginning of the water adsorption process is generally small and may first occur on the surfaces of small pores over time when the micro and mesopores become filled with moisture water then begins to accumulate in the macropores li et al 2018 in addition the effect of the mineral composition on water adsorption is mainly manifested in the clay mineral content especially when more montmorillonite occurs the core sample attains a highwater adsorptioncapacity and the water adsorption rate varies greatly in the water adsorption process dong et al 2017 the water adsorption performance of sample 1 suitably validates the above theory sample 1 contains 14 montmorillonite and 2 kaolinite resulting in the maximum water adsorption capacity and water adsorption rate comparing samples 1 and 4 as shown in fig 6 it is observed that although the pvs of these two cores are veryclose the water adsorption capacity of the former is much higher we suspect that this could be attributed to its highest clay mineral content although kerisit and parker 2004 rahaman et al 2008 and schultz et al 2013 proposed that calcite is characterized by a high surface area and weak affinity for water sample 1 which contains 24 calcite still attained the highest water capacity mainly because the wettability of clay minerals is greater than that of calcite and the contact angle of the sample decreases with an increasing hydrophilic mineral content especially with an increasing montmorillonite content yang yu 2020 the sample with a strongly hydrophilic clay mineral content tends to have a relatively higher water capacity therefore it could be considered that the clay mineral content is the primary factor influencing water adsorption followed by the pore structure 4 1 2 rh sw relationship at different relative humidities the water saturation distribution is highly affected by the pore size and the micro and mesopores are filled with water under certain conditions while the macropores only contain bound water films pore structure analysis reveals that all four samples contain a certain proportion of macro meso and micropores table 3 therefore the water adsorption process in our study is a very complex process as it evolves through monolayer adsorption multilayer adsorption and capillary condensation fig 7 shows the relationship between the rh and water saturation the water saturation sw corresponding to the different relative humidities can be determined by the following equation 8 s w m m o m 1 m o 100 sample 1 attains the highest water saturation which approaches nearly 80 followed by sample 4 with a water saturation close to 60 in addition the water saturation of samples 2 and 3 only approaches 7 and the change in water saturation for samples 2 and 3 is slow with the increasing rh in conventional sandstone reservoirs the unsaturated phenomenon is primarily caused by a displacement of reservoir water by the gas phase during the co2 geological storage process thus samples 2 and 3 are more similar to these conventional sandstone reservoirs conversely in tight sandstone formation an ultralow water saturation is the result of water evaporation during the hydrocarbon generation process further the low permeability characteristics of tight formation make displacement behavior difficult to occur therefore the water adsorption equilibrium method is a more reliable way to acquire the water saturation of tight formation samples such as samples 1 and 4 which are more suitable as caprock for co2 geological storage 4 2 water film thickness 4 2 1 water film thickness in the different pore sizes previous studies have demonstrated that the amount of water within pores at the beginning of the water saturation process is small and occurs on the surfaces of small pores wu et al 2001 cieslinski mosdorf 2005 in the thermodynamic system of water film adsorption on a flat substrate the relationship between disjoining pressure and rh can be described as tuller et al 1999 9 π e f f h v r t ln p m p o 10 π eff h rt v l n r h eqs 9 and 10 indicate that the relationship between the water film thickness and rh in pores with different sizes as shown in fig 8 the variation in water film thickness for different pore sizes is significant with the same rh the smaller the pore radius is the larger the water film thickness with an increase in rh the small pores will be filled first to reveal the water film thickness in the different pore sizes a new calculation method is proposed according to the water distribution at the various rhs we assume that only after the micro to mesopores have been filled does water begin to accumulate in the macropores therefore the water amount occurring in the different pores is proportional to their pv the volume fraction of the different pore sizes is the ratio of their pv table 3 to the total pv again we determined the surface area a as the product of the ssa table 3 and the dry weight of the sample table 4 the water amount in the different pore sizes is calculated with eq 11 and the average water film thickness h in the different pore sizes is obtained by eq 12 11 v w m w ρ w p 12 h v w a where vw is the water volume mw is the water mass in the pores ρw is the density of water i e 0 99 g cm3 and p is the volume fraction table 5 provides the water film thickness in the three different types of pores at the seven rh levels the micropores of all samples are almost blocked even at a low rh as the average water film thickness in the micropores approaches or exceeds the average micropore radius with increasing rh the water film thickness in the mesopores of samples 2 and 3 gradually increases and the maximum water saturation in the mesopores reaches 31 and 37 respectively additionally the mesopores of sample 4 are blocked when the rh 55 while the mesopores of sample 1 are blocked except at an rh of 15 in regard to the macropores water films only form in samples 1 and 4 and the maximum water saturation reaches 59 and 33 respectively the calculation results quantify the distribution characteristics of the water saturation at the different pore scales at a certain rh differences occur in the water saturation between the different pore scales as the micropores and some of the mesopores are filled with capillary water while the macropores only contain bound water films 4 2 2 critical water film thickness as shown in fig 9 a and b with increasing water saturation the absorbed water film experiences a progressive process from monolayer adsorption to multilayer adsorption when the water film thickness reaches the critical condition fig 9 c the water film forms a liquid bridge and water begins to condense in fig 9 c hc is the critical water film thickness for condensation which can be identified as the sum of the film thickness values in three different pore sizes by comparing the hc values in table 5 the critical water film thickness of sample 1 is 3 6 times that of the other samples under the same rh conditions it is likely that the positive effect of clay minerals on water film formation is obvious as the high clay mineral content of sample 1 leads to the maximum critical water film thickness sample 1 contains a high content of clay minerals especially montmorillonite which has a large ssa and exhibits a high hydrophilicity when the sample is in contact with water water molecules will enter the crystal interlayer of montmorillonite the accumulation of water molecules will cause the expansion of the interlayer spacing leading to an increase in the amount of water entering the interlayer during the water adsorption experimental process we found that the influence of the micro and mesopore structures on the water adsorption process is obvious fig 10 confirms this standpoint since the water film thickness is positively correlated with the pv and ssa of the micro and mesopores while the correlation with the pv of the macropores is poor in other words the effect of the water saturation on the micro to mesopores is more notable at the same water saturation almost all the micropores and some mesopores of the samples may be blocked by capillary water while only a little or no adsorbed water occurs in the macropores the relationship between the critical water film thickness and corresponding water saturation is shown in fig 11 the hc value increased in the form of a power function as the water saturation increased the correlation coefficients r2 are 0 9996 0 9971 0 9992 and 0 9954 indicating their close relationship 4 3 effect of the water film thickness on co2 transport co2 breakthrough experiments conducted at various water saturations on these four parallel core samples were performed by zhao and yu 2017a as described in zhao and yu 2017a the breakthrough pressure of sample 1 at sw 37 2 was 7 83 mpa which indicates that the injection gas pressure already reached 16 33 mpa even though the inlet pressure approached the instrument limitation 20 mpa co2 still failed to break through therefore only two groups of breakthrough experiments were carried out for sample 1 for the other three samples the co2 breakthrough pressure pbt and effective permeability keff was obtained under four different water saturation conditions the experimental results are presented in table 6 with the critical water film thickness at each water saturation for all samples determined with the fitting equations in the hc sw relationship in fig 11 4 3 1 effect of the water film thickness on co2 breakthrough pressure zhao and yu 2017a demonstrated that the breakthrough pressure for dry samples decreases with an increase in the average pore radius in the power function however since the change in water film thickness with an increase in water saturation is not distinct the relationship between pore size and breakthrough pressure under unsaturation conditions cannot be described quantitatively as described in table 6 the breakthrough pressure of samples 2 and 3 hardly changes with water saturation which can be attributed to the great influence of critical pore radius critical water film thickness on co2 transport as previously noted the movability of water film in different pore sizes is very variable according to the distance from the solid surface and the magnitude of the interfacial forces between the water molecules and the solid surface the movability of water film with different thicknesses can be investigated li et al 2019 woodruff revil 2012 as wetting films grows with water saturation the pressure caused by curved wetting films becomes significant which will dominate the instability of the films therefore the pore radius is the primary reason affecting the stability of water films in cylindrical pores li et al 2017 fig 12 illustrates the effective disjoining pressure acting on the water film inside cylindrical pores with different radii taking sample 4 as an example it can be seen that the pressure variation is remarkable when the film thickness is close to the pore radius for example when the critical water film thickness is 2 44 nm at sw 16 6 with an increase in the pore radius from 3 to 5 nm the pressure decreases significantly by 65 when r hc there is no significant pressure change based on dlvo theory inside cylindrical pores the effective disjoining pressure of different critical water film thicknesses under various water saturation can be measured considering that eq 4 describes the stability of water film with uniform thickness the most probable pore radius pore radius which has maximal probability is chosen to represent r in eq 4 according to micp measurements the calculated values of r for samples 1 2 3 and 4 are 0 014 0 713 1 760 and 0 028 nm respectively other values of physical constants needed for the calculation are listed in table 7 the comparisons between the effective disjoining pressure calculated using dlvo theory and the experimental results of breakthrough pressure in zhao yu 2017a are illustrated in fig 13 although the order of magnitude of these two pressures is consistent in fig 13 there is still a gap between their values the effective disjoining pressure measured by eq 4 based on the most probable pore radius can be regarded as the basis for evaluating the sealing performance of rocks in the case of high water saturation co2 can enter samples 2 and 3 only by overcoming low capillary pressure 0 1 mpa which means that this kind of sandstone with a large pore radius is more suitable as the target reservoir for co2 storage when it is covered with suitable caprock coincidentally tight sandstone such as sample 1 can be utilized as a suitable caprock as much larger capillary pressure should be conquered for co2 to breakthrough even at lower water saturation for sample 4 the pore size distribution is more uniform than that of the other three cores as the trend line of sample 4 in fig 2 is gentle and its peak value is the lowest as a result the effective disjoining pressure that was calculated using the most probable pore radius will have a relatively large deviation from the experimental results with an increase in hc the difference in the effective pore size distribution is narrowed resulting in the gradual elimination of the deviation 4 3 2 effect of the water film thickness on co2 permeability the regularity of the change in co2 effective permeability and critical water film thickness with water saturation for all samples is illustrated in fig 14 at the same water saturation the critical water film thicknesses of samples 2 and 3 are much larger than those of samples 1 and 4 while the effective permeabilities of the latter two aremuchlowerthanthose of the former two the thicker water film seems to have resulted in a higher gas permeability in fact thecauseofthisphenomenonis the disregard of the inherent pore size distribution characteristics compared to the average pore radius and pv values listed in table 3 it is found that the proportion of micro and mesopores only amounts to approximately 19 and 17 for samples 2 and 3 respectively but reaches as high as 45 and 36 for samples 1 and 4 respectively moreover the three average pore radii of samples 2 and 3 are all larger than those of samples 1 and 4 therefore at the same water saturation the number of pores filled with condensed water in samples 1 and 4 is much larger than that filled with condensed water in samples 2 and 3 in other words a relatively small critical water film thickness could block a high proportion of micro to mesopores in samples 1 and 4 furthermore with continuously increasing water saturation water films are formed in the remaining macropores hence in samples 2 and 3 co2 will easily flow through macropores with large average radii and high proportions leading to high gas permeabilities as shown in table c1 the relationships between effective permeability and water saturation for the three samples were represented by an exponential model in zhao and yu 2017a except for sample 1 which occurs due to incomplete data therefore when the water saturation ranges from 10 to 90 at intervals of 10 the relationship between the critical water film thickness and co2 effective permeability for these three core samples is presented in fig 15 the fitting curves in fig 15 indicate that the relationship can be represented by an exponential model and a high correlation coefficient indicates a goodness of fit the thicker the water film is the lower the gas permeability is on the one hand this negative effect occurs because the thicker critical water film causes a limited flowable pore space as a higher proportion of pores have been filled with water on the other hand in unsaturated pores a thicker critical water film leads to a smaller effective pore radius although the effective disjoining pressure hardly changes with an increase in water film for samples 2 and 3 the movement of water will lead to the transport of net charge resulting in an electroviscous effect that would reduce the net flow rate yang yu 2020 for pure water in small channels the flow resistance caused by the electroviscous effect could reach 20 li 2001 accordingly the electroviscous effect will have a more predominant negative effect on the movement of co2 resulting in a decrease in co2 effective permeability 5 conclusions in this paper we first investigated the water adsorption characteristics of four samples with different pore structures and mineral compositions and proposed a calculation method to quantify the absorbed water film thickness inside the various pore sizes afterwards the effects of the water saturation distribution and water film thickness on gas transport based on the dlvo theory were analyzed according to this study the following main conclusions are obtained 1 the adsorption isotherms indicate that all four sandstone samples have a wide distribution of pore size and experienced mono to multilayer adsorption with increasing rh the main factor influencing the water adsorption behavior is the clay mineral content followed by the pv and ssa of the micro and mesopores the impact of the macropores on the water adsorption characteristics and film thickness is weak 2 a new calculation method is proposed to measure the water film thickness in different pore sizes which confirms that the micro and mesopores are initially filled with condensed water while the macropores only contain absorbed water films and the critical water film thickness increased in the form of a power function as the water saturation increased it also reveals that clay minerals with a high hydrophilicity dominate the water adsorption behavior and impose an obvious influence on the water film thickness the critical water film thickness of the sandstone sample with a high montmorillonite content can reach 3 6 times that of other samples at the same rh 3 the influence of water film thickness on co2 transport was evaluated based on the dlvo theory inside cylindrical pores considering the mobility difference in the water film of different pores the effective disjoining pressure measured by the most probable pore radius can be regarded as the preliminary basis for the selection of reservoir or caprock and the evaluation of the sealing performance of rock as co2 can enter samples 2 and 3 only by overcoming low capillary pressure and the stability of water film is almost unaffected by an increase in water saturation it is proven that sandstone with a large pore radius is more suitable as the target reservoir for co2 storage in contrast the effective disjoining pressure of water film increases significantly with water saturation for samples 1 and 4 which can be regarded as caprock for co2 storage 4 for sandstone samples with known pore size distribution characteristics the thicker the water film is the lower the co2 permeability is and their relationship is represented by an exponential model with increasing water film thickness the percentage of pores blocked by condensed water greatly increases resulting in a smaller effective pore radius and flowable pore space on the other hand the movement of water in the pore channel will lead to the transport of net charge resulting in an electroviscous effect that would have a negative effect on the co2 movement both of them eventually lead to a decrease in co2 effective permeability further experimental and computational studies on water films wetting different lithological rocks over wider ranges of disjoining pressures are needed to better understand film behavior and its influence on gas transport under geologic co2 sequestration conditions notation π h disjoining pressure of liquid

and porosity were measured by helium to significantly reduce possible measurement errors from gas adsorption in addition the measurements with gas avoid changes in the pore structure which may be caused by water rock interactions when measuring the permeability with water the equipment and experimental procedures for the permeability and porosity measurements were provided by zhao and yu 2017a three measurements were conducted to test the accuracy and the average value of kabs and porosity table a1 were acquired by averaging the results of three identical experiments on each dried core sample furthermore the correlation analysis results between the porosity and permeability are shown in fig a1 the correlation between these parameters is very poor because the permeability is determined by both the porosity and pore structure moreover cores with high porosities even exhibit lower permeabilities this is exactly a manifestation of the pore structure differences among low permeability rocks the shape size and connectivity of pores in tight formation rocks greatly influence the permeability as a result the variation in the water bearing characteristics at the different pore scales is considerable which has tremendous consequences for the gas flow capacity li et al 2016 appendix b young laplace equation a meniscus interface at the gas water contact surface and the fluid pressure on both sides of the meniscus interface are discontinuous which generates capillary pressure the capillary pressure is an important driving force for water flow in unsaturated pores kopp et al 2009 bergmo et al 2011 it is equal to the difference between the internal pressures of the water pw and the internal pressures of the gas phases pg young 1805 b1 p c p g p w according to the young laplace equation eq b2 the magnitude of the capillary pressure depends on the curvature of the meniscus and interfacial tension ift b2 p c 2 σ r where σ is the ift and r is the average radius of the curvature as shown in fig b1 it is generally assumed that the meniscus interface is a spherical surface therefore the young laplace equation can be expressed as b3 p c 2 σ cos θ r c where θ is the contact angle and rc is the critical pore radius of the rock washburn 1921 dake 1978 tokunaga et al 2013 the young laplace equation can also be expressed as eq b4 when the pore radius r is smaller than the critical radius pores will be filled with condensed water conversely if r rc the middle part of a pore is filled with gas and the pore wall is covered by a water film b4 r c 2 σ cos θ p c with the use of p0 to represent the saturated vapor pressure of water and pm to represent the saturated vapor pressure on the meniscus interface the well known kelvin equation can be expressed as b5 ln p m p 0 2 σ c o s θ rt r c v where v is the molar volume of water r is the gas constant and rh is the ratio of pm to p0 thus the kelvin equation can be rewritten as b6 r c 2 σ c o s θ v rt 1 l n r h thus the critical pore radius is largely related to the rock properties and rh the critical condition of the adsorbed water film transition into spontaneous condensation can be predicted with eq b6 considering that the contact angle of the pore surface with the water film is difficult to quantify the critical pore radius is measured by water adsorption experiments in this study and the value is represented by the critical water film thickness appendix c table c1

industry and social sectors nearly 70 of global population lives on 38 of the land surface that is prone to drought eslamian and eslamian 2017 droughts are also more difficult to monitor and predict because of their slow onset gradual development and prolonged duration long term analysis of droughts is necessary for better understanding of their dynamics for planning and targeting mitigation measures bhuiyan et al 2006 droughts can be categorized into meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic droughts wilhite and glantz 1985 mishra and singh 2010 rainfall below a specified threshold leads to meteorological drought and its persistence over extended periods sequentially impacts soil moisture streamflows and groundwater leading to agricultural hydrological and socio economic droughts deficits of rainfall soil moisture streamflows and groundwater table are considered drought indicators but have different response times umran 1999 zhu et al 2016 the combined effects of meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought conditions lead to socio economic drought that affects food and water security for millions of people unoosa 2015 this paper is concerned with high resolution spatio temporal analysis of meteorological droughts quantitative indices like drought duration severity intensity and frequency have been used to characterize measure and monitor droughts dai et al 2004 hayes et al 2011 these are based on defining drought as a consecutive sequence of time periods with an index value less than a chosen threshold level the standard precipitation index spi and standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei have been commonly used to characterize and measure meteorological drought at multiple time scales mishra and singh 2010 spi has a strong theoretical basis as it is determined from corresponding probability functions of rainfall is robust and has shown better performance over other indices for drought analysis sierra soler et al 2016 zarch et al 2015 zuo et al 2018 the world meteorological organization recommended use of spi as the key indicator of meteorological drought hayes et al 2011 spi for specified duration is generally computed by fitting a gamma probability distribution function to long term rainfall data edwards and mckee 1997 spei is computed in a similar fashion using the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration spei is sensitive to temperature and methods adopted to compute evapotranspiration further at short time scales up to 4 months drought characteristics estimated from spi and spei have been shown to be similar in monsoon regions aadhar and mishra 2017 existing drought monitoring systems provide information on drought indicators at regional scales drought monitoring at finer scales has been constrained by limited in situ meteorological hydrological or soil moisture observational networks hao et al 2017 and it could also be tedious and time consuming prasad et al 2007 however in recent years satellite based gridded precipitation products have provided a practical option for continuous drought monitoring at moderately higher 0 25 to 1 25 km to 100 km spatial resolutions guo et al 2018 west et al 2019 these include the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa precipitation estimation from

with gauge observations compared to persiann cdr and trmm precipitation products zambrano et al 2017 it has also been shown to be useful in drought monitoring at this scale in monsoon climate regions gao et al 2008 funk et al 2015 aadhar and mishra 2017 used chirps gridded data to develop 0 05 high resolution bias corrected precipitation and temperature data for monitoring near real time drought

been attempted mishra and desai 2005 amrit et al 2018 pandit 2018 three such satellite sensor based cofactors ndvi lst and elevation have been known to influence spatial variations of rainfall in a

reddy and ganguli 2012 the major aim of this study is to develop a practical and sufficiently general integrated framework to analyze spatio temporal characteristics and patterns of meteorological drought at 1 km resolution to support local risk planning and mitigation decisions and actions the drought prone state of maharashtra in the central part of india is chosen as the case study region to develop the framework the specific objectives of the present study are i to downscale publicly available long term 2001 17 chirps 0 050 precipitation data to higher spatial resolution 1 km using the

frequent droughts in nearly 16 of its land area affecting more than 50 million people dutta et al 2015 mainly dependent on agriculture and allied services for their livelihoods udmale et al 2014 the central indian drought prone state of maharashtra is selected as the study area fig 1 the state is situated between 16 04 to 22 01 n latitude and 72 06 to 80 09 e longitude covers nearly 3 07 lakh km2 third largest state in the country and is bounded by a 720 km western coastline the study area has a tropical monsoon climate with moderate rainfall of wide spatial variability the western coastal mountain regions western ghats receive high rainfall with mahabaleshwar recording the highest rainfall of 6226 mm the eastern regions of the state receive average annual rainfall of less than 500 mm

hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps is a publicly available long term 1981 near present re analysis rainfall dataset generated at 5 km resolution funk et al 2015 data for the

composites didan 2015 ii modis land surface temperature lst 1 km resolution 8 day composites wan et al 2015 and iii shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem at 30 m resolution usgs 2004 provide the cofactors for downscaling chirps 5 km resolution rainfall data to 1 km resolution the spatial distribution of vegetation characteristics and temperature were computed after scaling modis ndvi and modis lst products with scaling factors of 0 0001 and 0 02 respectively modis 8 day composite product at 500 m resolution running et al 2017 scaled with a factor of 0 1 was used to derive the pet distribution in the study area for computation of spei monthly pet composites at 1 km resolution were generated by a temporal aggregation of the 500 m 8 day composites for a month using sum operation and then spatially aggregated to 1 km monthly rainfall observations from 65 indian meteorological department imd rain gauge stations for 2001 17 were also used for the validation of downscaled chirps rainfall gridded product the different data products used in this study with their details of spatial resolution and sources are summarized in table 1 3 2 methodology the methodology used in this study is summarized in fig 2 it comprises the computational steps of noise removal in input data downscaling chirps 5 km rainfall data to 1 km resolution validation of the downscaled product with both chirps 5 km and rain gauge data computation of spi and spei computation of drought characteristics by applying the theory of runs to spi and spei time series comparisons between drought characteristics derived from spi and spei series and integration of drought indices into a composite index using pca to identify drought patterns in addition onset and cessation month for a particular drought event were identified by considering start and end of the event based on threshold and duration 3 2 1 noise removal in modis ndvi and lst products one of the common problems in modis ndvi and lst products is that some pixels often exhibit inherent low quality and noise that are mainly introduced during acquistion of the remotely sensed dataset moody et al 2005 adaptive savitzky golay filter avaialble in timesat software was envisaged for noise removal smoothing in the modis ndvi and lst datasets a pre defined quadratic polynomial was applied at pixel level in the raster in moving window as described in press et al 1994 the reconstructed high quality dataset after applying filter is given by 1 x j i f i f a i x k 1 n where x original given ndvi or lst value x the corrected ndvi or lst value ai is the coefficient of the filter at the ith ndvi or lst value xj 1 the original ndvi or lst data value at position k 1 f the filter interval and n the number of convoluting integers and is equal to the smoothing window size 2f 1 noise removal from ndvi or lst data was carried out by using 2nd order polynomial coefficients with window size 5 3 2 2 downscaling of chirps rainfall and its validation the details of methodology and computations involved in downscaling of chirps 5 km rainfall products to 1 km resolution are shown in fig 3 an initial relationship between independent rainfall and dependent ndvi lst and elevation variables was established for the original 5 km resolution chirps data two approaches for downscaling the monthly 5 km rainfall product were tested 1 the proportionate monthly rainfall approach to generate the monthly spatially downscaled 1 km rainfall product as suggested by shi and song 2015 and 2 deriving a separate monthly downscaled model for each year preliminary analysis suggested that spatially downscaled monthly images generated using approach 2 had much lower root mean square error rmse compared to approach 1 therefore the monthly model for each year approach was adopted for downscaling the random forest rf regression machine learning algorithm developed by breiman 2001 was used to establish the relationship between the original chirps 5 km rainfall data and land surface characteristics ndvi lst elevation in view of its better performance compared to other models shi and song 2015 jing et al 2016 the rf algorithm is an ensemble approach that combines different individually developed decision trees using randomly chosen subsets of input variables sampled independently each decision tree is based on the classification and regression trees cart algorithm in which tree like graph is generated through recursive partitioning of the training dataset resulting in a homogeneous group the random forest approach generates two data objects for calibration and validation respectively out of the original dataset used in the model 70 of the observations are randomly sampled during the process to grow a tree and the rest of the observations called out of bag oob data are used for unbiased error estimation as more trees are added to the forest hutengs and vohland 2016 jaiswal and samikannu 2017 in this study the rf model was tuned for various number of trees 1 to 1000 at intervals of 50 and the model with minimum root mean square error was used for downscaling chirps data for each month and year a separate model was developed major steps followed in the methodology are given below i modis ndvi and lst products at 1 km were aggregated to 5 km using mean operator to use them as independent variables of the random forest model development all the pixels with ndvi values less than 0 were masked before aggregation ii similarly srtm dem at 30 m resolution was aggregated to 5 km and 1 km resolution grids the 5 km resolution dem was used for model development whereas 1 km resolution dataset was used for prediction iii the relationship between rainfall dependent variable and ndvi lst and dem independent variables was first established at 5 km spatial resolution using random forest algorithm iv the model was developed using 70 the observations pixels while 30 of the observations were used for the model validation the root mean square error was computed for error estimation v the random forest model developed iii iv above was used for prediction of chirps rainfall data at 1 km using ndvi lst and dem data at 1 km resolution vi initially residual correction was carried out to overcome under and over prediction a the model predicted rainfall raster was first aggregated to 5 km before residuals were computed by subtraction of 5 km model predicted residuals from the original 5 km chirps precipitation data b the residual raster was interpolated from 5 km to 1 km using spline tension interpolation this technique has been found to be more accurate for regular interval data this step was performed by converting residual raster to point vector data for the interpolation c the interpolated residual surface at 1 km was added to the predicted rainfall raster output of step iv vii validation of chirps downscaled 1 km was carried out at multiple levels a the model was validated using 30 of the test data that was not used for model development and the rmse is computed as follows 2 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n where o is the observed value p is the predicted value and n is the number of observations b to evaluate whether the final downscaled chirps data product preserves the statistical properties of original chirps dataset the spatial as well as temporal mean and standard deviation of the two products were compared c the strength of association between observed imd downscaled chirps and original chirps were investigated for each month separately using correlation coefficient d since correlation coefficient does not reflect spatial behavior indices for spatial association namely geary s c geary 1954 moran s i moran 1950 along with correlogram hereafter called cic analysis were used to compare spatial dependence between original and downscaled chirps products these metrics are robust and widely used for analyzing spatial process in atmospheric science tapiador et al 2018 geary c where c stands for contiguity considers local variation and is computed as given below 3 c n 1 i j w ij x i x j 2 2 i j w ij x i x 2 where n is the number of observations wij is the spatial weight metrics xi and xj are the attribute values at location i and j respectively the geary c ranges from 0 to 2 with 0 being perfect positive spatial correlation 2 being perfect negative spatial correlation and 1 being random pattern no spatial correlation moran s i i stands for isotropy is computed as follows 4 i nn i 1 n j 1 w i j x i x x j x n i 1 n j 1 w i j n i 1 x 1 x 2 where n is the number of observations wij is weight metrics and xi and xj are the attribute values at location i and j respectively x is the global mean of x the value of i is positive whenever the eight neighboring grid points have similar values the precipitation pattern is clustered the closer the value of i is to 1 the more spatially correlated the field is a non parametric spatial correlogram was constructed for validating the spatial dependence pattern across space the spatial correlation was computed by fitting a local regression to the covariances or correlations for all pairs of observations as a function of distance between them anselin et al 2006 o the downscaled chirps precipitation data was further validated with the imd in situ observations the statistical parameters root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were used for relative evaluation of downscaled chirps precipitation data mae is computed as given below 5 mae i 1 n o i p i n where o is imd observation and p is downscaled chirps data 3 2 3 computation of spi and spei both spi and spei are computed in a similar fashion from their probability functions as the two indicators have same underlying mechanics vicente serrano et al 2010 the only difference is in probability distributions used gamma distribution for spi and log logistic distribution for spei 3 2 3 1 spi spi 3 is computed for the case study area for both chirps gridded product at 5 km and the corresponding downscaled chirps 1 km gridded product the gamma distribution function is fitted to the aggregated precipitation values however gamma function with two parameters can only be defined for non zero values while a mixed distribution function is applied to eliminate the problem of zero value for number of observations thus the modified cumulative distribution function cdf after consideration of zero in mixed distribution function as defined in mckee et al 1993 and edwards and mckee 1997 was used the drought severity classification proposed by svoboda et al 2002 for spi was used for the spi 3 product table 2 3 2 3 2 spei gridded products of time series monthly precipitation p downscaled 1 km rainfall product and monthly potential evapotranspiration pet modis 16 day 1 km composites provide the data inputs for spei computation modis pet is computed using penman monteith method running et al 2017 like spi spei is also computed at multiple time scales as per details given in vicente serrano et al 2010 the range of spei is same as spi and therefore both have same thresholds for drought severity classes the same drought severity classification used for spi table 2 is also adopted for spei as done in other studies leasor et al 2020 turco et al 2020 3 2 4 computation of meteorological drought characteristics drought characteristics for the 1 km spi 3 product namely duration severity intensity and frequency were estimated using runs theory yevjevich 1967 the procedure is illustrated in fig 4 for spi 3 time series drought events constitute all values lower than a selected threshold spi 0 5 a run for this series is defined as a succession of similar events below the threshold drought events preceded and succeeded by different events spi 0 5 non drought events values above and below the threshold level are called positive and negative runs respectively and the number of elements in a run is its length run length defines the drought duration the total time during which a drought variable spi 3 is below a certain threshold in a given run drought severity is cumulative value of spi 3 below the threshold drought intensity is the ratio of drought severity and duration drought duration severity and intensity were analyzed using runs theory for spi 3 with 0 5 as the threshold below that the different drought categories exist table 2 a drought event is considered only if the value of spi 3 is less than threshold for at least 3 consecutive months in addition to the above standard drought characteristics duration and timing of longest drought onset and cessation month of individual droughts were also estimated the onset month to is the first month when spi falls below the specified threshold range mo 2011 the cessation month td is the last month before which spi value rises above the threshold range mo 2011 these drought characteristics were also estimated for spei time series to compare them with those of the spi series 3 2 5 composite effective meteorological drought index from the drought management perspective a composite index that combines the effects of different drought characteristics of severity duration intensity and frequency into a single effective meteorological drought index can be useful in identifying regional patterns of drought vulnerability for spatial targeting of drought policies and mitigation measures such an index is derived by applying principal component analysis pca to the different drought characteristics pca is a spectral decomposition technique that is used to identify the dominant common pattern among various variables pca generates a new set of variables components by transforming correlated original variables these components are uncorrelated and are ordered such that the first component explains maximum variability in the original dataset followed by the second component and so on jackson 2003 jolliffe 2004 the maximum number of components that can be extracted is equal to the total number of original variables most of the variances in the original dataset can be explained by the first few components thus the most common utility of pca is to reduce the dimension of intercorrelated variables six modes p q r s t of pca are available that vary in terms of variable and observation definition defined in pca factor analysis literature cattell 1952 richman 1986 table 3 in this study r mode pca was used to combine drought intensity drought severity drought duration and number of drought events that have occurred at each pixel in the terminology of pca factor analysis the four drought characteristics can be considered as different phenomena since these drought characteristics are available for each pixel so samples in space are the observations 4 results and discussion 4 1 downscaling and validation of chirps rainfall monthly chirps precipitation data at a coarse resolution 5 km was downscaled to fine resolution 1 km using the random forest machine learning algorithm for each month and year for the period 2001 2017 the regression model was developed for the original 5 km chirps data using 70 of the observations and validated with remaining 30 of the observations 4 1 1 validation using chirps rainfall the rmse was computed between predicted and test data original chirps data at 5 km resolution table 4 the differences between the two sets of data are higher in monsoon months june july august this has also been observed by other researchers eg retalis et al 2017 and can be attributed to overestimation of the higher rainfall in the wetter months the differences between spatial mean and standard deviation for all the time steps fig 5 are fairly small indicating that downscaling could preserve the statistical properties of the original chirps dataset monthly mean and standard deviation of imd rainfall station data downscaled chirps 1 km and original chirps 5 km were also compared at several point locations supplementary information figs s1 and s2 the results indicated that the statistical properties of the three datasets are comparable comparisons between the pearson correlation coefficients of original and downscaled chirps with imd observations supplementary fig s3 also show that the two chirps datasets are strongly correlated with imd dataset for most months to validate if downscaled product adheres to the spatial structure and spatial dependence of original chirps data cic analysis was carried out contiguity analysis indicated both chirps original and downscaled data have geary c closer to 0 suggesting similar strong spatial correlation fig 6 a similarly isotropy analysis indicated both the series having moran s i closer to 1 suggesting similar strong spatial correlation structure fig 6b the spatial correlogram indicated that both original and downscaled chirps datasets have similar spatial dependence structure fig 7 the figure presents the results for monsoon july and non monsoon feb months for three years consistently similar correlogram pattern was found for all the months for 17 years confirming that the downscaled product preserves the spatial structure of the original chirps data 4 1 2 validation with imd rain gauge data the downscaled chirps 1 km rainfall product was further validated by comparisons with imd rain gauge stations data scatter plots between chirps 1 km and in situ observations for all the months and seasons fig 8 showed good correlation between the two data sets the overall rmse and mae of the downscaled rainfall products are observed to be 81 59 mm and 37 39 mm respectively higher rmse and mae values are observed for the wetter months jja while values were comparatively low for drier months mam son djf similar observations have been made by others shi and song 2015 immerzeel et al 2009 retalis et al 2017 chirps downscaled data were lower than imd values for high rainfall events marginal changes in rmse during non monsoon months indicated that downscaling algorithm performs better for drier non monsoon months fig 8 in addition the downscaled 1 km rainfall product was compared with imd data for years with three distinct weather conditions namely dry wet and normal rmse and mae for dry year 2002 was least rmse 64 42 mm mae 31 13 mm followed by normal year 2008 rmse 74 88 mm mae 35 43 mm and followed by wet year rmse 86 98 mm mae 39 82 mm 4 2 meteorological drought assessment a major portion of the study area experienced drought in several years during 2001 2017 for both monsoon spi 3 jja months fig 9 and non monsoon spi 3 jfm months fig 10 in all 12 meteorological droughts were experienced in monsoon months and 10 were in non monsoon months in this period the periods 2001 2004 2008 2009 2012 and 2015 experienced drought conditions during both monsoon and non monsoon seasons droughts of severe intensity were observed in years 2004 2008 2009 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 these observations are consistent with other regional studies for the area kulkarni et al 2016 chavadekar and kashid 2016 overall most of the districts in the study area faced dry conditions during both non monsoon and monsoon months in the years 2001 2004 2009 and 2017 however change of wet to dry condition between non monsoon to monsoon months was observed during the years 2008 and 2015 in some districts and vice versa in others during the years 2007 and 2011 to establish the suitability of the downscaled 1 km data for spatio temporal droughts analysis at finer scales the spi 3 maps were zoomed to pixel level for ashti taluka sub district in bid district for both original 5 km and downscaled 1 km chirps data for 2017 fig 11 a d chirps 1 km data could capture spatial variability of drought within and between villages whereas one pixel in the original chirps 5 km data covered multiple villages few villages in the northeastern part of taluka that faced different levels of drought severity can be clearly seen in the downscaled spi 3 for monsoon months jja spatial variability in drought severity at this level could not be captured in the spi 3 from original chirps data due to its coarser resolution similarly in the non monsoon month when most of the villages are affected by drought condition the spatial variability is much more distinctly visible in downscaled image compared to the spi 3 from original chirps dataset hence downscaled chirps product was used for meteorological drought monitoring and its characterization 4 3 meteorological drought characteristics spatio temporal variations of drought characteristics were analyzed using the downscaled spi 3 product and run theory for the years 2001 17 threshold value of spi 3 0 5 for three consecutive months was used to define the drought event the spatial distribution of drought frequency mean severity mean duration and mean intensity most frequent drought and its onset and cessation months and longest drought and its onset and cessation months are presented in fig 12 a i districts situated in eastern north eastern and central parts of the study area experienced drought 10 to 17 times or almost every year or alternate year fig 12a the drought intensity is higher in central north east north west and some eastern districts compared to the rest of the state fig 12b severe droughts have occurred in the central south east south west and eastern parts of the state fig 12c drought duration varies between 3 and 8 months with most regions experiencing shorter duration droughts fig 12d districts in the east southeast and southwest part of the state experience longer drought conditions 6 8 months the onset of drought conditions can be seen during winter months in the north east eastern and south west districts during monsoon months in the central part of the state and during march april and may in the south east region fig 12e drought conditions cease by pre monsoon months mam in the northeast and eastern part of state and during post monsoon and winter months ond in the south east and north west part of the study area fig 12f major portion of the study area has faced droughts of 3 6 months duration fig 12g these areas were also continuously rain deficient for more than one and half year during the period june 2002 to march 2004 fig 12h i the proportion of study area that experienced droughts of different severity levels as defined in table 2 is shown in fig 13 most of the region faced moderate drought d1 over the 17 years exceptional drought conditions were prevalent during the periods 2002 2004 2008 2009 and 2014 2015 nearly 20 of the study area faced exceptional drought in november 2014 the spatial distribution of persistent drought conditions for at least 3 months or more at different severity levels d0 to d4 table 2 during 2001 17 is shown in fig 14 a e majority of the study area have faced the moderate drought condition at least once or more compared to severe extreme and exception drought parts of northern eastern and southeastern districts have faced relatively higher number of droughts of moderate severity extreme and exceptional droughts are rare and occur only in parts of a few districts fig 14e the longest duration drought varies spatially with drought severity fig 15 a e moderate drought is most common for the longest period drought and in northeastern southeastern and southern districts it can last almost a year severe to extreme droughts of long duration are rare and occur only in some small parts of a few districts thus studying drought frequency severity and duration for a region not only helps us to understand the region s drought characteristics but also helps in the probability of drought recurrence at various severity levels 4 3 1 comparison with spei derived drought characteristics the comparison between meteorological drought characteristics on the basis of spi 3 and spei 3 for fourteen sample locations fig 1 is given in table 5 although drought severity value is relatively smaller for spei compared to spi all the values are 2 the drought characterization as exceptional drought table 2 is the same for both spi and spei however spi identifies a higher frequency of droughts compared to spei this is consistent with the findings of aadhar and mishra 2017 that spi and spei at 4 month scale were largely similar for severe and extreme droughts also pei et al 2020 reported variations between spi and spei for drought frequencies and intensities but these decreased with increased timescales meher and vaheddoost 2019 and tirivarombo et al 2018 also reported decrease of spi and spei differences with longer time scale but with slight differences in drought intensity however the observed similarity between spi and spei for similarly identifying the drought severity category may be the result of the rainfall downscaling process implicitly including variability in vegetation and temperature which are also inputs for the modis pet data product 4 4 composite multivariate index for meteorological drought assessment for a comprehensive assessment of spatial patterns of drought vulnerability the different drought characteristics of frequency intensity severity and duration estimated above were integrated into a composite effective meteorological drought index using pca figs 16 and 17 the biplot in figure 16 indicates that frequency duration and severity of the drought have contributed in the formation of pc1 as corresponding vectors are nearly parallel to the axis the contribution of intensity and duration could also be seen in the formation of pc2 in this study the large obtuse angle between frequency and severity of drought indicates negative correlation between the two variables similarly the frequency and duration of drought are also negatively correlated while drought duration and severity are positively correlated negative correlation between the intensity and duration of drought indicated that locations of higher frequency drought are mainly associated with shorter duration these shorter duration droughts are also generally of large intensity and severity and vice versa the spatial distribution of these relationships among four drought characteristics can be seen through principal component scores and associated loadings the spatial pattern of the principal component and the loading i e correlation between original variables and principal component are shown in the fig 17a b the principal component score is the spatial pattern and correlation between individual variable and principal component is a scalar value shown in bar chart the strength of correlation indicates the contribution of each variable in the formation of a component pca first component pc1 explained 52 2 of variance in the dataset the strong correlation large loading magnitude of pc1 with mean severity number of droughts and mean drought duration is indicative of their contribution in the formation of the component the component score and associated loading with individual variable indicates the inverse relationship of number of droughts with mean drought severity and duration fig 17a regions with higher frequency of drought events have droughts of shorter duration and less severity these regions include parts of several districts in northern and central part of the state several grids in these districts have drought frequency above 12 and duration less than or equal to 4 months and severity greater than 2 since pca is based on the spatial mean and deviation from spatial mean therefore the interpretation is in relative sense less frequent droughts with high severity and of large duration can be seen in area near satara and pune border solapur osmanabad chandrapur and garchirolidistricts these areas have less than 10 drought events at several grids but have longer mean duration of values more than 5 to 7 months and extreme severity with values less than 5 however such long duration drought could make all the regions quite vulnerable but could substantially affect these districts that receive low rainfall the second principal component pc2 accounts for 28 6 variance the component has very strong correlation large loading with mean intensity and little less correlation with mean duration of the drought indicating their contribution in the formation of pc2 pc2 mainly represent contrast between mean drought intensity and drought fig 17b grids with lower intensity 1 have longer drought duration 5 7 months and vice versa it is evident that several districts across the study region i e south and south eastern region sindhudurg ratnagiri kolhapur satara southern pune and raigarh north nandurbar dhule jalgoan districts and north eastern region yavatamal and nanded districts are facing high intensity 1 but short duration drought 3 to 4 months high intensity in low rainfall districts may have a substantial impact thus making the district quite vulnerable similarly longer duration drought with low intensity can also have substantial impact in the region e g thane nashik ahmadnagar aurangabad jalna bid osmanabad solapur and garhichiroli districts the composite index generated in this study explains the aggregated effect of the drought phenomenon in a more comprehensive way pca helped to reduce the dimensionality of essential input variables such as drought frequency drought intensity drought severity and duration such a composite index can be useful for managing water resources and highlighting the impending droughts thus the index could categorize the study area into zones namely 1 region facing drought that are of longer duration but less intense less severity and are less frequent 2 region with shorter duration drought but with higher frequency severity and intensity shorter duration drought may affect soil moisture and surface runoff but longer duration drought though less frequent may affect the groundwater and thus require different drought mitigation strategies 5 summary and conclusions the study developed an integrated methodological framework for spatio temporal analysis and assessment of meteorological droughts at high resolution 1 km starting from publicly available coarse scale rainfall data and spi to identify drought events and their characteristics the random forest machine learning based approach for spatial downscaling of chirps 5 km data to 1 km resolution using high resolution satellite sensor data as cofactors conserves both statistical properties and spatial structure of the input data in the downscaled product the error was relatively higher in wet monsoon months jja and wet years compared to other months and drought years respectively the downscaled product enables analysis and assessment of spatiotemporal variations of drought at village and sub village scales drought duration severity intensity frequency and onset and cessation of the drought event were identified based on theory of runs applied to the spi of the downscaled chirps product for the period 2001 17 droughts occurred at least once over 17 years over the study area and the entire study area faced moderately severe drought conditions over seventeen years exceptional drought occurred during 2002 2004 2008 2009 and 2014 2015 the drought duration varied between three to eight months over the study area with differences in drought onset and cessation the comparison between spi and spei at 1 km resolution for 14 locations indicated that spi and spei were consistent in identifying the drought severity category though absolute values were different also spi was identified more number of droughts compared to spei in most of these locations the individual characteristics of drought were integrated into a composite effective meteorological drought index emdi using pca the composite index helps to identify drought vulnerability patterns at 1 km grid level for the case study area the pca analysis identified two regions with distinct drought patterns the regions with longer duration drought have relatively less frequent less severe and low intensity droughts regions with shorter duration droughts have more frequent droughts with higher severity and intensity the identification of such regional patterns of vulnerability can be useful for spatial targeting of drought policies and management interventions the integrated framework developed in this study for high resolution spatio temporal analysis of droughts starting from coarse scale precipitation data is sufficiently general and can be applicable to other regions declaration of competing interest the

encompassed multiple villages spatial distribution of composite index emdi delineates the study area into two characteristic drought risk regions in one region droughts are of longer duration but are less frequent with lower severity and intensity in the second region droughts are of shorter duration but of higher severity intensity and frequency the integrated framework developed in this study

industry and social sectors nearly 70 of global population lives on 38 of the land surface that is prone to drought eslamian and eslamian 2017 droughts are also more difficult to monitor and predict because of their slow onset gradual development and prolonged duration long term analysis of droughts is necessary for better understanding of their dynamics for planning and targeting mitigation measures bhuiyan et al 2006 droughts can be categorized into meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic droughts wilhite and glantz 1985 mishra and singh 2010 rainfall below a specified threshold leads to meteorological drought and its persistence over extended periods sequentially impacts soil moisture streamflows and groundwater leading to agricultural hydrological and socio economic droughts deficits of rainfall soil moisture streamflows and groundwater table are considered drought indicators but have different response times umran 1999 zhu et al 2016 the combined effects of meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought conditions lead to socio economic drought that affects food and water security for millions of people unoosa 2015 this paper is concerned with high resolution spatio temporal analysis of meteorological droughts quantitative indices like drought duration severity intensity and frequency have been used to characterize measure and monitor droughts dai et al 2004 hayes et al 2011 these are based on defining drought as a consecutive sequence of time periods with an index value less than a chosen threshold level the standard precipitation index spi and standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei have been commonly used to characterize and measure meteorological drought at multiple time scales mishra and singh 2010 spi has a strong theoretical basis as it is determined from corresponding probability functions of rainfall is robust and has shown better performance over other indices for drought analysis sierra soler et al 2016 zarch et al 2015 zuo et al 2018 the world meteorological organization recommended use of spi as the key indicator of meteorological drought hayes et al 2011 spi for specified duration is generally computed by fitting a gamma probability distribution function to long term rainfall data edwards and mckee 1997 spei is computed in a similar fashion using the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration spei is sensitive to temperature and methods adopted to compute evapotranspiration further at short time scales up to 4 months drought characteristics estimated from spi and spei have been shown to be similar in monsoon regions aadhar and mishra 2017 existing drought monitoring systems provide information on drought indicators at regional scales drought monitoring at finer scales has been constrained by limited in situ meteorological hydrological or soil moisture observational networks hao et al 2017 and it could also be tedious and time consuming prasad et al 2007 however in recent years satellite based gridded precipitation products have provided a practical option for continuous drought monitoring at moderately higher 0 25 to 1 25 km to 100 km spatial resolutions guo et al 2018 west et al 2019 these include the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa precipitation estimation from

precipitation products the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps rainfall gridded has a higher spatial resolution of 0 05 5km the chirps product also has better agreement with gauge observations compared to persiann cdr and trmm precipitation products zambrano et al 2017 it has also been shown to be useful in drought monitoring at this scale in monsoon climate regions gao et al 2008 funk et al 2015 aadhar and mishra 2017 used chirps gridded data to develop 0 05 high resolution bias corrected precipitation and temperature data for monitoring near real time drought conditions using spi and spei over south asia downscaling of coarse grid rainfall to higher spatial resolutions using high resolution datasets from different satellite sensors as cofactors has also been attempted mishra and desai 2005 amrit et al 2018 pandit 2018 three such satellite sensor based cofactors ndvi lst and elevation have been known to influence spatial variations of rainfall in a region immerzeel et al 2009 jia et al 2011 jing et al 2016 trenberth and shea 2005 shi and song 2015 downscaled trmm 25 km rainfall to 1 km resolution using random forest model with satellite derived

ndvi and altitude as cofactors while these studies focused on spatial downscaling of rainfall to 1 km drought characteristics were not analyzed at this resolution drought characteristics include drought duration intensity severity and frequency the theory of runs yevjevich 1967 has been used to derive these drought characteristics at varying spatial scales e g liu et al 2016 jamro et al 2020 some studies have integrated two or more drought characteristics into a single composite index at regional scales mesbahzadeh et al 2020 hui mean et al 2019 guo et al 2018 li et al 2015 xu et al 2015 reddy and ganguli 2012 the major aim of this study is to develop a practical and sufficiently general integrated framework to analyze spatio temporal characteristics and patterns of meteorological drought at 1 km resolution to support local risk planning and mitigation decisions and actions the drought prone state of maharashtra in the central part of india is chosen as the case study region to develop the framework the specific objectives of the present study are i to downscale publicly available long term 2001 17 chirps 0 050 precipitation data to higher spatial resolution 1 km using the random forest machine learning algorithm and high resolution satellite sensor data of ndvi temperature and elevation as cofactors ii to validate the downscaled product 1 km resolution at seasonal and

derive a composite drought index using pca that encapsulates the effects of different drought indices iv above to identify sub regional patterns of drought vulnerability 2 study area india experiences frequent droughts in nearly 16 of its land area affecting more than 50 million people dutta et al 2015 mainly dependent on agriculture and allied services for their livelihoods udmale et al 2014 the central indian drought prone state of maharashtra is selected as the study area fig 1 the state is situated between 16 04 to 22 01 n latitude and 72 06 to 80 09 e longitude covers nearly 3 07 lakh km2 third largest state in the country and is bounded by a 720 km western coastline the study area has a tropical monsoon climate with moderate rainfall of wide spatial variability the western coastal mountain regions western ghats receive high rainfall with mahabaleshwar recording the highest rainfall of 6226 mm the eastern regions of the state receive average annual rainfall of less than 500 mm forests and agriculture constitute 17 and 58 of the study area respectively sorghum and cotton are the dominant crops in the drier parts of the state 3 material and method 3 1 data used the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps is a publicly available long term 1981 near present re analysis rainfall dataset generated at 5 km resolution funk et al 2015 data for the period 2001 17 is used in this study time series gridded data products of i moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis normalized difference vegetation index ndvi 1 km resolution 16 day composites didan 2015 ii modis land surface temperature lst 1 km resolution 8 day composites wan et al 2015 and iii shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem at 30 m resolution usgs 2004 provide the cofactors for downscaling chirps 5 km resolution rainfall data to 1 km resolution the spatial distribution of vegetation characteristics and temperature were computed after scaling modis ndvi and modis lst products with scaling factors of 0 0001 and 0 02 respectively modis 8 day composite product at 500 m resolution running et al 2017 scaled with a factor of 0 1 was used to derive the pet distribution in the study area for computation of spei monthly pet composites at 1 km resolution were generated by a temporal aggregation of the 500 m 8 day composites for a month using sum operation and then spatially aggregated to 1 km monthly rainfall observations from 65 indian meteorological department imd rain gauge stations for 2001 17 were also used for the validation of downscaled chirps rainfall gridded product the different data products used in this study with their details of spatial resolution and sources are summarized in table 1 3 2 methodology the methodology used in this study is summarized in fig 2 it comprises the computational steps of noise removal in input data downscaling chirps 5 km rainfall data to 1 km resolution validation of the downscaled product with both chirps 5 km and rain gauge data computation of spi and spei computation of drought characteristics by applying the theory of runs to spi and spei time series comparisons between drought characteristics derived from spi and spei series and integration of drought indices into a composite index using pca to identify drought patterns in addition onset and cessation month for a particular drought event were identified by considering start and end of the event based on threshold and duration 3 2 1 noise removal in modis ndvi and lst products one of the common problems in modis ndvi and lst products is that some pixels often exhibit inherent low quality and noise that are mainly introduced during acquistion of the remotely sensed dataset moody et al 2005 adaptive savitzky golay filter avaialble in timesat software was envisaged for noise removal smoothing in the modis ndvi and lst datasets a pre defined quadratic polynomial was applied at pixel level in the raster in moving window as described in press et al 1994 the reconstructed high quality dataset after applying filter is given by 1 x j i f i f a i x k 1 n where x original given ndvi or lst value x the corrected ndvi or lst value ai is the coefficient of the filter at the ith ndvi or lst value xj 1 the original ndvi or lst data value at position k 1 f the filter interval and n the number of convoluting integers and is equal to the smoothing window size 2f 1 noise removal from ndvi or lst data was carried out by using 2nd order polynomial coefficients with window size 5 3 2 2 downscaling of chirps rainfall and its validation the details of methodology and computations involved in downscaling of chirps 5 km rainfall products to 1 km resolution are shown in fig 3 an initial relationship between independent rainfall and dependent ndvi lst and elevation variables was established for the original 5 km resolution chirps data two approaches for downscaling the monthly 5 km rainfall product were tested 1 the proportionate monthly rainfall approach to generate the monthly spatially downscaled 1 km rainfall product as suggested by shi and song 2015 and 2 deriving a separate monthly downscaled model for each year preliminary analysis suggested that spatially downscaled monthly images generated using approach 2 had much lower root mean square error rmse compared to approach 1 therefore the monthly model for each year approach was adopted for downscaling the random forest rf regression machine learning algorithm developed by breiman 2001 was used to establish the relationship between the original chirps 5 km rainfall data and land surface characteristics ndvi lst elevation in view of its better performance compared to other models shi and song 2015 jing et al 2016 the rf algorithm is an ensemble approach that combines different individually developed decision trees using randomly chosen subsets of input variables sampled independently each decision tree is based on the classification and regression trees cart algorithm in which tree like graph is generated through recursive partitioning of the training dataset resulting in a homogeneous group the random forest approach generates two data objects for calibration and validation respectively out of the original dataset used in the model 70 of the observations are randomly sampled during the process to grow a tree and the rest of the observations called out of bag oob data are used for unbiased error estimation as more trees are added to the forest hutengs and vohland 2016 jaiswal and samikannu 2017 in this study the rf model was tuned for various number of trees 1 to 1000 at intervals of 50 and the model with minimum root mean square error was used for downscaling chirps data for each month and year a separate model was developed major steps followed in the methodology are given below i modis ndvi and lst products at 1 km were aggregated to 5 km using mean operator to use them as independent variables of the random forest model development all the pixels with ndvi values less than 0 were masked before aggregation ii similarly srtm dem at 30 m resolution was aggregated to 5 km and 1 km resolution grids the 5 km resolution dem was used for model development whereas 1 km resolution dataset was used for prediction iii the relationship between rainfall dependent variable and ndvi lst and dem independent variables was first established at 5 km spatial resolution using random forest algorithm iv the model was developed using 70 the observations pixels while 30 of the observations were used for the model validation the root mean square error was computed for error estimation v the random forest model developed iii iv above was used for prediction of chirps rainfall data at 1 km using ndvi lst and dem data at 1 km resolution vi initially residual correction was carried out to overcome under and over prediction a the model predicted rainfall raster was first aggregated to 5 km before residuals were computed by subtraction of 5 km model predicted residuals from the original 5 km chirps precipitation data b the residual raster was interpolated from 5 km to 1 km using spline tension interpolation this technique has been found to be more accurate for regular interval data this step was performed by converting residual raster to point vector data for the interpolation c the interpolated residual surface at 1 km was added to the predicted rainfall raster output of step iv vii validation of chirps downscaled 1 km was carried out at multiple levels a the model was validated using 30 of the test data that was not used for model development and the rmse is computed as follows 2 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n where o is the observed value p is the predicted value and n is the number of observations b to evaluate whether the final downscaled chirps data product preserves the statistical properties of original chirps dataset the spatial as well as temporal mean and standard deviation of the two products were compared c the strength of association between observed imd downscaled chirps and original chirps were investigated for each month separately using correlation coefficient d since correlation coefficient does not reflect spatial behavior indices for spatial association namely geary s c geary 1954 moran s i moran 1950 along with correlogram hereafter called cic analysis were used to compare spatial dependence between original and downscaled chirps products these metrics are robust and widely used for analyzing spatial process in atmospheric science tapiador et al 2018 geary c where c stands for contiguity considers local variation and is computed as given below 3 c n 1 i j w ij x i x j 2 2 i j w ij x i x 2 where n is the number of observations wij is the spatial weight metrics xi and xj are the attribute values at location i and j respectively the geary c ranges from 0 to 2 with 0 being perfect positive spatial correlation 2 being perfect negative spatial correlation and 1 being random pattern no spatial correlation moran s i i stands for isotropy is computed as follows 4 i nn i 1 n j 1 w i j x i x x j x n i 1 n j 1 w i j n i 1 x 1 x 2 where n is the number of observations wij is weight metrics and xi and xj are the attribute values at location i and j respectively x is the global mean of x the value of i is positive whenever the eight neighboring grid points have similar values the precipitation pattern is clustered the closer the value of i is to 1 the more spatially correlated the field is a non parametric spatial correlogram was constructed for validating the spatial dependence pattern across space the spatial correlation was computed by fitting a local regression to the covariances or correlations for all pairs of observations as a function of distance between them anselin et al 2006 o the downscaled chirps precipitation data was further validated with the imd in situ observations the statistical parameters root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were used for relative evaluation of downscaled chirps precipitation data mae is computed as given below 5 mae i 1 n o i p i n where o is imd observation and p is downscaled chirps data 3 2 3 computation of spi and spei both spi and spei are computed in a similar fashion from their probability functions as the two indicators have same underlying mechanics vicente serrano et al 2010 the only difference is in probability distributions used gamma distribution for spi and log logistic distribution for spei 3 2 3 1 spi spi 3 is computed for the case study area for both chirps gridded product at 5 km and the corresponding downscaled chirps 1 km gridded product the gamma distribution function is fitted to the aggregated precipitation values however gamma function with two parameters can only be defined for non zero values while a mixed distribution function is applied to eliminate the problem of zero value for number of observations thus the modified cumulative distribution function cdf after consideration of zero in mixed distribution function as defined in mckee et al 1993 and edwards and mckee 1997 was used the drought severity classification proposed by svoboda et al 2002 for spi was used for the spi 3 product table 2 3 2 3 2 spei gridded products of time series monthly precipitation p downscaled 1 km rainfall product and monthly potential evapotranspiration pet modis 16 day 1 km composites provide the data inputs for spei computation modis pet is computed using penman monteith method running et al 2017 like spi spei is also computed at multiple time scales as per details given in vicente serrano et al 2010 the range of spei is same as spi and therefore both have same thresholds for drought severity classes the same drought severity classification used for spi table 2 is also adopted for spei as done in other studies leasor et al 2020 turco et al 2020 3 2 4 computation of meteorological drought characteristics drought characteristics for the 1 km spi 3 product namely duration severity intensity and frequency were estimated using runs theory yevjevich 1967 the procedure is illustrated in fig 4 for spi 3 time series drought events constitute all values lower than a selected threshold spi 0 5 a run for this series is defined as a succession of similar events below the threshold drought events preceded and succeeded by different events spi 0 5 non drought events values above and below the threshold level are called positive and negative runs respectively and the number of elements in a run is its length run length defines the drought duration the total time during which a drought variable spi 3 is below a certain threshold in a given run drought severity is cumulative value of spi 3 below the threshold drought intensity is the ratio of drought severity and duration drought duration severity and intensity were analyzed using runs theory for spi 3 with 0 5 as the threshold below that the different drought categories exist table 2 a drought event is considered only if the value of spi 3 is less than threshold for at least 3 consecutive months in addition to the above standard drought characteristics duration and timing of longest drought onset and cessation month of individual droughts were also estimated the onset month to is the first month when spi falls below the specified threshold range mo 2011 the cessation month td is the last month before which spi value rises above the threshold range mo 2011 these drought characteristics were also estimated for spei time series to compare them with those of the spi series 3 2 5 composite effective meteorological drought index from the drought management perspective a composite index that combines the effects of different drought characteristics of severity duration intensity and frequency into a single effective meteorological drought index can be useful in identifying regional patterns of drought vulnerability for spatial targeting of drought policies and mitigation measures such an index is derived by applying principal component analysis pca to the different drought characteristics pca is a spectral decomposition technique that is used to identify the dominant common pattern among various variables pca generates a new set of variables components by transforming correlated original variables these components are uncorrelated and are ordered such that the first component explains maximum variability in the original dataset followed by the second component and so on jackson 2003 jolliffe 2004 the maximum number of components that can be extracted is equal to the total number of original variables most of the variances in the original dataset can be explained by the first few components thus the most common utility of pca is to reduce the dimension of intercorrelated variables six modes p q r s t of pca are available that vary in terms of variable and observation definition defined in pca factor analysis literature cattell 1952 richman 1986 table 3 in this study r mode pca was used to combine drought intensity drought severity drought duration and number of drought events that have occurred at each pixel in the terminology of pca factor analysis the four drought characteristics can be considered as different phenomena since these drought characteristics are available for each pixel so samples in space are the observations 4 results and discussion 4 1 downscaling and validation of chirps rainfall monthly chirps precipitation data at a coarse resolution 5 km was downscaled to fine resolution 1 km using the random forest machine learning algorithm for each month and year for the period 2001 2017 the regression model was developed for the original 5 km chirps data using 70 of the observations and validated with remaining 30 of the observations 4 1 1 validation using chirps rainfall the rmse was computed between predicted and test data original chirps data at 5 km resolution table 4 the differences between the two sets of data are higher in monsoon months june july august this has also been observed by other researchers eg retalis et al 2017 and can be attributed to overestimation of the higher rainfall in the wetter months the differences between spatial mean and standard deviation for all the time steps fig 5 are fairly small indicating that downscaling could preserve the statistical properties of the original chirps dataset monthly mean and standard deviation of imd rainfall station data downscaled chirps 1 km and original chirps 5 km were also compared at several point locations supplementary information figs s1 and s2 the results indicated that the statistical properties of the three datasets are comparable comparisons between the pearson correlation coefficients of original and downscaled chirps with imd observations supplementary fig s3 also show that the two chirps datasets are strongly correlated with imd dataset for most months to validate if downscaled product adheres to the spatial structure and spatial dependence of original chirps data cic analysis was carried out contiguity analysis indicated both chirps original and downscaled data have geary c closer to 0 suggesting similar strong spatial correlation fig 6 a similarly isotropy analysis indicated both the series having moran s i closer to 1 suggesting similar strong spatial correlation structure fig 6b the spatial correlogram indicated that both original and downscaled chirps datasets have similar spatial dependence structure fig 7 the figure presents the results for monsoon july and non monsoon feb months for three years consistently similar correlogram pattern was found for all the months for 17 years confirming that the downscaled product preserves the spatial structure of the original chirps data 4 1 2 validation with imd rain gauge data the downscaled chirps 1 km rainfall product was further validated by comparisons with imd rain gauge stations data scatter plots between chirps 1 km and in situ observations for all the months and seasons fig 8 showed good correlation between the two data sets the overall rmse and mae of the downscaled rainfall products are observed to be 81 59 mm and 37 39 mm respectively higher rmse and mae values are observed for the wetter months jja while values were comparatively low for drier months mam son djf similar observations have been made by others shi and song 2015 immerzeel et al 2009 retalis et al 2017 chirps downscaled data were lower than imd values for high rainfall events marginal changes in rmse during non monsoon months indicated that downscaling algorithm performs better for drier non monsoon months fig 8 in addition the downscaled 1 km rainfall product was compared with imd data for years with three distinct weather conditions namely dry wet and normal rmse and mae for dry year 2002 was least rmse 64 42 mm mae 31 13 mm followed by normal year 2008 rmse 74 88 mm mae 35 43 mm and followed by wet year rmse 86 98 mm mae 39 82 mm 4 2 meteorological drought assessment a major portion of the study area experienced drought in several years during 2001 2017 for both monsoon spi 3 jja months fig 9 and non monsoon spi 3 jfm months fig 10 in all 12 meteorological droughts were experienced in monsoon months and 10 were in non monsoon months in this period the periods 2001 2004 2008 2009 2012 and 2015 experienced drought conditions during both monsoon and non monsoon seasons droughts of severe intensity were observed in years 2004 2008 2009 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 these observations are consistent with other regional studies for the area kulkarni et al 2016 chavadekar and kashid 2016 overall most of the districts in the study area faced dry conditions during both non monsoon and monsoon months in the years 2001 2004 2009 and 2017 however change of wet to dry condition between non monsoon to monsoon months was observed during the years 2008 and 2015 in some districts and vice versa in others during the years 2007 and 2011 to establish the suitability of the downscaled 1 km data for spatio temporal droughts analysis at finer scales the spi 3 maps were zoomed to pixel level for ashti taluka sub district in bid district for both original 5 km and downscaled 1 km chirps data for 2017 fig 11 a d chirps 1 km data could capture spatial variability of drought within and between villages whereas one pixel in the original chirps 5 km data covered multiple villages few villages in the northeastern part of taluka that faced different levels of drought severity can be clearly seen in the downscaled spi 3 for monsoon months jja spatial variability in drought severity at this level could not be captured in the spi 3 from original chirps data due to its coarser resolution similarly in the non monsoon month when most of the villages are affected by drought condition the spatial variability is much more distinctly visible in downscaled image compared to the spi 3 from original chirps dataset hence downscaled chirps product was used for meteorological drought monitoring and its characterization 4 3 meteorological drought characteristics spatio temporal variations of drought characteristics were analyzed using the downscaled spi 3 product and run theory for the years 2001 17 threshold value of spi 3 0 5 for three consecutive months was used to define the drought event the spatial distribution of drought frequency mean severity mean duration and mean intensity most frequent drought and its onset and cessation months and longest drought and its onset and cessation months are presented in fig 12 a i districts situated in eastern north eastern and central parts of the study area experienced drought 10 to 17 times or almost every year or alternate year fig 12a the drought intensity is higher in central north east north west and some eastern districts compared to the rest of the state fig 12b severe droughts have occurred in the central south east south west and eastern parts of the state fig 12c drought duration varies between 3 and 8 months with most regions experiencing shorter duration droughts fig 12d districts in the east southeast and southwest part of the state experience longer drought conditions 6 8 months the onset of drought conditions can be seen during winter months in the north east eastern and south west districts during monsoon months in the central part of the state and during march april and may in the south east region fig 12e drought conditions cease by pre monsoon months mam in the northeast and eastern part of state and during post monsoon and winter months ond in the south east and north west part of the study area fig 12f major portion of the study area has faced droughts of 3 6 months duration fig 12g these areas were also continuously rain deficient for more than one and half year during the period june 2002 to march 2004 fig 12h i the proportion of study area that experienced droughts of different severity levels as defined in table 2 is shown in fig 13 most of the region faced moderate drought d1 over the 17 years exceptional drought conditions were prevalent during the periods 2002 2004 2008 2009 and 2014 2015 nearly 20 of the study area faced exceptional drought in november 2014 the spatial distribution of persistent drought conditions for at least 3 months or more at different severity levels d0 to d4 table 2 during 2001 17 is shown in fig 14 a e majority of the study area have faced the moderate drought condition at least once or more compared to severe extreme and exception drought parts of northern eastern and southeastern districts have faced relatively higher number of droughts of moderate severity extreme and exceptional droughts are rare and occur only in parts of a few districts fig 14e the longest duration drought varies spatially with drought severity fig 15 a e moderate drought is most common for the longest period drought and in northeastern southeastern and southern districts it can last almost a year severe to extreme droughts of long duration are rare and occur only in some small parts of a few districts thus studying drought frequency severity and duration for a region not only helps us to understand the region s drought characteristics but also helps in the probability of drought recurrence at various severity levels 4 3 1 comparison with spei derived drought characteristics the comparison between meteorological drought characteristics on the basis of spi 3 and spei 3 for fourteen sample locations fig 1 is given in table 5 although drought severity value is relatively smaller for spei compared to spi all the values are 2 the drought characterization as exceptional drought table 2 is the same for both spi and spei however spi identifies a higher frequency of droughts compared to spei this is consistent with the findings of aadhar and mishra 2017 that spi and spei at 4 month scale were largely similar for severe and extreme droughts also pei et al 2020 reported variations between spi and spei for drought frequencies and intensities but these decreased with increased timescales meher and vaheddoost 2019 and tirivarombo et al 2018 also reported decrease of spi and spei differences with longer time scale but with slight differences in drought intensity however the observed similarity between spi and spei for similarly identifying the drought severity category may be the result of the rainfall downscaling process implicitly including variability in vegetation and temperature which are also inputs for the modis pet data product 4 4 composite multivariate index for meteorological drought assessment for a comprehensive assessment of spatial patterns of drought vulnerability the different drought characteristics of frequency intensity severity and duration estimated above were integrated into a composite effective meteorological drought index using pca figs 16 and 17 the biplot in figure 16 indicates that frequency duration and severity of the drought have contributed in the formation of pc1 as corresponding vectors are nearly parallel to the axis the contribution of intensity and duration could also be seen in the formation of pc2 in this study the large obtuse angle between frequency and severity of drought indicates negative correlation between the two variables similarly the frequency and duration of drought are also negatively correlated while drought duration and severity are positively correlated negative correlation between the intensity and duration of drought indicated that locations of higher frequency drought are mainly associated with shorter duration these shorter duration droughts are also generally of large intensity and severity and vice versa the spatial distribution of these relationships among four drought characteristics can be seen through principal component scores and associated loadings the spatial pattern of the principal component and the loading i e correlation between original variables and principal component are shown in the fig 17a b the principal component score is the spatial pattern and correlation between individual variable and principal component is a scalar value shown in bar chart the strength of correlation indicates the contribution of each variable in the formation of a component pca first component pc1 explained 52 2 of variance in the dataset the strong correlation large loading magnitude of pc1 with mean severity number of droughts and mean drought duration is indicative of their contribution in the formation of the component the component score and associated loading with individual variable indicates the inverse relationship of number of droughts with mean drought severity and duration fig 17a regions with higher frequency of drought events have droughts of shorter duration and less severity these regions include parts of several districts in northern and central part of the state several grids in these districts have drought frequency above 12 and duration less than or equal to 4 months and severity greater than 2 since pca is based on the spatial mean and deviation from spatial mean therefore the interpretation is in relative sense less frequent droughts with high severity and of large duration can be seen in area near satara and pune border solapur osmanabad chandrapur and garchirolidistricts these areas have less than 10 drought events at several grids but have longer mean duration of values more than 5 to 7 months and extreme severity with values less than 5 however such long duration drought could make all the regions quite vulnerable but could substantially affect these districts that receive low rainfall the second principal component pc2 accounts for 28 6 variance the component has very strong correlation large loading with mean intensity and little less correlation with mean duration of the drought indicating their contribution in the formation of pc2 pc2 mainly represent contrast between mean drought intensity and drought fig 17b grids with lower intensity 1 have longer drought duration 5 7 months and vice versa it is evident that several districts across the study region i e south and south eastern region sindhudurg ratnagiri kolhapur satara southern pune and raigarh north nandurbar dhule jalgoan districts and north eastern region yavatamal and nanded districts are facing high intensity 1 but short duration drought 3 to 4 months high intensity in low rainfall districts may have a substantial impact thus making the district quite vulnerable similarly longer duration drought with low intensity can also have substantial impact in the region e g thane nashik ahmadnagar aurangabad jalna bid osmanabad solapur and garhichiroli districts the composite index generated in this study explains the aggregated effect of the drought phenomenon in a more comprehensive way pca helped to reduce the dimensionality of essential input variables such as drought frequency drought intensity drought severity and duration such a composite index can be useful for managing water resources and highlighting the impending droughts thus the index could categorize the study area into zones namely 1 region facing drought that are of longer duration but less intense less severity and are less frequent 2 region with shorter duration drought but with higher frequency severity and intensity shorter duration drought may affect soil moisture and surface runoff but longer duration drought though less frequent may affect the groundwater and thus require different drought mitigation strategies 5 summary and conclusions the study developed an integrated methodological framework for spatio temporal analysis and assessment of meteorological droughts at high resolution 1 km starting from publicly available coarse scale rainfall data and spi to identify drought events and their characteristics the random forest machine learning based approach for spatial downscaling of chirps 5 km data to 1 km resolution using high resolution satellite sensor data as cofactors conserves both statistical properties and spatial structure of the input data in the downscaled product the error was relatively higher in wet monsoon months jja and wet years compared to other months and drought years respectively the downscaled product enables analysis and assessment of spatiotemporal variations of drought at village and sub village scales drought duration severity intensity frequency and onset and cessation of the drought event were identified based on theory of runs applied to the spi of the downscaled chirps product for the period 2001 17 droughts occurred at least once over 17 years over the study area and the entire study area faced moderately severe drought conditions over seventeen years exceptional drought occurred during 2002 2004 2008 2009 and 2014 2015 the drought duration varied between three to eight months over the study area with differences in drought onset and cessation the comparison between spi and spei at 1 km resolution for 14 locations indicated that spi and spei were consistent in identifying the drought severity category though absolute values were different also spi was identified more number of droughts compared to spei in most of these locations the individual characteristics of drought were integrated into a composite effective meteorological drought index emdi using pca the composite index helps to identify drought vulnerability patterns at 1 km grid level for the case study area the pca analysis identified two regions with distinct drought patterns the regions with longer duration drought have relatively less frequent less severe and low intensity droughts regions with shorter duration droughts have more frequent droughts with higher severity and intensity the identification of such regional patterns of vulnerability can be useful for spatial targeting of drought policies and management interventions the integrated framework developed in this study for high resolution spatio temporal analysis of droughts starting from coarse scale precipitation data is sufficiently general and can be applicable to other regions declaration of competing interest the

4307,lakes on the tibetan plateau tp are a reliable indicator of local and global climate changes surveying lake water storage lws and understanding the causes of lake variations are crucial to regulate water resources and protect local ecology however the lake bathymetric survey and the analysis of consecutive lake changes were absent on the tp in this study we investigated the lws for seven lakes in the central tp and estimated their water storage variations during the period of 1976 2018 by utilizing long term time series landsat images and bathymetric data then the driving factors of lake water storage variations were also analyzed based on the data of the meteorological station the results suggested that the lws of the seven lakes co nag daru co dung co pung co co ngoin bam co and neri punco in the central tp expanded by 2 54 km3 22 12 from 1976 to 2018 with total lake area increased by 183 42 km2 22 73 especially experienced obviously increasing trend between 1997 and 2006 the growth of lws between 1997 and 2006 explained 70 63 of the net increase during the whole period while the correlation analysis of lws and climate change revealed that temperature precipitation and evaporation all had impacts on the changes of lws temperature and precipitation dominated the main role for the expansion of these lakes during the period of 1997 2006 and lws had approximately 3 years of lag time in response to precipitation we also found that the time of the abrupt increase of lws was probably associated with the step change point of annual precipitation keywords tibetan plateau lake water storage bathymetric survey climate change 1 introduction lakes as an important component of the hydrological cycle provide a link between the hydrosphere atmosphere cryosphere lithosphere and biosphere lehner and döll 2004 wang and zhang 1999 it is not only the important indicator for climate change but also has the special role that regulates regional climate supplies water resource for local inhabitants and wildlife and supports ecosystem service huybers et al 2016 laird et al 2016 wong et al 2017 the lakes around the world had significant changes of expansion or shrinkage under global warming over the past decades moser et al 2019 qiao et al 2019b tao et al 2015 zhang et al 2019b zou et al 2018 in the cold regions lake area and level variations also experienced significant changes which primarily influenced by temperature precipitation evaporation glacier melting and permafrost degradation liao et al 2013 liu et al 2009 song et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a zhu et al 2010 the tibetan plateau tp denotes an ideal place for research on climate change due to the few disturbances of human activity tp has been getting warmer and wetter significantly during the recent decades chen et al 2015 the meteorological data from 95 china meteorological administration stations on the tp revealed that temperature experienced an increasing trend at a rate of 0 04 0 005 c a and precipitation also had a generally increasing trend from 1980 to 2018 zhang et al 2019a due to large lake areas on the tp which possess sensitivity to climatic change and less human activity the study of relationship between lakes and climate change has become a hot topic in recent years mao et al 2018 yang et al 2019a 2019b yao et al 2018 under the condition of climatic warming the water resources changes and water cycles in tp are very important because tp acts as the role of asian water tower which supplies 1 4 billion people immerzeel et al 2010 pritchard 2019 lakes in tp are the major part of the land surface water resources and have key role in the water facies shifting among solid glacier liquid precipitation and surface water and gaseous evaporation therefore it is necessary to deeply understand the lakes dynamic changes and their linkages with climatic changes in the tp most of the previous studies related to lake and recent climatic changes in the tp were about the changes of lake surface area lsa and level by using the remote sensing images hwang et al 2019 lu et al 2017 phan et al 2012 song et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 while few studies have focused on the changes of lake water storage lws with certain time spans qiao et al 2019a yang et al 2017 however the lsa changes may conceal the lake actual response amplitude to climatic change due to their differences from lws variation which result in lake water balance for examples the lsa in the northern and central parts of tp increased by 1981 6 km2 and 1869 1 km2 during 2000 2013 respectively but the former accounted for only half of the increase in lws in the latter qiao et al 2019b meanwhile the monitoring timescale in most of the previous studies were multi year or decade while few studies investigated the consecutive changes of lakes in the tp which prevent us from accurately understanding the influence of climate change on lake changes lei et al 2013 li et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 in addition due to shortage of in situ lake bathymetric surveys there is less total lws data in certain surface area condition therefore it is difficult to compare the variation ratios of lsa and lws which is the key indicator to reflect the relationships between lake and climatic changes hence in this study we select 7 lakes in naqu region of central tp to investigate the annual lws and estimate their long term changes based on bathymetric data and landsat images then analyze the driving factors of their variations from 1976 to 2018 our study may further reveal the mechanism of lake variations and climate change based on the consecutive annual lws variations in the central tp 2 study area the study area is located between nyainqen tanglha and tanggula mountains in central tp where possess high lake rate this area climatically is the transitional zone between the westerlies and the india monsoon dominations fig 1 lake variations in this area have been ever studied due to their intensive expansions bian et al 2006 which resulted in the pasture grassland having been flooded for examples there were about about 3246 66 ha of grassland were flooded by the expansion of pung co dung co neri punco from 2000 to 2005 which have resulted in the relocation of numerous local herders ge and zong 2005 for further understanding the relationships between lake variations and climatic changes and lake variation tendencies in this area we selected seven large lakes e g co nag daru co dung co pung co co ngoin bam co neri punco to investigate the relationships among their lws and climatic changes in these seven lakes co nag is an outflow lake draining into the nu river upper reach of salween river and the other six lakes are all closed lakes different from the other lakes pung co is supplied by glacier melting water via beng co with approximately 27 3 km2 which possess 0 82 of the catchment area lei et al 2013 the area of these lakes ranged between 80 km2 and 250 km2 and the elevation of these lakes level were above 4500 m a s l in 2018 table1 the climate in the study area was cold and dry with the mean annual average temperature mat mean annual precipitation map and mean annual pan evaporation mae were around 1 08 c 414 mm and 1738 mm from southeast to northwest in this region precipitation and evaporation had a decreasing and increasing trend respectively 3 data and methodology 3 1 extracting the sequences of lsa in this study the available landsat surface reflectance tier 1 datasets in google earth engine gee were used to extract the lsa the selected data in gee have been atmospherically corrected through using the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive system algorithms for landsat 5 7 data and the landsat surface reflectance code for landsat 8 data masek et al 2006 vermote et al 2016 the cloud cloud shadow and snow ice were masked by the algorithm of the fmask zhu et al 2015 additionally landsat 2 mss collection 1 tier 1 of 1976 1977 in the gee were also used all tier 1 landsat data can be considered consistent and inter calibrated across the different landsat sensors at present there are 5 popular algorithms have been developed and widely used to extract lsa such as normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 modified normalized difference water index mndwi xu 2006 automated water extraction index with no shadows aweinsh feyisa et al 2014 automated water extraction index with shadows aweish and wi2015 fisher et al 2016 table 2 choosing the largest lake bam co as a test case in the study area we compared the accuracies of different auto water index algorithms with the results of manual interpretation of the images in the november of 2018 fig 2 the lsa accuracy of ndwi was 99 81 higher than mndwi 98 72 aweish 97 87 aweinsh 99 79 wi2015 99 35 therefore the algorithm of ndwi was applied to extract the lsa in this study even though there were slight differences in the wavelengths between landsat 8 and landsat 5 7 due to their different sensors we chose the dynamic threshold of otsu that could automatically find an optimal threshold to distinguish the surface water from other objects which could effectively reduce the noise s influence of different sensors all the landsat data were processed using the cloud computing technology based on the gee platform https earthengine google com to minimize the impact of seasonal variations on inter annual differences these landsat images between september and november the beginning or end of the hydrological year are selected zhang et al 2017 3 2 calculating the sequences of lws the lws were calculated by using the tools in arcgis 10 0 according to the underwater terrain and lsa qiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 the underwater terrain of these 7 lakes are produced from bathymetric data which were obtained in october and november in 2018 by using the lowrance high definition system hds 5 single beam echosounder with the hst wsu 83 200 khz skimmer transducer the survey lines in these lakes ranged from 39 3 km to 103 98 km according to their sizes and shapes fig 3 according to abovewater dem of the lake basin the lake level elevations under different lsa are calculated and then the lake water depths under different lsa are able to be inferred based on the in situ measured water depth in 2018 therefore the lws sequence of these 7 lakes have been obtained according to their sequences of lsa 3 3 analysis of long term trends of climate parameters 1 mean annual climatic parameters the lake water balance is mainly related with temperature precipitation and evaporation zhu et al 2010 the meteorological data obtained from three meteorological stations naqu amdo bange were used to assess the change of climate fig 4 showed that whether the temperature or precipitation the fluctuation trends of them from three meteorological stations were basically similar even at the highest or lowest values so the average annual temperature and annual precipitation of the three stations were be calculated and used to represent the climate of the study area the annual evaporation of three stations also had similar fluctuation trends here we only used the annual evaporation of naqu station to represent the evaporation of the study area due to it s complete data 2 variation tendency analyses the method of non parametric mann kendall statistical test kendall 1975 mann 1945 make no assumptions about the distribution of data and performed well in detecting trends in time series of hydrology climate variables chen et al 2007 li et al 2016 xu et al 2008 therefore mann kendall method was employed to detect the trends of temperature precipitation and evaporation in this study for a given time series x1 x2 x3 xn when n 10 the mann kendall test statistic z is defined as follows z s 1 v a r s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 where s i 1 n 1 k i 1 n s g n x k x i x k and x i are the sequential values in the year of k and i respectively k i n is the length of the data set and s g n θ 1 θ 0 0 θ 0 1 θ 0 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 t t t 1 2 t 5 18 where t is the extent of any given tie and t denotes the summation of all ties 3 step change point test the nonparametric mann kendall sneyers test was used for detecting the step change point of climate elements kendall 1975 mann 1945 sneyers 1975 step change in this study means a abrupt change from one average value to another for a given time series x1 x2 x3 xn it uses the intersection of two curves ufk and ubk statistics ufk above 0 means a rising trend otherwise a declining trend and the intersection of two curves represents the time of abrupt change point under the null hypothesis no step change point the normally distributed statistic t k can be described as follows t k i 1 k n i e t k as mean and v a r t k as variance of the normally distributed statistic can be calculated as follows e t k n n 1 4 and v a r t k n n 1 2 n 5 72 uf k as the sequential value of the statistic for uf k is calculated by uf k t k e t k v a r t k the ub k can be calculated by the above process in the opposite time series xn xn 1 xn 2 x1 4 results 4 1 lsa and lws of the lakes according to the bathymetric data that obtained in 2018 the maximum depth of co nag daru co dung co pung co co ngoin bam co neri punco were 33 51 m 20 57 m 35 03 m 59 52 m 8 44 m 72 79 m 32 82 m respectively and the average depth of these lakes were 12 39 m 7 21 m 7 81 m 18 2 m 4 43 m 21 25 m 9 3 m respectively their corresponding lws were approximately 2 35 km3 0 49 km3 1 15 km3 3 17 km3 0 36 km3 5 17 km3 and 0 83 km3 although the lsa of co nag was larger than that of pung co the lws of co nag was a little bit small compared with that of pung co due to the shallow water depth the detailed information about the bathymetric characteristics for the seven lakes are shown in table 3 based on the bathymetric data the lake water storage area curves of seven lakes were established with cubic function as shown in fig 5 and the fitting curves of seven lakes all showed a strong relationship with a r2 0 96 which indicated the model of the lake water storage area was reliable according to the sequence of lsa derived from available images of different years note there are not suitable images between 1978 and 1985 and the bathymetric data in 2018 the sequence of the lws in different years can be calculated fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the lsa and lws of the seven lakes both displayed overall rising trends from 1976 to 2018 with increments of 183 42 km2 and 2 54 km3 and percentages of 22 73 and 22 12 the change trends of the lsa and lws were generally consistent whereas there was a significant difference between 2011 and 2018 the fluctuation of lsa s variation in this period was strong than the lws s indicating that the change of lsa is sensitive to basin topography and lake size because steep shores prevent large lake area changes as compared to lakes with shallow shores during the period of 1976 1996 the lsa and lws of the seven lakes showed a small expansion from 806 92 km2 and 11 5 km3 to 859 61 km2 the percentage of 6 5 and 12 17 km3 the percentage of 5 8 however the lsa and lws experienced an abrupt increase from 1997 to 2006 by 133 27 km2 the percentage of 15 36 and 1 8 km3 the percentage of 14 69 which accounted for 72 66 and 70 63 of the total increments during the whole study period then the lake area and lws remained relatively stable with slight fluctuations during the period of 2007 2018 the seven lakes had the different performance of changes in different periods among them the expansion of bam co and pung co were most significant of which the lsa increased from 188 16 km2 and 134 45 km2 in 1976 to 243 4 km2 and 172 89 km2 in 2018 with the percentages of 29 36 and 28 59 corresponding to the lws change from 4 26 km3 and 2 44 km3 to 5 52 km3 and 3 3 km3 with the percentages of 29 58 and 35 25 although the area s increment of bam co and pung co contributed 51 07 of the total lake area s increment the increment of their lws contributed 83 17 of the total lws s increment although co ngoin only increased by 21 64 km2 and 0 12 km3 it s relative changes were 35 7 and 47 63 which were larger than other lakes due to the small initial area meanwhile from 1976 to 2018 the lake areas of neri punco and dung co increased by 21 74 km2 the percentage of 32 43 and 25 4 km2 the percentage of 20 64 while the lws increased by 0 18 km3 the percentage of 27 02 and 0 06 km3 the percentage of 5 8 two lakes in the north of the study area co nag and daru co only had a slight growth the lake areas of two lakes increased by 8 55 km2 the percentage of 4 7 and 12 41 km2 the percentage of 23 46 and lws of two lakes only increased by 0 02 km3 the percentage of 0 7 and 0 05 km3 the percentage of 10 6 over the past 43 years specifically there was no obvious change of lake area and lws in co nag due to the outflow river from the south of the lake 4 2 climate parameters variations it can be found that the average annual temperature for the three meteorological stations in the study area showed a strong rising trend with a rate of 0 53 c 10 a from 1976 to 2017 fig 4 and there was a cooling in 1983 and 1997 compared with temperature the increasing trend of annual precipitation 11 5 mm 10 a was not significant during the whole study period the precipitation experienced a slightly decreasing trend with fluctuations from 1976 to 1994 followed by a rapidly increasing trend from 1994 to 2003 with a rate of 172 5 mm 10 a then turning to a stable fluctuation trend in terms of evaporation it showed a significant downward trend from 1976 to 2017 with a rate of 32 7 mm 10 a and there was a sharp drop in 1997 although the evaporation did not decline between 1997 and 2006 the value of this period remained a low level of value that around 1496 mm which also could be conducive to the growth of these lakes based on the method of mann kendall test from 1976 to 2017 the temperature exhibited an increasing trend at the 0 001 significance level the precipitation also exhibited an increasing trend at the 0 05 significance level and the evaporation showed a decreasing trend at the 0 05 significance level table 4 due to the rapid increase of lws in the period of 1997 2006 and the relatively monotonous state of lws during the other two periods three stages 1976 1996 1997 2006 and 2007 2017 were set to analyze the climate change according to statistics the temperature increased significantly in all the three stages whereas the precipitation only increased in the stage of 1997 2006 the evaporation presented a downward tendency between 1976 and 1996 thereafter it showed insignificant increases in the next two stages the evaporation exhibited an increasing trend with a rate of 40 44 mm a from 1997 to 2006 suggesting that it was not the main reason for lake growth the mean value of annual precipitation in the stage of 1997 2006 440 73 mm was highest in all stages in contrast the mean value of annual evaporation 1496 mm in this stage was lowest both of which had positive influence on lakes growth the mean value of temperature in the stage of 1997 2006 0 97 c was neither the highest nor the lowest in all periods but it kept increasing at the 0 05 significance level as illustrated in fig 7 the mann kendall sneyers step change point test showed that the change point of temperature occurred in 2001 precipitation occurred in 1997 and evaporation occurred between 1990 and 1993 however the change point of temperature did not pass the significant test because the intersection of ufk and ubk was outside of the confidence interval the result of mann kendall sneyers test also showed that temperature exhibited an increasing trend after 1985 and the trend became more significant since 1990 precipitation had an increasing trend since 1981 except in 1984 1986 1995 and 1996 however evaporation basically had a decreasing trend during the whole period and decreased significantly since 2000 the abrupt increase of lws between 1997 and 2006 seemed to be more probably associated with the step change point of the precipitation because their occurred time were very similar 5 discussions 5 1 relationship between lws changes and climatic change the mechanism driving the lake variations could be consider a complex combination of hydrometeorological factors although temperature was not directly related to the water budget it could affect lake water balance through melting the glacier and permafrost the trend of climate warming and wetting was conductive to the expansion in the central tp in recent decades but the influencing factors of lake variation in every stage were different given that the variations of lws can truly represent the changes of the lake we only analyzed the variations of lws to respond the climate change in the stage of 1976 1996 there was no significant change of precipitation while the lws showed a slightly expansion which could be concluded the role of decreased evaporation and increased temperature obviously the increased evaporation from 1997 to 2006 was not the main reason for the lakes growth the rapid lakes expansion in this stage was mainly attributed to the significant increase of precipitation and temperature the change point of precipitation in 1997 also prove it s strong impact on the lws in this stage from 2007 to 2017 the precipitation and evaporation remained a stable fluctuation trend and the rate of increase in temperature became weak all these factors favor the insignificant change of the lws however the lws had a drop in 2015 and 2016 due to the effect of strong el niño event lei et al 2019 the depth of seasonally frozen ground at bange station has been decreased by about 42 cm from 1960s to 2005 implied that a mass of water from frozen ground would be released in this region liu et al 2010 therefore the increased meltwater from permafrost seasonally frozen ground induced by rising temperature has made a positive contribution to the water balance of these lakes the correlation coefficients between lws and climate elements were investigated for estimating the impacts of climate change on the variations of lws tables 5 and 6 showed that the lws presented strong correlation with the temperature both in the period of 1976 2017 and the period of 1997 2006 while had the weak correlation with the precipitation in the two periods for the evaporation the evaporation had a negative effect on the lake changes and the correlation coefficients in the period of 1997 2006 were larger than it in the period of 1976 2017 it is worth noting that the correlations between lws and precipitation of pre three year were much higher than the correlation between lws and precipitation of current year especially in the period of 1997 2006 in addition we also found that precipitation increased distinctly from 1994 to 2003 and corresponded well to the lakes rapidly expansion from 1997 to 2006 so it is easy to infer that lws had approximately 3 years of lag time in response to precipitation it should be noted that pung co showed the strongest correlation of temperature and lws which could indicate that glacier in the catchment also had an important contribution to lake s growth what s more regarding that only little glaciers were distributed in this region the strong correlation between the temperature and lws implied that permafrost degradation by rising temperature might be one of the important factors for lakes growth the distribution and characteristics of ground ice has been investigated along the qinghai tibetan highway over the past decades according to their results the average thickness of permafrost table and the average weighted water content in this study area were about 18 m and 15 2 respectively zhao et al 2010 compared with other regions the permafrost table was thin and degradation was more notable inevitably with the rising of temperature the meltwater from ground ice would increase and take part in the hydrological cycle indicated that degrade permafrost had close relationship with lake changes and would be the important water source of lakes under the context of the climate warming liu et al 2020 wu et al 2009 overall the temperature precipitation and evaporation all had impacts on the variations of lws but the impact of temperature and precipitation were more significant 5 2 comparison of lake changes with previous studies most of previous studies reported the lakes in the tp expanded from 1990s but they did not provide the exact time of lake s expansion while our results showed that the lakes in the central of tp had a remarkable expansion from 1997 to 2006 several studies also investigated the lake changes in this study area and demonstrated that the lakes increased in recent decades however they only employed a few topographic maps or remote sensing images of different periods and only extracted the surface area of these lakes bian et al 2006 lei et al 2013 liu et al 2009 compared with their studies we investigated the consecutive variations of lws which could reveal the accurate trends of the lake change and help us understand the impact of climate change on the lake changes although previous studies have discussed the driving factors of lake changes the cause of lake changes was still controversial similar with our study liu et al 2009 also found that climatic parameter and runoff have a change point around 1997 but the satellite imagery 2000 2005 they used was too short to exhibit the relationship between climate change and lakes change increased precipitation decreased lake evaporation and the melt of glacier snow by increased temperature were considered the main causes for the lake growth in this region bian et al 2006 lei et al 2013 whereas the glacier existed only in the catchment of pung co so we inferred that increased temperature was mainly responsible for the melt of permafrost rather than the melt of glacier due to strong correlation between the change of temperature and lws based on the spatial distribution of permafrost permafrost in this region have transformed to the seasonally frozen ground and the depth of seasonally frozen ground has been decreased which could release amount of water from ground ice and flow into the closed lake eventually however it should be noted that when the permafrost continues to degrade to a certain depth it may cause the lake water and surface water to supply the groundwater therefore the much work of permafrost monitoring and research need to be strengthened in the following study 6 conclusions in this study we investigated the lake water storage of the seven lakes based on the bathymetric surveys in the central tibetan plateau bathymetric surveys showed that co nag daru co dung co pung co co ngoin bam co and neri punco had the mean and maximum water depth of 12 39 m 7 21 m 7 81 m 18 2 m 4 43 m 21 25 m 9 3 m and 33 51 m 20 57 m 35 03 m 59 52 m 8 44 m 72 79 m 32 82 m respectively and their water storage was estimated to be approximately 2 35 km3 0 49 km3 1 15 km3 3 17 km3 0 36 km3 5 17 km3 and 0 83 km3 in november 2018 based on the google earth engine platform we extracted the consecutive changes of the seven lakes area from 1976 to 2018 by using the algorithm of ndwi the consecutive changes of lws can be determined by the sequence of lsa and bathymetric data in general the lake area and water storage of the seven lakes have experienced increasing trends from 1976 to 2018 by 183 42 km2 22 73 and 2 54 km3 22 12 among them bam co and pung co were the fastest growing lakes the lsa of which increased by 29 36 and 28 59 and the lws of them correspondingly increased by 29 58 and 35 25 during 1976 2018 compared with the indistinct time of lakes expansion in previous studies we found the relatively exact time of lake rapid expansion were during 1997 to 2006 with the expansion of 133 27 km2 15 36 and 1 8 km3 4 69 which respectively accounted for 72 66 and 70 63 of the total increments during the whole study period furthermore the impact of climate change on the lws of the seven lakes was explored in the past four decades the climate in the central tp demonstrated a warming and wetting trend according to correlation relationship between the changes of lws and climate elements it is suggested that the increased temperature increased precipitation and decreased evaporation had positive impacts on the lakes growth the increment of precipitation mainly concentrated in the period of 1994 2003 and had an apparent correspondence with the rapid increase of lws between 1997 and 2006 what s more the correlation coefficients of lws and precipitation of pre three year were much higher both of which implied that the lws had approximately 3 years of lag time in response to precipitation the warming triggered permafrost degradation might be one of the driving factors of lakes growth in the central tp but the condition of permafrost in this region is need to be further investigated this study also found that the time of lakes rapid growth was closely associated with the step change point of annual precipitation since 1997 based on the mann kendall sneyers test the consecutive lws variations presented here will help to better understand the impact of climate change on lakes and the water

4307,lakes on the tibetan plateau tp are a reliable indicator of local and global climate changes surveying lake water storage lws and understanding the causes of lake variations are crucial to regulate water resources and protect local ecology however the lake bathymetric survey and the analysis of consecutive lake changes were absent on the tp in this study we investigated the lws for seven lakes in the central tp and estimated their water storage variations during the period of 1976 2018 by utilizing long term time series landsat images and bathymetric data then the driving factors of lake water storage variations were also analyzed based on the data of the meteorological station the results suggested that the lws of the seven lakes co nag daru co dung co pung co co ngoin bam co and neri punco in the central tp expanded by 2 54 km3 22 12 from 1976 to 2018 with total lake area increased by 183 42 km2 22 73 especially experienced obviously increasing trend between 1997 and 2006 the growth of lws between 1997 and 2006 explained 70 63 of the net increase during the whole period while the correlation analysis of lws and climate change revealed that temperature precipitation and evaporation all had impacts on the changes of lws temperature and precipitation dominated the main role for the expansion of these lakes during the period of 1997 2006 and lws had approximately 3 years of lag time in response to precipitation we also found that the time of the abrupt increase of lws was probably associated with the step change point of annual precipitation keywords tibetan plateau lake water storage bathymetric survey climate change 1 introduction lakes as an important component of the hydrological cycle provide a link between the hydrosphere atmosphere cryosphere lithosphere and biosphere lehner and döll 2004 wang and zhang 1999 it is not only the important indicator for climate change but also has the special role that regulates regional climate supplies water resource for local inhabitants and wildlife and supports ecosystem service huybers et al 2016 laird et al 2016 wong et al 2017 the lakes around the world had significant changes of expansion or shrinkage under global warming over the past decades moser et al 2019 qiao et al 2019b tao et al 2015 zhang et al 2019b zou et al 2018 in the cold regions lake area and level variations also experienced significant changes which primarily influenced by temperature precipitation evaporation glacier melting and permafrost degradation liao et al 2013 liu et al 2009 song et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a zhu et al 2010 the tibetan plateau tp denotes an ideal place for research on climate change due to the few disturbances of human activity tp has been getting warmer and wetter significantly during the recent decades chen et al 2015 the meteorological data from 95 china meteorological administration stations on the tp revealed that temperature experienced an increasing trend at a rate of 0 04 0 005 c a and precipitation also had a generally increasing trend from 1980 to 2018 zhang et al 2019a due to large lake areas on the tp which possess sensitivity to climatic change and less human activity the study of relationship between lakes and climate change has become a hot topic in recent years mao et al 2018 yang et al 2019a 2019b yao et al 2018 under the condition of climatic warming the water resources changes and water cycles in tp are very important because tp acts as the role of asian water tower which supplies 1 4 billion people immerzeel et al 2010 pritchard 2019 lakes in tp are the major part of the land surface water resources and have key role in the water facies shifting among solid glacier liquid precipitation and surface water and gaseous evaporation therefore it is necessary to deeply understand the lakes dynamic changes and their linkages with climatic changes in the tp most of the previous studies related to lake and recent climatic changes in the tp were about the changes of lake surface area lsa and level by using the remote sensing images hwang et al 2019 lu et al 2017 phan et al 2012 song et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 while few studies have focused on the changes of lake water storage lws with certain time spans qiao et al 2019a yang et al 2017 however the lsa changes may conceal the lake actual response amplitude to climatic change due to their differences from lws variation which result in lake water balance for examples the lsa in the northern and central parts of tp increased by 1981 6 km2 and 1869 1 km2 during 2000 2013 respectively but the former accounted for only half of the increase in lws in the latter qiao et al 2019b meanwhile the monitoring timescale in most of the previous studies were multi year or decade while few studies investigated the consecutive changes of lakes in the tp which prevent us from accurately understanding the influence of climate change on lake changes lei et al 2013 li et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 in addition due to shortage of in situ lake bathymetric surveys there is less total lws data in certain surface area condition therefore it is difficult to compare the variation ratios of lsa and lws which is the key indicator to reflect the relationships between lake and climatic changes hence in this study we select 7 lakes in naqu region of central tp to investigate the annual lws and estimate their long term changes based on bathymetric data and landsat images then analyze the driving factors of their variations from 1976 to 2018 our study may further reveal the mechanism of lake variations and climate change based on the consecutive annual lws variations in the central tp 2 study area the study area is located between nyainqen tanglha and tanggula mountains in central tp where possess high lake rate this area climatically is the transitional zone between the westerlies and the india monsoon dominations fig 1 lake variations in this area have been ever studied due to their intensive expansions bian et al 2006 which resulted in the pasture grassland having been flooded for examples there were about about 3246 66 ha of grassland were flooded by the expansion of pung co dung co neri punco from 2000 to 2005 which have resulted in the relocation of numerous local herders ge and zong 2005 for further understanding the relationships between lake variations and climatic changes and lake variation tendencies in this area we selected seven large lakes e g co nag daru co dung co pung co co ngoin bam co neri punco to investigate the relationships among their lws and climatic changes in these seven lakes co nag is an outflow lake draining into the nu river upper reach of salween river and the other six lakes are all closed lakes different from the other lakes pung co is supplied by glacier melting water via beng co with approximately 27 3 km2 which possess 0 82 of the catchment area lei et al 2013 the area of these lakes ranged between 80 km2 and 250 km2 and the elevation of these lakes level were above 4500 m a s l in 2018 table1 the climate in the study area was cold and dry with the mean annual average temperature mat mean annual precipitation map and mean annual pan evaporation mae were around 1 08 c 414 mm and 1738 mm from southeast to northwest in this region precipitation and evaporation had a decreasing and increasing trend respectively 3 data and methodology 3 1 extracting the sequences of lsa in this study the available landsat surface reflectance tier 1 datasets in google earth engine gee were used to extract the lsa the selected data in gee have been atmospherically corrected through using the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive system algorithms for landsat 5 7 data and the landsat surface reflectance code for landsat 8 data masek et al 2006 vermote et al 2016 the cloud cloud shadow and snow ice were masked by the algorithm of the fmask zhu et al 2015 additionally landsat 2 mss collection 1 tier 1 of 1976 1977 in the gee were also used all tier 1 landsat data can be considered consistent and inter calibrated across the different landsat sensors at present there are 5 popular algorithms have been developed and widely used to extract lsa such as normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 modified normalized difference water index mndwi xu 2006 automated water extraction index with no shadows aweinsh feyisa et al 2014 automated water extraction index with shadows aweish and wi2015 fisher et al 2016 table 2 choosing the largest lake bam co as a test case in the study area we compared the accuracies of different auto water index algorithms with the results of manual interpretation of the images in the november of 2018 fig 2 the lsa accuracy of ndwi was 99 81 higher than mndwi 98 72 aweish 97 87 aweinsh 99 79 wi2015 99 35 therefore the algorithm of ndwi was applied to extract the lsa in this study even though there were slight differences in the wavelengths between landsat 8 and landsat 5 7 due to their different sensors we chose the dynamic threshold of otsu that could automatically find an optimal threshold to distinguish the surface water from other objects which could effectively reduce the noise s influence of different sensors all the landsat data were processed using the cloud computing technology based on the gee platform https earthengine google com to minimize the impact of seasonal variations on inter annual differences these landsat images between september and november the beginning or end of the hydrological year are selected zhang et al 2017 3 2 calculating the sequences of lws the lws were calculated by using the tools in arcgis 10 0 according to the underwater terrain and lsa qiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 the underwater terrain of these 7 lakes are produced from bathymetric data which were obtained in october and november in 2018 by using the lowrance high definition system hds 5 single beam echosounder with the hst wsu 83 200 khz skimmer transducer the survey lines in these lakes ranged from 39 3 km to 103 98 km according to their sizes and shapes fig 3 according to abovewater dem of the lake basin the lake level elevations under different lsa are calculated and then the lake water depths under different lsa are able to be inferred based on the in situ measured water depth in 2018 therefore the lws sequence of these 7 lakes have been obtained according to their sequences of lsa 3 3 analysis of long term trends of climate parameters 1 mean annual climatic parameters the lake water balance is mainly related with temperature precipitation and evaporation zhu et al 2010 the meteorological data obtained from three meteorological stations naqu amdo bange were used to assess the change of climate fig 4 showed that whether the temperature or precipitation the fluctuation trends of them from three meteorological stations were basically similar even at the highest or lowest values so the average annual temperature and annual precipitation of the three stations were be calculated and used to represent the climate of the study area the annual evaporation of three stations also had similar fluctuation trends here we only used the annual evaporation of naqu station to represent the evaporation of the study area due to it s complete data 2 variation tendency analyses the method of non parametric mann kendall statistical test kendall 1975 mann 1945 make no assumptions about the distribution of data and performed well in detecting trends in time series of hydrology climate variables chen et al 2007 li et al 2016 xu et al 2008 therefore mann kendall method was employed to detect the trends of temperature precipitation and evaporation in this study for a given time series x1 x2 x3 xn when n 10 the mann kendall test statistic z is defined as follows z s 1 v a r s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 where s i 1 n 1 k i 1 n s g n x k x i x k and x i are the sequential values in the year of k and i respectively k i n is the length of the data set and s g n θ 1 θ 0 0 θ 0 1 θ 0 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 t t t 1 2 t 5 18 where t is the extent of any given tie and t denotes the summation of all ties 3 step change point test the nonparametric mann kendall sneyers test was used for detecting the step change point of climate elements kendall 1975 mann 1945 sneyers 1975 step change in this study means a abrupt change from one average value to another for a given time series x1 x2 x3 xn it uses the intersection of two curves ufk and ubk statistics ufk above 0 means a rising trend otherwise a declining trend and the intersection of two curves represents the time of abrupt change point under the null hypothesis no step change point the normally distributed statistic t k can be described as follows t k i 1 k n i e t k as mean and v a r t k as variance of the normally distributed statistic can be calculated as follows e t k n n 1 4 and v a r t k n n 1 2 n 5 72 uf k as the sequential value of the statistic for uf k is calculated by uf k t k e t k v a r t k the ub k can be calculated by the above process in the opposite time series xn xn 1 xn 2 x1 4 results 4 1 lsa and lws of the lakes according to the bathymetric data that obtained in 2018 the maximum depth of co nag daru co dung co pung co co ngoin bam co neri punco were 33 51 m 20 57 m 35 03 m 59 52 m 8 44 m 72 79 m 32 82 m respectively and the average depth of these lakes were 12 39 m 7 21 m 7 81 m 18 2 m 4 43 m 21 25 m 9 3 m respectively their corresponding lws were approximately 2 35 km3 0 49 km3 1 15 km3 3 17 km3 0 36 km3 5 17 km3 and 0 83 km3 although the lsa of co nag was larger than that of pung co the lws of co nag was a little bit small compared with that of pung co due to the shallow water depth the detailed information about the bathymetric characteristics for the seven lakes are shown in table 3 based on the bathymetric data the lake water storage area curves of seven lakes were established with cubic function as shown in fig 5 and the fitting curves of seven lakes all showed a strong relationship with a r2 0 96 which indicated the model of the lake water storage area was reliable according to the sequence of lsa derived from available images of different years note there are not suitable images between 1978 and 1985 and the bathymetric data in 2018 the sequence of the lws in different years can be calculated fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the lsa and lws of the seven lakes both displayed overall rising trends from 1976 to 2018 with increments of 183 42 km2 and 2 54 km3 and percentages of 22 73 and 22 12 the change trends of the lsa and lws were generally consistent whereas there was a significant difference between 2011 and 2018 the fluctuation of lsa s variation in this period was strong than the lws s indicating that the change of lsa is sensitive to basin topography and lake size because steep shores prevent large lake area changes as compared to lakes with shallow shores during the period of 1976 1996 the lsa and lws of the seven lakes showed a small expansion from 806 92 km2 and 11 5 km3 to 859 61 km2 the percentage of 6 5 and 12 17 km3 the percentage of 5 8 however the lsa and lws experienced an abrupt increase from 1997 to 2006 by 133 27 km2 the percentage of 15 36 and 1 8 km3 the percentage of 14 69 which accounted for 72 66 and 70 63 of the total increments during the whole study period then the lake area and lws remained relatively stable with slight fluctuations during the period of 2007 2018 the seven lakes had the different performance of changes in different periods among them the expansion of bam co and pung co were most significant of which the lsa increased from 188 16 km2 and 134 45 km2 in 1976 to 243 4 km2 and 172 89 km2 in 2018 with the percentages of 29 36 and 28 59 corresponding to the lws change from 4 26 km3 and 2 44 km3 to 5 52 km3 and 3 3 km3 with the percentages of 29 58 and 35 25 although the area s increment of bam co and pung co contributed 51 07 of the total lake area s increment the increment of their lws contributed 83 17 of the total lws s increment although co ngoin only increased by 21 64 km2 and 0 12 km3 it s relative changes were 35 7 and 47 63 which were larger than other lakes due to the small initial area meanwhile from 1976 to 2018 the lake areas of neri punco and dung co increased by 21 74 km2 the percentage of 32 43 and 25 4 km2 the percentage of 20 64 while the lws increased by 0 18 km3 the percentage of 27 02 and 0 06 km3 the percentage of 5 8 two lakes in the north of the study area co nag and daru co only had a slight growth the lake areas of two lakes increased by 8 55 km2 the percentage of 4 7 and 12 41 km2 the percentage of 23 46 and lws of two lakes only increased by 0 02 km3 the percentage of 0 7 and 0 05 km3 the percentage of 10 6 over the past 43 years specifically there was no obvious change of lake area and lws in co nag due to the outflow river from the south of the lake 4 2 climate parameters variations it can be found that the average annual temperature for the three meteorological stations in the study area showed a strong rising trend with a rate of 0 53 c 10 a from 1976 to 2017 fig 4 and there was a cooling in 1983 and 1997 compared with temperature the increasing trend of annual precipitation 11 5 mm 10 a was not significant during the whole study period the precipitation experienced a slightly decreasing trend with fluctuations from 1976 to 1994 followed by a rapidly increasing trend from 1994 to 2003 with a rate of 172 5 mm 10 a then turning to a stable fluctuation trend in terms of evaporation it showed a significant downward trend from 1976 to 2017 with a rate of 32 7 mm 10 a and there was a sharp drop in 1997 although the evaporation did not decline between 1997 and 2006 the value of this period remained a low level of value that around 1496 mm which also could be conducive to the growth of these lakes based on the method of mann kendall test from 1976 to 2017 the temperature exhibited an increasing trend at the 0 001 significance level the precipitation also exhibited an increasing trend at the 0 05 significance level and the evaporation showed a decreasing trend at the 0 05 significance level table 4 due to the rapid increase of lws in the period of 1997 2006 and the relatively monotonous state of lws during the other two periods three stages 1976 1996 1997 2006 and 2007 2017 were set to analyze the climate change according to statistics the temperature increased significantly in all the three stages whereas the precipitation only increased in the stage of 1997 2006 the evaporation presented a downward tendency between 1976 and 1996 thereafter it showed insignificant increases in the next two stages the evaporation exhibited an increasing trend with a rate of 40 44 mm a from 1997 to 2006 suggesting that it was not the main reason for lake growth the mean value of annual precipitation in the stage of 1997 2006 440 73 mm was highest in all stages in contrast the mean value of annual evaporation 1496 mm in this stage was lowest both of which had positive influence on lakes growth the mean value of temperature in the stage of 1997 2006 0 97 c was neither the highest nor the lowest in all periods but it kept increasing at the 0 05 significance level as illustrated in fig 7 the mann kendall sneyers step change point test showed that the change point of temperature occurred in 2001 precipitation occurred in 1997 and evaporation occurred between 1990 and 1993 however the change point of temperature did not pass the significant test because the intersection of ufk and ubk was outside of the confidence interval the result of mann kendall sneyers test also showed that temperature exhibited an increasing trend after 1985 and the trend became more significant since 1990 precipitation had an increasing trend since 1981 except in 1984 1986 1995 and 1996 however evaporation basically had a decreasing trend during the whole period and decreased significantly since 2000 the abrupt increase of lws between 1997 and 2006 seemed to be more probably associated with the step change point of the precipitation because their occurred time were very similar 5 discussions 5 1 relationship between lws changes and climatic change the mechanism driving the lake variations could be consider a complex combination of hydrometeorological factors although temperature was not directly related to the water budget it could affect lake water balance through melting the glacier and permafrost the trend of climate warming and wetting was conductive to the expansion in the central tp in recent decades but the influencing factors of lake variation in every stage were different given that the variations of lws can truly represent the changes of the lake we only analyzed the variations of lws to respond the climate change in the stage of 1976 1996 there was no significant change of precipitation while the lws showed a slightly expansion which could be concluded the role of decreased evaporation and increased temperature obviously the increased evaporation from 1997 to 2006 was not the main reason for the lakes growth the rapid lakes expansion in this stage was mainly attributed to the significant increase of precipitation and temperature the change point of precipitation in 1997 also prove it s strong impact on the lws in this stage from 2007 to 2017 the precipitation and evaporation remained a stable fluctuation trend and the rate of increase in temperature became weak all these factors favor the insignificant change of the lws however the lws had a drop in 2015 and 2016 due to the effect of strong el niño event lei et al 2019 the depth of seasonally frozen ground at bange station has been decreased by about 42 cm from 1960s to 2005 implied that a mass of water from frozen ground would be released in this region liu et al 2010 therefore the increased meltwater from permafrost seasonally frozen ground induced by rising temperature has made a positive contribution to the water balance of these lakes the correlation coefficients between lws and climate elements were investigated for estimating the impacts of climate change on the variations of lws tables 5 and 6 showed that the lws presented strong correlation with the temperature both in the period of 1976 2017 and the period of 1997 2006 while had the weak correlation with the precipitation in the two periods for the evaporation the evaporation had a negative effect on the lake changes and the correlation coefficients in the period of 1997 2006 were larger than it in the period of 1976 2017 it is worth noting that the correlations between lws and precipitation of pre three year were much higher than the correlation between lws and precipitation of current year especially in the period of 1997 2006 in addition we also found that precipitation increased distinctly from 1994 to 2003 and corresponded well to the lakes rapidly expansion from 1997 to 2006 so it is easy to infer that lws had approximately 3 years of lag time in response to precipitation it should be noted that pung co showed the strongest correlation of temperature and lws which could indicate that glacier in the catchment also had an important contribution to lake s growth what s more regarding that only little glaciers were distributed in this region the strong correlation between the temperature and lws implied that permafrost degradation by rising temperature might be one of the important factors for lakes growth the distribution and characteristics of ground ice has been investigated along the qinghai tibetan highway over the past decades according to their results the average thickness of permafrost table and the average weighted water content in this study area were about 18 m and 15 2 respectively zhao et al 2010 compared with other regions the permafrost table was thin and degradation was more notable inevitably with the rising of temperature the meltwater from ground ice would increase and take part in the hydrological cycle indicated that degrade permafrost had close relationship with lake changes and would be the important water source of lakes under the context of the climate warming liu et al 2020 wu et al 2009 overall the temperature precipitation and evaporation all had impacts on the variations of lws but the impact of temperature and precipitation were more significant 5 2 comparison of lake changes with previous studies most of previous studies reported the lakes in the tp expanded from 1990s but they did not provide the exact time of lake s expansion while our results showed that the lakes in the central of tp had a remarkable expansion from 1997 to 2006 several studies also investigated the lake changes in this study area and demonstrated that the lakes increased in recent decades however they only employed a few topographic maps or remote sensing images of different periods and only extracted the surface area of these lakes bian et al 2006 lei et al 2013 liu et al 2009 compared with their studies we investigated the consecutive variations of lws which could reveal the accurate trends of the lake change and help us understand the impact of climate change on the lake changes although previous studies have discussed the driving factors of lake changes the cause of lake changes was still controversial similar with our study liu et al 2009 also found that climatic parameter and runoff have a change point around 1997 but the satellite imagery 2000 2005 they used was too short to exhibit the relationship between climate change and lakes change increased precipitation decreased lake evaporation and the melt of glacier snow by increased temperature were considered the main causes for the lake growth in this region bian et al 2006 lei et al 2013 whereas the glacier existed only in the catchment of pung co so we inferred that increased temperature was mainly responsible for the melt of permafrost rather than the melt of glacier due to strong correlation between the change of temperature and lws based on the spatial distribution of permafrost permafrost in this region have transformed to the seasonally frozen ground and the depth of seasonally frozen ground has been decreased which could release amount of water from ground ice and flow into the closed lake eventually however it should be noted that when the permafrost continues to degrade to a certain depth it may cause the lake water and surface water to supply the groundwater therefore the much work of permafrost monitoring and research need to be strengthened in the following study 6 conclusions in this study we investigated the lake water storage of the seven lakes based on the bathymetric surveys in the central tibetan plateau bathymetric surveys showed that co nag daru co dung co pung co co ngoin bam co and neri punco had the mean and maximum water depth of 12 39 m 7 21 m 7 81 m 18 2 m 4 43 m 21 25 m 9 3 m and 33 51 m 20 57 m 35 03 m 59 52 m 8 44 m 72 79 m 32 82 m respectively and their water storage was estimated to be approximately 2 35 km3 0 49 km3 1 15 km3 3 17 km3 0 36 km3 5 17 km3 and 0 83 km3 in november 2018 based on the google earth engine platform we extracted the consecutive changes of the seven lakes area from 1976 to 2018 by using the algorithm of ndwi the consecutive changes of lws can be determined by the sequence of lsa and bathymetric data in general the lake area and water storage of the seven lakes have experienced increasing trends from 1976 to 2018 by 183 42 km2 22 73 and 2 54 km3 22 12 among them bam co and pung co were the fastest growing lakes the lsa of which increased by 29 36 and 28 59 and the lws of them correspondingly increased by 29 58 and 35 25 during 1976 2018 compared with the indistinct time of lakes expansion in previous studies we found the relatively exact time of lake rapid expansion were during 1997 to 2006 with the expansion of 133 27 km2 15 36 and 1 8 km3 4 69 which respectively accounted for 72 66 and 70 63 of the total increments during the whole study period furthermore the impact of climate change on the lws of the seven lakes was explored in the past four decades the climate in the central tp demonstrated a warming and wetting trend according to correlation relationship between the changes of lws and climate elements it is suggested that the increased temperature increased precipitation and decreased evaporation had positive impacts on the lakes growth the increment of precipitation mainly concentrated in the period of 1994 2003 and had an apparent correspondence with the rapid increase of lws between 1997 and 2006 what s more the correlation coefficients of lws and precipitation of pre three year were much higher both of which implied that the lws had approximately 3 years of lag time in response to precipitation the warming triggered permafrost degradation might be one of the driving factors of lakes growth in the central tp but the condition of permafrost in this region is need to be further investigated this study also found that the time of lakes rapid growth was closely associated with the step change point of annual precipitation since 1997 based on the mann kendall sneyers test the consecutive lws variations presented here will help to better understand the impact of climate change on lakes and the water

4308,surface water monitoring is the foundation of water resources management however large scale surface water monitoring based on long sequence landsat images is easily affected by cloud cover in this study taking the tonle sap lake in the lower mekong as an example a series of water land boundaries with height attributes based on water level data were extracted from multi temporal landsat images without cloud cover using the optimal water index and the lakeshore elevation model lem of tonle sap lake was constructed on this basis with the help of the limited land water boundary provided by the landsat image over a longer period long term monitoring of the changes in the water area of the entire lake area was realized the results show that the landsat image data in conjunction with the lem can effectively remove the effect of cloud cover in monitoring the change of long time series water bodies reconstruction of historical data on changes in the waters of tonle sap lake with the proposed method shows that in the past 30 years there has been no significant change in the water areas of tonle sap lake in either the dry or rainy seasons water area changes of the lake have a delayed response of 1 3 months to changes in the water level of the mekong river which is more affected by the mainstream recharge the water area of the lake is unaffected in the dry season however it is weakly affected in the rainy season by the xiaowan and nuozhadu hydropower stations in china keywords lakeshore elevation model landsat images remote sensing water indices hydropower development tonle sap lake 1 introduction surface water monitoring is an important part of water resources management and climate related research pekel et al 2016 prigent et al 2012 vörösmarty et al 2000 as important land water resources lakes play important roles in the water cycle and flood regulation brönmark and hansson 2002 du et al 2011 and monitoring lake water changes have always been an important aspect of the study of surface water changes however unlike ordinary lakes with the characteristics of a stable water area tonle sap lake is affected by the combination of tropical monsoon climate and the lancang mekong flood pulse as a result the lake area exhibits a large degree of alternation and periodic changes in the water area this change of water area and its relationship with the hydropower development activities carried out in the mainstream of the river basin is one of the focus issues in the study of environmental change in the lower mekong river arias et al 2014 fan et al 2015 ji et al 2018 tangdamrongsub et al 2016 however research on the dynamic changes of large scale waters requires the use of long time remote sensing images although spectral images can meet the time series requirements complete information relevant to the waters is difficult to extract due to considerable cloud coverage for this traditional methods such as linear interpolation and pixel based time series simulation are used to obtain the missing information however large errors still occur kennedy et al 2010 zhu and woodcock 2014 until now in the monitoring process of tonle sap lake and indeed all large lakes it has been difficult to obtain long time series of the water area i e effective means of combining long time series with the entire water area have not been well established given the basic feature that different locations on the water surface of a lake area have the same elevation and the fact that high precision lakeshore elevation models lems of tonle sap lake are scarce this study used landsat images for a limited cloudless period to extract water land boundaries and the corresponding water levels to construct lems then we used the elevation model to extract the complete inundation range without being affected by cloud cover to realize the long term extraction and dynamic change analysis of the lake water area from 1988 2017 with a view to flood monitoring and prediction and agricultural development 2 methodology 2 1 tonle sap lake tonle sap lake is located on the alluvial plain of the lower lancang mekong river fig 1 covering the quaternary strata it is the largest freshwater lake in southeast asia kummu et al 2014 due to the influence of the tropical monsoon climate and the changes in the recharge of the lancang mekong river the lake terrain is flat and the water area shows periodic expansions and contractions within a large range as a result the water area generally changes between approximately 2 240 13 220 km2 and the corresponding water depth varies between about 0 5 7 m burnett et al 2017 tanaka et al 2010 the annual mean temperature of the lake area is 28 33 c the annual precipitation is between 1 300 1 500 mm and the annual cloud coverage rate is greater than 60 mostly concentrated from march to november every year siev et al 2018 2 2 data and methods 2 2 1 data and processing the data used in the study

mrcmekong org 2 2 2 methods the lem was established based on the water boundary and the corresponding water level of the lake and the water boundary was extracted from the cloud free remote sensing image through the water index which is the basic idea of water monitoring in the lake area fig 2 the establishment process of the lem includes the optimization of the water index the water level assignment of the water land boundary the generation of the elevation model by spatial interpolation and the corresponding verification to identify the optimal water indices we first used a series of water indices to extract the water land boundaries separately and then calculated the distance deviation between these boundaries and the visually interpreted reference boundary benchmark reference for the selection and evaluation of optimal precision based on a digital shoreline analysis system dsas thieler et al 2009 the water index corresponding to the minimum distance deviation was taken as the final preferred index in the process of extracting the land water boundary the optimal water and land segmentation threshold of the water index was obtained by the canny detection method table 1 which has characteristics of slow speed less interference by noise and accurate edge monitoring fujimoto et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 since the lake water level is linearly related to the changing surface elevation of the water level fluctuating zone we assigned corresponding water level values to the extracted series of the water boundary during different periods which enabled a set of contour lines of the shape of the lake beach to be obtained the lakeshore elevation model can be generated by interpolation after the lem was established the entire water area could be depicted according to the local water land boundaries exposed by the cloud cover gaps in the remote sensing image thereby overcoming the cloud coverage of the water area with the help of the constructed lem the water land boundaries from 1988 2017 could be extracted from landsat tm etm oli images and used to analyze the characteristics of the water area change in the extraction process it was only necessary to remove the image of the cloud coverage area that was large enough to cover the entire lakeshore elevation model area fully in the process of using water land boundaries assigned with water level information to generate the lem the necessary work is to select several water land boundaries such as high resolution visual interpretation results as accurate as possible as a benchmark to exclude from the interpolation operation and determine the horizontal distance error by calculating the distance deviation which can be conducted by using the dsas software extension for arcgis in addition the actual or measured values of a set of heights need to be compared with the model heights to determine their elevation errors therefore the changes in water level difference from 2014 2017 are compared with the height difference changes extracted under corresponding conditions to determine the vertical error 3 results 3 1 selection of the water index for extracting water land boundaries in the process of water land boundary extraction it is necessary to determine the optimal water and land segmentation threshold for all water indices under different sensor conditions according to canny edge detection zhang et al 2011 judging from the situation reflected in the extraction process there are certain differences in the land water segmentation thresholds under different sensor images or different water indices however this does not prevent the positive effect of most water indices in extracting the water surface coverage taking the landsat 8 oli image as an example except for a few water indices such as ndmi and nowi fig 3 the water land boundary extracted according to most water indices maintained a high degree of consistency with the original lake area the median distance deviation between the water land boundary and the reference boundary extracted by most water indices was 100 m fig 4 among them the median distance deviation between the land water boundary and the reference boundary extracted based on landsat oli images was generally smaller than landsat tm images and both were less than a 30 m resolution pixel fig 4 among all the water indices the median deviations of the water land boundary extracted by sw5 ndwi3 wri mciwi and nciwi are the least of 8 58 m 9 26 m 7 56 m 9 17 m and 9 35 m verified based on sentinel 2a data respectively among the four types of water index the single band segmentation type usually produced a lower median distance deviation according to the analysis of the standard deviation of the distance it can be seen that the error during the extraction of the water land boundary by the water index was always in a relatively stable and limited numerical range 3 2 lakeshore elevation model lem with the addition of a series of water land boundaries extracted by the water index and the corresponding water level values and a spline interpolation method was used to generate the lem of a 30 m spatial resolution with the interpolated water land boundary density of 26 water level records per meter vertically fig 5 in the interpolation simulation process the models generated under different parameter conditions were compared with the water level data and the model with the highest accuracy was selected as the final lakeshore elevation model through cross validation root mean square error 0 4135 m confidence interval 95 by calculating the distance deviation between the reference boundary and the water land boundary extracted from the lem we found that the median value of the distance deviation was 60 m with the interpolated boundary density of 1 2 10 3 1 5 10 2 water level records per meter horizontally indicating that the model spatial error was less than two pixels its accuracy was significantly higher than srtm fig 6 and the water level difference and the elevation difference based on the lem also follow a very significant linear relationship fig 7 which ensured that we were able to obtain a full range of water under cloud coverage fig 8 3 3 changes in the water area of the lake basin with the help of the lakeshore elevation model the monitoring results of the changes in the water area of the tonle sap lake in the past 30 years through the cloud free area on the landsat image show that the lake basin has a small water area coverage from february july each year fig 9 whereas from august january the water surface coverage is relatively extensive the maximum value of the water area during the year appears from september november and the minimum value occurs from april june there is a large difference in the maximum value of the water area each year exceeding 15 000 km2 whereas the inter annual difference in the minimum value is very small the stable water area is approximately 2 300 km2 in terms of seasonal characteristics the mean area of the water area in the rainy season is 7 000 km2 and the maximum and minimum values appeared in 2001 and 2003 respectively the annual mean change trend of water area over the past 30 years is not significant the impact of changes in precipitation on changes in lake waters is not immediate using a delay time of 0 6 months to calculate the correlation coefficient between the two we found that when the delay time was 1 3 months the correlation between rainfall and water area of the lake was the largest which shows that there is a 1 3 months delay in the response of lake water area to rainfall variations fig 10 similarly the relationship between the lake water area and the water level data of the two hydrological stations on the lower mekong river i e pakse and kratie shows that the water area has a 1 2 months delayed response time to the mainstream water level variations 4 discussion 4 1 lem based on landsat images and water levels satellite data and hydrological records are the basis for studying water content on land hong et al 2010 yang and chen 2015 in many parts of the world especially in areas where there are many lakes monitoring of changes in water resources depends on water level monitoring however it is difficult to obtain information on changes in lake water reserves over a long period in waters in which hydrological monitoring has commenced only relatively recently hong et al 2010 jafari et al 2012 due to the long time span of landsat remote sensing image data a new method is to realize long time lake water monitoring by establishing a lem through limited water level change data extracting local water boundary from the landsat remote sensing image with the aid of a water index and restoring the entire water area according to the principles of water level contours this method has strong applicability in monitoring the changes in the water area of tonle sap lake and can be widely adapted to the monitoring of water area changes in other lakes lacking lake basin shape data accuracy of the lem is the key to ensuring the reliability of monitoring changes in the water area the production of dems on a global scale mainly depends on the differential interferometry of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar and the related data mainly includes aster srtm alos and tandem x dems examined by comparing them with gps and lidar measurements rossi and gernhardt 2013 zhang et al 2019 however the water level differences in the shallow lake basin are very sensitive to the elevation error and the elevation error of these data is generally around 10 m which cannot satisfy the research needs mukul et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 although the dems generated based on the measured contours and lidar technology can meet the requirements of elevation accuracy the cost of data acquisition is high and the period of data production is long li et al 2017 polat et al 2015 which is difficult to apply to a large area the elevation accuracy of the newly established lakeshore elevation model mainly depends on the accuracy of the water index used to identify the water area however the water index is of various types and depends on the sensor landsat images are obtained using three sensors and their respective service periods are different compared with tm and etm images oli images have a higher quality of radiation and geometric corrections loveland and irons 2016 and can divide water bodies and vegetation with higher accuracy ke et al 2015 the effect of extracting the land water boundary from the landsat tm image is slightly inferior to the other two images however because of its long time series the significance of the screening water index based on this image is more obvious among many water body indices those with a superior extraction performance of the water land boundary include nir single band index bennett 1987 green nir ratio index alesheikh et al 2007 wri index shen and li 2010 and ciwi comprehensive index mo et al 2007 we also verified the poor performance of individual water indices in the process of extracting the water land boundary the ndmi index under the three sensor conditions used to extract the tonle sap lake water boundary errors was larger this index is based on the vegetation canopy with high reflectivity and weak absorption of liquid and was originally used to monitor moisture content in vegetation gao 1996 because of the vast forests and shrubs in the seasonally flooded areas around the tonle sap lake area some soils and water bodies with higher water content must be mistaken when using the ndmi index to monitor the water and land boundaries kummu et al 2008 the highlights that in addition to the quality of the remote sensing image itself the choice of the water index must be combined with actual information such as the properties and distribution of the underlying surface objects 4 2 variation and attribution of lake area based on the lem changes in water areas are the response of lakes to climate change and human activities arias et al 2014 zhong et al 2012 especially in the current situation involving frequent drought events and increasing human activities monitoring and correct attribution of changes in the water area of important lakes can help clarify the role of human activities and provide a basis for resolving water disputes however the study area is a tropical offshore area with severe cloud cover tsay et al 2013 which is the main factor affecting the dynamic monitoring of the lake water area change over a long period and it is especially difficult to obtain near anniversary images moreover there is a lack of intra annual change feature data it seriously affects the diagnosis and attribution analysis of lake water area changes we reconstructed the long term and high precision monthly water area changes fig 9 which are fundamentally affected by the mainstream runoff and rainfall in the lake area the most significant factor currently affecting changes in runoff is considered to be hydropower development hecht et al 2019 hoang et al 2019 and the hydropower stations are mainly located in the mainstream lancang mekong river within china and laos and in the sesan srepok and sekong 3s rivers among them xiaowan dam height 262 m and nuozhadu dam height 292 m have the largest scales and commenced operation in 2008 and 2011 respectively whether these two hydropower stations have caused significant disturbance to the change in the water area of tonle sap lake is an important cross border environmental issue fan et al 2015 we compared the changes in the monthly average water level of pakse and kratie hydrological stations located on the lower mekong river and the tonle sap lake before and after the operation of the hydropower station as well as the average areas of the lake table 1 in terms of the rainy season regardless of the period after the xiaowan hydropower station or the nuozhadu hydropower station were put into operation the water level of the main stream and the lake area were consistently reduced while the amount of precipitation replenishment in the lake area during the corresponding period increased which shows that the change is mainly influenced by the water level of the mainstream i e the recharge amount of the mainstream is the main reason for the change of the lake area this coincides with the inference that the large scale dam building in the mainstem and tributaries of the lancang mekong river lowered the flooding water level in the lake by changing the frequency and magnitude of the lancang mekong flood pulse kummu and sarkkula 2008 however unlike the regular change in the precipitation of the basin after the operation of the xiaowan hydropower station and the level of the main stream in the period after the nuozhadu hydropower station commenced operation in 2011 the phenomenon of the decline of the main stream water level occurred although average precipitation in the basin increased table 2 the decline of the main stream water level may reflect the impact of factors such as agricultural irrigation evaporation and increased industrial water use or may be caused by the reservoir storage reducing the runoff of the downstream channel after entering the dry season regardless of increased precipitation in the lake area the water area of the lake area shrunk compared with the previous period indicating that the precipitation in the lake area has no obvious impact on the change of water area as the higher water level of the main stream in the dry season compared with the previous period can hinder the external flow of the lake area the water area of the lake area were predicted to increase with the rise of the water level in the lake kummu and sarkkula 2008 however the actual lake area is shrinking which may reflect strong evaporation in the dry season or caused by the lake s blocked supply channel in the dry season to the mainstream of the lower mekong river it can be deduced that the variation of water area in the lake area during the dry season cannot be linked to the result of hydropower development in the main stream in addition as far as the entire basin is concerned the water discharge contribution of the lancang river is less than 15 of the total lancang mekong discharge fan et al 2015 which is far lower than the discharge contribution approx 25 of the 3s rivers arias et al 2014 and the dam has distance attenuation effects on the runoff disturbance according to the principle of spatial autocorrelation gu et al 2020 thus it is also less likely that the lake will be affected by the runoff disturbance of the two dams in the rainy season wang et al 2020 4 3 lem advantages and disadvantages cloud cover is a widespread phenomenon in landsat images and spatial interpolation is usually used to compensate for missing data however this method is not preferable in the classification of water objects because clouds are usually distributed in a large space and the lack of geographic information will greatly reduce the effectiveness of interpolation although the pixel value of the missing time is simulated by the ccdc continuous change detection and classification method based on the existing clear pixels zhu and woodcock 2014 and the effect of cloud coverage can be solved well the long term data loss greatly affects the accurate construction of the relationship between the surface reflectance and the time function when solving the classification problem of perennial cloud covering a large area there is a detrimental effect of simulating image pixel information based on landsat image and water level data the lem of tonle sap lake can extract the water area more completely under conditions of cloud cover compensate for the missing information of cloud cover and more accurately show the water area of the lake which provides a new method for lake water monitoring unlike the general dem which is affected by the data collection method and sampling density leading to unstable data quality the lem established by this method can control the spatial error within 2 pixels ensuring accurate water monitoring however there may still be some shortcomings when using landsat imagery and water level data to construct lakeshore elevation models for example landsat satellites have a long revisit period 26 days and there may be some changes in the water level data within the blank date of the image resulting in errors in monitoring the water area similarly when the landsat image boundary is used the accuracy of the linear feature extraction will be affected when the difference between the water and land boundary is not sufficiently large which will affect the accuracy of the spatial interpolation result in addition since tonle sap lake is a shallow lake that is heavily affected by the lancang mekong flood pulse the average annual input of sediment is 5 1 106 6 4 106 tons and the discharge volume is 1 4 106 1 5 106 tons kummu et al 2008 which will cause unknown changes in the bottom terrain of the lake area and result in inconsistent topographic conditions of the lake level data 5 conclusions surface water monitoring is an important part of water resources management using landsat images can achieve long term monitoring of water bodies however it is also susceptible to cloud coverage according to the principle that the water s surface in the same lake basin is constant at the same elevation position this study investigated tonle sap lake in cambodia by optimizing the water index the land water boundaries of different lake levels were extracted and a series of contour lines were obtained indirectly finally the lem of tonle sap lake was constructed by interpolation the accuracy analysis results of the model show that the selected water index is appropriate and the water level data is correct a reliable lakeshore elevation model can be constructed and that long time series monitoring of the entire water area of the lake can be realized by using the model and the limited water boundary the monitoring results for the lake area show that 1 the changing trend in the mean water area of tonle sap lake in the past 30 years is not very obvious 2 there is a 1 3 months delay between dry and abundant periods of the lake and the time of rainfall and mainstream replenishment 3 the water area of the lake area during the rainy season is mainly affected by the water level of the mainstream and 4 the dry season is

4308,surface water monitoring is the foundation of water resources management however large scale surface water monitoring based on long sequence landsat images is easily affected by cloud cover in this study taking the tonle sap lake in the lower mekong as an example a series of water land boundaries with height attributes based on water level data were extracted from multi temporal landsat images without cloud cover using the optimal water index and the lakeshore elevation model lem of tonle sap lake was constructed on this basis with the help of the limited land water boundary provided by the landsat image over a longer period long term monitoring of the changes in the water area of the entire lake area was realized the results show that the landsat image data in conjunction with the lem can effectively remove the effect of cloud cover in monitoring the change of long time series water bodies reconstruction of historical data on changes in the waters of tonle sap lake with the proposed method shows that in the past 30 years there has been no significant change in the water areas of tonle sap lake in either the dry or rainy seasons water area changes of the lake have a delayed response of 1 3 months to changes in the water level of the mekong river which is more affected by the mainstream recharge the water area of the lake is unaffected in the dry season however it is weakly affected in the rainy season by the xiaowan and nuozhadu hydropower stations in china keywords lakeshore elevation model landsat images remote sensing water indices hydropower development tonle sap lake 1 introduction surface water monitoring is an important part of water resources management and climate related research pekel et al 2016 prigent et al 2012 vörösmarty et al 2000 as important land water resources lakes play important roles in the water cycle and flood regulation brönmark and hansson 2002 du et al 2011 and monitoring lake water changes have always been an important aspect of the study of surface water changes however unlike ordinary lakes with the characteristics of a stable water area tonle sap lake is affected by the combination of tropical monsoon climate and the lancang mekong flood pulse as a result the lake area exhibits a large degree of alternation and periodic changes in the water area this change of water area and its relationship with the hydropower development activities carried out in the mainstream of the river basin is one of the focus issues in the study of environmental change in the lower mekong river arias et al 2014 fan et al 2015 ji et al 2018 tangdamrongsub et al 2016 however research on the dynamic changes of large scale waters requires the use of long time remote sensing images although spectral images can meet the time series requirements complete information relevant to the waters is difficult to extract due to considerable cloud coverage for this traditional methods such as linear interpolation and pixel based time series simulation are used to obtain the missing information however large errors still occur kennedy et al 2010 zhu and woodcock 2014 until now in the monitoring process of tonle sap lake and indeed all large lakes it has been difficult to obtain long time series of the water area i e effective means of combining long time series with the entire water area have not been well established given the basic feature that different locations on the water surface of a lake area have the same elevation and the fact that high precision lakeshore elevation models lems of tonle sap lake are scarce this study used landsat images for a limited cloudless period to extract water land boundaries and the corresponding water levels to construct lems then we used the elevation model to extract the complete inundation range without being affected by cloud cover to realize the long term extraction and dynamic change analysis of the lake water area from 1988 2017 with a view to flood monitoring and prediction and agricultural development 2 methodology 2 1 tonle sap lake tonle sap lake is located on the alluvial plain of the lower lancang mekong river fig 1 covering the quaternary strata it is the largest freshwater lake in southeast asia kummu et al 2014 due to the influence of the tropical monsoon climate and the changes in the recharge of the lancang mekong river the lake terrain is flat and the water area shows periodic expansions and contractions within a large range as a result the water area generally changes between approximately 2 240 13 220 km2 and the corresponding water depth varies between about 0 5 7 m burnett et al 2017 tanaka et al 2010 the annual mean temperature of the lake area is 28 33 c the annual precipitation is between 1 300 1 500 mm and the annual cloud coverage rate is greater than 60 mostly concentrated from march to november every year siev et al 2018 2 2 data and methods 2 2 1 data and processing the data used in the study

mrcmekong org 2 2 2 methods the lem was established based on the water boundary and the corresponding water level of the lake and the water boundary was extracted from the cloud free remote sensing image through the water index which is the basic idea of water monitoring in the lake area fig 2 the establishment process of the lem includes the optimization of the water index the water level assignment of the water land boundary the generation of the elevation model by spatial interpolation and the corresponding verification to identify the optimal water indices we first used a series of water indices to extract the water land boundaries separately and then calculated the distance deviation between these boundaries and the visually interpreted reference boundary benchmark reference for the selection and evaluation of optimal precision based on a digital shoreline analysis system dsas thieler et al 2009 the water index corresponding to the minimum distance deviation was taken as the final preferred index in the process of extracting the land water boundary the optimal water and land segmentation threshold of the water index was obtained by the canny detection method table 1 which has characteristics of slow speed less interference by noise and accurate edge monitoring fujimoto et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 since the lake water level is linearly related to the changing surface elevation of the water level fluctuating zone we assigned corresponding water level values to the extracted series of the water boundary during different periods which enabled a set of contour lines of the shape of the lake beach to be obtained the lakeshore elevation model can be generated by interpolation after the lem was established the entire water area could be depicted according to the local water land boundaries exposed by the cloud cover gaps in the remote sensing image thereby overcoming the cloud coverage of the water area with the help of the constructed lem the water land boundaries from 1988 2017 could be extracted from landsat tm etm oli images and used to analyze the characteristics of the water area change in the extraction process it was only necessary to remove the image of the cloud coverage area that was large enough to cover the entire lakeshore elevation model area fully in the process of using water land boundaries assigned with water level information to generate the lem the necessary work is to select several water land boundaries such as high resolution visual interpretation results as accurate as possible as a benchmark to exclude from the interpolation operation and determine the horizontal distance error by calculating the distance deviation which can be conducted by using the dsas software extension for arcgis in addition the actual or measured values of a set of heights need to be compared with the model heights to determine their elevation errors therefore the changes in water level difference from 2014 2017 are compared with the height difference changes extracted under corresponding conditions to determine the vertical error 3 results 3 1 selection of the water index for extracting water land boundaries in the process of water land boundary extraction it is necessary to determine the optimal water and land segmentation threshold for all water indices under different sensor conditions according to canny edge detection zhang et al 2011 judging from the situation reflected in the extraction process there are certain differences in the land water segmentation thresholds under different sensor images or different water indices however this does not prevent the positive effect of most water indices in extracting the water surface coverage taking the landsat 8 oli image as an example except for a few water indices such as ndmi and nowi fig 3 the water land boundary extracted according to most water indices maintained a high degree of consistency with the original lake area the median distance deviation between the water land boundary and the reference boundary extracted by most water indices was 100 m fig 4 among them the median distance deviation between the land water boundary and the reference boundary extracted based on landsat oli images was generally smaller than landsat tm images and both were less than a 30 m resolution pixel fig 4 among all the water indices the median deviations of the water land boundary extracted by sw5 ndwi3 wri mciwi and nciwi are the least of 8 58 m 9 26 m 7 56 m 9 17 m and 9 35 m verified based on sentinel 2a data respectively among the four types of water index the single band segmentation type usually produced a lower median distance deviation according to the analysis of the standard deviation of the distance it can be seen that the error during the extraction of the water land boundary by the water index was always in a relatively stable and limited numerical range 3 2 lakeshore elevation model lem with the addition of a series of water land boundaries extracted by the water index and the corresponding water level values and a spline interpolation method was used to generate the lem of a 30 m spatial resolution with the interpolated water land boundary density of 26 water level records per meter vertically fig 5 in the interpolation simulation process the models generated under different parameter conditions were compared with the water level data and the model with the highest accuracy was selected as the final lakeshore elevation model through cross validation root mean square error 0 4135 m confidence interval 95 by calculating the distance deviation between the reference boundary and the water land boundary extracted from the lem we found that the median value of the distance deviation was 60 m with the interpolated boundary density of 1 2 10 3 1 5 10 2 water level records per meter horizontally indicating that the model spatial error was less than two pixels its accuracy was significantly higher than srtm fig 6 and the water level difference and the elevation difference based on the lem also follow a very significant linear relationship fig 7 which ensured that we were able to obtain a full range of water under cloud coverage fig 8 3 3 changes in the water area of the lake basin with the help of the lakeshore elevation model the monitoring results of the changes in the water area of the tonle sap lake in the past 30 years through the cloud free area on the landsat image show that the lake basin has a small water area coverage from february july each year fig 9 whereas from august january the water surface coverage is relatively extensive the maximum value of the water area during the year appears from september november and the minimum value occurs from april june there is a large difference in the maximum value of the water area each year exceeding 15 000 km2 whereas the inter annual difference in the minimum value is very small the stable water area is approximately 2 300 km2 in terms of seasonal characteristics the mean area of the water area in the rainy season is 7 000 km2 and the maximum and minimum values appeared in 2001 and 2003 respectively the annual mean change trend of water area over the past 30 years is not significant the impact of changes in precipitation on changes in lake waters is not immediate using a delay time of 0 6 months to calculate the correlation coefficient between the two we found that when the delay time was 1 3 months the correlation between rainfall and water area of the lake was the largest which shows that there is a 1 3 months delay in the response of lake water area to rainfall variations fig 10 similarly the relationship between the lake water area and the water level data of the two hydrological stations on the lower mekong river i e pakse and kratie shows that the water area has a 1 2 months delayed response time to the mainstream water level variations 4 discussion 4 1 lem based on landsat images and water levels satellite data and hydrological records are the basis for studying water content on land hong et al 2010 yang and chen 2015 in many parts of the world especially in areas where there are many lakes monitoring of changes in water resources depends on water level monitoring however it is difficult to obtain information on changes in lake water reserves over a long period in waters in which hydrological monitoring has commenced only relatively recently hong et al 2010 jafari et al 2012 due to the long time span of landsat remote sensing image data a new method is to realize long time lake water monitoring by establishing a lem through limited water level change data extracting local water boundary from the landsat remote sensing image with the aid of a water index and restoring the entire water area according to the principles of water level contours this method has strong applicability in monitoring the changes in the water area of tonle sap lake and can be widely adapted to the monitoring of water area changes in other lakes lacking lake basin shape data accuracy of the lem is the key to ensuring the reliability of monitoring changes in the water area the production of dems on a global scale mainly depends on the differential interferometry of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar and the related data mainly includes aster srtm alos and tandem x dems examined by comparing them with gps and lidar measurements rossi and gernhardt 2013 zhang et al 2019 however the water level differences in the shallow lake basin are very sensitive to the elevation error and the elevation error of these data is generally around 10 m which cannot satisfy the research needs mukul et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 although the dems generated based on the measured contours and lidar technology can meet the requirements of elevation accuracy the cost of data acquisition is high and the period of data production is long li et al 2017 polat et al 2015 which is difficult to apply to a large area the elevation accuracy of the newly established lakeshore elevation model mainly depends on the accuracy of the water index used to identify the water area however the water index is of various types and depends on the sensor landsat images are obtained using three sensors and their respective service periods are different compared with tm and etm images oli images have a higher quality of radiation and geometric corrections loveland and irons 2016 and can divide water bodies and vegetation with higher accuracy ke et al 2015 the effect of extracting the land water boundary from the landsat tm image is slightly inferior to the other two images however because of its long time series the significance of the screening water index based on this image is more obvious among many water body indices those with a superior extraction performance of the water land boundary include nir single band index bennett 1987 green nir ratio index alesheikh et al 2007 wri index shen and li 2010 and ciwi comprehensive index mo et al 2007 we also verified the poor performance of individual water indices in the process of extracting the water land boundary the ndmi index under the three sensor conditions used to extract the tonle sap lake water boundary errors was larger this index is based on the vegetation canopy with high reflectivity and weak absorption of liquid and was originally used to monitor moisture content in vegetation gao 1996 because of the vast forests and shrubs in the seasonally flooded areas around the tonle sap lake area some soils and water bodies with higher water content must be mistaken when using the ndmi index to monitor the water and land boundaries kummu et al 2008 the highlights that in addition to the quality of the remote sensing image itself the choice of the water index must be combined with actual information such as the properties and distribution of the underlying surface objects 4 2 variation and attribution of lake area based on the lem changes in water areas are the response of lakes to climate change and human activities arias et al 2014 zhong et al 2012 especially in the current situation involving frequent drought events and increasing human activities monitoring and correct attribution of changes in the water area of important lakes can help clarify the role of human activities and provide a basis for resolving water disputes however the study area is a tropical offshore area with severe cloud cover tsay et al 2013 which is the main factor affecting the dynamic monitoring of the lake water area change over a long period and it is especially difficult to obtain near anniversary images moreover there is a lack of intra annual change feature data it seriously affects the diagnosis and attribution analysis of lake water area changes we reconstructed the long term and high precision monthly water area changes fig 9 which are fundamentally affected by the mainstream runoff and rainfall in the lake area the most significant factor currently affecting changes in runoff is considered to be hydropower development hecht et al 2019 hoang et al 2019 and the hydropower stations are mainly located in the mainstream lancang mekong river within china and laos and in the sesan srepok and sekong 3s rivers among them xiaowan dam height 262 m and nuozhadu dam height 292 m have the largest scales and commenced operation in 2008 and 2011 respectively whether these two hydropower stations have caused significant disturbance to the change in the water area of tonle sap lake is an important cross border environmental issue fan et al 2015 we compared the changes in the monthly average water level of pakse and kratie hydrological stations located on the lower mekong river and the tonle sap lake before and after the operation of the hydropower station as well as the average areas of the lake table 1 in terms of the rainy season regardless of the period after the xiaowan hydropower station or the nuozhadu hydropower station were put into operation the water level of the main stream and the lake area were consistently reduced while the amount of precipitation replenishment in the lake area during the corresponding period increased which shows that the change is mainly influenced by the water level of the mainstream i e the recharge amount of the mainstream is the main reason for the change of the lake area this coincides with the inference that the large scale dam building in the mainstem and tributaries of the lancang mekong river lowered the flooding water level in the lake by changing the frequency and magnitude of the lancang mekong flood pulse kummu and sarkkula 2008 however unlike the regular change in the precipitation of the basin after the operation of the xiaowan hydropower station and the level of the main stream in the period after the nuozhadu hydropower station commenced operation in 2011 the phenomenon of the decline of the main stream water level occurred although average precipitation in the basin increased table 2 the decline of the main stream water level may reflect the impact of factors such as agricultural irrigation evaporation and increased industrial water use or may be caused by the reservoir storage reducing the runoff of the downstream channel after entering the dry season regardless of increased precipitation in the lake area the water area of the lake area shrunk compared with the previous period indicating that the precipitation in the lake area has no obvious impact on the change of water area as the higher water level of the main stream in the dry season compared with the previous period can hinder the external flow of the lake area the water area of the lake area were predicted to increase with the rise of the water level in the lake kummu and sarkkula 2008 however the actual lake area is shrinking which may reflect strong evaporation in the dry season or caused by the lake s blocked supply channel in the dry season to the mainstream of the lower mekong river it can be deduced that the variation of water area in the lake area during the dry season cannot be linked to the result of hydropower development in the main stream in addition as far as the entire basin is concerned the water discharge contribution of the lancang river is less than 15 of the total lancang mekong discharge fan et al 2015 which is far lower than the discharge contribution approx 25 of the 3s rivers arias et al 2014 and the dam has distance attenuation effects on the runoff disturbance according to the principle of spatial autocorrelation gu et al 2020 thus it is also less likely that the lake will be affected by the runoff disturbance of the two dams in the rainy season wang et al 2020 4 3 lem advantages and disadvantages cloud cover is a widespread phenomenon in landsat images and spatial interpolation is usually used to compensate for missing data however this method is not preferable in the classification of water objects because clouds are usually distributed in a large space and the lack of geographic information will greatly reduce the effectiveness of interpolation although the pixel value of the missing time is simulated by the ccdc continuous change detection and classification method based on the existing clear pixels zhu and woodcock 2014 and the effect of cloud coverage can be solved well the long term data loss greatly affects the accurate construction of the relationship between the surface reflectance and the time function when solving the classification problem of perennial cloud covering a large area there is a detrimental effect of simulating image pixel information based on landsat image and water level data the lem of tonle sap lake can extract the water area more completely under conditions of cloud cover compensate for the missing information of cloud cover and more accurately show the water area of the lake which provides a new method for lake water monitoring unlike the general dem which is affected by the data collection method and sampling density leading to unstable data quality the lem established by this method can control the spatial error within 2 pixels ensuring accurate water monitoring however there may still be some shortcomings when using landsat imagery and water level data to construct lakeshore elevation models for example landsat satellites have a long revisit period 26 days and there may be some changes in the water level data within the blank date of the image resulting in errors in monitoring the water area similarly when the landsat image boundary is used the accuracy of the linear feature extraction will be affected when the difference between the water and land boundary is not sufficiently large which will affect the accuracy of the spatial interpolation result in addition since tonle sap lake is a shallow lake that is heavily affected by the lancang mekong flood pulse the average annual input of sediment is 5 1 106 6 4 106 tons and the discharge volume is 1 4 106 1 5 106 tons kummu et al 2008 which will cause unknown changes in the bottom terrain of the lake area and result in inconsistent topographic conditions of the lake level data 5 conclusions surface water monitoring is an important part of water resources management using landsat images can achieve long term monitoring of water bodies however it is also susceptible to cloud coverage according to the principle that the water s surface in the same lake basin is constant at the same elevation position this study investigated tonle sap lake in cambodia by optimizing the water index the land water boundaries of different lake levels were extracted and a series of contour lines were obtained indirectly finally the lem of tonle sap lake was constructed by interpolation the accuracy analysis results of the model show that the selected water index is appropriate and the water level data is correct a reliable lakeshore elevation model can be constructed and that long time series monitoring of the entire water area of the lake can be realized by using the model and the limited water boundary the monitoring results for the lake area show that 1 the changing trend in the mean water area of tonle sap lake in the past 30 years is not very obvious 2 there is a 1 3 months delay between dry and abundant periods of the lake and the time of rainfall and mainstream replenishment 3 the water area of the lake area during the rainy season is mainly affected by the water level of the mainstream and 4 the dry season is unaffected by xiaowan and nuozhadu hydropower stations in the upper reaches of the mainstream and hydropower development may have an influence on lakes in the rainy season but it is not obvious in

4309,since evapotranspiration et is the intrinsic link between global energy and water cycle remote sensing based models have been developed for regional and global scale et on heterogeneous land surface over the past four decades in view of the significantly different physical mechanisms and mathematical expressions among remote sensing et models as well as data availability and quality control process among the model input products it is necessary to investigate the uncertainties of the multiple sources in actual et estimation here three remote sensing et models including the pt dtsr model the pm mod model and the pml model were simultaneously driven by three meteorological reanalysis products resulting in nine calculation schemes to analyze the combined effect of the models and the input datasets the sobol sensitivity method was also adopted for identifying the influential model parameters and in turn understanding the model process the results indicated that estimates from nine calculation schemes showed great differences in the magnitude and temporal variation explaining 20 50 of et variability over all sites additionally schemes compared with both uncorrected and corrected energy balance observations as well as schemes using meteorological variables from three reanalysis products and eddy covariance tower observations verified that the uncertainties in latent heat flux data observations caused by the energy budget mis closure problem and spatial scale mismatch have propagated into the et estimation our study is a beneficial reference for the uncertainties in remote sensing based methods and thus can provide guidance for the future development of et models keywords evapotranspiration remote sensing uncertainty penman monteith priestly taylor eddy

and biosphere hoek van dijke et al 2020 jung et al 2010 wang and dickinson 2012 accurately estimating et and identifying its temporal and spatial patterns are thus the linchpins to better understand

2019 gerhards et al 2019 mallick et al 2015 2018a morillas et al 2013 taikan and shinjiro 2006 yang et al 2012 however et which consists of evaporation from the water and soil surface transpiration through the stomata of plants and water intercepted by the plant canopy is recognized as one of the most challenging components in the hydrologic cycle to be measured and simulated due to its complicated dependence on numerous climatological variables physical soil properties and moisture conditions bhattarai et al 2018 mallick et al 2018b as well as the vegetation types tang et al 2010

measurement methods holmes 1984 seneviratne et al 2010 the ec and bowen ratio techniques have been used broadly cook 2007 wilson et al 2002 however the application of current eddy covariance and bowen ratio systems are more or less subject to the tower density gash 1987 wang et al 2010 limited durations and spatial coverage mao and wang 2017 and high requirement for surface homogeneity therefore alternative approaches for regional et simulation with larger footprint and lower cost are urgently required with significant advantages in capturing land surface information such as vegetation type and density at large scales satellite retrieval technique has received increasing attention in the scientific community during the past four decades numerous models based on satellite retrieval

meteorological conditions the pm and pt models in which almost all variables and parameters have clear physical meanings can estimate et directly bhattarai et al 2018 mallick et al 2014 2018b with

2011 for the pm and pt models the input products generally consist of radiation variables vegetation indices and meteorological observations yao et al 2013 for radiation related and meteorological variables conventional observations distribute irregularly in space and time while unconventional observations from satellites have inevitable accuracy issues to achieve a spatially complete and relatively accurate gridded dataset data assimilation system has been developed to integrate and optimize the data from satellite retrieval products with various sources and types of observations however there are still uncertainties in reanalysis products due to the limitations in model and analysis technique which in turn will induce propagation error into the simulation of actual et bengtsson and shukla 1988 rienecker et al 2011 in fact uncertainties exist widely in model mechanisms allen et al 2006 crago 1996 gavilán et al 2007 guo et al 2007 ortega farias et al 2004 wang et al

partitioning methods and ecophysiological constraints for model parameters the empirical coefficient α in pt type models and surface resistance r s in pm type models as well as the meteorological

the standard often used for calibrating and validating coarse scale latent heat flux le is the observation data from the ec tower so far hundreds of eddy flux towers have come into service all over the world and are organized under the globe fluxnet initiative baldocchi et al 2001 nevertheless the ec method has its limitations the typical error of le measured by ec method is about 5 20 or 20 50 w m2 foken 2008 there are two problems that cannot be ignored when the data from the ec towers and the et modeled estimates are compared first the energy budget of the tower measurements is rarely closed resulting in non closure on the order of 20 to 30 second the towers sample over a limited fetch usually on the order of 100 1000 m depending on the tower height which restricts the scale of evaluation anderson et al 2003 twine et al 2000 vinukollu et al 2011 however it is noted that both the ideal and nonideal ec sites can provide information on physiological functioning temporal dynamics and response to the environment during the day baldocchi et al 2001 and that integrated annual measurements of et with lysimeters and watersheds show good agreement barr et al 2000 wilson and baldocchi 2000 therefore it is meaningful to use the le data from ec towers provided by fluxnet as the benchmark in the comparison of the results and uncertainties of different schemes in this study we examined the uncertainties in the procedure of et estimation based on the remote sensing models the estimated et from nine calculation schemes using three different remote sensing et models including the pt dtsr model the pm mod model and the pml model driven by three different meteorological reanalysis products were compared against the observations from eight ec towers table 1 the sobol sensitivity method was also used for understanding the model process and influential parameters in addition the energy budget mis closure problem in the ec method was detected by comparing the nine schemes with both energy balance uncorrected and corrected observations the mismatch problem in spatial scale was analyzed by comparing the schemes respectively forced by pixel scale reanalysis products and point scale ec tower observations comprehensive comparisons of various remote sensing based et methods and input datasets as well as quantification of their uncertainties should be valuable in terms of the selection of appropriate datasets and models for water management and for advancing the science of et modeling 2 data and methods 2 1 process based remote sensing evapotranspiration models three process based models including two penman monteith type models penman 1948 monteith 1965 i e pm mod model mu et al 2011 and pml model zhang et al 2010 and one priestley taylor type model i e pt dtsr model yao et al 2013 were used in this study with the consideration of the surface energy partitioning process and environment constraints mu et al 2011 applied the penman monteith equation to specific components moreover the pm mod model differs from other models in the sense that it considers the transpiration at night time and divides the soil surface into the saturated wet and moist surface another significant feature of the pm mod model is the parameterization of the resistance by using vapor pressure deficit vpd and temperature constraints to estimate the stomatal conductance and using leaf area index lai as a scalar to estimate canopy conductance from stomatal conductance compared with the pm mod model the pml model has simpler formulas for the canopy conductance g c and aerodynamic conductance g a leuning et al 2008 with only six parameters and ability to divide the canopy physiological processes and soil evaporation meanwhile combined with a calibrated fu model and gridded long term precipitation and runoff data to get the best estimate of the parameters the model was further developed by zhang et al 2010 for a finer temporal resolution and closure of the annual water balance however the pm type models require more meteorological variables than pt type models which limits their implementation the radiation based priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 is more empirical than the penman monteith equation and can be regarded as a simplified version of the penman equation as shown in the supplement method s1 s2 s3 among the three models used in our study the algorithm of the pm mod model is the most complex while the algorithm of the pt dtsr model is the simplest the pt dtsr model transfers potential et to actual et by constructing ecophysiological and soil condition constraints and replacing the atmospheric demand with an empirical coefficient α without calculating the aerodynamic and surface resistance based on the pt jpl model constructed by fisher et al 2008 yao et al 2013 modifies some of the constraint functions and reduces the input variables by replacing vpd or relative humidity rh with air temperature ta in the calculation of the soil moisture constraints therefore pt dtsr model has the least number of input variables among the three models and can keep the balance between the model availability and accuracy 2 2 data at eddy covariance sites the eddy covariance ec method is the standard method used widely to trace gas fluxes between ecosystem and atmosphere in this study we obtained data from fluxnet https fluxnet fluxdata org for meteorological variables and latent heat flux data the fluxnet is hosted by the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in the usa including ameriflux asiaflux euroflux ozflux and other members the datasets from fluxnet have been gapfilled using the multidimensional scaling mds method reichstein et al 2005 there are 8 flux sites in china covering five major terrestrial biomes mixed forests mf evergreen needleleaf forests enf evergreen broadleaf forests ebf wetlands wet and grasslands gra the names and locations of the ec towers and land cover types of china were presented in fig 1 and table 2 in order to estimate et at the point scale and evaluate the uncertainty of various meteorological factors from reanalysis datasets we extracted datasets from fluxnet for daily net radiation rn ta incoming shortwave radiation vpd rh and air pressure pres note that the le data mentioned in our study has energy budget mis closure problems for a necessary supplement we extracted the energy balance corrected version of le from the fluxnet which was named lecor in this paper based on the assumption that bowen ratio is correct the energy balance correction requires the measurements of sensible heat h and soil heat flux g due to the measurement limitation the lecor data are only available in cn cng and cn du2 from the 8 sites 2 3 meteorological data and land surface parameters at regional scale to estimate et at regional scale daily ta maximum air temperature tmax minimum air temperature tmin rh pres and downward shortwave radiation ssrd were used to drive all three models meanwhile we adopted three different meteorological reanalysis products which were introduced as follows china meteorological forcing dataset called

models also need vegetation indices and land surface parameters we used the global land surface satellite glass datasets to achieve the albedo abd and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis datasets to achieve the leaf area index lai the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green vegetation fpar and the land cover type from 2003 to 2012 covering the time series of all fluxnet sites used in this study the surface albedo from the glass product is developed by qu et al 2014 at a 0 05 spatial resolution and an 8 day temporal interval albedo used in our study is taken as the average of the white sky albedo wsa and black sky albedo bsa su et al 2007 moreover continuous lai and fpar datasets were generated from the mcd15a2 product at a 500 m spatial resolution and an 8 day temporal interval while continuous ndvi datasets were generated from the mod13a2 product at a 1 km spatial resolution and a 16 day temporal interval the terrestrial ecosystem area of china is defined by the modis land cover product mcd12q1 band 1 of igbp classification at a 500 m resolution for 2001 the glass product was acquired

active archive center daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov search all the input data and the model simulations in this study were processed to a spatial resolution of 0 1 by the nearest neighbor interpolation method and a temporal resolution of 8 days by the arithmetical average method 2 4 the sobol sensitivity analysis in this study we adopted the method of sobol to calculate the sensitivity index si of the parameters in the pt dtsr model the pm mod model and the pml model the sobol method is based on the variance decomposition and can handle nonlinear and non monotonic functions and models sobol 2001 assume that a parameterized model can be represented by the following functional form 1 y f x θ where y is the output of the model θ is the parameter set and x is the forcing data of the model in the sobol method the total variance of function f can be decomposed into a summation of terms with increasing dimensionality 2 d y i 1 k d i i 1 k 1 j i 1 k d ij d 1 k where d i is the amount of variance due to the i th parameter θ i d ij is the amount of variance due to the interaction between the i th and j th parameter and k is the total number of parameters in this way the variance contributions to the total output variance of individual parameters and parameter interactions can be determined the final sensitivity effect is divided into a first order si s i and a total order si s ti 3 s i d i d 4 s ti s i j i s ij the first order index s i is a measure for the variance contribution of the individual parameter θ i to the total model variance while the impact on the model output variance of the main effect of θ i and all its interactions with the other parameters is given by s ti further details about the method are available in nossent et al 2011 and zhang et al 2013 2 5 statistical analysis in this study we quantified the mismatches between the model calculation results and the observation data from ec towers for goodness of fit metrics we used four indices including the coefficient of determination r2 bias bias w m2 root mean square error rmse w m2 and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kim et al 2018 li et al 2015 liu et al 2016 majozi et al 2017 ramoelo et al 2014 velpuri et al 2013 wang et al 2013 to indicate the uncertainties and errors in the simulations the r2 showed how much variation in the observations was explained by the model while the rmse indicated the difference between simulations and observations the kge was used to comprehensively evaluate the model performance by incorporating correlation variability error and bias error into a single multi objective criterion the details of the evaluation metrics are as follows 5 r 2 i 1 n s i s 2 g i g 2 i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n g i g 2 2 6 b i a s 1 n i 1 n s i g i 7 r m s e i 1 n s i g i 2 n 8 kge 1 e d 9 ed r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 10 α σ s σ 0 11 β μ s μ 0 where i means the i t h number of samples s i and g i represent 8 days satellite and ground based actual et datasets respectively n represents a total number of data pairs during the study periods s and g are the mean satellite and flux tower based et values ed is the euclidian distance from the ideal point μ0 and σ0 are the mean and standard deviation of the observations μs and σs are the mean and standard deviation of the simulations α is a measure of relative variability in the simulated and observed values and β is the ratio of the mean values of simulations and observations without any simulation errors the values of the three components should be r 1 α 1 and β 1 therefore the ideal kge value is 1 3 results 3 1 the sobol sensitivity analysis for the remote sensing et models a proper sample size is needed to calculate the sensitivity indices in this study we used a sample size of 12 000 to calculate the sensitivity indices for 20 key parameters in the three models which were listed in the table 3 compared with results from smaller sample sizes we found that this sample size is sufficient and the sensitivity indices are reliable due to the size of the paper the details are deferred to the supplementary material for readers who are interested in the details see fig s1 s3 fig 2 presents the values of first order si and total order si for model parameters it should be noted that sensitive parameters are defined with a 10 threshold of total order si zhang et al 2013 for the pt dtsr model the final outputs were sensitive to α and f wet as shown in fig 2 α had the highest first order sensitivity and total order sensitivity accounting for 52 59 and 64 44 of the total variance moreover the first order sensitivity and total order sensitivity values of f sm and f t were near zero indicating that the influence of themselves and their interaction with other parameters on the model outputs were negligible furthermore the total order sensitivity values of α f wet and f v were much higher than their first order sensitivity values suggesting that they had significant interactions with each other the metric variance was attributed to more parameters in the pm mod model there were three sensitive parameters including f c f wet and r a n i g h t that had great influence on the outputs the first order sensitivity values of five parameters including r h r c r a d a y r s d a y r s n i g h t and ras were near zero among the three parameters in the pml model g a and g s were highly sensitive to the modeled et accounting for 71 16 and 31 20 of the total variance respectively additionally parameter interactions contributed to a significant portion of the variation in all three models the parameters of all three models except f had significantly higher total order sensitivity than the first order sensitivity the results of the sobol sensitivity analysis revealed that highly sensitive parameters have very large influences on the model output the parameters in pm mod model have more complex interactions while pt dtsr model and pml model are mainly affected by their first order effects i e separated effects therefore accurately calculating or calibrating the highly sensitive model parameters will be helpful for reducing the uncertainty in et estimation 3 2 statistical analysis of the uncertainties in the modeled et at regional scales the modeled et was evaluated by the observations from ec towers the results of the nine calculation schemes differed greatly from each other at regional scale generally as illustrated in fig 3 the nine estimates explained 20 50 of et variability over all towers meanwhile the modeled seasonal curves of le plotted in fig 4 showed relatively good agreement with the observed ones the results of the pt dtsr model using data from merra showed the highest coefficient of determination r2 0 50 followed by the pt dtsr model using data from cmfd and era and the pm mod model using data from cmfd with r2 values ranging from 0 44 to 0 46 the results of the pm mod model using data from cmfd were the closest to the observed values with the lowest absolute value of bias bias 0 98 w m2 among all the calculation schemes moreover there was no significant difference in rmses of all calculation schemes with range from 26 52 to 35 84 w m2 by removing the seasonal mean of the time series fig s4 presents the interannual variability of the daily et estimated by different reanalysis products and different remote sensing models with the fluxcom product it can be found that different schemes reflected different trends in interannual variability the results indicated that pt dtsr model had a better agreement with the fluxcom product than the pm mod model and pml model and results of the pm mod model using data from era and merra fluctuated much more sharply than the other schemes for individual sites fig 5 shows that the pt dtsr model presented higher r2 and lower bias of le than the other models while the pml model presented lower r2 and higher bias these characteristics were particularly pronounced on median values although the rmses for all estimations were similar the pm mod model showed larger differences among sites implying that the performance of the pm mod model was more inconsistent than the pt dtsr and pml model over study sites the variation of the kge values was also very large especially for the pm mod model using data from cmfd with kge ranging from 0 50 to 0 90 overall the pm mod model using data from cmfd the pm mod model using data from era and the pt dtsr model using data from merra were the most reliable calculation schemes according to kge values it should be noted that uncertainties in et depend upon the complex association between input datasets and models previous researches only focused on the independent influence of the input data accuracy or model performance however as different reanalysis products have different deviations for specific meteorological variables and the most sensitive variables in specific models are also different the combination of the model and input product can greatly affect the accuracy of et estimation previous studies revealed a similar phenomenon in potential evapotranspiration pet estimation wang et al 2017 designed four different pet estimation approaches which grouped input variables and methods with different reliability together and found obvious differences in quantity therefore it is possible to optimize the model performance by choosing suitable data products 3 2 1 performance assessment of remote sensing et models the performance of the different algorithms was quantitatively evaluated as shown in table s1 for the pt dtsr pm mod and pml models respectively the mean r2 were 0 71 0 61 and 0 36 while the mean rmse were 29 33 28 47 and 29 34 w m2 suggesting that the pt dtsr model has an advantage in estimating the temporal variation of et and the pm mod model has an advantage over the quantity moreover the bias of daily et for the pt dtsr pm mod and pml models were 14 98 3 32 and 6 90 w m2 respectively implying that there was substantial variation in the quantity estimation of et among models it can be seen from fig 6 that without excluding the influence of input datasets the annual et estimated by the pm mod model was generally higher than that estimated by the pt dtsr model and lower than that estimated by the pml model for most sites according to the nine calculation schemes models play a major role in the estimation of et which has been documented in many other studies e g vinukollu et al 2011 for example yang et al 2018 compared three dual source remote sensing et models to gain a better understanding of differences in models similarly by comparing the pt dtsr pm mod and pml models our study explores in depth the cause of disagreements in the outputs of the models the differences in et simulation are primarily due to the model mechanism the fundamental difference of model mechanism mentioned here mainly refers to the difference between the priestley taylor equation and the penman monteith equation the pm type models are based on the penman monteith equation that takes the energy balance equation and aerodynamic methods as well as canopy and aerodynamic resistances into the algorithm while the priestley taylor equation can be considered a simplified version of the penman equation and avoids the calculation of the aerodynamic and surface resistance the pt type models replace the atmospheric demand with an empirical coefficient α whose sensitivity accounts for 64 44 of the total variance and convert the potential evapotranspiration pet to actual et with ecophysiological constraints and soil evaporation partitioning the absence of the aerodynamic and surface resistance may explain why the r2 and bias of the pt dtsr model are relatively less affected by the input products compared to the pm type models at all 8 sites fig 5 also the limitation of the empirical coefficient α and the ecophysiological constraints may account for the underestimate of et which have different performance over different land cover type fig s2 moreover the expressions of the key process variables also account for the uncertainty this point was verified by the comparison of the pm mod model and the pml model although being constructed under the same pm framework pm mod model and the pml model were differentiated by the aerodynamic and surface resistance parameterization methods the algorithms for g c and g a in pm mod model rely heavily on optimized leaf scale parameters and take et components in to consideration while pml model uses a biophysical model to calculate g c and assigns constant values for g a as shown in fig 2 the outputs of the pm mod model and pml model are highly sensitive to aerodynamic and surface resistance thus differences in simulated et calculated by the pm mod model and pml model can partly be attributed by aerodynamic and surface resistance parameterization methods furthermore various empirical methods that calculate the parameters related to cover fraction and ecophysiological constraints were used in different models cleugh et al 2007 fisher et al 2008 mu et al 2007 2011 yao et al 2013 for example the water cover fraction f wet can be estimated by different variables such as rh and diurnal temperature range in different forms of equations also formulas used to calculate the vegetation cover fraction f c have different structures and contain different variables such as fpar ndvi and the enhanced vegetation index the selection of empirical equations largely depends on the user s experience leading to complex uncertainties in the remote sensing et models due to the limitation of parameterization method zhang et al 2019 as well as the sample size and representativeness mu et al 2007 li et al 2017 parameters bring additional uncertainty into the models 3 2 2 evaluation of the uncertainty caused by different products fig 7 and table 4 present scatter plots of meteorological variables from remote sensing retrievals against that measured at 8 eddy flux towers these six variables including tmin ta tmax pres ssrd and rh are the common and most important meteorological variables that affect the accuracy in et estimation generally tmin ta tmax and pres from the three products were consistent with ground observations with r2 close to 1 low bias and low rmse meanwhile it can be seen in table 4 that all of the remote sensing retrieved ssrd correlated well with the site observations whereas the bias rmse value of 1 11 24 40 w m2 obtained from cmfd was significantly lower than that of 18 59 32 98 w m2 and 28 52 43 48 w m2 from era and merra respectively moreover the data of rh showed the highest uncertainty among all the variables with lowest values of r2 ranging from 0 005 to 0 09 table s1 presents the metrics of the comparisons for et for each tower though the indices varied from site to site the mean coefficients of determination for all sites were 0 66 0 53 and 0 46 for the data from cmfd era and merra respectively while the mean rmses were 28 58 27 79 and 30 76 w m2 respectively by comparing r2 and rmse we found that estimates using the data from cmfd can better reflect the et change patterns while that from era can better reflect the magnitude fig 4 shows the time traces of nine estimates of et which displays strong seasonality at most towers the estimates corresponded well with the observations in the winter times and showed a significant distinction in the summer times when plants are in their growing season the results derived from the same algorithm and different products indicated that uncertainty in input data has a great impact on the et estimation in both magnitude and temporal variation comparing meteorological variables from cmfd era and merra with the ground observations we found that all reanalysis products discussed in our study show great differences especially for ssrd and rh as shown in table 4 the bias of ssrd from three reanalysis products to the ec tower observations range from 1 11 to 28 52 w m2 and the rmse range from 24 40 to 43 48 w m2 while the r2 of rh range from 0 005 to 0 09 and the bias range from 4 00 to 12 55 in pm and pt type models meteorological factors are essential for et estimation for example the ssrd is related to the supply of energy that provides the latent heat of vaporization and rh directly affects the vpd that governs the transport of vapor penman 1948 therefore the uncertainties in meteorological products have an important effect on et estimation in both magnitude and temporal variation 3 3 evaluation of the uncertainties from eddy covariance towers although the uncertainty of observations from ec towers has been studied researchers have paid little attention to its impact on the et estimation in this study we further explored the two reasons originating from the ec towers that induced the uncertainties into the et estimation the fig 8 plots the r2 and rmse of et at two ec towers where the green lines represented the indices in comparison with lecor while the yellow lines represented the indices in comparison with le it can be seen that the modeled et agreed better with lecor with higher r2 nevertheless the differences in the r2 in term of lecor and le were not significant ranging from 0 008 to 0 064 it is hard to determine the effect of the energy balance closure correction because the average rmse of the lecor was 2 44 w m2 higher than that of le in addition the difference in the rmse in term of the lecor and le for cn cng was much higher than that for cn du2 another reason that induces uncertainty into ec tower observation is the mismatch of the scales often the input datasets that drive the remote sensing models are from regional products while the le data can only cover a point scale as shown in table 4 and fig 7 the values of meteorological variables from point scale and regional scale showed great disparities especially for rh here to avoid the calculation of aerodynamic and surface resistance the pt dtsr model was selected for analysis since it has fewer interferences from other factors than the other models by setting the most sensitive parameter α at 1 26 we forced the pt dtsr model separately by the regional scale reanalysis products and the point scale meteorological variables entirely from ec tower observations the performances of the et estimates are shown in fig 9 in general almost all sites had higher r2 and lower rmse when using point scale data at individual sites the indices of three regional schemes are similar while the indices of point scale scheme sometimes showed great difference with the indices of regional schemes we can thus conclude that the estimates driven completely by point scale meteorological variables agreed better with observations than that driven by regional datasets indicating that the scale mismatch is another source of the uncertainties in et estimation by analyzing the uncertainties arising from the ec towers we found that limitations in ec tower observations have great effect on the magnitude of et estimation therefore we recommend an evaluation of the ec flux measurements before its application the limitations of ec method also inevitably lead to the uncertainties in et estimation as observations from ec towers are often used as the standard in the calibration and validation of large scale et e g vinukollu et al 2011 park et al 2017ab twine et al 2000 on one hand the pixel to footprint mismatch would be a significant cause of uncertainty for instance the errors of the model estimates ranged between 5 and 15 when the sebs model was forced by the tower based inputs however when the sebs model was forced by reanalysis inputs the errors would increase significantly up to 40 su et al 2007 2005 in this study the pt dtsr model was chosen for comparison the differences between the results calculated by the meteorological data from ec towers and three products indicated that partial uncertainties in et estimation come from the mismatch of the ground observations and the input data fig 9 meanwhile as a bridge between large scale variables and station scale et remote sensing models bring parameter calibration mismatch into estimation as the inputs of the remote sensing et models are at regional scale while the parameters are calibrated to satisfy the point scale therefore et scaling beyond the ec footprint remains little known on the other hand uncertainties can also be attributed to the mis closure of energy balance with le data which is a long outstood issue foken et al 2006 michel et al 2016 twine et al 2000 the comparison of the lecor and le demonstrated that the energy balance mis closure problem has little impact on temporal variation while its impact on quantity depends on the construction conditions of the ec tower in addition many studies have shown that land cover type and regional climate condition have great impacts on the energy closure rate of the region foken 2008 mcafee 2013 wang et al 2015 wilson et al 2002 how to improve the ec method in consideration of the land cover type to achieve the closure of energy budget is still an open question 3 4 evaluation of the uncertainties in different land cover types fig 10 a presents the model performance associated with specific vegetation apparently the r2 of different models were obviously different when being applied to different land cover types ranging from 0 31 to 0 85 over 8 sites particularly the bias of mean daily et calculated by the pm mod model for forest grassland and wetland were 23 64 7 40 and 13 70 w m2 respectively suggesting that the pm mod model was highly sensitive to the land cover types moreover as indicated in fig 10a the rmse of daily et varied with land cover type for all three models therefore it can be concluded that model performance depends heavily on the land cover types over study area when remote sensing et model is applied to different land cover types over china especially when pm mod model is applied the selection of appropriate input products is of great importance for the simulation accuracy besides the products are sensitive to the land cover types as shown in fig 10b the metrics of various land cover types calculated using different products were quite different with the mean r2 for individual land cover types ranging from 0 52 grass land cover type to 0 72 wet land cover type and the mean bias of individual land cover types ranged from 13 70 w m2 wet land cover type to 9 32 w m2 grass land cover type hence in practice it is necessary to select appropriate input datasets according land cover types especially the forest cover climate and vegetation have long been considered as the important factors that affect the ecosystem evapotranspiration chen et al 2021 our results showed that all three models had strong correlations between the model performance and land cover type fig 10 and fig s5 which was consistent with previous studies for example khan et al 2018 evaluated the results of gleam gldas and mod16 over nine asiaflux sites representing forest rice paddy and grassland biomes and found large difference in the errors between low vegetation and tall canopies meanwhile it can be seen in fig s6 that all of the three models have higher uncertainties in plateau continental climate zone and the pm mod model is sensitive to climatic differences which overestimates et in subtropical monsoon climate zones and has better performance in temperate monsoon climate and temperate continental climate zones nevertheless our study has limitations in sample size more sites are needed when analyzing the response of et to specific vegetation type and climate zone 4 conclusions and discussions this paper explored the multiple sources of the uncertainties in actual et estimation over china based on three remote sensing et models three reanalysis products and flux tower observations nine calculation schemes using different models and input products were designed for quantifying the uncertainties induced by the meteorological forcing and the computational procedures used in remote sensing et models the comparisons among the nine calculation schemes revealed that estimates derived from different models and input datasets show great differences in both magnitude and temporal variation with the pt dtsr modeled et having a significant advantage in simulating the temporal variation and that the applicability of reanalysis products relies heavily on the model moreover the uncertainties caused by energy balance mis closure problems were analyzed by comparing the nine schemes with both energy balance uncorrected and corrected observations and mismatch in spatial scale difference was analyzed using meteorological variables from three reanalysis products and observations at ec towers noticeably the uncertainties induced by multiple sources have a clear association with the land cover type the uncertainties in et estimation were systematically investigated using ten schemes the findings can provide a useful reference for et model improvement and further help better understand the important role that evapotranspiration plays in the hydrological cycle however since the comparisons in this study were based on the 8 sites located in china our quantitative analyses are restricted to these regions and may not be applicable to other regions which are different from our study regions furthermore due to the limited product sources this paper did not analyze the uncertainties induced by vegetation indices whereas the sensitivity study performed by ferguson et al 2010 using the pm mod model has found that the final et estimates are affected more by the lai and fractional vegetation cover than climatic variables especially in humid basins moreover current comparisons are mainly performed based on the observations from the ec towers which only reflect the values of le at limited sites and days therefore the uncertainties associated with the model performance and product reliance were not thoroughly revealed despite the limitations our study can effectively provide directions for improving the accuracy of et estimation for instance developing a new parameterization method with more solid physiological theories and performing local calibration to reduce uncertainties in model parameterizations can be an effective way to improve the accuracy finally with the development of measurement instruments such as sap flow and lysimeter a deeper insight into the uncertainties in the et sub components are possible researches in future declaration of

4309,since evapotranspiration et is the intrinsic link between global energy and water cycle remote sensing based models have been developed for regional and global scale et on heterogeneous land surface over the past four decades in view of the significantly different physical mechanisms and mathematical expressions among remote sensing et models as well as data availability and quality control process among the model input products it is necessary to investigate the uncertainties of the multiple sources in actual et estimation here three remote sensing et models including the pt dtsr model the pm mod model and the pml model were simultaneously driven by three meteorological reanalysis products resulting in nine calculation schemes to analyze the combined effect of the models and the input datasets the sobol sensitivity method was also adopted for identifying the influential model parameters and in turn understanding the model process the results indicated that estimates from nine calculation schemes showed great differences in the magnitude and temporal variation explaining 20 50 of et variability over all sites additionally schemes compared with both uncorrected and corrected energy balance observations as well as schemes using meteorological variables from three reanalysis products and eddy covariance tower observations verified that the uncertainties in latent heat flux data observations caused by the energy budget mis closure problem and spatial scale mismatch have propagated into the et estimation our study is a beneficial reference for the uncertainties

and biosphere hoek van dijke et al 2020 jung et al 2010 wang and dickinson 2012 accurately estimating et and identifying its temporal and spatial patterns are thus the linchpins to better understand

2019 gerhards et al 2019 mallick et al 2015 2018a morillas et al 2013 taikan and shinjiro 2006 yang et al 2012 however et which consists of evaporation from the water and soil surface transpiration through the stomata of plants and water intercepted by the plant canopy is recognized as one of the most challenging components in the hydrologic cycle to be measured and simulated due to its complicated dependence on numerous climatological variables physical soil properties and moisture conditions bhattarai et al 2018 mallick et al 2018b as well as the vegetation types tang et al 2010 generally the measurement of et can be achieved by using the lysimeter world meteorological organization 2008 eddy covariance ec system wilson et al 2002 and energy balance bowen ratio method bowen 1926 cook 2007 in fact at small scale e g within one square meter goss and ehlers 2009 the lysimeter is considered to be the most standard instrument without any assumptions among all the in situ measurement methods holmes 1984 seneviratne et al 2010 the ec and bowen ratio techniques have been used broadly cook 2007 wilson et al 2002 however the application of current eddy covariance and bowen ratio systems are more or less subject to the tower density gash 1987 wang et al 2010 limited durations and spatial coverage mao and wang 2017 and high requirement for surface homogeneity therefore alternative approaches for regional et simulation with larger footprint and lower cost are urgently required with significant advantages in capturing land surface information such as vegetation type and density at large scales satellite retrieval technique has received increasing attention in the scientific community during the past four decades numerous models based on satellite retrieval technique have been developed to estimate et over heterogeneous landscapes wang and dickinson 2012 the majority of satellite retrieval et models can be broadly categorized as 1 the empirical models e

retrieval et models are constructed with different simplifying assumptions formulas and constraints among the satellite retrieval et models the pm and pt models have advantages in time scale and time range zhang et al 2019 meanwhile by using penman monteith or priestly taylor equations and expressing the surface conductance as functions of remote sensed vegetation indices and concurrent meteorological conditions the pm and pt models in which almost all variables and parameters have clear physical meanings can estimate et directly bhattarai et al 2018 mallick et al 2014 2018b with more specific physical mechanism and lower requirement for surface temperature accuracy the pm and pt models are relatively easy to implement and thus have been used widely in hydrological ecological

studies have revealed that multiple input remote sensing datasets and algorithms are two of the many factors that cause the uncertainties in the modeled et estimates khan et al 2018 vinukollu et al 2011 for the pm and pt models the input products generally consist of radiation variables vegetation indices and meteorological observations yao et al 2013 for radiation related and meteorological variables conventional observations distribute irregularly in space and time while unconventional observations from satellites have inevitable accuracy issues to achieve a spatially complete and relatively accurate gridded dataset data assimilation system has been developed to integrate and optimize the data from satellite retrieval products with various sources and types of observations however there are still uncertainties in reanalysis products due to the limitations in model and analysis technique which in turn will induce propagation error into the simulation of actual et bengtsson and shukla 1988 rienecker et al 2011 in fact uncertainties exist widely in model mechanisms allen et al 2006 crago 1996 gavilán et al 2007 guo et al 2007 ortega farias et al 2004 wang et al 2006 and parameterization green et al 1984 lhomme 1997 shuttleworth and calder 1979 stannard 1993 model mechanism mainly refers to the fundamental equations on which the model is based component partitioning methods and ecophysiological constraints for model parameters the empirical coefficient α in pt type models and surface resistance r s in pm type models as well as the meteorological variables have been the focus of discussion in addition to data input and model calculation the uncertainty in the et estimation will also be induced in the process of model calibration and validation the standard often used for calibrating and validating coarse scale latent heat flux le is the observation data from the ec tower so far hundreds of eddy flux towers have come into service all over the world and are organized under the globe fluxnet initiative baldocchi et al 2001 nevertheless the ec method has its limitations the typical error of le measured by ec method is about 5 20 or 20 50 w m2 foken 2008 there are two problems that cannot be ignored when the data from the ec towers and the et modeled estimates are compared first the energy budget of the tower measurements is rarely closed resulting in non closure on the order of 20 to 30 second the towers sample over a limited fetch usually on the order of 100 1000 m depending on the tower height which restricts the scale of evaluation anderson et al 2003 twine et al 2000 vinukollu et al 2011 however it is noted that both the ideal and nonideal ec sites can provide information on physiological functioning temporal dynamics and response to the environment during the day baldocchi et al 2001 and that integrated annual measurements of et with lysimeters and watersheds show good agreement barr et al 2000 wilson and baldocchi 2000 therefore it is meaningful to use the le data from ec towers provided by fluxnet as the benchmark in the comparison of the results and uncertainties of different schemes in this study we examined the uncertainties in the procedure of et estimation based on the remote sensing models the estimated et from nine calculation schemes using three different remote sensing et models including the pt dtsr model the pm mod model and the pml model driven by three different meteorological reanalysis products were compared against the observations from eight ec towers table 1 the sobol sensitivity method was also used for understanding the model process and influential parameters in addition the energy budget mis closure problem in the ec method was detected by comparing the nine schemes with both energy balance uncorrected and corrected observations the mismatch problem in spatial scale was analyzed by comparing the schemes respectively forced by pixel scale reanalysis products and point scale ec tower observations comprehensive comparisons of various remote sensing based et methods and input datasets as well as quantification of their uncertainties should be valuable in terms of the selection of appropriate datasets and models for water management and for advancing the science of et modeling 2 data and methods 2 1 process based remote sensing evapotranspiration models three process based models including two penman monteith type models penman 1948 monteith 1965 i e pm mod model mu et al 2011 and pml model zhang et al 2010 and one priestley taylor type model i e pt dtsr model yao et al 2013 were used in this study with the consideration of the surface energy partitioning process and environment constraints mu et al 2011 applied the penman monteith equation to specific components moreover the pm mod model differs from other models in the sense that it considers the transpiration at night time and divides the soil surface into the saturated wet and moist surface another significant feature of the pm mod model is the parameterization of the resistance by using vapor pressure deficit vpd and temperature constraints to estimate the stomatal conductance and using leaf area index lai as a scalar to estimate canopy conductance from stomatal conductance compared with the pm mod model the pml model has simpler formulas for the canopy conductance g c and aerodynamic conductance g a leuning et al 2008 with only six parameters and ability to divide the canopy physiological processes and soil evaporation meanwhile combined with a calibrated fu model and gridded long term precipitation and runoff data to get the best estimate of the parameters the model was further developed by zhang et al 2010 for a finer temporal resolution and closure of the annual water balance however the pm type models require more meteorological variables than pt type models which limits their implementation the radiation based priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 is more empirical than the penman monteith equation and can be regarded as a simplified version of the penman equation as shown in the supplement method s1 s2 s3 among the three models used in our study the algorithm of the pm mod model is the most complex while the algorithm of the pt dtsr model is the simplest the pt dtsr model transfers potential et to actual et by constructing ecophysiological and soil condition constraints and replacing the atmospheric demand with an empirical coefficient α without calculating the aerodynamic and surface resistance based on the pt jpl model constructed by fisher et al 2008 yao et al 2013 modifies some of the constraint functions and reduces the input variables by replacing vpd or relative humidity rh with air temperature ta in the calculation of the soil moisture constraints therefore pt dtsr model has the least number of input variables among the three models and can keep the balance between the model availability and accuracy 2 2 data at eddy covariance sites the eddy covariance ec method is the standard method used widely to trace gas fluxes between ecosystem and atmosphere in this study we obtained data from fluxnet https fluxnet fluxdata org for meteorological variables and latent heat flux data the fluxnet is hosted by the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in the usa including ameriflux asiaflux euroflux ozflux and other members the datasets from fluxnet have been gapfilled using the multidimensional scaling mds method reichstein et al 2005 there are 8 flux sites in china covering five major terrestrial biomes mixed forests mf evergreen needleleaf forests enf evergreen broadleaf forests ebf wetlands wet and grasslands gra the names and locations of the ec towers and land cover types of china were presented in fig 1 and table 2 in order to estimate et at the point scale and evaluate the uncertainty of various meteorological factors from reanalysis datasets we extracted datasets from fluxnet for daily net radiation rn ta incoming shortwave radiation vpd rh and air pressure pres note that the le data mentioned in our study has energy budget mis closure problems for a necessary supplement we extracted the energy balance corrected version of le from the fluxnet which was named lecor in this paper based on the assumption that bowen ratio is correct the energy balance correction requires the measurements of sensible heat h and soil heat flux g due to the measurement limitation the lecor data are only available in cn cng and cn du2 from the 8 sites 2

models also need vegetation indices and land surface parameters we used the global land surface satellite glass datasets to achieve the albedo abd and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer

an 8 day temporal interval albedo used in our study is taken as the average of the white sky albedo wsa and black sky albedo bsa su et al 2007 moreover continuous lai and fpar datasets were generated from the mcd15a2 product at a 500 m spatial resolution and an 8 day temporal interval while continuous ndvi datasets were generated from the mod13a2 product at a 1 km spatial resolution and a 16 day

active archive center daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov search all the input data and the model simulations in this study were processed to a spatial resolution of 0 1 by the nearest neighbor interpolation method and a temporal resolution of 8 days by the arithmetical average method 2 4 the sobol sensitivity analysis in this study we adopted the method of sobol to calculate the sensitivity index si of the parameters in the pt dtsr model the pm mod model and the pml model the sobol method is based on the variance decomposition and can handle nonlinear and non monotonic functions and models sobol 2001 assume that a parameterized model can be represented by the following functional form 1 y f x θ where y is the output of the model θ is the parameter set and x is the forcing data of the model in the sobol method the total variance of function f can be decomposed into a summation of terms with increasing dimensionality 2 d y i 1 k d i i 1 k 1 j i 1 k d ij d 1 k where d i is the amount of variance due to the i th parameter θ i d ij is the amount of variance due to the interaction between the i th and j th parameter and k is the total number of parameters in this way the variance contributions to the total output variance of individual parameters and parameter interactions can be determined the final sensitivity effect is divided into a first order si s i and a total order si s ti 3 s i d i d 4 s ti s i j i s ij the first order index s i is a measure for the variance contribution of the individual parameter θ i to the total model variance while the impact on the model output variance of the main effect of θ i and all its interactions with the other parameters is given by s ti further details about the method are available in nossent et al 2011 and zhang et al 2013 2 5 statistical analysis in this study we quantified the mismatches between the model calculation results and the observation data from ec towers for goodness of fit metrics we used four indices including the coefficient of determination r2 bias bias w m2 root mean square error rmse w m2 and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kim et al 2018 li et al 2015 liu et al 2016 majozi et al 2017 ramoelo et al 2014 velpuri et al 2013 wang et al 2013 to indicate the uncertainties and errors in the simulations the r2 showed how much variation in the observations was explained by the model while the rmse indicated the difference between simulations and observations the kge was used to comprehensively evaluate the model performance by incorporating correlation variability error and bias error into a single multi objective criterion the details of the evaluation metrics are as follows 5 r 2 i 1 n s i s 2 g i g 2 i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n g i g 2 2 6 b i a s 1 n i 1 n s i g i 7 r m s e i 1 n s i g i 2 n 8 kge 1 e d 9 ed r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 10 α σ s σ 0 11 β μ s μ 0 where i means the i t h number of samples s i and g i represent 8 days satellite and ground based actual et datasets respectively n represents a total number of data pairs during the study periods s and g are the mean satellite and flux tower based et values ed is the euclidian distance from the ideal point μ0 and σ0 are the mean and standard deviation of the observations μs and σs are the mean and standard deviation of the simulations α is a measure of relative variability in the simulated and observed values and β is the ratio of the mean values of simulations and observations without any simulation errors the values of the three components should be r 1 α 1 and β 1 therefore the ideal kge value is 1 3 results 3 1 the sobol sensitivity analysis for the remote sensing et models a proper sample size is needed to calculate the sensitivity indices in this study we used a sample size of 12 000 to calculate the sensitivity indices for 20 key parameters in the three models which were listed in the table 3 compared with results from smaller sample sizes we found that this sample size is sufficient and the sensitivity indices are reliable due to the size of the paper the details are deferred to the supplementary material for readers who are interested in the details see fig s1 s3 fig 2 presents the values of first order si and total order si for model parameters it should be noted that sensitive parameters are defined with a 10 threshold of total order si zhang et al 2013 for the pt dtsr model the final outputs were sensitive to α and f wet as shown in fig 2 α had the highest first order sensitivity and total order sensitivity accounting for 52 59 and 64 44 of the total variance moreover the first order sensitivity and total order sensitivity values of f sm and f t were near zero indicating that the influence of themselves and their interaction with other parameters on the model outputs were negligible furthermore the total order sensitivity values of α f wet and f v were much higher than their first order sensitivity values suggesting that they had significant interactions with each other the metric variance was attributed to more parameters in the pm mod model there were three sensitive parameters including f c f wet and r a n i g h t that had great influence on the outputs the first order sensitivity values of five parameters including r h r c r a d a y r s d a y r s n i g h t and ras were near zero among the three parameters in the pml model g a and g s were highly sensitive to the modeled et accounting for 71 16 and 31 20 of the total variance respectively additionally parameter interactions contributed to a significant portion of the variation in all three models the parameters of all three models except f had significantly higher total order sensitivity than the first order sensitivity the results of the sobol sensitivity analysis revealed that highly sensitive parameters have very large influences on the model output the parameters in pm mod model have more complex interactions while pt dtsr model and pml model are mainly affected by their first order effects i e separated effects therefore accurately calculating or calibrating the highly sensitive model parameters will be helpful for reducing the uncertainty in et estimation 3 2 statistical analysis of the uncertainties in the modeled et at regional scales the modeled et was evaluated by the observations from ec towers the results of the nine calculation schemes differed greatly from each other at regional scale generally as illustrated in fig 3 the nine estimates explained 20 50 of et variability over all towers meanwhile the modeled seasonal curves of le plotted in fig 4 showed relatively good agreement with the observed ones the results of the pt dtsr model using data from merra showed the highest coefficient of determination r2 0 50 followed by the pt dtsr model using data from cmfd and era and the pm mod model using data from cmfd with r2 values ranging from 0 44 to 0 46 the results of the pm mod model using data from cmfd were the closest to the observed values with the lowest absolute value of bias bias 0 98 w m2 among all the calculation schemes moreover there was no significant difference in rmses of all calculation schemes with range from 26 52 to 35 84 w m2 by removing the seasonal mean of the time series fig s4 presents the interannual variability of the daily et estimated by different reanalysis products and different remote sensing models with the fluxcom product it can be found that different schemes reflected different trends in interannual variability the results indicated that pt dtsr model had a better agreement with the fluxcom product than the pm mod model and pml model and results of the pm mod model using data from era and merra fluctuated much more sharply than the other schemes for individual sites fig 5 shows that the pt dtsr model presented higher r2 and lower bias of le than the other models while the pml model presented lower r2 and higher bias these characteristics were particularly pronounced on median values although the rmses for all estimations were similar the pm mod model showed larger differences among sites implying that the performance of the pm mod model was more inconsistent than the pt dtsr and pml model over study sites the variation of the kge values was also very large especially for the pm mod model using data from cmfd with kge ranging from 0 50 to 0 90 overall the pm mod model using data from cmfd the pm mod model using data from era and the pt dtsr model using data from merra were the most reliable calculation schemes according to kge values it should be noted that uncertainties in et depend upon the complex association between input datasets and models previous researches only focused on the independent influence of the input data accuracy or model performance however as different reanalysis products have different deviations for specific meteorological variables and the most sensitive variables in specific models are also different the combination of the model and input product can greatly affect the accuracy of et estimation previous studies revealed a similar phenomenon in potential evapotranspiration pet estimation wang et al 2017 designed four different pet estimation approaches which grouped input variables and methods with different reliability together and found obvious differences in quantity therefore it is possible to optimize the model performance by choosing suitable data products 3 2 1 performance assessment of remote sensing et models the performance of the different algorithms was quantitatively evaluated as shown in table s1 for the pt dtsr pm mod and pml models respectively the mean r2 were 0 71 0 61 and 0 36 while the mean rmse were 29 33 28 47 and 29 34 w m2 suggesting that the pt dtsr model has an advantage in estimating the temporal variation of et and the pm mod model has an advantage over the quantity moreover the bias of daily et for the pt dtsr pm mod and pml models were 14 98 3 32 and 6 90 w m2 respectively implying that there was substantial variation in the quantity estimation of et among models it can be seen from fig 6 that without excluding the influence of input datasets the annual et estimated by the pm mod model was generally higher than that estimated by the pt dtsr model and lower than that estimated by the pml model for most sites according to the nine calculation schemes models play a major role in the estimation of et which has been documented in many other studies e g vinukollu et al 2011 for example yang et al 2018 compared three dual source remote sensing et models to gain a better understanding of differences in models similarly by comparing the pt dtsr pm mod and pml models our study explores in depth the cause of disagreements in the outputs of the models the differences in et simulation are primarily due to the model mechanism the fundamental difference of model mechanism mentioned here mainly refers to the difference between the priestley taylor equation and the penman monteith equation the pm type models are based on the penman monteith equation that takes the energy balance equation and aerodynamic methods as well as canopy and aerodynamic resistances into the algorithm while the priestley taylor equation can be considered a simplified version of the penman equation and avoids the calculation of the aerodynamic and surface resistance the pt type models replace the atmospheric demand with an empirical coefficient α whose sensitivity accounts for 64 44 of the total variance and convert the potential evapotranspiration pet to actual et with ecophysiological constraints and soil evaporation partitioning the absence of the aerodynamic and surface resistance may explain why the r2 and bias of the pt dtsr model are relatively less affected by the input products compared to the pm type models at all 8 sites fig 5 also the limitation of the empirical coefficient α and the ecophysiological constraints may account for the underestimate of et which have different performance over different land cover type fig s2 moreover the expressions of the key process variables also account for the uncertainty this point was verified by the comparison of the pm mod model and the pml model although being constructed under the same pm framework pm mod model and the pml model were differentiated by the aerodynamic and surface resistance parameterization methods the algorithms for g c and g a in pm mod model rely heavily on optimized leaf scale parameters and take et components in to consideration while pml model uses a biophysical model to calculate g c and assigns constant values for g a as shown in fig 2 the outputs of the pm mod model and pml model are highly sensitive to aerodynamic and surface resistance thus differences in simulated et calculated by the pm mod model and pml model can partly be attributed by aerodynamic and surface resistance parameterization methods furthermore various empirical methods that calculate the parameters related to cover fraction and ecophysiological constraints were used in different models cleugh et al 2007 fisher et al 2008 mu et al 2007 2011 yao et al 2013 for example the water cover fraction f wet can be estimated by different variables such as rh and diurnal temperature range in different forms of equations also formulas used to calculate the vegetation cover fraction f c have different structures and contain different variables such as fpar ndvi and the enhanced vegetation index the selection of empirical equations largely depends on the user s experience leading to complex uncertainties in the remote sensing et models due to the limitation of parameterization method zhang et al 2019 as well as the sample size and representativeness mu et al 2007 li et al 2017 parameters bring additional uncertainty into the models 3 2 2 evaluation of the uncertainty caused by different products fig 7 and table 4 present scatter plots of meteorological variables from remote sensing retrievals against that measured at 8 eddy flux towers these six variables including tmin ta tmax pres ssrd and rh are the common and most important meteorological variables that affect the accuracy in et estimation generally tmin ta tmax and pres from the three products were consistent with ground observations with r2 close to 1 low bias and low rmse meanwhile it can be seen in table 4 that all of the remote sensing retrieved ssrd correlated well with the site observations whereas the bias rmse value of 1 11 24 40 w m2 obtained from cmfd was significantly lower than that of 18 59 32 98 w m2 and 28 52 43 48 w m2 from era and merra respectively moreover the data of rh showed the highest uncertainty among all the variables with lowest values of r2 ranging from 0 005 to 0 09 table s1 presents the metrics of the comparisons for et for each tower though the indices varied from site to site the mean coefficients of determination for all sites were 0 66 0 53 and 0 46 for the data from cmfd era and merra respectively while the mean rmses were 28 58 27 79 and 30 76 w m2 respectively by comparing r2 and rmse we found that estimates using the data from cmfd can better reflect the et change patterns while that from era can better reflect the magnitude fig 4 shows the time traces of nine estimates of et which displays strong seasonality at most towers the estimates corresponded well with the observations in the winter times and showed a significant distinction in the summer times when plants are in their growing season the results derived from the same algorithm and different products indicated that uncertainty in input data has a great impact on the et estimation in both magnitude and temporal variation comparing meteorological variables from cmfd era and merra with the ground observations we found that all reanalysis products discussed in our study show great differences especially for ssrd and rh as shown in table 4 the bias of ssrd from three reanalysis products to the ec tower observations range from 1 11 to 28 52 w m2 and the rmse range from 24 40 to 43 48 w m2 while the r2 of rh range from 0 005 to 0 09 and the bias range from 4 00 to 12 55 in pm and pt type models meteorological factors are essential for et estimation for example the ssrd is related to the supply of energy that provides the latent heat of vaporization and rh directly affects the vpd that governs the transport of vapor penman 1948 therefore the uncertainties in meteorological products have an important effect on et estimation in both magnitude and temporal variation 3 3 evaluation of the uncertainties from eddy covariance towers although the uncertainty of observations from ec towers has been studied researchers have paid little attention to its impact on the et estimation in this study we further explored the two reasons originating from the ec towers that induced the uncertainties into the et estimation the fig 8 plots the r2 and rmse of et at two ec towers where the green lines represented the indices in comparison with lecor while the yellow lines represented the indices in comparison with le it can be seen that the modeled et agreed better with lecor with higher r2 nevertheless the differences in the r2 in term of lecor and le were not significant ranging from 0 008 to 0 064 it is hard to determine the effect of the energy balance closure correction because the average rmse of the lecor was 2 44 w m2 higher than that of le in addition the difference in the rmse in term of the lecor and le for cn cng was much higher than that for cn du2 another reason that induces uncertainty into ec tower observation is the mismatch of the scales often the input datasets that drive the remote sensing models are from regional products while the le data can only cover a point scale as shown in table 4 and fig 7 the values of meteorological variables from point scale and regional scale showed great disparities especially for rh here to avoid the calculation of aerodynamic and surface resistance the pt dtsr model was selected for analysis since it has fewer interferences from other factors than the other models by setting the most sensitive parameter α at 1 26 we forced the pt dtsr model separately by the regional scale reanalysis products and the point scale meteorological variables entirely from ec tower observations the performances of the et estimates are shown in fig 9 in general almost all sites had higher r2 and lower rmse when using point scale data at individual sites the indices of three regional schemes are similar while the indices of point scale scheme sometimes showed great difference with the indices of regional schemes we can thus conclude that the estimates driven completely by point scale meteorological variables agreed better with observations than that driven by regional datasets indicating that the scale mismatch is another source of the uncertainties in et estimation by analyzing the uncertainties arising from the ec towers we found that limitations in ec tower observations have great effect on the magnitude of et estimation therefore we recommend an evaluation of the ec flux measurements before its application the limitations of ec method also inevitably lead to the uncertainties in et estimation as observations from ec towers are often used as the standard in the calibration and validation of large scale et e g vinukollu et al 2011 park et al 2017ab twine et al 2000 on one hand the pixel to footprint mismatch would be a significant cause of uncertainty for instance the errors of the model estimates ranged between 5 and 15 when the sebs model was forced by the tower based inputs however when the sebs model was forced by reanalysis inputs the errors would increase significantly up to 40 su et al 2007 2005 in this study the pt dtsr model was chosen for comparison the differences between the results calculated by the meteorological data from ec towers and three products indicated that partial uncertainties in et estimation come from the mismatch of the ground observations and the input data fig 9 meanwhile as a bridge between large scale variables and station scale et remote sensing models bring parameter calibration mismatch into estimation as the inputs of the remote sensing et models are at regional scale while the parameters are calibrated to satisfy the point scale therefore et scaling beyond the ec footprint remains little known on the other hand uncertainties can also be attributed to the mis closure of energy balance with le data which is a long outstood issue foken et al 2006 michel et al 2016 twine et al 2000 the comparison of the lecor and le demonstrated that the energy balance mis closure problem has little impact on temporal variation while its impact on quantity depends on the construction conditions of the ec tower in addition many studies have shown that land cover type and regional climate condition have great impacts on the energy closure rate of the region foken 2008 mcafee 2013 wang et al 2015 wilson et al 2002 how to improve the ec method in consideration of the land cover type to achieve the closure of energy budget is still an open question 3 4 evaluation of the uncertainties in different land cover types fig 10 a presents the model performance associated with specific vegetation apparently the r2 of different models were obviously different when being applied to different land cover types ranging from 0 31 to 0 85 over 8 sites particularly the bias of mean daily et calculated by the pm mod model for forest grassland and wetland were 23 64 7 40 and 13 70 w m2 respectively suggesting that the pm mod model was highly sensitive to the land cover types moreover as indicated in fig 10a the rmse of daily et varied with land cover type for all three models therefore it can be concluded that model performance depends heavily on the land cover types over study area when remote sensing et model is applied to different land cover types over china especially when pm mod model is applied the selection of appropriate input products is of great importance for the simulation accuracy besides the products are sensitive to the land cover types as shown in fig 10b the metrics of various land cover types calculated using different products were quite different with the mean r2 for individual land cover types ranging from 0 52 grass land cover type to 0 72 wet land cover type and the mean bias of individual land cover types ranged from 13 70 w m2 wet land cover type to 9 32 w m2 grass land cover type hence in practice it is necessary to select appropriate input datasets according land cover types especially the forest cover climate and vegetation have long been considered as the important factors that affect the ecosystem evapotranspiration chen et al 2021 our results showed that all three models had strong correlations between the model performance and land cover type fig 10 and fig s5 which was consistent with previous studies for example khan et al 2018 evaluated the results of gleam gldas and mod16 over nine asiaflux sites representing forest rice paddy and grassland biomes and found large difference in the errors between low vegetation and tall canopies meanwhile it can be seen in fig s6 that all of the three models have higher uncertainties in plateau continental climate zone and the pm mod model is sensitive to climatic differences which overestimates et in subtropical monsoon climate zones and has better performance in temperate monsoon climate and temperate continental climate zones nevertheless our study has limitations in sample size more sites are needed when analyzing the response of et to specific vegetation type and climate zone 4 conclusions and discussions this paper explored the multiple sources of the uncertainties in actual et estimation over china based on three remote sensing et models three reanalysis products and flux tower observations nine calculation schemes using different models and input products were designed for quantifying the uncertainties induced by the meteorological forcing and the computational procedures used in remote sensing et models the comparisons among the nine calculation schemes revealed that estimates derived from different models and input datasets show great differences in both magnitude and temporal variation with the pt dtsr modeled et having a significant advantage in simulating the temporal variation and that the applicability of reanalysis products relies heavily on the model moreover the uncertainties caused by energy balance mis closure problems were analyzed by comparing the nine schemes with both energy balance uncorrected and corrected observations and mismatch in spatial scale difference was analyzed using meteorological variables from three reanalysis products and observations at ec towers noticeably the uncertainties induced by multiple sources have a clear association with the land cover type the uncertainties in et estimation were systematically investigated using ten schemes the findings can provide a useful reference for et model improvement and further help better understand the important role that evapotranspiration plays in the hydrological cycle however since the comparisons in this study were based on the 8 sites located in china our quantitative analyses are restricted to these regions and may not be applicable to other regions which are different from our study regions furthermore due to the limited product sources this paper did not analyze the uncertainties induced by vegetation indices whereas the sensitivity study performed by ferguson et al 2010 using the pm mod model has found that the final et estimates are affected more by the lai and fractional vegetation cover than climatic variables especially in humid basins moreover current comparisons are mainly performed based on the observations from the ec towers which only reflect the values of le at limited sites and days therefore the uncertainties associated with the model performance and product reliance were not thoroughly revealed despite the limitations our study can effectively provide directions for improving the accuracy of et estimation for instance developing a new parameterization method with more solid physiological theories and performing local calibration to reduce uncertainties in model parameterizations can be an effective way to improve the accuracy finally with the development of measurement instruments such as sap flow and lysimeter a deeper insight into the uncertainties in the et sub components are possible researches in future declaration of
