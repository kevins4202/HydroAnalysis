18820,in this study ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes uv aops including uv persulfate uv ps uv chlorine and uv h2o2 were employed to alleviate ultrafiltration membrane fouling during the treatment of algae laden water the results show that uv ps pretreatment exhibited the best performance on fouling control followed by the uv h2o2 pretreatment the fouling mitigation performance improved with the increase of oxidant dose however uv chlorine pretreatment aggravated membrane fouling and the irreversible fouling resistance increased by five times compared with that of raw water the dissolved organic carbon doc in the algae laden solution was reduced after uv ps pretreatment while either uv chlorine or uv h2o2 pretreatment had little influence on the doc of feed water uv ps and uv h2o2 pretreatments were effective in the degradation of fluorescent compounds thus reducing the deposition of organic matter on the membrane surface additionally the decreased concentration of hydrophobic organics algal cells and debris in feed water after uv ps pretreatment was also contributed to the fouling alleviation the aggravated irreversible fouling after uv chlorine pretreatment was probably ascribed to the increased accumulation of hydrophobic fractions in the membrane pores modeling result indicates that membrane fouling during the filtration of raw algae laden water was dominated by intermediate blocking and cake filtration mechanisms both uv ps and uv h2o2 pretreatments transformed the combined fouling mechanism into standard blocking while uv chlorine pretreatment aggravated the pore blocking in the initial filtration period graphical abstract image 1 keywords ultrafiltration uf membrane membrane fouling algae ultraviolet persulfate uv ps ultraviolet chlorine

burford et al 2007 guo 2007 yang et al 2008 algal cells which are stable in water because of the electrostatic repulsion surface hydrophilicity and steric effects have brought serious challenges to conventional drinking water treatment plants edzwald 1993 algae blooms can not only cause the dysfunction of water treatment processes but also can deteriorate the water quality with the formation of disinfection by products dbps as well as the release of intracellular toxins and odours in the subsequent disinfection process fang et al 2010 xie et al 2013 zamyadi et al 2013 ultrafiltration uf has been commonly considered as a reliable alternative for algae laden water treatment because of the complete rejection of the algal cells approximately 100 via size exclusion campinas and rosa 2010 kwon et al 2005 however membrane fouling produced by algal cells and their derived metabolites is a major obstacle for the widespread application of uf membrane liu et al 2017b ma et al 2018a with regard to algae related membrane fouling algal cells whose particle size is much larger than uf membrane pore size are usually associated with the formation of thick cake layer on the membrane surface whereas algae derived organic matters aom mainly induce gel layer formation and pore blocking since their size is close to the diameter of the membrane pores pivokonsky et al 2014 qu et al 2012 wei et al 2016a zhang et al 2013 to address algal related membrane fouling issues a variety of pretreatment processes prior to membrane filtration have been utilized in recent years in addition to coagulation and adsorption alizadeh tabatabai et al 2014 li et al 2014a zhang et al 2014 pre oxidation of feed water such as ozone and fe ii persulfate has been reported to be effective in minimizing fouling tendency by altering the structure of organic components and transforming them into smaller fragments liu et al 2018 wei et al 2016a 2016b however despite good performance in membrane fouling mitigation a higher concentration of ozone can lead to the breakage of algal cells as a result to releasing intracellular toxins and odorous compounds while fe ii persulfate pretreatment can increase the sludge production ascribed to the formation of ferric flocs tian et al 2018 xie et al 2013 2016 ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes uv aops have attracted worldwide attention due to their good ability in the degradation of various organic pollutants and the inactivation of microorganisms sichel et al 2011 sun et al 2018 xie et al 2015b yuan et al 2009 as two rapidly expanding advanced treatment processes of uv aops and uf membrane the combination of the two processes would be the shape of water purification to come recently several commonly seen uv aops including uv persulfate uv ps uv chlorine and uv h2o2 have been put forward to integrating with membrane filtration in view of their well established capability to control membrane fouling tian et al 2018 wang et al 2019 xing et al 2018 the formation of reactive radicals through the three uv aops are illustrated in eqs 1 3 the activation of ps and h2o2 by uv can produce sulfate radical so 4 and hydroxyl radical ho respectively xie et al 2015 yuan et al 2009 while the decomposition of chlorine by uv generates both ho and chlorine atom cl watts and linden 2007 previous researches have proven that uv radiation can effectively control the concentration of microorganism in the feed water and thereby reducing the bio fouling during the membrane filtration yu et al 2016 besides the formed reactive radicals such as s o 4 ho and cl in the uv aops can also degrade both micropollutant and natural organic matter nom in surface water which is also believed to alleviate membrane fouling during the subsequent filtration process varanasi et al 2018 wang et al 2019 xing et al 2018 for example our recent research finds that uv ps pretreatment was effective in the alleviation of membrane fouling caused by humic acid ha and sodium alginate sa wang et al 2019 it is also reported that uv chlorine pre oxidation of surface water could effectively retard irreversible fouling xing et al 2018 however aforementioned studies of uv aops pretreatment are mainly related to the mitigation of membrane fouling caused by nom while the performance of uv aops has not been reported as a pretreatment process for the control of algae derived uf membrane fouling it has been proven that uv aops are promising technologies for the inactivation and removal of microcystis aeruginosa jia et al 2018 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2016 moreover algal metabolites such as 2 methylisoborneol geosmin and microcystin lr which are difficult to be removed by uf membrane can be effectively degraded by uv aops suggesting that the released intracellular compounds would be further degraded during uv aops pretreatment ma et al 2018b xie et al 2015b zong et al 2013 therefore application of uv aops to treat algae laden water prior to uf might efficiently improve the performance of membrane separation which still needs to be clarified as the membrane fouling is seriously affected by the characteristics of algal cells and their derived organic compounds evaluating the variation of the characteristics of algae laden water during the treatment by uv aops is also meaningful in addition different uv aops may have different performances on the characteristics of water samples and membrane fouling alleviation therefore to disclose the impact of pretreatment by different uv aops on the following uf process is necessary

impacts on the mitigation of uf membrane fouling during the treatment of algae laden water microcystis aeruginosa a most commonly occurred and problematic algal species in fresh water was chosen to simulate the algae laden surface water the impacts of three uv aops pretreatment on the performance of membrane fouling alleviation were evaluated through the membrane flux decline fouling reversibility and model fitness then the possible mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation under different pretreatment processes was further explained based on the evaluation of feed water and the characterization of fouled membranes 2 methods and materials 2 1 materials and reagents microcystis aeruginosa was obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of science wuhan china

supplementary information si the water contact angle of the membrane surface was determined to be around 56 fig s3 indicating that the membrane surface was hydrophilic all the membranes were soaked in

pretreatment on membrane fouling 3 1 1 uv ps pretreatment the effect of uv ps pretreatment on membrane fouling is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1a raw algae laden water without pretreatment caused a serious flux decline with a final specific flux j j0 value at the end of the second filtration cycle of 0 26 for either uv radiation or ps alone a negligible influence was observed on the membrane flux decline in contrast the flux decline was significantly alleviated when uv ps pretreatment was applied for instance the performance improved with the increase of ps dose from 0 25 to 1 mm where the specific flux increased from 0 29 to 0 81 fig 1b shows the impact of uv ps pretreatment on the reversibility of membrane fouling the reversible and irreversible fouling resistance caused by raw algae laden water was 4 35 1012 and 0 59 1012 m 1 respectively and comparable reversible and irreversible membrane fouling resistance were also obtained during algae laden water treatment liu et al 2018 this result reveals that algae laden water caused much more reversible fouling than irreversible fouling due to the deposition of algal cells and macromolecular fraction of extracellular organic matter eom on the membrane surface qu et al 2012 when uv irradiation alone was applied the irreversible fouling was aggravated even though the total fouling resistance remained stable the result is similar to that of pre ozonation at low ozone dose prior to uf liu et al 2018 as intracellular organic matter iom and cell debris can cause much more serious irreversible fouling than algal cells liu et al 2017a the increase of irreversible fouling can be ascribed to the release of iom and the formation of cell debris induced by uv radiation when uv ps process was applied the reversible fouling was substantially alleviated for example the reversible fouling resistance was reduced to 1 18 1012 m 1 at 0 5 mm ps dose and was further reduced to 0 05 1012 m 1 at 1 mm ps dose this result indicates that uv ps pretreatment was effective in the control of membrane fouling caused by algae laden water and a similar result was also reported when the integrated process of uv ps pretreatment and uf membrane was used to treat surface water tian et al 2018 3 1 2 uv chlorine pretreatment as illustrated in fig 2 a pretreatment using chlorine alone had little influence on flux decline but decreased the restore efficiency of flux through hydraulic backwash which is similar to the result achieved after uv radiation alone however membrane fouling was aggravated after uv chlorine pretreatment with much worse flux recovery through hydraulic backwash it is worthy to mention that more sharply membrane flux reduction was observed at the initial filtration stage with the increased chlorine dose in addition fig 2b also shows that uv chlorine pretreatment increased the irreversible fouling resistance and higher chlorine dose resulted in greater irreversible fouling resistance for instance the irreversible fouling resistance was 3 04 1012 m 1 when the uv chlorine pretreatment was applied at 1 mm chlorine dose which was about five times higher than that of raw water a previous study found that uv chlorine process with low chlorine dose 4 mg l was effective to retard irreversible membrane fouling caused by nom in surface water xing et al 2018 which is different to the result of this study thus we also evaluated the variation of membrane fouling after uv chlorine pretreatment at low chlorine dose as observed in fig s5 a negligible variation of membrane flux decline was observed when the chlorine dose range was 1 4 mg l also the irreversible resistance performed a small increasing trend with the increase of chlorine dose this result confirms that the discrepant fouling result here after uv chlorine pretreatment is not attributed to the different chlorine dose the components and characteristics of algae and their derived organic matter are quite different from nom liu et al 2017a xing et al 2018 which is expected to account for the different achievements here from the previous publication 3 1 3 uv h2o2 pretreatment fig 3 shows the effect of uv h2o2 pretreatment on membrane flux decline and fouling reversibility pretreatment using h2o2 alone had undetectable effect on membrane flux decline and similar phenomenon was also observed when uv h2o2 pretreatment was applied with the h2o2 dose less than 0 5 mm fig 3a however when the concentration of h2o2 was elevated to 1 mm the membrane flux decline was improved with the final specific flux of 0 38 as shown in fig 3b significant decrease of fouling resistance could be only achieved at the highest h2o2 dose 1 mm when uv h2o2 was applied where the reversible resistance was 3 04 1012 m 1 these results indicate that uv h2o2 pretreatment could improve the membrane flux and reduce the fouling resistance only at high h2o2 dose combining the results shown in figs 1 3 it is concluded that uv ps pretreatment performed much better ability than the pretreatment processes of uv chlorine and uv h2o2 in the alleviation of membrane fouling when treating algae laden water the performance of membrane fouling mitigation showed an apparent regularity of uv ps uv h2o2 uv chlorine 3 2 characterization of feed water 3 2 1 doc as shown in fig 4 the effect of different pretreatment processes on the removal of doc during algae laden water treatment was investigated with respect to raw water the doc of feed and permeate were 7 89 and 0 96 mg l respectively with the removal rate of 87 2 by membrane separation uv radiation alone slightly increased the doc of feed to 8 4 mg l which might be due to the breakage of algal cells and the release of iom wang et al 2016 when uv ps pretreatment was applied at a ps dose of 0 25 mm the doc of permeate increased to 4 54 mg l causing that the removal rate of doc decreased to around 50 this result is in accordance with some previous studies focusing on the treatment of eom and nom cheng et al 2016 wei et al 2016b the decreased doc removal can be explained by the transformation of organic compounds from high molecular weight mw into low mw during uv ps pretreatment with the further increase of ps dose to 1 mm the doc of feed and permeate gradually decreased to 2 14 and 1 23 mg l respectively implying that uv ps can partly mineralize aom tian et al 2018 wang et al 2016 therefore the breakage and partial mineralization of aom by uv ps pretreatment were supposed to contribute to the fouling alleviation the result also suggests that although uv ps pretreatment had a potential to increase the dissolved aom in the permeate and lowered the separation efficiency of uf membrane it can be compensated by the increase of ps dose as shown in fig 4b either chlorine alone or uv chlorine pretreatment slightly increased the doc of feed water indicating the breakage of algal cells also occurred it is noteworthy that doc of permeate significantly increased after uv chlorine pretreatment resulting in poor performance of doc rejection additionally increasing chlorine dose in uv chlorine pretreatment elevated the doc concentration of permeate which is different from the result achieved in uv ps pretreatment fig 4a for example the doc of permeate increased from 2 29 to 6 42 mg l with increasing chlorine dose from 0 to 1 mm these results suggest that uv chlorine process could only break down the large organic matters into smaller ones without further mineralization as for the uv h2o2 process the doc of permeate slightly increased with the increase of h2o2 dose there is a research reporting that uv h2o2 pretreatment significantly reduce the doc of aom due to the high mineralization ability of hydroxyl radical zhang et al 2015 however either uv radiation or hydroxyl radical oxidation can lyse algal cells resulting in the release of dissolved iom jia et al 2018 thus the increase of doc in the feed water can be explained by the breakage of algal cells and formation of debris during uv h2o2 pretreatment 3 2 2 fluorescent components fig 5 shows the effects of different pretreatment processes on fluorescence eem spectra of algae laden water because chlorine could fast destruct the fluorescent functional groups in aom the eem spectra of feed water after uv chlorine pretreatment is not shown here fang et al 2010a according to the method proposed by chen et al eem spectra can be divided into five regions chen et al 2003 region i ex em 200 250 280 330 nm and region ii ex em 200 250 330 380 nm represent the aromatic protein region iii ex em 200 250 380 540 nm corresponds to the fluvic acid like components region iv ex em 250 400 280 380 nm is associated with the soluble microbial by product like components and region v ex em 250 400 380 540 nm is related to the humic acid like components the eem spectrum volumes of five regions were calculated and shown in table s1 as illustrated in fig 5 untreated algae laden water showed four peaks in region i iv and v indicating that aom contained humic like protein like and dissolved microbial compounds cheng et al 2018 wei et al 2016b when uv radiation was applied eem spectrum volumes of region i and iv were reduced by 51 and 26 respectively which could be ascribed to the structure change of protein like substance wang et al 2019 additionally the fluorescence intensity of region iii and v approximately increased by 50 and 52 respectively after uv radiation this result could be attributed to the release of iom from broken cells and the transformation of high mw protein like components to low mw humic acid like and fluvic acid like components cheng et al 2018 wang et al 2016 it has been demonstrated that humic like substances can cause serious irreversible membrane fouling katsoufidou et al 2008 thus the aggravated irreversible membrane fouling after uv radiation was primarily due to the increase of the humic like components in the feed water when uv ps pretreatment was applied the peak intensities of region iii and v gradually decreased with the increase of ps dose wang et al 2016 it is worthy to note that membrane flux decline in fig 1a showed inconspicuous variation when uv ps pretreatment was applied at 0 25 mm ps dose even though the peak intensities in region iii and v had significant reduction fig 5c this phenomenon suggests that algal cells and debris still dominated the membrane fouling when uv ps was applied to pretreat algae laden water at higher ps dose 0 5 mm and 1 mm the algal cells and debris could be further broken into smaller components resulting in the membrane fouling alleviation when uv h2o2 pretreatment was applied at an h2o2 dose lower than 0 5 mm the fluorescence intensities of region iii and v were slightly reduced compared to that of single uv radiation indicating the decreased concentration of the humic like substances in the feed water this result is in line with the slight alleviation of irreversible membrane fouling after uv h2o2 pretreatment fig 3b however undetectable difference in the membrane flux decline was observed when the h2o2 dose ranged from 0 to 0 5 mm which could be also interpreted by that the algal cells and debris played the predominant roles in membrane fouling when the h2o2 dose increased to 1 mm the peak intensities of region iii and v significantly decreased suggesting the humic like substances could be further oxidized by uv h2o2 pretreatment furthermore the mitigated membrane flux decline shown in fig 3a revealed that the breakage of algal cells and debris into smaller substances also occurred it has been demonstrated that the mitigation of membrane fouling associated with feed water pretreatment is primarily attributed to the decreased deposition of organics on the membrane surface and the structural change of organic matter in the feed water huang et al 2009 wei et al 2016b zhang et al 2015 in this study uv ps pretreatment achieved a significant reduction of doc fig 4a implying the reduced deposition of foulant on the membrane surface besides the structure change of aom in feed water also played an important role in fouling alleviation as fluorescence of aom significantly decreased after pretreatment with regard to uv h2o2 pretreatment the fluorescence of aom showed a significant reduction while a negligible variation of doc was observed after pretreatment this result indicates that the retarded fouling after uv h2o2 pretreatment was mainly attributed to the change of aom characteristics in the feed water 3 2 3 hydrophilicity the variations of aom hydrophilicity with different pretreatment processes were also investigated and shown in fig 6 it is always considered that uf membrane primarily rejects the hpo fractions of the aom while the hpi organic compounds mainly cause irreversible membrane fouling tian et al 2018 wei et al 2016b the hpi tpi and hpo fractions in terms of doc concentration in untreated water were 0 96 1 82 and 6 49 mg l respectively which is consistent with the previous finding that hpo fraction was the dominant fraction in aom wei et al 2016a for single uv radiation the hpi fraction increased which might be due to the release of the hydrophilic humic like substances li et al 2012 this result is consistent with the slight increase of irreversible fouling after uv radiation when uv ps pretreatment was applied the hpo fraction significantly decreased and the hpi fraction was the dominant fraction in the feed water indicating that the significant improvement of membrane flux decline was partly ascribed to the removal of hpo fraction fig 1a based on eq 1 lots of so 4 formed in the uv ps system and were the dominant oxidants which could fast destruct organic compounds and cause the formation of lots hydrophilic functional groups as a result to the increase of the low mw hpi fraction tian et al 2018 it should be noted that uv ps pretreatment had limited ability to alleviate hydraulically irreversible fouling fig 1b potential reasons for this phenomenon would be as follows 1 uv ps pretreatment produced more low mw hpi compounds fig 6 which progressively accumulated in the membrane pores 2 a dense cake layer formed on the membrane surface due to the deposition of hpo fractions algal cells and debris during the filtration of untreated algae laden water and this cake layer served as an additional physical filter and increased the rejection of hpi fraction uv ps pretreatment significantly reduced the cake layer on the membrane surface which enhanced the interaction between the hpi fraction and membrane and thus allowing more hpi fractions to enter membrane pores with respect to uv chlorine pretreatment the hydrophilicity of feed water did not have apparent variation and the hpo was still the dominant fraction from the result of doc analysis uv chlorine pretreatment could reduce the mw of the organic matter in the feed water xing et al 2018 the activation of chlorine by uv can form both ho and cl eq 2 which are strong oxidants the oxidation of aom by ho and cl would form some hpi fraction sarathy and mohseni 2010 however chlorine also has high reactivity with lots of aom which is different from ps fang et al 2010b when chlorine reacts with aom there are three reaction processes including oxidation substitution and addition fang et al 2010a both substitution and addition reactions can form many halo generated organic fractions with low mw as the halo generated organic fractions usually contain strong hydrophobicity the direct reaction between chlorine and aom might increase the hpo fractions which might compensate for the decrease of hpo fractions by the reaction between aom and the formed ho and cl then the final observation is that the hydrophilicity of feed water did not have apparent variation after uv chlorine pretreatment as the low mw hpo fraction form through the direct reaction between chlorine and aom might accumulate in the membrane pores during filtration resulting in the membrane pore narrowing and blocking it is widely recognized that foulants deposited into the membrane pores are usually hard removed by hydraulic backwash cheng et al 2016 wang et al 2019 thus the irreversible membrane fouling caused by algae laden water was aggravated after uv chlorine pretreatment fig 2 when uv h2o2 pretreatment was applied the variation of hydrophilicity was similar to that of uv chlorine pretreatment however the fouling results were different the improved membrane performance after uv h2o2 pretreatment was probably due to the trade off effect on the one hand the hpo fraction could be changed from high mw into low mw which resulted in the pore blocking but the mw decrease of hpo fraction after uv h2o2 pretreatment was not as obvious as that of water sample pretreated by uv chlorine since the doc of permeate only showed a slight increase fig 4c on the other hand the structure of organics was significantly changed after uv h2o2 pretreatment fig 5 which reduced the formation of cake gel layer on the membrane surface and mitigated membrane fouling therefore it can be inferred that the negative influence on membrane fouling was offset by the positive influence resulting in the fouling alleviation 3 2 4 flow cytometry analysis fig 7 presents the flow cytometry result of microcystis cells after pretreatment by different uv aops in these figures cells region represents the integrated and damaged algal cells while the debris region corresponds to the algal debris liu et al 2015 wilkinson 2018 the total concentration of algal cells and debris in feed water after different pretreatment processes was also calculated and shown in table s2 in fig 7a the ratio of algal cells and debris were 59 and 34 3 respectively in raw algae laden water without pre oxidation uv radiation showed inconspicuous influence on the algae concentration which is in accordance with the aforementioned conclusion that uv radiation played little role in fouling control however the ratio of algal cells significantly decreased to 23 5 when uv ps pretreatment was applied in addition table s2 shows that the total number of algal cells and debris decreased significantly after uv ps pretreatment these results further prove that reactive substances such as so 4 and ho produced in the uv ps process could effectively damage the algal cells and form cell debris wang et al 2016 supporting the speculation that mitigation of membrane fouling after uv ps pretreatment was attributed to the degradation of aom as well as the partial conversion of algal cells and debris into smaller substances although uv chlorine pretreatment had little influence on the ratio of cells and debris fig 7d the concentration of algal cells and debris showed a significant reduction table s2 this result proves that aggravated membrane fouling after uv chlorine pretreatment was primarily attributed to the pore blocking caused by low mw hpo fraction rather than the cake filtration caused by algal cells and debris with respect to uv h2o2 pretreatment the concentration of algal cells and debris slightly decreased which is in line with the slight alleviation of membrane fouling after pretreatment fig 3 some previous studies reported that algal cells and debris were always associated with the formation of cake layer whereas aom including humic like substances polysaccharides and proteins usually formed cake gel layer babel and takizawa 2010 li et al 2014b qu et al 2012 our previous research verified that membrane fouling caused by the mixture of humic acid ha sodium alginate sa and bovine serum albumin bsa could be effectively controlled when uv ps pretreatment was applied wang et al 2019 herein it can be inferred that cake gel layer formed by aom could be effectively removed by uv ps pretreatment this result could also be obtained from the analysis of fluorescent eem fig 5c e therefore membrane fouling was primarily attributed to the cake layer filtration caused by algal cells and debris when uv ps was used at a higher ps dose such as 0 5 mm and 1 mm fig 7c similar phenomenon also occurred when uv h2o2 pretreatment was applied at higher h2o2 dose 1 mm since the concentration of algal cells and debris showed slight reduction fig 7e although the intensities of fluorescence eem were significantly decreased fig 5f h in addition the surface morphologies of algal cells were observed to study the impacts of uv aops pretreatment on cell integrity as shown in fig s6 the algal cells without pretreatment showed a smooth cell membrane while uv radiation deformed the algal cells after pretreatment by either uv ps or uv chlorine the algal cells were severe damaged with completely losing the cellular structure as for uv h2o2 pretreatment the algal cell was also seriously damaged although it can still keep its shape this result further indicated the damage of algal cells by uv aops 3 3 characterization of membrane surface 3 3 1 ftir the influences of different pretreatment processes on the variation of functional groups on the surface of pristine and fouled membranes were compared using atr ftir fig 8 after the filtration of algae laden water strong absorbance at around 3280 2925 1535 1392 and 1027 cm 1 could be noticed the broad absorbance band centered at 3280 cm 1 was assigned to o h stretching vibrations and stretch at 2925 cm 1 was associated with the c h corresponding to the characteristics of polysaccharides zhou et al 2014 the peak related to the n h stretching vibration amide ii was also noticed at 1535 cm 1 indicating the deposition of the protein like substances on the membrane surface tian et al 2018 zhang et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 this result is consistent with the result of fluorescent eem spectra that the appearance of protein like substances in aom fig 5 furthermore the broad band around 1040 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of carboxylate group c o c revealing the deposition of polysaccharide like substances chiou et al 2010 a negligible difference of peaks intensities was observed when the water sample was pretreated by uv radiation alone while a slight decrease of the intensities was achieved when uv h2o2 pretreatment was used however the peaks intensities dramatically decreased when uv ps pretreatment was applied this result indicates that polysaccharide like substances and protein like substances were oxidized and a thinner cake gel layer formed on the membrane surface after pretreatment which could explain the fouling mitigation shown in fig 1 wang et al 2019 a similar result was also observed when uv chlorine pretreatment was used suggesting that uv chlorine could also reduce the deposition of foulants on the membrane surface this result further proves that the more serious membrane fouling after uv chlorine was due to the irreversible pore blocking rather than the deposition of foulants on the membrane surface figs 2 and 6 3 3 2 sem sem images of pristine and fouled membranes are offered in fig 9 to help study the variation of membrane fouling after pretreatment by different uv aops the sem image of the virgin membrane clearly shows the smooth membrane surface without any foulants in the presence of untreated algae laden water algal cells and agglomerates covered on the membrane surface to form a dense and compact cake layer this result suggests that membrane fouling caused by algae laden water was attributed to the dense cake layer formed by algal cells and aom which was external fouling and easily removed by hydraulic backwash liu et al 2017a for single uv radiation fig 9c algal cells with much fewer agglomerates could be observed on the membrane surface when uv h2o2 process was applied fig 9f the algal cells were partly deformed and more debris appeared on the membrane surface indicating the breakage of algal cells when the feed water was subjected to the uv ps pretreatment the number of algal cells on the membrane surface significantly decreased and a relatively porous cake layer formed on the membrane surface which further confirms that the membrane fouling alleviation by uv ps pretreatment was ascribed to the control of cake gel filtration this is in accordance with the result of flow cytometry analysis with respect to uv chlorine pretreatment a relatively loose cake layer formed on the membrane surface which is correlated with the ftir result fig 8 further supporting that pore blocking rather than cake filtration dominated the membrane fouling 3 4 effect of pretreatment by uv aops on membrane fouling mechanisms to obtain a better comprehending of the fouling mitigation mechanism the experimental results were plotted as d2 t dv 2 against dt dv following eq 6 the variation of the n value indicates the change of the dominant mechanism furthermore the permeate volume versus dt dv was also plotted in fig 10 to obtain the approximate filtration volume where the fouling mechanism changed as shown in fig 10 membrane fouling caused by algae laden water without pretreatment was governed by intermediate blocking and cake filtration with the n value of 1 147 and 0 057 respectively the conversion of the fouling mechanism occurred at the filtration volume of 110 ml this result could be ascribed to the initial pore blocking caused by aom followed by the cake filtration derived from algal cells and debris liu et al 2018 when uv ps pretreatment was applied fouling mechanism during the entire filtration cycle was governed by pore blocking the algal cells were cracked into debris and aom was transformed into smaller organic compounds during uv ps pretreatment which resulted in the less deposition of foulants on the membrane surface and reduced the role of cake filtration this is consistent with the flow cytometry analysis and sem result figs 7 and 9 additionally this result also evidences that irreversible membrane fouling occupied a dominant position when uv ps was applied at a ps dose of 1 mm fig 1b when uv chlorine pretreatment was used the fouling mechanism also changed during filtration in the initial stage the fouling was primarily governed by standard blocking with the n value of 0 686 while for the followed filtration stage the n value was 0 237 which could not be interpreted by any of the classical fouling models many researchers claimed that the variation of n value from the positive to negative could be ascribed to the transition of filtration mechanism to cake filtration as the negative slopes always appeared after d2 t dv 2 increased to a peak followed by a zero slope byun et al 2011 cheng et al 2018 lee et al 2013 it should be noted that the transition of the fouling mechanism could be observed with the filtration volume of around 70 ml the volume required for the transition i e transition volume was reduced after uv chlorine pretreatment compared with the untreated water sample implying that the pretreatment brought forward the transformation of the fouling mechanism cheng et al 2018 pore blocking was more severe than that of untreated algae laden water since the low mw hpo fractions could enter membrane pores more easily which resulted in the earlier conversion of fouling mechanism from pore blocking to cake filtration this result is consistent with the aggravated membrane flux decline in the initial filtration period after uv chlorine pretreatment fig 2a as for uv h2o2 pretreatment the pore blocking mechanism governed the membrane fouling throughout the whole filtration cycle in the absence of the cake filtration the effect of uv aops pretreatment on membrane fouling mechanism during algae laden water treatment is illustrated in fig 11 4 conclusion in this study pretreatment of algae laden water by uv ps uv h2o2 and uv chlorine on the variation of characteristics and the alleviation of membrane fouling were investigated uv ps pretreatment effectively improved membrane flux and reduced reversible membrane fouling which was much more efficient than uv h2o2 pretreatment while uv chlorine pretreatment resulted in more serious irreversible fouling during the uv ps pretreatment oxidation of algal cells and aom can effectively decrease the doc fluorescent components and hpo fractions in feed water which was expected to account for the alleviation of membrane fouling although uv h2o2 pretreatment can break down algal cells and reduce the fluorescent components in feed water the reduction of doc and hpo fraction after uv h2o2 pretreatment was less than that of uv ps pretreatment thereby causing a lower efficiency of uv h2o2 pretreatment on fouling control uv chlorine pretreatment could form lots of low mw hpo compounds which progressively accumulated in membrane pores and aggravated irreversible membrane fouling model fitting indicates that membrane fouling caused by algae laden water without pretreatment was governed by intermediate blocking and cake filtration uv ps and uv h2o2 pretreatment changed the dominant mechanism into standard blocking and intermediate blocking respectively however a more severe pore blocking occurred after uv chlorine pretreatment this study suggests that pretreatment of algae laden water using uv ps is more effective to control the uf membrane fouling than that of uv h2o2 or uv chlorine additionally it should be concerned that the application of uv ps pretreatment might lower the efficiency of uf membrane and increase the doc in permeate when treating algae laden water due to the release of aom with small mw however uv ps pretreatment might be still a good choice in the combination of uf membrane filtration as some released aom can be further removed by the increase of ps dose acknowledgment this research was supported by the natural science foundation of china grant

18820,in this study ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes uv aops including uv persulfate uv ps uv chlorine and uv h2o2 were employed to alleviate ultrafiltration membrane fouling during the treatment of algae laden water the results show that uv ps pretreatment exhibited the best performance on fouling control followed by the uv h2o2 pretreatment the fouling mitigation performance improved with the increase of oxidant dose however uv chlorine pretreatment aggravated membrane fouling and the irreversible fouling resistance increased by five times compared with that of raw water the dissolved organic carbon doc in the algae laden solution was reduced after uv ps pretreatment while either uv chlorine or uv h2o2 pretreatment had little influence on the doc of feed water uv ps and uv h2o2 pretreatments were effective in the degradation of fluorescent compounds thus reducing the deposition of organic matter on the membrane surface additionally the decreased concentration of hydrophobic organics algal cells and debris in feed water after uv ps pretreatment was also contributed to the fouling alleviation the aggravated irreversible fouling after uv chlorine pretreatment was probably ascribed to the increased accumulation of hydrophobic fractions in the membrane pores modeling result indicates that membrane fouling during the filtration of raw algae laden water was dominated by intermediate blocking and cake filtration mechanisms both uv ps and uv h2o2 pretreatments transformed the combined fouling mechanism into standard blocking while uv chlorine pretreatment aggravated the pore blocking in the initial filtration period graphical abstract image 1 keywords ultrafiltration uf membrane membrane fouling algae ultraviolet persulfate uv ps ultraviolet chlorine

burford et al 2007 guo 2007 yang et al 2008 algal cells which are stable in water because of the electrostatic repulsion surface hydrophilicity and steric effects have brought serious challenges to conventional drinking water treatment plants edzwald 1993 algae blooms can not only cause the dysfunction of water treatment processes but also can deteriorate the water quality with the formation of disinfection by products dbps as well as the release of intracellular toxins and odours in the subsequent disinfection process fang et al 2010 xie et al 2013 zamyadi et al 2013 ultrafiltration uf has been commonly considered as a reliable alternative for algae laden water treatment because of the complete rejection of the algal cells approximately 100 via size exclusion campinas and rosa 2010 kwon et al 2005 however membrane fouling produced by algal cells and their derived metabolites is a major obstacle for the widespread application of uf membrane liu et al 2017b ma et al 2018a with regard to algae related membrane fouling algal cells whose particle size is much larger than uf membrane pore size are usually associated with the formation of thick cake layer on the membrane surface whereas algae derived organic matters aom mainly induce gel layer formation and pore blocking since their size is close to the diameter of the membrane pores pivokonsky et al 2014 qu et al 2012 wei et al 2016a zhang et al 2013 to address algal related membrane fouling issues a variety of pretreatment processes prior to membrane filtration have been utilized in recent years in addition to coagulation and adsorption alizadeh tabatabai et al 2014 li et al 2014a zhang et al 2014 pre oxidation of feed water such as ozone and fe ii persulfate has been reported to be effective in minimizing fouling tendency by altering the structure of organic components and transforming them into smaller fragments liu et al 2018 wei et al 2016a 2016b however despite good performance in membrane fouling mitigation a higher concentration of ozone can lead to the breakage of algal cells as a result to releasing intracellular toxins and odorous compounds while fe ii persulfate pretreatment can increase the sludge production ascribed to the formation of ferric flocs tian et al 2018 xie et al 2013 2016 ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes uv aops have attracted worldwide attention due to their good ability in the degradation of various organic pollutants and the inactivation of microorganisms sichel et al 2011 sun et al 2018 xie et al 2015b yuan et al 2009 as two rapidly expanding advanced treatment processes of uv aops and uf membrane the combination of the two processes would be the shape of water purification to come recently several commonly seen uv aops including uv persulfate uv ps uv chlorine and uv h2o2 have been put forward to integrating with membrane filtration in view of their well established capability to control membrane fouling tian et al 2018 wang et al 2019 xing et al 2018 the formation of reactive radicals through the three uv aops are illustrated in eqs 1 3 the activation of ps and h2o2 by uv can produce sulfate radical so 4 and hydroxyl radical ho respectively xie et al 2015 yuan et al 2009 while the decomposition of chlorine by uv generates both ho and chlorine atom cl watts and linden 2007 previous researches have proven that uv radiation can effectively control the concentration of microorganism in the feed water and thereby reducing the bio fouling during the membrane filtration yu et al 2016 besides the formed reactive radicals such as s o 4 ho and cl in the uv aops can also degrade both micropollutant and natural organic matter nom in surface water which is also believed to alleviate membrane fouling during the subsequent filtration process varanasi et al 2018 wang et al 2019 xing et al 2018 for example our recent research finds that uv ps pretreatment was effective in the alleviation of membrane fouling caused by humic acid ha and sodium alginate sa wang et al 2019 it is also reported that uv chlorine pre oxidation of surface water could effectively retard irreversible fouling xing et al 2018 however aforementioned studies of uv aops pretreatment are mainly related to the mitigation of membrane fouling caused by nom while the performance of uv aops has not been reported as a pretreatment process for the control of algae derived uf membrane fouling it has been proven that uv aops are promising technologies for the inactivation and removal of microcystis aeruginosa jia et al 2018 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2016 moreover algal metabolites such as 2 methylisoborneol geosmin and microcystin lr which are difficult to be removed by uf membrane can be effectively degraded by uv aops suggesting that the released intracellular compounds would be further degraded during uv aops pretreatment ma et al 2018b xie et al 2015b zong et al 2013 therefore application of uv aops to treat algae laden water prior to uf might efficiently improve the performance of membrane separation which still needs to be clarified as the membrane fouling is seriously affected by the characteristics of algal cells and their derived organic compounds evaluating the variation of the characteristics of algae laden water during the treatment by uv aops is also meaningful in addition different uv aops may have different performances on the characteristics of water samples and membrane fouling alleviation therefore to disclose the impact of pretreatment by different uv aops on the following uf process is necessary

simulate the algae laden surface water the impacts of three uv aops pretreatment on the performance of membrane fouling alleviation were evaluated through the membrane flux decline fouling reversibility and model fitness then the possible mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation under different pretreatment processes was further explained based on the evaluation of feed water and the characterization of fouled membranes 2 methods and materials 2 1 materials and reagents microcystis aeruginosa was obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of science wuhan china

pretreatment on membrane fouling 3 1 1 uv ps pretreatment the effect of uv ps pretreatment on membrane fouling is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1a raw algae laden water without pretreatment caused a serious flux decline with a final specific flux j j0 value at the end of the second filtration cycle of 0 26 for either uv radiation or ps alone a negligible influence was observed on the membrane flux decline in contrast the flux decline was significantly alleviated when uv ps pretreatment was applied for instance the performance improved with the increase of ps dose from 0 25 to 1 mm where the specific flux increased from 0 29 to 0 81 fig 1b shows the impact of uv ps pretreatment on the reversibility of membrane fouling the reversible and irreversible fouling resistance caused by raw algae laden water was 4 35 1012 and 0 59 1012 m 1 respectively and comparable reversible and irreversible membrane fouling resistance were also obtained during algae laden water treatment liu et al 2018 this result reveals that algae laden water caused much more reversible fouling than irreversible fouling due to the deposition of algal cells and macromolecular fraction of extracellular organic matter eom on the membrane surface qu et al 2012 when uv irradiation alone was applied the irreversible fouling was aggravated even though the total fouling resistance remained stable the result is similar to that of pre ozonation at low ozone dose prior to uf liu et al 2018 as intracellular organic matter iom and cell debris can cause much more serious irreversible fouling than algal cells liu et al 2017a the increase of irreversible fouling can be ascribed to the release of iom and the formation of cell debris induced by uv radiation when uv ps process was applied the reversible fouling was substantially alleviated for example the reversible fouling resistance was reduced to 1 18 1012 m 1 at 0 5 mm ps dose and was further reduced to 0 05 1012 m 1 at 1 mm ps dose this result indicates that uv ps pretreatment was effective in the control of membrane fouling caused by algae laden water and a similar result was also reported when the integrated process of uv ps pretreatment and uf membrane was used to treat surface water tian et al 2018 3 1 2 uv chlorine pretreatment as illustrated in fig 2 a pretreatment using chlorine alone had little influence on flux decline but decreased the restore efficiency of flux through hydraulic backwash which is similar to the result achieved after uv radiation alone however membrane fouling was aggravated after uv chlorine pretreatment with much worse flux recovery through hydraulic backwash it is worthy to mention that more sharply membrane flux reduction was observed at the initial filtration stage with the increased chlorine dose in addition fig 2b also shows that uv chlorine pretreatment increased the irreversible fouling resistance and higher chlorine dose resulted in greater irreversible fouling resistance for instance the irreversible fouling resistance was 3 04 1012 m 1 when the uv chlorine pretreatment was applied at 1 mm chlorine dose which was about five times higher than that of raw water a previous study found that uv chlorine process with low chlorine dose 4 mg l was effective to retard irreversible membrane fouling caused by nom in surface water xing et al 2018 which is different to the result of this study thus we also evaluated the variation of membrane fouling after uv chlorine pretreatment at low chlorine dose as observed in fig s5 a negligible variation of membrane flux decline was observed when the chlorine dose range was 1 4 mg l also the irreversible resistance performed a small increasing trend with the increase of chlorine dose this result confirms that the discrepant fouling result here after uv chlorine pretreatment is not attributed to the different chlorine dose the components and characteristics of algae and their derived organic matter are quite different from nom liu et al 2017a xing et al 2018 which is expected to account for the different achievements here from the previous publication 3 1 3 uv h2o2 pretreatment fig 3 shows the effect of uv h2o2 pretreatment on membrane flux decline and fouling reversibility pretreatment using h2o2 alone had undetectable effect on membrane flux decline and similar phenomenon was also observed when uv h2o2 pretreatment was applied with the h2o2 dose less than 0 5 mm fig 3a however when the concentration of h2o2 was elevated to 1 mm the membrane flux decline was improved with the final specific flux of 0 38 as shown in fig 3b significant decrease of fouling resistance could be only achieved at the highest h2o2 dose 1 mm when uv h2o2 was applied where the reversible resistance was 3 04 1012 m 1 these results indicate that uv h2o2 pretreatment could improve the membrane flux and reduce the fouling resistance only at high h2o2 dose combining the results shown in figs 1 3 it is concluded that uv ps pretreatment performed much better ability than the pretreatment processes of uv chlorine and uv h2o2 in the alleviation of membrane fouling when treating algae laden water the performance of membrane fouling mitigation showed an apparent regularity of uv ps uv h2o2 uv chlorine 3 2 characterization of feed water 3 2 1 doc as shown in fig 4 the effect of different pretreatment processes on the removal of doc during algae laden water treatment was investigated with respect to raw water the doc of feed and permeate were 7 89 and 0 96 mg l respectively with the removal rate of 87 2 by membrane separation uv radiation alone slightly increased the doc of feed to 8 4 mg l which might be due to the breakage of algal cells and the release of iom wang et al 2016 when uv ps pretreatment was applied at a ps dose of 0 25 mm the doc of permeate increased to 4 54 mg l causing that the removal rate of doc decreased to around 50 this result is in accordance with some previous studies focusing on the treatment of eom and nom cheng et al 2016 wei et al 2016b the decreased doc removal can be explained by the transformation of organic compounds from high molecular weight mw into low mw during uv ps pretreatment with the further increase of ps dose to 1 mm the doc of feed and permeate gradually decreased to 2 14 and 1 23 mg l respectively implying that uv ps can partly mineralize aom tian et al 2018 wang et al 2016 therefore the breakage and partial mineralization of aom by uv ps pretreatment were supposed to contribute to the fouling alleviation the result also suggests that although uv ps pretreatment had a potential to increase the dissolved aom in the permeate and lowered the separation efficiency of uf membrane it can be compensated by the increase of ps dose as shown in fig 4b either chlorine alone or uv chlorine pretreatment slightly increased the doc of feed water indicating the breakage of algal cells also occurred it is noteworthy that doc of permeate significantly increased after uv chlorine pretreatment resulting in poor performance of doc rejection additionally increasing chlorine dose in uv chlorine pretreatment elevated the doc concentration of permeate which is different from the result achieved in uv ps pretreatment fig 4a for example the doc of permeate increased from 2 29 to 6 42 mg l with increasing chlorine dose from 0 to 1 mm these results suggest that uv chlorine process could only break down the large organic matters into smaller ones without further mineralization as for the uv h2o2 process the doc of permeate slightly increased with the increase of h2o2 dose there is a research reporting that uv h2o2 pretreatment significantly reduce the doc of aom due to the high mineralization ability of hydroxyl radical zhang et al 2015 however either uv radiation or hydroxyl radical oxidation can lyse algal cells resulting in the release of dissolved iom jia et al 2018 thus the increase of doc in the feed water can be explained by the breakage of algal cells and formation of debris during uv h2o2 pretreatment 3 2 2 fluorescent components fig 5 shows the effects of different pretreatment processes on fluorescence eem spectra of algae laden water because chlorine could fast destruct the fluorescent functional groups in aom the eem spectra of feed water after uv chlorine pretreatment is not shown here fang et al 2010a according to the method proposed by chen et al eem spectra can be divided into five regions chen et al 2003 region i ex em 200 250 280 330 nm and region ii ex em 200 250 330 380 nm represent the aromatic protein region iii ex em 200 250 380 540 nm corresponds to the fluvic acid like components region iv ex em 250 400 280 380 nm is associated with the soluble microbial by product like components and region v ex em 250 400 380 540 nm is related to the humic acid like components the eem spectrum volumes of five regions were calculated and shown in table s1 as illustrated in fig 5 untreated algae laden water showed four peaks in region i iv and v indicating that aom contained humic like protein like and dissolved microbial compounds cheng et al 2018 wei et al 2016b when uv radiation was applied eem spectrum volumes of region i and iv were reduced by 51 and 26 respectively which could be ascribed to the structure change of protein like substance wang et al 2019 additionally the fluorescence intensity of region iii and v approximately increased by 50 and 52 respectively after uv radiation this result could be attributed to the release of iom from broken cells and the transformation of high mw protein like components to low mw humic acid like and fluvic acid like components cheng et al 2018 wang et al 2016 it has been demonstrated that humic like substances can cause serious irreversible membrane fouling katsoufidou et al 2008 thus the aggravated irreversible membrane fouling after uv radiation was primarily due to the increase of the humic like components in the feed water when uv ps pretreatment was applied the peak intensities of region iii and v gradually decreased with the increase of ps dose wang et al 2016 it is worthy to note that membrane flux decline in fig 1a showed inconspicuous variation when uv ps pretreatment was applied at 0 25 mm ps dose even though the peak intensities in region iii and v had significant reduction fig 5c this phenomenon suggests that algal cells and debris still dominated the membrane fouling when uv ps was applied to pretreat algae laden water at higher ps dose 0 5 mm and 1 mm the algal cells and debris could be further broken into smaller components resulting in the membrane fouling alleviation when uv h2o2 pretreatment was applied at an h2o2 dose lower than 0 5 mm the fluorescence intensities of region iii and v were slightly reduced compared to that of single uv radiation indicating the decreased concentration of the humic like substances in the feed water this result is in line with the slight alleviation of irreversible membrane fouling after uv h2o2 pretreatment fig 3b however undetectable difference in the membrane flux decline was observed when the h2o2 dose ranged from 0 to 0 5 mm which could be also interpreted by that the algal cells and debris played the predominant roles in membrane fouling when the h2o2 dose increased to 1 mm the peak intensities of region iii and v significantly decreased suggesting the humic like substances could be further oxidized by uv h2o2 pretreatment furthermore the mitigated membrane flux decline shown in fig 3a revealed that the breakage of algal cells and debris into smaller substances also occurred it has been demonstrated that the mitigation of membrane fouling associated with feed water pretreatment is primarily attributed to the decreased deposition of organics on the membrane surface and the structural change of organic matter in the feed water huang et al 2009 wei et al 2016b zhang et al 2015 in this study uv ps pretreatment achieved a significant reduction of doc fig 4a implying the reduced deposition of foulant on the membrane surface besides the structure change of aom in feed water also played an important role in fouling alleviation as fluorescence of aom significantly decreased after pretreatment with regard to uv h2o2 pretreatment the fluorescence of aom showed a significant reduction while a negligible variation of doc was observed after pretreatment this result indicates that the retarded fouling after uv h2o2 pretreatment was mainly attributed to the change of aom characteristics in the feed water 3 2 3 hydrophilicity the variations of aom hydrophilicity with different pretreatment processes were also investigated and shown in fig 6 it is always considered that uf membrane primarily rejects the hpo fractions of the aom while the hpi organic compounds mainly cause irreversible membrane fouling tian et al 2018 wei et al 2016b the hpi tpi and hpo fractions in terms of doc concentration in untreated water were 0 96 1 82 and 6 49 mg l respectively which is consistent with the previous finding that hpo fraction was the dominant fraction in aom wei et al 2016a for single uv radiation the hpi fraction increased which might be due to the release of the hydrophilic humic like substances li et al 2012 this result is consistent with the slight increase of irreversible fouling after uv radiation when uv ps pretreatment was applied the hpo fraction significantly decreased and the hpi fraction was the dominant fraction in the feed water indicating that the significant improvement of membrane flux decline was partly ascribed to the removal of hpo fraction fig 1a based on eq 1 lots of so 4 formed in the uv ps system and were the dominant oxidants which could fast destruct organic compounds and cause the formation of lots hydrophilic functional groups as a result to the increase of the low mw hpi fraction tian et al 2018 it should be noted that uv ps pretreatment had limited ability to alleviate hydraulically irreversible fouling fig 1b potential reasons for this phenomenon would be as follows 1 uv ps pretreatment produced more low mw hpi compounds fig 6 which progressively accumulated in the membrane pores 2 a dense cake layer formed on the membrane surface due to the deposition of hpo fractions algal cells and debris during the filtration of untreated algae laden water and this cake layer served as an additional physical filter and increased the rejection of hpi fraction uv ps pretreatment significantly reduced the cake layer on the membrane surface which enhanced the interaction between the hpi fraction and membrane and thus allowing more hpi fractions to enter membrane pores with respect to uv chlorine pretreatment the hydrophilicity of feed water did not have apparent variation and the hpo was still the dominant fraction from the result of doc analysis uv chlorine pretreatment could reduce the mw of the organic matter in the feed water xing et al 2018 the activation of chlorine by uv can form both ho and cl eq 2 which are strong oxidants the oxidation of aom by ho and cl would form some hpi fraction sarathy and mohseni 2010 however chlorine also has high reactivity with lots of aom which is different from ps fang et al 2010b when chlorine reacts with aom there are three reaction processes including oxidation substitution and addition fang et al 2010a both substitution and addition reactions can form many halo generated organic fractions with low mw as the halo generated organic fractions usually contain strong hydrophobicity the direct reaction between chlorine and aom might increase the hpo fractions which might compensate for the decrease of hpo fractions by the reaction between aom and the formed ho and cl then the final observation is that the hydrophilicity of feed water did not have apparent variation after uv chlorine pretreatment as the low mw hpo fraction form through the direct reaction between chlorine and aom might accumulate in the membrane pores during filtration resulting in the membrane pore narrowing and blocking it is widely recognized that foulants deposited into the membrane pores are usually hard removed by hydraulic backwash cheng et al 2016 wang et al 2019 thus the irreversible membrane fouling caused by algae laden water was aggravated after uv chlorine pretreatment fig 2 when uv h2o2 pretreatment was applied the variation of hydrophilicity was similar to that of uv chlorine pretreatment however the fouling results were different the improved membrane performance after uv h2o2 pretreatment was probably due to the trade off effect on the one hand the hpo fraction could be changed from high mw into low mw which resulted in the pore blocking but the mw decrease of hpo fraction after uv h2o2 pretreatment was not as obvious as that of water sample pretreated by uv chlorine since the doc of permeate only showed a slight increase fig 4c on the other hand the structure of organics was significantly changed after uv h2o2 pretreatment fig 5 which reduced the formation of cake gel layer on the membrane surface and mitigated membrane fouling therefore it can be inferred that the negative influence on membrane fouling was offset by the positive influence resulting in the fouling alleviation 3 2 4 flow cytometry analysis fig 7 presents the flow cytometry result of microcystis cells after pretreatment by different uv aops in these figures cells region represents the integrated and damaged algal cells while the debris region corresponds to the algal debris liu et al 2015 wilkinson 2018 the total concentration of algal cells and debris in feed water after different pretreatment processes was also calculated and shown in table s2 in fig 7a the ratio of algal cells and debris were 59 and 34 3 respectively in raw algae laden water without pre oxidation uv radiation showed inconspicuous influence on the algae concentration which is in accordance with the aforementioned conclusion that uv radiation played little role in fouling control however the ratio of algal cells significantly decreased to 23 5 when uv ps pretreatment was applied in addition table s2 shows that the total number of algal cells and debris decreased significantly after uv ps pretreatment these results further prove that reactive substances such as so 4 and ho produced in the uv ps process could effectively damage the algal cells and form cell debris wang et al 2016 supporting the speculation that mitigation of membrane fouling after uv ps pretreatment was attributed to the degradation of aom as well as the partial conversion of algal cells and debris into smaller substances although uv chlorine pretreatment had little influence on the ratio of cells and debris fig 7d the concentration of algal cells and debris showed a significant reduction table s2 this result proves that aggravated membrane fouling after uv chlorine pretreatment was primarily attributed to the pore blocking caused by low mw hpo fraction rather than the cake filtration caused by algal cells and debris with respect to uv h2o2 pretreatment the concentration of algal cells and debris slightly decreased which is in line with the slight alleviation of membrane fouling after pretreatment fig 3 some previous studies reported that algal cells and debris were always associated with the formation of cake layer whereas aom including humic like substances polysaccharides and proteins usually formed cake gel layer babel and takizawa 2010 li et al 2014b qu et al 2012 our previous research verified that membrane fouling caused by the mixture of humic acid ha sodium alginate sa and bovine serum albumin bsa could be effectively controlled when uv ps pretreatment was applied wang et al 2019 herein it can be inferred that cake gel layer formed by aom could be effectively removed by uv ps pretreatment this result could also be obtained from the analysis of fluorescent eem fig 5c e therefore membrane fouling was primarily attributed to the cake layer filtration caused by algal cells and debris when uv ps was used at a higher ps dose such as 0 5 mm and 1 mm fig 7c similar phenomenon also occurred when uv h2o2 pretreatment was applied at higher h2o2 dose 1 mm since the concentration of algal cells and debris showed slight reduction fig 7e although the intensities of fluorescence eem were significantly decreased fig 5f h in addition the surface morphologies of algal cells were observed to study the impacts of uv aops pretreatment on cell integrity as shown in fig s6 the algal cells without pretreatment showed a smooth cell membrane while uv radiation deformed the algal cells after pretreatment by either uv ps or uv chlorine the algal cells were severe damaged with completely losing the cellular structure as for uv h2o2 pretreatment the algal cell was also seriously damaged although it can still keep its shape this result further indicated the damage of algal cells by uv aops 3 3 characterization of membrane surface 3 3 1 ftir the influences of different pretreatment processes on the variation of functional groups on the surface of pristine and fouled membranes were compared using atr ftir fig 8 after the filtration of algae laden water strong absorbance at around 3280 2925 1535 1392 and 1027 cm 1 could be noticed the broad absorbance band centered at 3280 cm 1 was assigned to o h stretching vibrations and stretch at 2925 cm 1 was associated with the c h corresponding to the characteristics of polysaccharides zhou et al 2014 the peak related to the n h stretching vibration amide ii was also noticed at 1535 cm 1 indicating the deposition of the protein like substances on the membrane surface tian et al 2018 zhang et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 this result is consistent with the result of fluorescent eem spectra that the appearance of protein like substances in aom fig 5 furthermore the broad band around 1040 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of carboxylate group c o c revealing the deposition of polysaccharide like substances chiou et al 2010 a negligible difference of peaks intensities was observed when the water sample was pretreated by uv radiation alone while a slight decrease of the intensities was achieved when uv h2o2 pretreatment was used however the peaks intensities dramatically decreased when uv ps pretreatment was applied this result indicates that polysaccharide like substances and protein like substances were oxidized and a thinner cake gel layer formed on the membrane surface after pretreatment which could explain the fouling mitigation shown in fig 1 wang et al 2019 a similar result was also observed when uv chlorine pretreatment was used suggesting that uv chlorine could also reduce the deposition of foulants on the membrane surface this result further proves that the more serious membrane fouling after uv chlorine was due to the irreversible pore blocking rather than the deposition of foulants on the membrane surface figs 2 and 6 3 3 2 sem sem images of pristine and fouled membranes are offered in fig 9 to help study the variation of membrane fouling after pretreatment by different uv aops the sem image of the virgin membrane clearly shows the smooth membrane surface without any foulants in the presence of untreated algae laden water algal cells and agglomerates covered on the membrane surface to form a dense and compact cake layer this result suggests that membrane fouling caused by algae laden water was attributed to the dense cake layer formed by algal cells and aom which was external fouling and easily removed by hydraulic backwash liu et al 2017a for single uv radiation fig 9c algal cells with much fewer agglomerates could be observed on the membrane surface when uv h2o2 process was applied fig 9f the algal cells were partly deformed and more debris appeared on the membrane surface indicating the breakage of algal cells when the feed water was subjected to the uv ps pretreatment the number of algal cells on the membrane surface significantly decreased and a relatively porous cake layer formed on the membrane surface which further confirms that the membrane fouling alleviation by uv ps pretreatment was ascribed to the control of cake gel filtration this is in accordance with the result of flow cytometry analysis with respect to uv chlorine pretreatment a relatively loose cake layer formed on the membrane surface which is correlated with the ftir result fig 8 further supporting that pore blocking rather than cake filtration dominated the membrane fouling 3 4 effect of pretreatment by uv aops on membrane fouling mechanisms to obtain a better comprehending of the fouling mitigation mechanism the experimental results were plotted as d2 t dv 2 against dt dv following eq 6 the variation of the n value indicates the change of the dominant mechanism furthermore the permeate volume versus dt dv was also plotted in fig 10 to obtain the approximate filtration volume where the fouling mechanism changed as shown in fig 10 membrane fouling caused by algae laden water without pretreatment was governed by intermediate blocking and cake filtration with the n value of 1 147 and 0 057 respectively the conversion of the fouling mechanism occurred at the filtration volume of 110 ml this result could be ascribed to the initial pore blocking caused by aom followed by the cake filtration derived from algal cells and debris liu et al 2018 when uv ps pretreatment was applied fouling mechanism during the entire filtration cycle was governed by pore blocking the algal cells were cracked into debris and aom was transformed into smaller organic compounds during uv ps pretreatment which resulted in the less deposition of foulants on the membrane surface and reduced the role of cake filtration this is consistent with the flow cytometry analysis and sem result figs 7 and 9 additionally this result also evidences that irreversible membrane fouling occupied a dominant position when uv ps was applied at a ps dose of 1 mm fig 1b when uv chlorine pretreatment was used the fouling mechanism also changed during filtration in the initial stage the fouling was primarily governed by standard blocking with the n value of 0 686 while for the followed filtration stage the n value was 0 237 which could not be interpreted by any of the classical fouling models many researchers claimed that the variation of n value from the positive to negative could be ascribed to the transition of filtration mechanism to cake filtration as the negative slopes always appeared after d2 t dv 2 increased to a peak followed by a zero slope byun et al 2011 cheng et al 2018 lee et al 2013 it should be noted that the transition of the fouling mechanism could be observed with the filtration volume of around 70 ml the volume required for the transition i e transition volume was reduced after uv chlorine pretreatment compared with the untreated water sample implying that the pretreatment brought forward the transformation of the fouling mechanism cheng et al 2018 pore blocking was more severe than that of untreated algae laden water since the low mw hpo fractions could enter membrane pores more easily which resulted in the earlier conversion of fouling mechanism from pore blocking to cake filtration this result is consistent with the aggravated membrane flux decline in the initial filtration period after uv chlorine pretreatment fig 2a as for uv h2o2 pretreatment the pore blocking mechanism governed the membrane fouling throughout the whole filtration cycle in the absence of the cake filtration the effect of uv aops pretreatment on membrane fouling mechanism during algae laden water treatment is illustrated in fig 11 4 conclusion in this study pretreatment of algae laden water by uv ps uv h2o2 and uv chlorine on the variation of characteristics and the alleviation of membrane fouling were investigated uv ps pretreatment effectively improved membrane flux and reduced reversible membrane fouling which was much more efficient than uv h2o2 pretreatment while uv chlorine pretreatment resulted in more serious irreversible fouling during the uv ps pretreatment oxidation of algal cells and aom can effectively decrease the doc fluorescent components and hpo fractions in feed water which was expected to account for the alleviation of membrane fouling although uv h2o2 pretreatment can break down algal cells and reduce the fluorescent components in feed water the reduction of doc and hpo fraction after uv h2o2 pretreatment was less than that of uv ps pretreatment thereby causing a lower efficiency of uv h2o2 pretreatment on fouling control uv chlorine pretreatment could form lots of low mw hpo compounds which progressively accumulated in membrane pores and aggravated irreversible membrane fouling model fitting indicates that membrane fouling caused by algae laden water without pretreatment was governed by intermediate blocking and cake filtration uv ps and uv h2o2 pretreatment changed the dominant mechanism into standard blocking and intermediate blocking respectively however a more severe pore blocking occurred after uv chlorine pretreatment this study suggests that pretreatment of algae laden water using uv ps is more effective to control the uf membrane fouling than that of uv h2o2 or uv chlorine additionally it should be concerned that the application of uv ps pretreatment might lower the efficiency of uf membrane and increase the doc in permeate when treating algae laden water due to the release of aom with small mw however uv ps pretreatment might be still a good choice in the combination of uf membrane filtration as some released aom can be further removed by the increase of ps dose acknowledgment this research was supported by the natural science foundation of china grant

18821,the uv persulfate process is an effective advanced oxidation process aop for the abatement of a variety of micropollutants via producing sulfate radicals so4 however when this technology is used to reduce target pollutants the precursors of disinfection byproducts dbps such as natural organic matter nom and organic nitrogen compounds can be altered this study systematically investigated the dbp formation from nom and five model compounds after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments followed with 24 h chlorination compared to chlorination alone the yields of trichloromethane tcm and dichloroacetonitrile dcan from nom decreased by 50 and 54 respectively after uv persulfate treatment followed with chlorination whereas those of chloral hydrate ch 1 1 1 trichloropropanone 1 1 1 tcp and trichloronitromethane tcnm increased by 217 136 and 153 respectively the effect of uv h2o2 treatment on dbp formation shared a similar trend to that of uv persulfate treatment but the dbp formation was higher from the former as the uv persulfate treatment time prolonged or the persulfate dosage increased the formation of tcm and dcan continuously decreased while that of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm presented an increasing and then decreasing pattern so4 activated benzoic acid ba to form phenolic compounds that enhanced the formation of tcm and ch while it deactivated resorcinol to decrease the formation of tcm so4 reacted with aliphatic amines such as methylamine ma and dimethylamine dma to form nitro groups which significantly increased the formation of tcnm in post chlorination and the rate was determined to be higher than that of ho this study illuminated the diverse impacts of the structures of the precursors on dbp formation after uv persulfate treatment and dbp alteration depended on the reactivity between so4 and specific precursor graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation process sulfate radicals hydroxyl radicals disinfection byproducts natural organic matter water treatment 1 introduction sulfate radicals so4 e0 2 5 3 1 v based advanced oxidation processes aops have been being extensively investigated for the abatement of a variety of micropollutants in water treatment anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 ghanbari and moradi 2017 compared to hydroxyl radicals ho e0 1 8 2 7 v so4 is more selective and reacts with micropollutants with rate constants in a range of 106 109 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 ji et al 2016 hou et al 2017 the efficiencies of so4 based aops for the abatement of most micropollutants were reported to be comparable or higher compared to those of ho based aops yang et al 2014 2019 the uv persulfate aop is one of the typical so4 based aops antoniou et al 2010 lian et al 2017 and the solid phase and high aqueous solubility of persulfate allow it easier to be stored and transported than h2o2 hou et al 2018 thus the uv persulfate aop could be an alternative to the uv h2o2 aop for water treatment oxidation treatment can activate or deactivate some disinfection byproduct dbp precursors to increase or decrease dbp formation compared to chlorination alone the oxidation of natural organic matter nom by chlorine dioxide ozone ferrate and permanganate reduced the formation potential of most dbps in post chlorination such as trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans and chloral hydrate ch lamsal et al 2011 yang et al 2013a chu et al 2015b meanwhile the oxidation of nom by ferrate and ozone significantly increased the formation of trichloronitromethane tcnm in post chlorination compared to chlorination alone bond et al 2014 gan et al 2015 the uv h2o2 aop via producing ho can alter the properties of dbp precursors and influence dbp formation during the subsequent chlorination the yield of thms increased by 20 118 and 143 after uv h2o2 treatment followed by chlorination compared to chlorination alone under simulated drinking water distribution system conditions and in a drinking water treatment plant respectively dotson et al 2010 metz et al 2011 additionally the n nitrosodimethylamine ndma formation potential increased when diltiazem was treated with the uv h2o2 aop chen et al 2011 however the thm formation potential was reported to be decreased after the uv h2o2 treatment of surface water and three raw water samples from different water treatment plants due to the decreased hydrophobicity and aromaticity of nom lamsal et al 2011 lin and wang 2011 the formation of trichloromethane tcm and dichloroacetonitrile dcan slightly decreased after uv h2o2 treatment of five amino acids chu et al 2016b moreover uv h2o2 treatment of chloramphenicol increased the formation of tcnm zhang et al 2017 whereas it decreased the formation of haloacetamides hacams hans and tcnm from a filtered drinking water chu et al 2014 thus oxidation treatment can alter the precursors of specific dbps and the structures of precursors and water matrices are of great importance for dbp alteration when the uv persulfate aop is used to reduce target pollutants the precursors of dbps such as nom and organic nitrogen compounds can be altered nom one of the major dbp precursors is several orders of magnitude higher in concentration than micropollutants in surface water and drinking water guo et al 2017 hua et al 2019 which can significantly compete with micropollutants for so4 fang and shang 2012 thus the properties of nom could also be affected by uv persulfate treatment and further influence the dbp formation during the subsequent chlorination the formation of tcm increased but that of dcan decreased after uv persulfate treatment of nom and amino acids respectively xie et al 2015 chu et al 2016b the carboxylic groups on the aromatics of nom can be converted into hydroxyl groups when it was exposed to so4 leading to the increased reactivity between nom and chlorine and thus the enhancement of the formation potential of tcm and haas lu et al 2016 moreover uv persulfate treatment achieved a considerable reduction in the formation of hacams hans and tcnm in post chlorination from a filtered drinking water chu et al 2015a the tcm formation decreased from 2 4 di tert butylphenol but increased from chloramphenicol after uv persulfate treatment followed by chlorination chu et al 2016a wang et al 2018 thus the dbp alteration after uv persulfate treatment depends on the precursor properties and water matrices it is necessary to investigate the dbp alteration and the underlying mechanism of uv persulfate treatment of nom and model compounds representing the typical precursor structures the objectives of this study were as follows 1 to investigate the alteration in the dbp formation during post chlorination after so4 and ho oxidation from nom and typical model compounds 2 to investigate the effects of the treatment time persulfate dosage and water matrices on the dbp formation from nom by uv persulfate the selected model

2012 the ph was measured by a ph meter fe20 mettler toledo the h2o2 concentration was measured by an i3 colorimetric method klassen et al 1994 ba and resorcinol were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 coupled with a diode array detector the wavelengths were set at 227 nm and 273 nm for ba and resorcinol respectively ma dma and glycine were measured by hplc using pre column derivatization by fluorenylmethyl chloroformate fmoc coupled with a fluorescence detector an agilent poroshell c 18 column 4 6 mm 50 mm 2 7 μm held at a temperature of 30 c was used to measure the model compounds the second order rate constants of resorcinol with ho and so4 were determined by competition kinetics details in text s1 the significance of observed differences was evaluated by using t test to calculate p values and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 2 3 experimental procedures the photochemical experiments were carried out in a 700 ml cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor equipped with a low pressure mercury uv lamp 254 nm gph135t5l 4 heraeus noblelight in the centerline of the cylindrical reactor the photon flux entering the solution and the optical path length were determined to be 3 78 μe l 1 s 1 and 3 38 cm by the iodide iodate chemical actinometry bolton et al 2011 and measuring the photolysis rate of h2o2 baxendale and wilson 1957 respectively in all cases a thermostat thd 0515 tianheng china was used to control the reaction temperature at 25 0 2 c a 700 ml test solution containing a certain dbp precursor nom or model compounds and 2 mm phosphate buffer was dosed with persulfate or h2o2 and simultaneously exposed to uv irradiation the dosage of persulfate or h2o2 was 200 μm which was similar to that used for micropollutant abatement lutze et al 2015b hou et al 2017 at a predetermined time of uv exposure an aliquot of chlorine was added to the solution to ensure the residual chlorine after 24 h of chlorination was greater than 1 mg l subsequently the sample was well mixed and transferred into a headspace free 60 ml brown glass bottle the bottles were stored in an incubator under a constant temperature of 25 c after 24 h of dark chlorination residual chlorine was measured and the samples quenched by ascorbic acid were extracted with mtbe for the analysis of dbps the experiments to investigate the effects of water matrices on the dbp alteration after uv persulfate treatment were conducted by adding certain concentrations of chloride bromide and bicarbonate accordingly control tests to study the dbp formation after direct uv photolysis or without any treatment were carried out in a similar manner meanwhile additional tests were conducted to measure the degradation of nom and model compounds in which their uv254 toc and concentrations of the model compounds were measured during uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments all experiments were performed at least twice and the error bars represented the maximum and minimum of the experimental data 2 4 computer simulation the steady state concentrations of ho and so4 were simulated by a kinetic model using kintecus v5 50 ianni 2015 following hou et al 2017 the rate constants of ma and dma reacting with ho and so4 were determined by the model using the data fitting function of kintecus figure s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of uv persulfate treatment on dbp formation from nom 3 1 1 comparison of uv h2o2 and uv persulfate fig 1 displays the dbp formation in nom solution after uv uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments followed with subsequent 24 h of chlorination uv direct photolysis barely affected the formation of dbps in post chlorination which was consistent with previous study dotson et al 2010 the uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments showed a similar trend for all dbp formation compared to chlorination alone the yields of tcm and dcan in post chlorination decreased after uv persulfate or uv h2o2 treatment whereas those of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm increased due to the alteration of nom by so4 and or ho nevertheless the formation of most dbps except for 1 1 1 tcp after uv persulfate treatment was lower than that after uv h2o2 treatment the yields of tcm and dcan were 231 and 2 2 μg l respectively after 24 h of chlorination alone the formation of tcm decreased by 40 p 0 003 and 50 p 0 004 respectively after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments while that of dcan decreased by 54 p 0 002 and 55 p 0 004 on the other hand the yields of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm were 10 5 7 and 0 1 μg l respectively after 24 h of chlorination alone the formation of ch increased by 527 p 0 001 and 217 p 0 001 after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments respectively while that of tcnm increased by 350 p 0 001 and 153 p 0 002 respectively and that of 1 1 1 tcp increased by 117 p 0 006 and 136 p 0 016 respectively the dbp formation after uv persulfate treatment was significantly changed which is inconsistent with the previous study xie et al 2015 this is likely due to a relatively lower oxidant dosage 30 μm used in the previous study compared with this study 200 μm the persulfate dosage and uv fluence used in this study were similar to those used for micropollutant abatement gao et al 2012 hou et al 2017 the impact of uv persulfate treatment on the dbp formation in post chlorination could be ascribed to the property changes of nom 1 the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva which is an indicator of the aromatic and hydrophobic components of organic matter westerhoff et al 1999 weishaar et al 2003 and positively correlates with the formation of thms singer 1999 decreased from 4 30 to 1 86 and 2 89 l mg 1 cm 1 after 20 min of uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatment respectively table s1 2 the oxidation of nom by ho or so4 can activate the precursors to increase the formation of some dbps the increased formation of halo aldehydes and halo ketones such as ch and 1 1 1 tcp after uv persulfate treatment could be ascribed to the formation of aldehydes and ketones by ho or so4 xie et al 2015 meanwhile the amine groups of nom may be partially transformed into nitro groups by so4 which decreased the dcan formation but promoted the tcnm formation the formation of dbps after uv h2o2 treatment was higher than those after uv persulfate treatment due to the different reactivities of ho and so4 with nom and their different concentrations the reactivity of nom with ho k ho nom 2 5 104 l mg 1 s 1 is higher than that with so4 k so4 nom 2 103 l mg 1 s 1 hou et al 2018 the steady state concentrations of ho and so4 in uv persulfate treatment were 2 5 10 13 m and 4 2 10 11 m respectively while that of ho was 2 5 10 12 m in uv h2o2 treatment the higher concentration of ho and higher reactivity with nom led to the formation of more precursors of some dbps after uv h2o2 treatment for example the formation of acetaldehyde after uv h2o2 treatment were 128 higher than those after uv persulfate treatment at 30 μm h2o2 or persulfate xie et al 2015 which induced the higher yields of ch accordingly the chlorine consumption after uv persulfate treatment was 6 lower than that after uv h2o2 treatment figure s3 meanwhile suva of nom reduced after either uv h2o2 or uv persulfate treatment and the reduction degree was lower after uv h2o2 resulting in the higher yields of tcm after uv h2o2 compared to uv persulfate 3 1 2 effects of uv persulfate treatment time and persulfate dosage on dbp formation from nom fig 2 a shows the impact of the treatment time on the formation of dbps with increasing the treatment time from 0 to 30 min the formation of tcm and dcan continuously decreased whereas the formation of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm showed an increasing and then decreasing trend the maximum formation of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm occurred at 20 20 and 10 min which increased by 217 p 0 003 136 p 0 016 and 179 p 0 002 respectively the characteristics of nom were altered during the exposure of so4 and ho which may increase the formation of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm per unit doc meanwhile the concentration of doc continuously decreased with increasing treatment time table s1 indicating the degradation and mineralization of nom which was responsible for the decreased formation of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm fig 2b shows the effects of the persulfate dosage on dbp formation with increasing the persulfate dosage from 0 to 500 μm the formation of tcm and dcan continuously decreased by 86 p 0 001 and 73 p 0 001 the formation of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm displayed an increasing and then decreasing pattern with a maximum formation at 200 μm persulfate the chlorine consumption decreased monotonously with increasing persulfate dosage figure s4 the steady state concentrations of so4 and ho increased by 141 and 132 respectively with increasing the persulfate dosage from 200 to 500 μm compared with the prolonged treatment time increasing the persulfate dosage showed a similar effect on dbp formation due to the enhanced exposure of radicals 3 1 3 effects of water matrices in uv persulfate treatment on dbp formation from nom typical water matrix components such as chloride bromide and bicarbonate can affect the chemistry of the uv persulfate and chlorination processes fig 3 shows the effects of chloride bromide and bicarbonate on the formation of dbps from nom after uv persulfate treatment followed by chlorination the formation of tcm ch 1 1 1 tcp dcan and tcnm slightly increased by 10 p 0 127 15 p 0 049 27 p 0 057 3 p 0 670 and 5 p 0 009 respectively after uv persulfate treatment followed by chlorination in the presence of 1 mm chloride no free chlorine and dbps were detected during the uv persulfate treatment in the presence of 1 mm chloride data not shown meanwhile the steady state concentration of so4 decreased to 1 0 10 12 m and that of ho increased to 4 0 10 12 m which was likely to enhance the dbp formation in post chlorination after uv persulfate treatment with the presence of chloride in the presence of 5 μm bromide the yields of chlorinated dbps decreased whereas those of brominated dbps such as bdcm dbcm tbm dban and bcan significantly increased after uv persulfate treatment followed by chlorination the total formation of thms and hans increased by 46 p 0 003 and 115 p 0 002 with the presence of 5 μm bromide no brominated dbps were detected during uv persulfate data not shown in uv persulfate process the steady state concentration of so4 decreased by 40 in the presence of 5 μm bromide which may enhance thm and han formation meanwhile bromide reacted with free chlorine to form free bromine during subsequent chlorination resulting in the bromination of nom to form brominated dbps liu and croué 2016 bromine reacted with nom ten times faster than chlorine westerhoff et al 2004 leading to more halogen consumption figure s5 and higher formation of dbps with the presence of bromide the yields of tcm ch dcan and tcnm increased by 37 3 52 and 34 respectively while that of 1 1 1 tcp decreased by 6 when 0 5 mm bicarbonate ions existed in uv persulfate treatment hco3 could scavenge so4 and ho to form co3 the steady state concentrations of so4 and ho decreased by 37 and 65 respectively in the presence of 0 5 mm hco3 which could be responsible for the increase of dbp formation 3 2 effects of uv persulfate treatment on dbp formation from model compounds 3 2 1 benzoic acid and resorcinol ba and resorcinol were selected as model carbon compounds in nom which contain aromatic carboxyl and phenolic groups respectively ba is inert to chlorine while resorcinol is very reactive toward chlorine k 4 103 m 1 s 1 to form tcm and other dbps due to the meta dihydroxybenzene structure gallard and von gunten 2002 deborde and von gunten 2008 fig 4 a shows the dbp formation from ba after uv uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments and subsequent 24 h of chlorination the formation of tcm and ch significantly increased after uv uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments the dbp formation was lower after uv persulfate treatment than that after uv h2o2 treatment compared to chlorination alone the formation of tcm and ch after uv photolysis increased from 2 2 to 66 μg l p 0 001 and from 0 6 to 7 2 μg l p 0 001 respectively the yields of tcm after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments increased to 465 and 321 μg l p 0 001 respectively while those of ch increased to 160 and 61 μg l p 0 001 respectively in addition with increasing the uv persulfate treatment time from 0 to 20 min the yields of tcm and ch monotonically increased figure s6 suva obviously increased after uv persulfate treatment table s1 leading to the increased formation of tcm yang et al 2013b ba has a negligible reactivity with chlorine the removal rates of ba at 20 min were 8 80 and 95 by uv photolysis uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments respectively figure s7 the lower ba removal rate by the uv persulfate treatment compared to the uv h2o2 treatment was due to the higher reactivity of ba toward ho relative to so4 k ba ho 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 k ba so4 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 guan et al 2011 the transformation of ba by ho and so4 formed hydroxylated intermediates such as phenol 2 hydroxybenzoic acid and 4 hydroxybenzoic acid zrinyi and pham 2017 which were much more reactive toward chlorine compared to ba criquet et al 2015 lu et al 2016 thus ba was activated by ho and so4 to increase dbp formation and the formation of tcm ch and 1 1 1 tcp after uv persulfate treatment was lower than it was after uv h2o2 treatment accordingly the chlorine consumption increased from 1 6 to 8 3 and 9 6 mg l respectively after 20 min of uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments figure s8 additionally the chlorine consumption increased with increasing uv persulfate treatment time figure s9 fig 4b shows the dbp formation from resorcinol after uv uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments and subsequent 24 h of chlorination the chlorination of resorcinol significantly formed tcm which reached up to 8344 μg l after 24 h of chlorination interestingly uv uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments significantly decreased the tcm formation by 37 p 0 004 79 p 0 001 and 93 p 0 001 respectively the ch formation slightly increased from 340 to 350 μg l p 0 034 after uv h2o2 treatment but it decreased to 237 p 0 011 and 193 μg l p 0 001 respectively after uv and uv persulfate treatments furthermore as the uv persulfate treatment time increased from 0 to 20 min the formation of tcm and ch decreased monotonically figure s6 resorcinol has a high reactivity with chlorine k 4 103 m 1 s 1 to form thms gallard and von gunten 2002 the removal rates of resorcinol at 20 min were 51 80 and 93 by uv direct photolysis uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments respectively figure s7 in addition the concentration of doc decreased from 3 07 to 2 74 and 2 01 mg l after uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments respectively the degradation and mineralization of resorcinol by uv persulfate and uv h2o2 significantly reduced the precursors of tcm in post chlorination the attack of resorcinol by ho can lead to the aromatic ring opening to form a series of carboxylic acids such as succinic acid malonic acid and oxalic acid and finally carbon dioxide liu et al 2008 so4 may have similar effects on resorcinol these carboxylic acids may react with chlorine at a much lower rate compared to resorcinol resulting in the reduction of chlorine consumption figure s8 and the significant reduction of tcm formation after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments the relatively higher reaction rate constant of resorcinol with ho compared with so4 leads to the lower dbp formation in post chlorination after uv h2o2 treatment compared with after uv persulfate treatment k resorcinol ho 7 5 109 m 1 s 1 k resorcinol so4 2 3 109 m 1 s 1 3 2 2 methylamine dimethylamine and glycine aliphatic amines and amino acids are typical precursors of n dbps which are also typical functional groups in nom and organic nitrogen compounds ma and dma were selected as a representative primary amine and secondary amine respectively and glycine was selected as a representative amino acid fig 5 a shows the formation of dbps from ma after uv uv h2o2 uv persulfate treatments and subsequent 24 h of chlorination obviously the formation of tcnm significantly increased from 0 6 to 162 and 561 μg l p 0 001 respectively after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments moreover the formation of tcnm continuously increased from 122 to 561 μg l p 0 001 with increasing treatment time from 5 to 20 min figure s10 in addition the yields of c dbps and dcan from ma chlorination with or without treatment were insignificant which were less than 8 μg l and less than 0 1 μg l respectively the removal rates of ma were negligible 13 and 3 by uv photolysis uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments respectively at 20 min figure s7 which was due to the higher reactivity of ma with so4 k 3 1 106 m 1 s 1 than that with ho k 1 105 m 1 s 1 table 1 ma could be transformed by ozonation to nitromethane which could be further transformed to tcnm with a transformation rate of 50 during post chlorination mccurry et al 2016 similarly ma may be oxidized by ho and so4 to form nitromethane ho reacts with ma through hydrogen abstraction and generates ch3n h under neutral conditions helali et al 2013 which can be further oxidized to nitromethane this resulted in the enhanced tcnm formation during post chlorination after uv h2o2 treatment the degradation of ma by uv persulfate was faster than that by uv h2o2 indicating that more nitromethane may be formed after uv persulfate treatment therefore more tcnm was generated after uv persulfate treatment with post chlorination than after uv h2o2 treatment fig 5b shows the formation of dbps from dma after uv uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments followed by 24 h of chlorination the altered trend of dbp formation from dma by uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments was similar to that from ma but the yields of tcnm were lower specifically the formation of tcnm was 3 4 μg l after chlorination alone and it increased to 14 p 0 021 and 54 μg l p 0 001 after 20 min of uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments followed by chlorination respectively the formation of tcnm continuously increased with increasing uv persulfate treatment times figure s10 the formation of c dbps and dcan was higher after uv h2o2 treatment than that after uv persulfate treatment nevertheless their formation with or without treatment was insignificant dma can be oxidized by ho to form n methylformaldimine ch3n ch2 which can be further transformed to nitromethane wang et al 2017 and then formed tcnm during post chlorination 12 and 18 of dma was degraded by uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments respectively figure s7 indicating that dma was more reactive toward so4 k 6 1 106 m 1 s 1 than ho k 1 6 105 m 1 s 1 table 1 additionally so4 prefers to degrade organic compounds via dealkylation compared to ho lutze et al 2015a thus dma could be transformed to ma via demethylation therefore the alteration trend of dbp formation from dma particularly tcnm by uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments was similar to that from ma fig 5c shows the dbp formation from glycine after uv uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments followed by 24 h of chlorination the formation of tcnm was 0 6 μg l with chlorination alone which increased to 1 1 p 0 026 and 0 9 μg l p 0 001 after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments respectively the formation of dcan decreased from 0 3 to 0 2 p 0 028 and 0 1 μg l p 0 001 respectively after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments meanwhile the formation of c dbps such as tcm and ch was insignificant from glycine with or without treatment the formation of all dbps except for 1 1 1 tcp was higher after uv h2o2 treatment than that after uv persulfate treatment with increasing uv persulfate treatment time the formation of tcm and tcnm increased initially and then decreased with a maximum at 10 min whereas the formation of dcan monotonously decreased figure s10 the higher tcm and lower dcan formation from glycine after uv persulfate treatment was consistent with the previous study chu et al 2016b the alteration trends of tcnm formation from glycine after uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments was different than those from ma and dma which is likely due to the different reaction pathways of amino acids from primary amines the removal rates of glycine were 24 and 16 respectively by uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments figure s7 the reaction rate constant of glycine with ho was higher than that with so4 k glycine ho 1 7 107 m 1 s 1 k glycine so4 9 106 m 1 s 1 nist 2018 the carboxylic acid in glycine led to a low electron cloud density on the amino group which made it difficult to cleave the carbon bond of glycine to form nitromethane mccurry et al 2016 furthermore ho reacts with glycine through two pathways one is hydrogen abstraction at the α carbon and then deamination to generate oxalic acid the other is hydrogen abstraction from the amine group and then deamination to generate formic acid ying et al 2015 the deamination of glycine by radicals led to less tcnm formation on the other hand amino acids react with chlorine to produce aldehydes and nitriles deborde and von gunten 2008 which act as the precursors of some dbps such as ch and dcan intermediates formed from glycine after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments had low reactivity toward chlorine leading to less chlorine consumption figure s8 and the decreasing formation of ch and dcan figure s10 in summary ho and so4 could activate aromatic rings such as ba through hydroxylation to form phenolic components which increased the formation of tcm and ch in post chlorination additionally the oxidation by ho and so4 could deactivate the precursors such as resorcinol to decrease the c dbp formation the oxidation of the amine groups in aliphatic amines significantly promoted the formation of tcnm after uv persulfate treatment 4 conclusions and engineering implications dbp alteration after uv persulfate treatment primarily depends on the structures of precursors and water matrices for nom the formation of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm increased whereas those of tcm and dcan decreased after the uv persulfate treatment followed with chlorination the influence of uv h2o2 treatment on dbp formation was similar to that of uv persulfate treatment and the dbp formation after uv h2o2 treatment was higher than that after uv persulfate treatment with increasing treatment time and persulfate dosage the formation of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm increased at first and then decreased but the formation of tcm and dcan decreased monotonously the presence of chloride and bicarbonate in uv persulfate treatment increased the formation of chlorinated dbps whereas bromide decreased the chlorinated dbp formation but increased the formation of brominated dbps for the model compounds the formation of tcm and ch from ba and that of tcnm from ma and dma significantly increased while the tcm and ch formation from resorcinol dramatically decreased after uv persulfate treatment the dbp formation from glycine slightly changed after uv persulfate treatment although the regulated dbps such as tcm decreased from nom after uv persulfate the unregulated dbps such as ch and tcnm significantly increased which were reported to possess higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than the regulated dbps richardson et al 2007 the formation of total organic halogen tox deserve further investigation in the future study which is a collective parameter and a toxicity indicator for all the halogenated organic dbps in water this study provided a better understanding of the dbp formation after uv persulfate treatment the structures of precursors played a crucial role in dbp formation after uv persulfate treatment and the dbp alteration depended on the reactivity of precursors with ho and so4 both so4 and ho activated benzoate to enhance the formation of tcm and ch but deactivated resorcinol to reduce the tcm formation the reactivity of so4 with benzoate and resorcinol was lower than that of ho thus the dbp alteration was lower by so4 on the other hand the reactivity of so4 with primary amines was higher than that of ho resulting in more dramatic increase of the tcnm formation after uv persulfate treatment water matrices such as halides and alkalinity affected the radical chemistry during uv persulfate treatment which further influenced the dbp formation nevertheless so4 reacted with these water matrices about one magnitude order lower than that of ho neta et al 1988 buxton et al 1988 making so4 based aop much less susceptible than ho based aop thus uv persulfate treatment could be an alternative to uv h2o2 in controlling dbps as well as in the abatement of contaminants declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

18821,the uv persulfate process is an effective advanced oxidation process aop for the abatement of a variety of micropollutants via producing sulfate radicals so4 however when this technology is used to reduce target pollutants the precursors of disinfection byproducts dbps such as natural organic matter nom and organic nitrogen compounds can be altered this study systematically investigated the dbp formation from nom and five model compounds after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments followed with 24 h chlorination compared to chlorination alone the yields of trichloromethane tcm and dichloroacetonitrile dcan from nom decreased by 50 and 54 respectively after uv persulfate treatment followed with chlorination whereas those of chloral hydrate ch 1 1 1 trichloropropanone 1 1 1 tcp and trichloronitromethane tcnm increased by 217 136 and 153 respectively the effect of uv h2o2 treatment on dbp formation shared a similar trend to that of uv persulfate treatment but the dbp formation was higher from the former as the uv persulfate treatment time prolonged or the persulfate dosage increased the formation of tcm and dcan continuously decreased while that of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm presented an increasing and then decreasing pattern so4 activated benzoic acid ba to form phenolic compounds that enhanced the formation of tcm and ch while it deactivated resorcinol to decrease the formation of tcm so4 reacted with aliphatic amines such as methylamine ma and dimethylamine dma to form nitro groups which significantly increased the formation of tcnm in post chlorination and the rate was determined to be higher than that of ho this study illuminated the diverse impacts of the structures of the precursors on dbp formation after uv persulfate treatment and dbp alteration depended on the reactivity between so4 and specific precursor graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation process sulfate radicals hydroxyl radicals disinfection byproducts natural organic matter water treatment 1 introduction sulfate radicals so4 e0 2 5 3 1 v based advanced oxidation processes aops have been being extensively investigated for the abatement of a variety of micropollutants in water treatment anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 ghanbari and moradi 2017 compared to hydroxyl radicals ho e0 1 8 2 7 v so4 is more selective and reacts with micropollutants with rate constants in a range of 106 109 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 ji et al 2016 hou et al 2017 the efficiencies of so4 based aops for the abatement of most micropollutants were reported to be comparable or higher compared to those of ho based aops yang et al 2014 2019 the uv persulfate aop is one of the typical so4 based aops antoniou et al 2010 lian et al 2017 and the solid phase and high aqueous solubility of persulfate allow it easier to be stored and transported than h2o2 hou et al 2018 thus the uv persulfate aop could be an alternative to the uv h2o2 aop for water treatment oxidation treatment can activate or deactivate some disinfection byproduct dbp precursors to increase or decrease dbp formation compared to chlorination alone the oxidation of natural organic matter nom by chlorine dioxide ozone ferrate and permanganate reduced the formation potential of most dbps in post chlorination such as trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans and chloral hydrate ch lamsal et al 2011 yang et al 2013a chu et al 2015b meanwhile the oxidation of nom by ferrate and ozone significantly increased the formation of trichloronitromethane tcnm in post chlorination compared to chlorination alone bond et al 2014 gan et al 2015 the uv h2o2 aop via producing ho can alter the properties of dbp precursors and influence dbp formation during the subsequent chlorination the yield of thms increased by 20 118 and 143 after uv h2o2 treatment followed by chlorination compared to chlorination alone under simulated drinking water distribution system conditions and in a drinking water treatment plant respectively dotson et al 2010 metz et al 2011 additionally the n nitrosodimethylamine ndma formation potential increased when diltiazem was treated with the uv h2o2 aop chen et al 2011 however the thm formation potential was reported to be decreased after the uv h2o2 treatment of surface water and three raw water samples from different water treatment plants due to the decreased hydrophobicity and aromaticity of nom lamsal et al 2011 lin and wang 2011 the formation of trichloromethane tcm and dichloroacetonitrile dcan slightly decreased after uv h2o2 treatment of five amino acids chu et al 2016b moreover uv h2o2 treatment of chloramphenicol increased the formation of tcnm zhang et al 2017 whereas it decreased the formation of haloacetamides hacams hans and tcnm from a filtered drinking water chu et al 2014 thus oxidation treatment can alter the precursors of specific dbps and the structures of precursors and water matrices are of great importance for dbp alteration when the uv persulfate aop is used to reduce target pollutants the precursors of dbps such as nom and organic nitrogen compounds can be altered nom one of the major dbp precursors is several orders of magnitude higher in concentration than micropollutants in surface water and drinking water guo et al 2017 hua et al 2019 which can significantly compete with micropollutants for so4 fang and shang 2012 thus the properties of nom could also be affected by uv persulfate treatment and further influence the dbp formation during the subsequent chlorination the formation of tcm increased but that of dcan decreased after uv persulfate treatment of nom and amino acids respectively xie et al 2015 chu et al 2016b the carboxylic groups on the aromatics of nom can be converted into hydroxyl groups when it was exposed to so4 leading to the increased reactivity between nom and chlorine and thus the enhancement of the formation potential of tcm and haas lu et al 2016 moreover uv persulfate treatment achieved a considerable reduction in the formation of hacams hans and tcnm in post chlorination from a filtered drinking water chu et al 2015a the tcm formation decreased from 2 4 di tert butylphenol but increased from chloramphenicol after uv persulfate treatment followed by chlorination chu et al 2016a wang et al 2018 thus the dbp alteration after uv persulfate treatment depends on the precursor properties and water matrices it is necessary to investigate the dbp alteration and the underlying mechanism of uv persulfate treatment of nom and model compounds representing the typical precursor structures the objectives of this study were as follows 1 to investigate the alteration in the dbp formation during post chlorination after so4 and ho oxidation from nom and typical model compounds 2 to investigate the effects of the treatment time persulfate dosage and water matrices on the dbp formation from nom by uv persulfate the selected model compounds were typical aromatic compounds of benzoic acid ba and resorcinol as well as typical organic nitrogen compounds of methylamine ma dimethylamine dma and glycine 2 materials and methods 2 1

tribromethane tbm ch dcan dibromoacetonitrile dban bromochloroacetonitrile bcan tcnm and 1 1 1 trichloro 2 propanone 1 1 1 tcp were determined according to the usepa method 551 1 usepa 1998 the dbps were extracted with mtbe which were then analyzed using a gas chromatograph gc agilent 7890a system equipped with an electron capture detector ecd and a hp 5 fused silica capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm j w scientific the total organic carbon toc was measured with a toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph the concentration of free chlorine was determined by the dpd fas titration method apha awwa wef 2012 the ph was measured by a ph meter fe20 mettler toledo the h2o2 concentration was measured by an i3 colorimetric method klassen et al 1994 ba and resorcinol were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 coupled with a diode array detector the wavelengths were set at 227 nm and 273 nm for ba and resorcinol respectively ma dma and glycine were measured by hplc using pre column derivatization by fluorenylmethyl chloroformate fmoc coupled with a fluorescence detector an agilent poroshell c 18 column 4 6 mm 50 mm 2 7 μm held at a temperature of 30 c was used to measure the model compounds the second order rate constants of resorcinol with ho and so4 were determined by competition kinetics details in text s1 the significance of observed differences was evaluated by using t test to calculate p values and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 2 3 experimental procedures the photochemical experiments were carried out in a 700 ml cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor equipped with a low pressure mercury uv lamp 254 nm gph135t5l 4 heraeus noblelight in the centerline of the cylindrical reactor the photon flux entering the solution and the optical path length were determined to be 3 78 μe l 1 s 1 and 3 38 cm by the iodide iodate chemical actinometry bolton et al 2011 and measuring the photolysis rate of h2o2 baxendale and wilson 1957 respectively in all cases a thermostat thd 0515 tianheng china was used to control the reaction temperature at 25 0 2 c a 700 ml test solution containing a certain dbp precursor nom or model compounds and 2 mm phosphate buffer was dosed with persulfate or h2o2 and simultaneously exposed to uv irradiation the dosage of persulfate or h2o2 was 200 μm which was similar to that used for micropollutant abatement lutze et al 2015b hou et al 2017 at a predetermined time of uv exposure an aliquot of chlorine was added to the solution to ensure the residual chlorine after 24 h of chlorination was greater than 1 mg l subsequently the sample was well mixed and transferred into a headspace free 60 ml brown glass bottle the bottles were stored in an incubator under a constant temperature of 25 c after 24 h of dark chlorination residual chlorine was measured and the samples quenched by ascorbic acid were extracted with mtbe for the analysis of dbps the experiments to investigate the effects of water matrices on the dbp alteration after uv persulfate treatment were conducted by adding certain concentrations of chloride bromide and bicarbonate accordingly control tests to study the dbp formation after direct uv photolysis or without any treatment were carried out in a similar manner meanwhile additional tests were conducted to measure the degradation of nom and model compounds in which their uv254 toc and concentrations of the model compounds were measured during uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments all experiments were performed at least twice and the error bars represented the maximum and minimum of the experimental data 2 4 computer simulation the steady state concentrations of ho and so4 were simulated by a kinetic model using kintecus v5 50 ianni 2015 following hou et al 2017 the rate constants of ma and dma reacting with ho and so4 were determined by the model using the data fitting function of kintecus figure s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of uv persulfate treatment on dbp formation from nom 3 1 1 comparison of uv h2o2 and uv persulfate fig 1 displays the dbp formation in nom solution after uv uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments followed with subsequent 24 h of chlorination uv direct photolysis barely affected the formation of dbps in post chlorination which was consistent with previous study dotson et al 2010 the uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments showed a similar trend for all dbp formation compared to chlorination alone the yields of tcm and dcan in post chlorination decreased after uv persulfate or uv h2o2 treatment whereas those of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm increased due to the alteration of nom by so4 and or ho nevertheless the formation of most dbps except for 1 1 1 tcp after uv persulfate treatment was lower than that after uv h2o2 treatment the yields of tcm and dcan were 231 and 2 2 μg l respectively after 24 h of chlorination alone the formation of tcm decreased by 40 p 0 003 and 50 p 0 004 respectively after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments while that of dcan decreased by 54 p 0 002 and 55 p 0 004 on the other hand the yields of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm were 10 5 7 and 0 1 μg l respectively after 24 h of chlorination alone the formation of ch increased by 527 p 0 001 and 217 p 0 001 after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments respectively while that of tcnm increased by 350 p 0 001 and 153 p 0 002 respectively and that of 1 1 1 tcp increased by 117 p 0 006 and 136 p 0 016 respectively the dbp formation after uv persulfate treatment was significantly changed which is inconsistent with the previous study xie et al 2015 this is likely due to a relatively lower oxidant dosage 30 μm used in the previous study compared with this study 200 μm the persulfate dosage and uv fluence used in this study were similar to those used for micropollutant abatement gao et al 2012 hou et al 2017 the impact of uv persulfate treatment on the dbp formation in post chlorination could be ascribed to the property changes of nom 1 the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva which is an indicator of the aromatic and hydrophobic components of organic matter westerhoff et al 1999 weishaar et al 2003 and positively correlates with the formation of thms singer 1999 decreased from 4 30 to 1 86 and 2 89 l mg 1 cm 1 after 20 min of uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatment respectively table s1 2 the oxidation of nom by ho or so4 can activate the precursors to increase the formation of some dbps the increased formation of halo aldehydes and halo ketones such as ch and 1 1 1 tcp after uv persulfate treatment could be ascribed to the formation of aldehydes and ketones by ho or so4 xie et al 2015 meanwhile the amine groups of nom may be partially transformed into nitro groups by so4 which decreased the dcan formation but promoted the tcnm formation the formation of dbps after uv h2o2 treatment was higher than those after uv persulfate treatment due to the different reactivities of ho and so4 with nom and their different concentrations the reactivity of nom with ho k ho nom 2 5 104 l mg 1 s 1 is higher than that with so4 k so4 nom 2 103 l mg 1 s 1 hou et al 2018 the steady state concentrations of ho and so4 in uv persulfate treatment were 2 5 10 13 m and 4 2 10 11 m respectively while that of ho was 2 5 10 12 m in uv h2o2 treatment the higher concentration of ho and higher reactivity with nom led to the formation of more precursors of some dbps after uv h2o2 treatment for example the formation of acetaldehyde after uv h2o2 treatment were 128 higher than those after uv persulfate treatment at 30 μm h2o2 or persulfate xie et al 2015 which induced the higher yields of ch accordingly the chlorine consumption after uv persulfate treatment was 6 lower than that after uv h2o2 treatment figure s3 meanwhile suva of nom reduced after either uv h2o2 or uv persulfate treatment and the reduction degree was lower after uv h2o2 resulting in the higher yields of tcm after uv h2o2 compared to uv persulfate 3 1 2 effects of uv persulfate treatment time and persulfate dosage on dbp formation from nom fig 2 a shows the impact of the treatment time on the formation of dbps with increasing the treatment time from 0 to 30 min the formation of tcm and dcan continuously decreased whereas the formation of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm showed an increasing and then decreasing trend the maximum formation of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm occurred at 20 20 and 10 min which increased by 217 p 0 003 136 p 0 016 and 179 p 0 002 respectively the characteristics of nom were altered during the exposure of so4 and ho which may increase the formation of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm per unit doc meanwhile the concentration of doc continuously decreased with increasing treatment time table s1 indicating the degradation and mineralization of nom which was responsible for the decreased formation of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm fig 2b shows the effects of the persulfate dosage on dbp formation with increasing the persulfate dosage from 0 to 500 μm the formation of tcm and dcan continuously decreased by 86 p 0 001 and 73 p 0 001 the formation of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm displayed an increasing and then decreasing pattern with a maximum formation at 200 μm persulfate the chlorine consumption decreased monotonously with increasing persulfate dosage figure s4 the steady state concentrations of so4 and ho increased by 141 and 132 respectively with increasing the persulfate dosage from 200 to 500 μm compared with the prolonged treatment time increasing the persulfate dosage showed a similar effect on dbp formation due to the enhanced exposure of radicals 3 1 3 effects of water matrices in uv persulfate treatment on dbp formation from nom typical water matrix components such as chloride bromide and bicarbonate can affect the chemistry of the uv persulfate and chlorination processes fig 3 shows the effects of chloride bromide and bicarbonate on the formation of dbps from nom after uv persulfate treatment followed by chlorination the formation of tcm ch 1 1 1 tcp dcan and tcnm slightly increased by 10 p 0 127 15 p 0 049 27 p 0 057 3 p 0 670 and 5 p 0 009 respectively after uv persulfate treatment followed by chlorination in the presence of 1 mm chloride no free chlorine and dbps were detected during the uv persulfate treatment in the presence of 1 mm chloride data not shown meanwhile the steady state concentration of so4 decreased to 1 0 10 12 m and that of ho increased to 4 0 10 12 m which was likely to enhance the dbp formation in post chlorination after uv persulfate treatment with the presence of chloride in the presence of 5 μm bromide the yields of chlorinated dbps decreased whereas those of brominated dbps such as bdcm dbcm tbm dban and bcan significantly increased after uv persulfate treatment followed by chlorination the total formation of thms and hans increased by 46 p 0 003 and 115 p 0 002 with the presence of 5 μm bromide no brominated dbps were detected during uv persulfate data not shown in uv persulfate process the steady state concentration of so4 decreased by 40 in the presence of 5 μm bromide which may enhance thm and han formation meanwhile bromide reacted with free chlorine to form free bromine during subsequent chlorination resulting in the bromination of nom to form brominated dbps liu and croué 2016 bromine reacted with nom ten times faster than chlorine westerhoff et al 2004 leading to more halogen consumption figure s5 and higher formation of dbps with the presence of bromide the yields of tcm ch dcan and tcnm increased by 37 3 52 and 34 respectively while that of 1 1 1 tcp decreased by 6 when 0 5 mm bicarbonate ions existed in uv persulfate treatment hco3 could scavenge so4 and ho to form co3 the steady state concentrations of so4 and ho decreased by 37 and 65 respectively in the presence of 0 5 mm hco3 which could be responsible for the increase of dbp formation 3 2 effects of uv persulfate treatment on dbp formation from model compounds 3 2 1 benzoic acid and resorcinol ba and resorcinol were selected as model carbon compounds in nom which contain aromatic carboxyl and phenolic groups respectively ba is inert to chlorine while resorcinol is very reactive toward chlorine k 4 103 m 1 s 1 to form tcm and other dbps due to the meta dihydroxybenzene structure gallard and von gunten 2002 deborde and von gunten 2008 fig 4 a shows the dbp formation from ba after uv uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments and subsequent 24 h of chlorination the formation of tcm and ch significantly increased after uv uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments the dbp formation was lower after uv persulfate treatment than that after uv h2o2 treatment compared to chlorination alone the formation of tcm and ch after uv photolysis increased from 2 2 to 66 μg l p 0 001 and from 0 6 to 7 2 μg l p 0 001 respectively the yields of tcm after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments increased to 465 and 321 μg l p 0 001 respectively while those of ch increased to 160 and 61 μg l p 0 001 respectively in addition with increasing the uv persulfate treatment time from 0 to 20 min the yields of tcm and ch monotonically increased figure s6 suva obviously increased after uv persulfate treatment table s1 leading to the increased formation of tcm yang et al 2013b ba has a negligible reactivity with chlorine the removal rates of ba at 20 min were 8 80 and 95 by uv photolysis uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments respectively figure s7 the lower ba removal rate by the uv persulfate treatment compared to the uv h2o2 treatment was due to the higher reactivity of ba toward ho relative to so4 k ba ho 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 k ba so4 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 guan et al 2011 the transformation of ba by ho and so4 formed hydroxylated intermediates such as phenol 2 hydroxybenzoic acid and 4 hydroxybenzoic acid zrinyi and pham 2017 which were much more reactive toward chlorine compared to ba criquet et al 2015 lu et al 2016 thus ba was activated by ho and so4 to increase dbp formation and the formation of tcm ch and 1 1 1 tcp after uv persulfate treatment was lower than it was after uv h2o2 treatment accordingly the chlorine consumption increased from 1 6 to 8 3 and 9 6 mg l respectively after 20 min of uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments figure s8 additionally the chlorine consumption increased with increasing uv persulfate treatment time figure s9 fig 4b shows the dbp formation from resorcinol after uv uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments and subsequent 24 h of chlorination the chlorination of resorcinol significantly formed tcm which reached up to 8344 μg l after 24 h of chlorination interestingly uv uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments significantly decreased the tcm formation by 37 p 0 004 79 p 0 001 and 93 p 0 001 respectively the ch formation slightly increased from 340 to 350 μg l p 0 034 after uv h2o2 treatment but it decreased to 237 p 0 011 and 193 μg l p 0 001 respectively after uv and uv persulfate treatments furthermore as the uv persulfate treatment time increased from 0 to 20 min the formation of tcm and ch decreased monotonically figure s6 resorcinol has a high reactivity with chlorine k 4 103 m 1 s 1 to form thms gallard and von gunten 2002 the removal rates of resorcinol at 20 min were 51 80 and 93 by uv direct photolysis uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments respectively figure s7 in addition the concentration of doc decreased from 3 07 to 2 74 and 2 01 mg l after uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments respectively the degradation and mineralization of resorcinol by uv persulfate and uv h2o2 significantly reduced the precursors of tcm in post chlorination the attack of resorcinol by ho can lead to the aromatic ring opening to form a series of carboxylic acids such as succinic acid malonic acid and oxalic acid and finally carbon dioxide liu et al 2008 so4 may have similar effects on resorcinol these carboxylic acids may react with chlorine at a much lower rate compared to resorcinol resulting in the reduction of chlorine consumption figure s8 and the significant reduction of tcm formation after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments the relatively higher reaction rate constant of resorcinol with ho compared with so4 leads to the lower dbp formation in post chlorination after uv h2o2 treatment compared with after uv persulfate treatment k resorcinol ho 7 5 109 m 1 s 1 k resorcinol so4 2 3 109 m 1 s 1 3 2 2 methylamine dimethylamine and glycine aliphatic amines and amino acids are typical precursors of n dbps which are also typical functional groups in nom and organic nitrogen compounds ma and dma were selected as a representative primary amine and secondary amine respectively and glycine was selected as a representative amino acid fig 5 a shows the formation of dbps from ma after uv uv h2o2 uv persulfate treatments and subsequent 24 h of chlorination obviously the formation of tcnm significantly increased from 0 6 to 162 and 561 μg l p 0 001 respectively after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments moreover the formation of tcnm continuously increased from 122 to 561 μg l p 0 001 with increasing treatment time from 5 to 20 min figure s10 in addition the yields of c dbps and dcan from ma chlorination with or without treatment were insignificant which were less than 8 μg l and less than 0 1 μg l respectively the removal rates of ma were negligible 13 and 3 by uv photolysis uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments respectively at 20 min figure s7 which was due to the higher reactivity of ma with so4 k 3 1 106 m 1 s 1 than that with ho k 1 105 m 1 s 1 table 1 ma could be transformed by ozonation to nitromethane which could be further transformed to tcnm with a transformation rate of 50 during post chlorination mccurry et al 2016 similarly ma may be oxidized by ho and so4 to form nitromethane ho reacts with ma through hydrogen abstraction and generates ch3n h under neutral conditions helali et al 2013 which can be further oxidized to nitromethane this resulted in the enhanced tcnm formation during post chlorination after uv h2o2 treatment the degradation of ma by uv persulfate was faster than that by uv h2o2 indicating that more nitromethane may be formed after uv persulfate treatment therefore more tcnm was generated after uv persulfate treatment with post chlorination than after uv h2o2 treatment fig 5b shows the formation of dbps from dma after uv uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments followed by 24 h of chlorination the altered trend of dbp formation from dma by uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments was similar to that from ma but the yields of tcnm were lower specifically the formation of tcnm was 3 4 μg l after chlorination alone and it increased to 14 p 0 021 and 54 μg l p 0 001 after 20 min of uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments followed by chlorination respectively the formation of tcnm continuously increased with increasing uv persulfate treatment times figure s10 the formation of c dbps and dcan was higher after uv h2o2 treatment than that after uv persulfate treatment nevertheless their formation with or without treatment was insignificant dma can be oxidized by ho to form n methylformaldimine ch3n ch2 which can be further transformed to nitromethane wang et al 2017 and then formed tcnm during post chlorination 12 and 18 of dma was degraded by uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments respectively figure s7 indicating that dma was more reactive toward so4 k 6 1 106 m 1 s 1 than ho k 1 6 105 m 1 s 1 table 1 additionally so4 prefers to degrade organic compounds via dealkylation compared to ho lutze et al 2015a thus dma could be transformed to ma via demethylation therefore the alteration trend of dbp formation from dma particularly tcnm by uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments was similar to that from ma fig 5c shows the dbp formation from glycine after uv uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments followed by 24 h of chlorination the formation of tcnm was 0 6 μg l with chlorination alone which increased to 1 1 p 0 026 and 0 9 μg l p 0 001 after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments respectively the formation of dcan decreased from 0 3 to 0 2 p 0 028 and 0 1 μg l p 0 001 respectively after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments meanwhile the formation of c dbps such as tcm and ch was insignificant from glycine with or without treatment the formation of all dbps except for 1 1 1 tcp was higher after uv h2o2 treatment than that after uv persulfate treatment with increasing uv persulfate treatment time the formation of tcm and tcnm increased initially and then decreased with a maximum at 10 min whereas the formation of dcan monotonously decreased figure s10 the higher tcm and lower dcan formation from glycine after uv persulfate treatment was consistent with the previous study chu et al 2016b the alteration trends of tcnm formation from glycine after uv persulfate and uv h2o2 treatments was different than those from ma and dma which is likely due to the different reaction pathways of amino acids from primary amines the removal rates of glycine were 24 and 16 respectively by uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments figure s7 the reaction rate constant of glycine with ho was higher than that with so4 k glycine ho 1 7 107 m 1 s 1 k glycine so4 9 106 m 1 s 1 nist 2018 the carboxylic acid in glycine led to a low electron cloud density on the amino group which made it difficult to cleave the carbon bond of glycine to form nitromethane mccurry et al 2016 furthermore ho reacts with glycine through two pathways one is hydrogen abstraction at the α carbon and then deamination to generate oxalic acid the other is hydrogen abstraction from the amine group and then deamination to generate formic acid ying et al 2015 the deamination of glycine by radicals led to less tcnm formation on the other hand amino acids react with chlorine to produce aldehydes and nitriles deborde and von gunten 2008 which act as the precursors of some dbps such as ch and dcan intermediates formed from glycine after uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments had low reactivity toward chlorine leading to less chlorine consumption figure s8 and the decreasing formation of ch and dcan figure s10 in summary ho and so4 could activate aromatic rings such as ba through hydroxylation to form phenolic components which increased the formation of tcm and ch in post chlorination additionally the oxidation by ho and so4 could deactivate the precursors such as resorcinol to decrease the c dbp formation the oxidation of the amine groups in aliphatic amines significantly promoted the formation of tcnm after uv persulfate treatment 4 conclusions and engineering implications dbp alteration after uv persulfate treatment primarily depends on the structures of precursors and water matrices for nom the formation of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm increased whereas those of tcm and dcan decreased after the uv persulfate treatment followed with chlorination the influence of uv h2o2 treatment on dbp formation was similar to that of uv persulfate treatment and the dbp formation after uv h2o2 treatment was higher than that after uv persulfate treatment with increasing treatment time and persulfate dosage the formation of ch 1 1 1 tcp and tcnm increased at first and then decreased but the formation of tcm and dcan decreased monotonously the presence of chloride and bicarbonate in uv persulfate treatment increased the formation of chlorinated dbps whereas bromide decreased the chlorinated dbp formation but increased the formation of brominated dbps for the model compounds the formation of tcm and ch from ba and that of tcnm from ma and dma significantly increased while the tcm and ch formation from resorcinol dramatically decreased after uv persulfate treatment the dbp formation from glycine slightly changed after uv persulfate treatment although the regulated dbps such as tcm decreased from nom after uv persulfate the unregulated dbps such as ch and tcnm significantly increased which were reported to possess higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than the regulated dbps richardson et al 2007 the formation of total organic halogen tox deserve further investigation in the future study which is a collective parameter and a toxicity indicator for all the halogenated organic dbps in water this study provided a better understanding of the dbp formation after uv persulfate treatment the structures of precursors played a crucial role in dbp formation after uv persulfate treatment and the dbp alteration depended on the reactivity of precursors with ho and so4 both so4 and ho activated benzoate to enhance the formation of tcm and ch but deactivated resorcinol to reduce the tcm formation the reactivity of so4 with benzoate and resorcinol was lower than that of ho thus the dbp alteration was lower by so4 on the other hand the reactivity of so4 with primary amines was higher than that of ho resulting in more dramatic increase of the tcnm formation after uv persulfate treatment water matrices such as halides and alkalinity affected the radical chemistry during uv persulfate treatment which further influenced the dbp formation nevertheless so4 reacted with these water matrices about one magnitude order lower than that of ho neta et al 1988 buxton et al 1988 making so4 based aop much less susceptible than ho based aop thus uv persulfate treatment could be an alternative to uv h2o2 in controlling dbps as well as in the abatement of contaminants declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

18822,in this study fe zeolite a as a phosphate adsorbent was synthesized by incorporating iron into the framework of zeolite a using ammonium iron citrate as the fe3 source the adsorption in acidic condition and desorption of phosphate in alkaline condition from an aqueous solution was repetitively performed for 18 times in batch test using fe zeolite a the rate of adsorption and desorption of po4 3 was much faster consistently than any of the reported study so far the crystalline phase of pristine zeolite changed to amorphous after one adsorption phase and ultimately transformed into a highly amorphous phase after 18 adsorption desorption cycles it was due to the formation of more active sites on the surface of the zeolite by a release of atoms breaking of bonds and deposition of metal and phosphate compounds on the surface by rigorous acid base treatment increase in active sites enhanced the sorption efficiency of fe zeolite a with the help of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques it was found that fe3 al3 and na metal ions of the fe zeolite a were involved in the adsorption desorption of po4 3 fe3 ion exhibited ligand exchange mechanism by exchanging oh ions with po4 3 al3 and na exhibited interactions like precipitation hydrogen bonding and diffusion respectively to adsorb po4 3 fe3 metal ion dominated over other metal ions by ligand exchange principle making the sorption process a highly reversible one the adsorbent showed quantitative adsorption desorption capacity even after continuous 18 cycles indicating a higher level of reusability graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption ligand exchange mechanism phosphate reusability zeolite 1 introduction the global supply of potable domestic agricultural and industrial water has been greatly affected by the ever increasing pollution originating from anthropogenic activities kumar et al 2014 though stringent rules maintained by regulatory bodies can be relaxed for industrial water but the same is not true for other forms the scarcity of freshwater bodies has forced stack holders to look for reclamation and reuse of treated wastewater for sustainable management of these valuable resources phosphorus p in the form of phosphates is one of the key elements required for the growth of plants and animals however a high concentration of phosphates in water bodies turns out to be a major contaminant xie et al 2014 though weathering of phosphate rocks is the natural source of phosphate enrichment in water bodies major culprits are mining fertilizer industries agriculture and sewage disposal carpenter and bennett 2011 amplification in the p concentration leads to eutrophication of water bodies boeykens et al 2017 this uncontrolled growth is the deciding factor in the availability of dissolved oxygen for aquatic organisms in the extreme cases of eutrophication the oxygen concentration reaches so low that it is impossible for living organisms to sustain drewry et al 2009 wang et al 2008 to maintain the quality of water in freshwater bodies various physical and chemical methods have been developed for p removal from water or wastewater such as anion exchange sendrowski and boyer 2013 alshameri et al 2014a 2014b adsorption boopathy et al 2013 lito et al 2012 membrane nanofiltration leo et al 2011 chemical precipitation huang et al 2011 xia et al 2016 and electrodialysis kabay et al 2008 out of these adsorption using minerals is considered an efficient economic and green approach for po4 3 p removal even at a low concentration however natural minerals are not as efficient as their modified forms and for this incorporation of metals ions like al3 fe3 la3 etc in matrices is achieved for the charge inversion liu et al 2016 guaya et al 2015 he et al 2016 zeolite in the modified form has been in the limelight for its unique ability to adsorb a considerable amount of phosphate moreover the adsorbed phosphate can be desorbed using suitable methods for further usage loganathan et al 2014 as evident from the literature properties of zeolites can be tuned by incorporating different metals into the matrices which serve as the primary binding sites for phosphate ions iron incorporation into adsorbents is highly preferred due to its economic eco friendly and semiconductor properties most of the studies feature optimization of the adsorption process which is followed by physical aspects of the process only a limited number of studies are available which provide an insight into the active metal ions of the zeolite frame in the sorption process moreover another aspect that literature is deprived off is the reusability studies for a considerably large number of cycles without which commenting on its industrial application seems unreasonable the framework topology of zeolite and its adsorption ability have been studied very well but the behavior of metal ions participating in the adsorption and desorption of phosphate is still untouched almeelbi and bezbaruah reported that non zero valent iron nzvi exhibited superior adsorption rate as compared to previously reported iron based adsorbents such as hydroxy iron iron hydroxide eggshell waste synthetic goethite steel slag etc for adsorption of phosphate from aqueous solution almeelbi and bezbaruah 2012 about 88 95 of the phosphate was adsorbed by nzvi within 10 min whereas it took 60 min for complete removal 96 100 and 80 recovery was possible for lanthanum calcium and aluminum hydroxide impregnated zeolites the equilibrium was achieved after 15 72 h of contact time mitrogiannis et al 2018 meng et al 2013 and thus making the adsorption process ineffective on the grounds of time thus apart from understanding the phosphate adsorption desorption mechanism onto metal doped zeolites achieving a higher adsorption rate is one of the targets in the present study here we have synthesized zeolite a and iron incorporated modified zeolite a fe zeolite a with ammonium iron citrate aic as fe source and optimized the phosphate adsorption onto fe zeolite a we conducted batch tests for 18 adsorption desorption cycles with the synthesized fe zeolite a unravelling the behavior of different metal ions in fe zeolite a and the key metal ion among it towards adsorption desorption of phosphate is the prima facie of this paper which is supported by various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques like sem eds xrd ft ir and xps additionally efforts have been made to comment positively on reusability and sustainability 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of fe zeolite a zeolite a was synthesized in a hydrothermal reactor by sol gel method sodium silicate na2sio3 junsei chemicals co ltd was used as the silica source sodium aluminate 37 na2o

calcination at 500 c for 5 h to eliminate organic compounds like citrate kim et al 2013 2 2 adsorption and desorption experiments 2 2 1 adsorption isotherm tests in order to calculate the adsorption capacity of fe zeolite a 4 g l 1 of fe zeolite a was introduced into four different beakers having 500 ml of 2 mg l 1 5 mg l 1 10 mg l 1 and 20 mg l 1 of po4 3 solution exactly 2 ml of phosphate

pre equilibrated at ph 10 was added into it and was stirred at 150 rpm after equilibration for the desired time a suitable aliquot of the aqueous phase was taken out with a disposable syringe filter hyundai micro model sn25p045ns having microfiltration membrane pore size 0 45 μm to lock the zeolite materials the locked zeolite was pumped back into the aqueous solution by pumping a small volume of distilled water through the syringe to avoid loss of zeolite in the test jar the samples were analyzed by uv vis spectrophotometer standard method after the adsorption study the ph of the solution was raised to 10 0 using 0 1 n naoh solution to proceed for desorption study studies were conducted as a function of time and samples were collected after completion of one adsorption desorption cycle the medium was again subjected to ph change from 10 0 to 5 0 zeolite samples were withdrawn for characterization after the termination of adsorption and desorption studies of the 1st 9th and 18th cycle 2

synthesized zeolite a were observed under a scanning electron microscope the sem images fig 1 of both the samples looked well crystallized with a regular hexahedron shape as compared to zeolite a the crystalline surface of fe zeolite a appeared to be rough evidently the synthesis protocol for incorporating fe in the framework of zeolite a was successful the xrd patterns of zeolite a and fe zeolite a are shown in fig 2 the characteristic peaks of the crystalline phase of zeolite a are 7 2 10 3 12 6 16 2 21 8 24 26 2 27 2 30 30 9 31 1 32 6 33 4 and 34 3 treacy and higgins 2001 the characteristic peak of crystalline zeolite a also appeared in fe zeolite a it suggested the formation of high crystalline zeolite a structure in both the samples a slight decrease in the intensity of the xrd peak of fe zeolite a was observed the decreased x ray diffraction pattern indicates a change in phase due to the incorporation of new atoms or due to the occupation of cation exchange sites fe in the fe zeolite a framework aziz et al 2016 variations observed in the reflection intensities for fe zeolite a were due to fe ions fig 2 the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds gave clear evidence of the presence of fe in the framework of fe zeolite a the elemental compositions of both the samples are summarized in table 2 3 2 phosphate adsorption and desorption experiments 3 2 1 batch test for

isotherm constant and n sorption intensity sun et al 2017 the best fitted model was found to be the langmuir freundlich isotherm model with r2 0 990 and thus indicated the physicochemical adsorption of phosphate onto the surface of fe zeolite a fig 3 the maximum adsorption capacity was 18 154 mg g 1 table 3 the molar adsorption ratio i e moles of p moles of al fe was found to be 1 378 3 2 2 continuous batch test in this study mass of po4 3 adsorbed and desorbed by the zeolite material were monitored as a function of time cycle 1 of fig 4 a it is evident from the study that the mass of po4 3 in the stock aqueous solution got declined from 4 725 mg to 0 145 mg within 1 min it states 97 of the po4 3 mass was adsorbed in 10 min of contact time 4 7107 mg po4 3 mass was adsorbed 99 suggesting rapid phosphate adsorption onto fe zeolite a by changing the ph of the aqueous phase about 4 104 mg of po4 3 88 2 desorption from the loaded fe zeolite a was achieved in 10 min of contact time after 30 min of contact time the desorbed mass of phosphate was about 4 715 mg which is nearly 100 one complete adsorption desorption cycle took only 40 min making it one of the robust adsorbents highly suitable for phosphate removal robustness and reusability of the adsorbent are two of the important factors that should be kept in mind before commenting on its industrial application faster adsorption desorption cycle for an adsorbent makes wastewater treatment plant economical as larger volumes of wastewater can be treated per day reversibility of fe zeolite a to adsorb and desorb po4 3 was studied for 11 cycles to understand the ease of the process fig 4a it is clear from the initial cycles a trend where a very higher mass of po4 3 getting adsorbed and desorbed was observed probably due to a more ordered structure of the synthesized fe zeolite a since the adsorption occurred via ligand exchange and precipitation gradually after the 2nd cycle the mass of po4 3 desorbed was not up to the level of po4 3 adsorbed adsorption out numbered desorption from the 2nd cycle to the 8th cycle irregularities were reported from the 2nd cycle to the 8th cycle where adsorbed mass was higher or lower than the corresponding desorbed mass of po4 3 suggesting a distorted structure and involvement of multiple mechanisms in the process nevertheless phosphate adsorption onto fe zeolite a was found highly reversible 3 2 3 reusability test for 7 cycles an economic adsorbent is titled to the one which shows good adsorption capacity even after a large number of adsorption desorption cycles to ensure that fe zeolite a is suitable for a higher number of adsorption desorption cycles instead of fresh fe zeolite a the regenerated sample after performing 11 adsorption desorption cycles for previous studies was studied to evaluate its adsorption and desorption performance for another 7 cycles and results have been depicted in fig 4b in this test a freshly prepared po4 3 solution was introduced into the system for each adsorption desorption cycle the mass of phosphate adsorbed and desorbed by the zeolite material from the aqueous solution remained almost consistent where 90 of the po4 3 mass was adsorbed and desorbed even after 7 cycles it again suggested a quantitative and qualitative reversible nature of fe zeolite a to adsorb and desorb phosphate and puts light on its excellent reusability characteristic this near quantitative adsorption performance of fe zeolite a is attributed by the conversion of zeolite material from the crystalline phase to a highly amorphous phase which is supported by the xrd results depicted below the less is the crystallinity of an adsorbent the more is its adsorption capacity gupta et al 2019 3 3 characterization of adsorbent before and after phosphate adsorption 3 3 1 scanning electron microscopy sem images for fe zeolite a before and after the adsorption of phosphate have been organized in fig 5 from the images that phosphate ions were adsorbed and deposited onto the surface of fe zeolite a particles but after desorption in the 9th cycle the surface cleaned up for further adsorption showing the reversibility of the process in the 18th cycle of adsorption a higher concentration of phosphate ions can be found deposited onto the surface validating that the adsorption capacity of fe zeolite a increased with the increasing number of cycles which is evident from xrd study as well in the upcoming section 3 3 5 the sem image for desorption after 18th cycle showed an uneven surface of the hexahedron framework of fe zeolite a after rigorous and continuous adsorption desorption of phosphate for 18 cycles and thus lowering the crystallinity of the adsorbent 3 3 2 eds analysis the first and foremost thing in this study was to know the validation of different atoms present in the fe zeolite a framework and its quantification in weight as mentioned in section 3 1 and table 2 fe is present along with na al and si in a fe zeolite a material to know any alteration in its elemental composition in the span of 18 cycles of adsorption and desorption of po4 3 from its pristine form it was compared with po4 3 loaded fe zeolite a sample of the 9th cycle a distinct peak for p was observed in the eds plot for loaded fe zeolite a showing that phosphorus was adsorbed and delocalized in the zeolite framework of fe zeolite a as evident from elemental mapping from table 2 it is evident that the weight of na showed a drastic fall validating the fact that na interacted with phosphate to form soluble phosphates sabadash et al 2016 the decrease in weight of al was may be due to the addition of surplus phosphate on the surface in the form of metal phosphate precipitates led to an escalation in the overall weight of fe zeolite a eds analysis of fe zeolite a in the pristine form along with p adsorbed in the 9th cycle and elemental mapping have been shown in supplementary figs s6 s7 and s8 respectively 3 3 3 xps analysis to gain further insight about the elements participating in the phosphate adsorption and desorption process xps analysis of fe zeolite a in the pristine form after phosphate adsorption and after phosphate desorption in the 9th cycle and the 18th cycle was conducted fig 6 the fe 2p peak of pristine fe zeolite a at 710 98 ev shifted to 712 98 ev after the adsorption phase of the 9th cycle this strong shift of 2 0 ev clearly indicates the involvement of fe3 in the phosphate adsorption process and the formation of feop bonds after phosphate desorption from the loaded fe zeolite a in the 9th cycle the peak shifted back to 712 18 ev probably due to the reversible nature of the adsorption process it showed a similar pattern in the 18th cycle as the fe 2p peak shifted to 712 98 ev and 712 08 ev after the adsorption phase and desorption phase respectively the xps data suggests that the active sites having iron formed inner sphere complexes ligand exchange with po4 3 in a reversible manner exchanging with oh in all 18 cycles fig 9 in case of aluminum the peak shift corresponding to al 2p shifted to from 73 78 ev pristine fe zeolite a to 73 68 ev after the adsorption phase of the 9th cycle suggested an interaction of phosphate ions with framework al the peak shifted to 73 88 ev after the desorption phase of the 9th cycle from the slight decline in peak intensity of al 2p and xrd analysis it was confirmed that rigorous acid base treatments in consecutive cycles collapsed the zeolite framework which may have led to the initiation of zeolite dealumination it also helped in the escalation in adsorption as well as desorption phosphate after the 9th cycle fig 4 the available al3 ions might have interacted with phosphate and got adsorbed as al h2po4 3 and al2 hpo4 3 in the active sites sabadash et al 2016 bij and weckhuysen 2015 for this reason low peak shift in the earlier stages of adsorption desorption was overturned by a shift of 0 3 ev in the 18th cycle where al 2p peak at 73 88 ev shifted to 74 18 ev after adsorption the increase in peak intensity of al 2p after adsorption phase of the 18th cycle and sem image after adsorption phase of 18th cycle fig 5 also suggested the precipitation of al and phosphate compounds on the surface of fe zeolite a in the form of soluble al h2po4 3 al2 hpo4 3 and insoluble alpo4 bij and weckhuysen 2015 in the p desorbed xps spectrum of the 18th cycle the intensity of al 2p was found lower than that of the pristine one suggesting the loss of free al arising from the dealumination of zeolite framework in the aqueous phase as soluble al h2po4 3 xh2o bij and weckhuysen 2015 thus apart from fe ions framework al ions were found involved in the phosphate sorption process the na 1s peak of pristine fe zeolite a shifted from 1071 58 ev to 1072 18 ev in the adsorption phase of the 9th cycle and to 1072 08 ev in the desorption phase this 0 60 ev shift of na 1s in the adsorption phase and 0 10 ev reverse shift in the successive desorption phase suggests the involvement of na metal ion in the adsorption and desorption of phosphate ion a similar pattern in the peak shift of na 1s can be seen in the 18th cycle as well the intensity of the na 1s peak at 1071 58 ev kept on decreasing with each cycle showing the loss of na ions from fe zeolite a to the aqueous phase at a low ph protons interact chemically with the zeolite framework and are accompanied by the release of sodium ions into the aqueous phase which in turn leads to the formation of zeolite new adsorption centres the phosphate ions may have retained on the zeolite pores in the form of nah2po4 and na2hpo4 sabadash et al 2016 these soluble forms of phosphate may have been removed with na during the desorption process for this reason the intensity of the na 1s peak at 1071 58 ev kept on decreasing from the xrd analysis discussed in section 3 3 5 it was evident that rigorous acid base treatments in consecutive cycles changed the phase of the crystal zeolite framework to a highly amorphous phase it was due to precipitation of metal phosphates on the surface of fe zeolite a and leaching of sodium ions from the fe zeolite a frame due to the rigorous and uninterrupted acid base treatment 3 3 4 ft ir analysis the ft ir spectra of fe zeolite a in the pristine phosphate adsorbed and phosphate desorbed form has been reported in fig 7 in the region of 400 1000 cm 1 the bands observed can be assigned to zeolite backbones which were composed of stretching and bending of siosi and sioal mozgawa et al 2011 after the adsorption of phosphate in the 2nd cycle considerable changes in intensities shifts in the bands along with the disappearance of a band at 557 4 cm 1 were observed all these changes suggest a change in the morphology of fe zeolite a after adsorption as mentioned below in the xrd spectra as well a broad band in the 3800 3100 cm 1 range with the maximum at 3452 4 cm 1 along with a band at 1672 2 cm 1 correspond to oh stretching and bending respectively these bands originated from the hydroxyl groups that are present as a lattice termination silanol groups b hydroxyl groups occurring at defects and c hydroxyl groups attached to fe3 which compensate the negative charge of the framework bij and weckhuysen 2015 gupta et al 2019 anirudhan and senan 2010 the shifts in the bands 3452 4 3438 9 cm 1 and 1672 2 1651 0 cm 1 along with the fall in intensities after phosphate adsorption onto fe zeolite a strongly suggests the involvement of hydroxyl groups in the adsorption process this was further backed by the increase in intensities of bands along with shifts 3438 9 3446 6 cm 1 and 1651 0 1652 9 cm 1 after phosphate desorption 3 3 5 xrd analysis the xrd spectrum of fe zeolite a recorded after adsorption phase of the 1st cycle shows fall in crystallinity of the adsorbent whereas after the adsorption phase of the 18th cycle there is an abrupt fall in its crystallinity making the material an amorphous one fig 8 it is well documented that a lower level of crystallinity in an adsorbent favours the adsorption process which is due to rise of new active sites caused by the release of metal ions such as si and na bij and weckhuysen 2015 gupta et al 2019 the rigorous acid and alkali treatment received by the adsorbent for every adsorption desorption cycle resulted in the phase deterioration of fe zeolite a bij and weckhuysen 2015 precipitation of metal salts on the zeolite surface also might have also contributed to its amorphicity which can be observed in the adsorbed phase of sem images fig 5 the fall in desorption of po4 3 from the 2nd cycle to the 8th cycle fig 4a might be due to surplus precipitation adsorption where al and na contributed more in precipitation forming metal phosphate compounds on the surface of fe zeolite a and less in desorption of po4 3 the increase in desorption efficiency from the 9th cycle fig 4 throws light on the rapid fall in its crystallinity by dealumination as discussed above in section 3 3 3 and leaching of na ion fig 6 the rigorous acid base treatment might have caused the release of precipitated metal ions in the form of soluble metal salts led to the formation of more and more active sites on the surface of fe zeolite a enhancing its adsorption desorption capacity it is also supported by the eds data showing a decline in weight of al fe si and na 3 4 role of fe3 al3 and na metal ions in adsorption and desorption of phosphate in order to deduce the activity of the metal ions fe al and na present in the fe zeolite a framework in the adsorption and desorption of phosphate experimental studies along with microscopic and spectroscopic studies have been carried out the ph variation in the aqueous phase arising from adsorption and desorption of phosphate anion has shed some light on the involvement of oh ions in the process fig 9 with the passing time ph of the aqueous phase increased in the case of adsorption whereas a reverse trend was recorded for desorption suggesting an exchange of oh ions with that of phosphate ions at the active sites thus ligand exchange mechanism or inner sphere complexation mechanism was found predominantly involved in the adsorption desorption process the ft ir analysis illustrated that the intensities of the bands at 3452 4 cm 1 and 1672 2 cm 1 fell with the adsorption of phosphate ions suggesting the replacement of hydroxyl groups bound to fe ions with phosphate ions which was also confirmed by the peak shift observed in fe 2p spectrum after desorption of phosphate a complete reversal in the entire process was confirmed by increased intensities of hydroxyl bands in the ft ir spectrum mozgawa et al 2011 the ligand exchange mechanism for phosphate removal has been reported in the literature on several occasions where hydroxyl groups present on the metal ions la3 al3 fe3 etc in the doped zeolite framework are exchanged with phosphate ions during the adsorption process he et al 2017 xie et al 2015 kim et al 2013 apart from ligand exchange adsorption of phosphate onto fe zeolite a was also governed by surface precipitation in the higher number of cycles where aluminum leached from the zeolite framework formed insoluble phosphate alpo4 and thus precipitated onto the surface which was confirmed by the sem analysis apart from these mechanisms like diffusion too have played some role in the adsorption process as well as evident from the shift in the na 1s peak with an increasing number of cycles along with the decreasing intensities diffusion of phosphate ions into the pores followed by phosphate interaction with na ions leading to the formation of nah2po4 and na2hpo4 were highly probable sabadash et al 2016 the decreasing intensities may be due to the removal of these soluble phosphates from the zeolite surface during the phosphate desorption process weaker forces like electrostatic interactions by fe and hydrogen bonding by al might have contributed to a smaller extent in the phosphate adsorption and desorption process the xrd results shown in fig 8 illustrates the change of phase of fe zeolite a from crystalline to amorphous phase after 1st adsorption phase fig 8a it might be due to precipitation of al h2po4 3 al2 hpo4 3 na2hpo4 and nah2po4 on the zeolite surface and release of metal atoms from the network in the desorption alkaline phase the soluble nature of these salts might also have contributed to the amorphicity the zeolite material ultimately turned into a highly amorphous material in the 18th cycle might be due to rigorous acid base treatment which can be seen in the xrd image fig 8b ligand exchange mechanism encourages sorption of po4 3 in a reversible manner as shown in fig 6 for fe 2p but the coexistence of other mechanisms such as electrostatic attraction precipitation diffusion and hydrogen bonding exhibited by the metal ions in the aqueous solution might have led to a fall in desorption of po4 3 from the 2nd cycle to the 8th cycle fig 4a the precipitated phosphate couldn t desorb and the above interacting mechanisms kept adsorbing po4 3 well in each successive cycles 2nd cycle to 8th cycle the alkaline ph for desorption leached na metal ions and phosphate from its surface which were adsorbed in the adsorption process from the surface it is suggested by seeing the change in intensity of na 1s fig 6 rigorous acid base treatment removed metal ions from the network led to leaching or dealumination of na and al in the form of metal phosphate salts gave rise to new active sites on the surface making fe zeolite a more amorphous and efficient for adsorption desorption process henceforth the material increased its adsorption desorption capacity with the increase in the number of cycles fig 4b the change in elemental weight of the metal ions in the fe zeolite a shown in table 2 also endorses the change in phase finally the sem images fig 5 also shows that the change in the crystallinity of the zeolite might be due to precipitation of alpo4 al h2po4 3 al2 hpo4 3 na2hpo4 and nah2po4 on the surface bij and weckhuysen 2015 sabadash et al 2016 however three of the metal ions fe al and na interacted with po4 3 in the aqueous phase to adsorb and desorb it but fe3 exhibited better adsorption desorption of po4 3 over other metal ions the peak shift adsorption desorption pattern shown by xps of fe 2p fig 6 from the 1st cycle till the 18th cycle and no significant change in peak intensity unlike al 2p and na 1s strongly claims a stable and consistent reversible interaction with po4 3 most probably through ligand exchange principle no change in the peak intensity also suggests the firm incorporation of the doped fe in the fe zeolite a framework hence fe metal ions can be nominated as the dominant metal ion in the fe zeolite a frame which not only boosted the adsorption and desorption speed supplementary data d1 supplementary figs s1 s2 and s3 but also enabled the material to adsorb and desorb po4 3 reversibly for a large number of adsorption desorption cycles a diagrammatic illustration of the behavior of the metal ions is shown in fig 10 4 conclusions in this study fe3 na and al3 in the fe zeolite a participated in the adsorption desorption of phosphate through multiple interactions fe3 metal ions predominantly exhibited ligand exchange mechanism to adsorb and desorb po4 3 by oh exchange from the aqueous solution which enabled the sorption process to be consistently reversible until the last cycle other probable interactions exhibited by the metal ions are an electrostatic attraction by fe3 precipitation and hydrogen bonding by al3 and diffusion by na metal ions the xrd results confirmed that the rigorous acidic alkaline treatment transformed the phase of fe zeolite a surface from crystalline to highly amorphous due to the breaking of bonds a release of metal ions and precipitation the same was supported by the sem images the amorphicity generated new active sites leading to enhanced sorption efficiency fe zeolite a adsorbed 97 of the po4 3 mass within 1 min and it took only 10 min for complete removal for desorption it took only 1 min for 88 2 recovery and 30 min for 100 recovery it adsorbed and desorbed po4 3 unfailingly for 18 adsorption desorption cycles the adsorption data fitted well with the langmuir freundlich isotherm model the maximum adsorption capacity of fe loaded zeolite for phosphate is 18 154 mg g 1 this study concludes that fe zeolite a is a suitable adsorbent for quick adsorption desorption of po4 3 from wastewaters for multiple continuous cycles and its industrial application can be seen in the coming future acknowledgment the authors are very

18822,in this study fe zeolite a as a phosphate adsorbent was synthesized by incorporating iron into the framework of zeolite a using ammonium iron citrate as the fe3 source the adsorption in acidic condition and desorption of phosphate in alkaline condition from an aqueous solution was repetitively performed for 18 times in batch test using fe zeolite a the rate of adsorption and desorption of po4 3 was much faster consistently than any of the reported study so far the crystalline phase of pristine zeolite changed to amorphous after one adsorption phase and ultimately transformed into a highly amorphous phase after 18 adsorption desorption cycles it was due to the formation of more active sites on the surface of the zeolite by a release of atoms breaking of bonds and deposition of metal and phosphate compounds on the surface by rigorous acid base treatment increase in active sites enhanced the sorption efficiency of fe zeolite a with the help of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques it was found that fe3 al3 and na metal ions of the fe zeolite a were involved in the adsorption desorption of po4 3 fe3 ion exhibited ligand exchange mechanism by exchanging oh ions with po4 3 al3 and na exhibited interactions like precipitation hydrogen bonding and diffusion respectively to adsorb po4 3 fe3 metal ion dominated over other metal ions by ligand exchange principle making the sorption process a highly reversible one the adsorbent showed quantitative adsorption desorption capacity even after continuous 18 cycles indicating a higher level of reusability graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption ligand exchange mechanism phosphate reusability zeolite 1 introduction the global supply of potable domestic agricultural and industrial water has been greatly affected by the ever increasing pollution originating from anthropogenic activities kumar et al 2014 though stringent rules maintained by regulatory bodies can be relaxed for industrial water but the same is not true for other forms the scarcity of freshwater bodies has forced stack holders to look for reclamation and reuse of treated wastewater for sustainable management of these valuable resources phosphorus p in the form of phosphates is one of the key elements required for the growth of plants and animals however a high concentration of phosphates in water bodies turns out to be a major contaminant xie et al 2014 though weathering of phosphate rocks is the natural source of phosphate enrichment in water bodies major culprits are mining fertilizer industries agriculture and sewage disposal carpenter and bennett 2011 amplification in the p concentration leads to eutrophication of water bodies boeykens et al 2017 this uncontrolled growth is the deciding factor in the availability of dissolved oxygen for aquatic organisms in the extreme cases of eutrophication the oxygen concentration reaches so low that it is impossible for living organisms to sustain drewry et al 2009 wang et al 2008 to maintain the quality of water in freshwater bodies various physical and chemical methods have been developed for p removal from water or wastewater such as anion exchange sendrowski and boyer 2013 alshameri et al 2014a 2014b adsorption boopathy et al 2013 lito et al 2012 membrane nanofiltration leo et al 2011 chemical precipitation huang et al 2011 xia et al 2016 and electrodialysis kabay et al 2008 out of these adsorption using minerals is considered an efficient economic and green approach for po4 3 p removal even at a low concentration however natural minerals are not as efficient as their modified forms and for this incorporation of metals ions like al3 fe3 la3 etc in matrices is achieved for the charge inversion liu et al 2016 guaya et al 2015 he et al 2016 zeolite in the modified form has been in the limelight for its unique ability to adsorb a considerable amount of phosphate moreover the adsorbed phosphate can be desorbed using suitable methods for further usage loganathan et al 2014 as evident from the literature properties of zeolites can be tuned by incorporating different metals into the matrices which serve as the primary binding sites for phosphate ions iron incorporation into adsorbents is highly preferred due to its economic eco friendly and semiconductor properties most of the studies feature optimization of the adsorption process which is followed by physical aspects of the process only a limited number of studies are available which provide an insight into the active metal ions of the zeolite frame in the sorption process moreover another aspect that literature is deprived off is the reusability studies for a considerably large number of cycles without which commenting on its industrial application seems unreasonable the framework topology of zeolite and its adsorption ability have been studied very well but the behavior of metal ions participating in the adsorption and desorption of phosphate is still untouched almeelbi and bezbaruah reported that non zero valent iron nzvi exhibited superior adsorption rate as compared to previously reported iron based adsorbents such as hydroxy iron iron hydroxide eggshell waste synthetic goethite steel slag etc for adsorption of phosphate from aqueous solution almeelbi and bezbaruah 2012 about 88 95 of the phosphate was adsorbed by nzvi within 10 min whereas it took 60 min for complete removal 96 100 and 80 recovery was possible for lanthanum calcium and aluminum hydroxide impregnated zeolites the equilibrium was achieved after 15 72 h of contact time mitrogiannis et al 2018 meng et al 2013 and thus making the adsorption process ineffective on the grounds of time thus apart from understanding the phosphate adsorption desorption mechanism onto metal doped zeolites achieving a higher adsorption rate is one of the targets in the present study here we have synthesized zeolite a and iron incorporated modified zeolite a fe zeolite a with ammonium iron citrate aic as fe source and optimized the phosphate adsorption onto fe zeolite a we conducted batch tests for 18 adsorption desorption cycles with the synthesized fe zeolite a unravelling the behavior of different metal ions in fe zeolite a and the key metal ion among it towards adsorption desorption of phosphate is the prima facie of this paper which is supported by various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques like sem eds xrd ft ir and xps additionally efforts have been made to comment positively on reusability and sustainability 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of fe zeolite a zeolite a was synthesized in a hydrothermal reactor by sol gel method sodium silicate na2sio3 junsei chemicals co ltd was used as the silica source sodium aluminate 37 na2o

naalo2 were dissolved separately in 170 ml of distilled water the solution of naalo2 was added to na2sio3 solution with continuous stirring the mixture gel was placed on a shaking incubator for 24 h at 25 c for aging the aged mixture was then transferred to a hydrothermal reactor for synthesis the reaction temperature was set at 120 c for 48 h then the synthesized product was washed properly with distilled water until the filtrate ph reached 8 0 finally it was dried at 100 c in a drying oven for overnight table 1 the iron source used for the zeolite was ammonium iron citrate aic fe 17 5 sigma aldrich about 1 5023 g of aic bearing 0 1 of fe al2o3 was dissolved in distilled water to prepare a gel mixture the iron solution and naalo2 solution refer to section 2 1 1 were poured to na2sio3 solution with continuous stirring then the same protocol was followed step by step as mentioned above in the zeolite preparation followed by aging finally the dried product was subjected to calcination at 500 c for 5 h to eliminate organic compounds like citrate kim et al 2013 2 2 adsorption and desorption experiments 2 2 1 adsorption isotherm tests in order to calculate the adsorption capacity of fe zeolite a 4 g l 1 of fe zeolite a was introduced into four different beakers having 500 ml of 2 mg l 1 5 mg l 1 10 mg l 1 and 20 mg l 1 of po4 3 solution exactly 2 ml of phosphate solution was withdrawn at 0 min stock 1 min 5min 15 min and 30 min for analysis the values were fitted to the langmuir freundlich and langmuir freundlich isotherm models the concentration of po4 3 in the aqueous solution was measured using an ion chromatography having dionex ionic as23 analytical column for anions with 4 250 mm dimension aquion system thermo fisher usa whose detection limit was 0 01 mg l 1 and for detection of very low concentration uv vis spectrophotometer standard method was used the detection limit was 0 3 mg l 1 adsorption experiments were conducted at ph 5 as at this ph the counter ion co3 2 escapes out from the solution in the form of co2 desorption experiment was conducted at ph 10 2 2 2 continuous batch test exactly 500 ml of phosphate solution having 4 725 mg of po4 3 was prepared the ph of the solution was adjusted to 5 0 for the adsorption phase using 0 1 n hcl with the help of an auto ph controller exactly 4 0 g l 1 of the newly synthesized fe zeolite a pre equilibrated at ph 10 was added into it and was stirred at 150 rpm after equilibration for the desired time a suitable aliquot of the aqueous phase was taken out with a disposable syringe filter hyundai micro model sn25p045ns having microfiltration membrane pore size 0 45 μm to lock the zeolite materials the locked zeolite was pumped back into the aqueous solution by pumping a small volume of distilled water through the syringe to avoid loss of zeolite in the test jar the samples were analyzed by uv vis spectrophotometer standard method after the adsorption study the ph of the solution was raised to 10 0 using 0 1 n naoh solution to proceed for desorption study studies were conducted as a function of time and samples were collected after completion of one adsorption desorption cycle the medium was again subjected to ph change from 10 0 to 5 0 zeolite samples were withdrawn for characterization after the termination of adsorption and desorption studies of the 1st 9th and 18th cycle 2 2 3 reusability test this step was performed with the regenerated zeolite 4 0 g l 1 sample used in the above study for 11 adsorption desorption cycles for a more accurate evaluation of the reusability of fe zeolite a phosphate solution from the previous study was discarded and freshly prepared phosphate solution of 8 mg l 1 was added into the beaker after completion of each cycle no amendments were made in the sampling time it was run for another 7 cycles a detailed diagrammatic illustration of both the above experimental study 2 2 2 2 2 3 is depicted in supplementary fig s5 2 3 characterization of the zeolite materials freshly prepared pristine zeolite a and fe zeolite a along with phosphate adsorbed and desorbed fe zeolite a zeolite samples were characterized at different stages of the 18 adsorption and desorption cycles mentioned in section 2 3 2 and 2 3 3 the samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 japan it was to observe the structural morphological and crystal shape changes of the zeolite crystals in the due course of experiments it was also mapped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds edx s 10 oxford to determine the change in elemental

spectroscopic xps spectra of the pristine phosphate adsorbed and phosphate desorbed fe zeolite a were obtained thermo scientific usa the composition of the fe zeolite a surface was determined based on the areas of fe 2p na 1s and al 2p photoelectron peaks for ft ir spectra a perkin elmer fourier transform infrared spectrometer with kbr pellets was used 2 4 role of fe3 al3 and na metal ions in adsorption and desorption of phosphate an attempt is made to discuss and predict the behavior of different metal ions present in the fe zeolite a framework to adsorb and desorb po4 3 from an aqueous solution it is done with the help of results obtained from the analytical techniques mentioned in section 2 3 3 results and discussions 3 1 synthesis of zeolite a and fe zeolite a the freshly synthesized zeolite a were observed under a scanning electron microscope the sem images fig 1 of both the samples looked well crystallized with a regular hexahedron shape as compared to zeolite a the crystalline surface of fe zeolite a appeared to be rough evidently the synthesis protocol for incorporating fe in the framework of zeolite a was successful the xrd patterns of zeolite a and fe zeolite a are shown in fig 2 the characteristic peaks of the crystalline phase of zeolite a are 7 2 10 3 12 6 16 2 21 8 24 26 2 27 2 30 30 9 31 1 32 6 33 4 and 34 3 treacy and higgins 2001 the characteristic peak of crystalline zeolite a also appeared in fe zeolite a it suggested the formation of high crystalline zeolite a structure in both the samples a slight decrease in the intensity of the xrd peak of fe zeolite a was observed the decreased x ray diffraction pattern indicates a change in phase due to the incorporation of new atoms or due to the occupation of cation exchange sites fe in the fe zeolite a framework aziz et al 2016 variations observed in the reflection intensities for fe zeolite a were due to fe ions fig 2 the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds gave clear evidence of the presence of fe in the framework of fe zeolite a the elemental compositions of both the samples are summarized in table 2 3 2 phosphate adsorption and desorption experiments 3 2 1 batch test for

isotherm constant and n sorption intensity sun et al 2017 the best fitted model was found to be the langmuir freundlich isotherm model with r2 0 990 and thus indicated the physicochemical adsorption of phosphate onto the surface of fe zeolite a fig 3 the maximum adsorption capacity was 18 154 mg g 1 table 3 the molar adsorption ratio i e moles of p moles of al fe was found to be 1 378 3 2 2 continuous batch test in this study mass of po4 3 adsorbed and desorbed by the zeolite material were monitored as a function of time cycle 1 of fig 4 a it is evident from the study that the mass of po4 3 in the stock aqueous solution got declined from 4 725 mg to 0 145 mg within 1 min it states 97 of the po4 3 mass was adsorbed in 10 min of contact time 4 7107 mg po4 3 mass was adsorbed 99 suggesting rapid phosphate adsorption onto fe zeolite a by changing the ph of the aqueous phase about 4 104 mg of po4 3 88 2 desorption from the loaded fe zeolite a was achieved in 10 min of contact time after 30 min of contact time the desorbed mass of phosphate was about 4 715 mg which is nearly 100 one complete adsorption desorption cycle took only 40 min making it one of the robust adsorbents highly suitable for phosphate removal robustness and reusability of the adsorbent are two of the important factors that should be kept in mind before commenting on its industrial application faster adsorption desorption cycle for an adsorbent makes wastewater treatment plant economical as larger volumes of wastewater can be treated per day reversibility of fe zeolite a to adsorb and desorb po4 3 was studied for 11 cycles to understand the ease of the process fig 4a it is clear from the initial cycles a trend where a very higher mass of po4 3 getting adsorbed and desorbed was observed probably due to a more ordered structure of the synthesized fe zeolite a since the adsorption occurred via ligand exchange and precipitation gradually after the 2nd cycle the mass of po4 3 desorbed was not up to the level of po4 3 adsorbed adsorption out numbered desorption from the 2nd cycle to the 8th cycle irregularities were reported from the 2nd cycle to the 8th cycle where adsorbed mass was higher or lower than the corresponding desorbed mass of po4 3 suggesting a distorted structure and involvement of multiple mechanisms in the process nevertheless phosphate adsorption onto fe zeolite a was found highly reversible 3 2 3 reusability test for 7 cycles an economic adsorbent is titled to the one which shows good adsorption capacity even after a large number of adsorption desorption cycles to ensure that fe zeolite a is suitable for a higher number of adsorption desorption cycles instead of fresh fe zeolite a the regenerated sample after performing 11 adsorption desorption cycles for previous studies was studied to evaluate its adsorption and desorption performance for another 7 cycles and results have been depicted in fig 4b in this test a freshly prepared po4 3 solution was introduced into the system for each adsorption desorption cycle the mass of phosphate adsorbed and desorbed by the zeolite material from the aqueous solution remained almost consistent where 90 of the po4 3 mass was adsorbed and desorbed even after 7 cycles it again suggested a quantitative and qualitative reversible nature of fe zeolite a to adsorb and desorb phosphate and puts light on its excellent reusability characteristic this near quantitative adsorption performance of fe zeolite a is attributed by the conversion of zeolite material from the crystalline phase to a highly amorphous phase which is supported by the xrd results depicted below the less is the crystallinity of an adsorbent the more is its adsorption capacity gupta et al 2019 3 3 characterization of adsorbent before and after phosphate adsorption 3 3 1 scanning electron microscopy sem images for fe zeolite a before and after the adsorption of phosphate have been organized in fig 5 from the images that phosphate ions were adsorbed and deposited onto the surface of fe zeolite a particles but after desorption in the 9th cycle the surface cleaned up for further adsorption showing the reversibility of the process in the 18th cycle of adsorption a higher concentration of phosphate ions can be found deposited onto the surface validating that the adsorption capacity of fe zeolite a increased with the increasing number of cycles which is evident from xrd study as well in the upcoming section 3 3 5 the sem image for desorption after 18th cycle showed an uneven surface of the hexahedron framework of fe zeolite a after rigorous and continuous adsorption desorption of phosphate for 18 cycles and thus lowering the crystallinity of the adsorbent 3 3 2 eds analysis the first and foremost thing in this study was to know the validation of different atoms present in the fe zeolite a framework and its quantification in weight as mentioned in section 3 1 and table 2 fe is present along with na al and si in a fe zeolite a material to know any alteration in its elemental composition in the span of 18 cycles of adsorption and desorption of po4 3 from its pristine form it was compared with po4 3 loaded fe zeolite a sample of the 9th cycle a distinct peak for p was observed in the eds plot for loaded fe zeolite a showing that phosphorus was adsorbed and delocalized in the zeolite framework of fe zeolite a as evident from elemental mapping from table 2 it is evident that the weight of na showed a drastic fall validating the fact that na interacted with phosphate to form soluble phosphates sabadash et al 2016 the decrease in weight of al was may be due to the addition of surplus phosphate on the surface in the form of metal phosphate precipitates led to an escalation in the overall weight of fe zeolite a eds analysis of fe zeolite a in the pristine form along with p adsorbed in the 9th cycle and elemental mapping have been shown in supplementary figs s6 s7 and s8 respectively 3 3 3 xps analysis to gain further insight about the elements participating in the phosphate adsorption and desorption process xps analysis of fe zeolite a in the pristine form after phosphate adsorption and after phosphate desorption in the 9th cycle and the 18th cycle was conducted fig 6 the fe 2p peak of pristine fe zeolite a at 710 98 ev shifted to 712 98 ev after the adsorption phase of the 9th cycle this strong shift of 2 0 ev clearly indicates the involvement of fe3 in the phosphate adsorption process and the formation of feop bonds after phosphate desorption from the loaded fe zeolite a in the 9th cycle the peak shifted back to 712 18 ev probably due to the reversible nature of the adsorption process it showed a similar pattern in the 18th cycle as the fe 2p peak shifted to 712 98 ev and 712 08 ev after the adsorption phase and desorption phase respectively the xps data suggests that the active sites having iron formed inner sphere complexes ligand exchange with po4 3 in a reversible manner exchanging with oh in all 18 cycles fig 9 in case of aluminum the peak shift corresponding to al 2p shifted to from 73 78 ev pristine fe zeolite a to 73 68 ev after the adsorption phase of the 9th cycle suggested an interaction of phosphate ions with framework al the peak shifted to 73 88 ev after the desorption phase of the 9th cycle from the slight decline in peak intensity of al 2p and xrd analysis it was confirmed that rigorous acid base treatments in consecutive cycles collapsed the zeolite framework which may have led to the initiation of zeolite dealumination it also helped in the escalation in adsorption as well as desorption phosphate after the 9th cycle fig 4 the available al3 ions might have interacted with phosphate and got adsorbed as al h2po4 3 and al2 hpo4 3 in the active sites sabadash et al 2016 bij and weckhuysen 2015 for this reason low peak shift in the earlier stages of adsorption desorption was overturned by a shift of 0 3 ev in the 18th cycle where al 2p peak at 73 88 ev shifted to 74 18 ev after adsorption the increase in peak intensity of al 2p after adsorption phase of the 18th cycle and sem image after adsorption phase of 18th cycle fig 5 also suggested the precipitation of al and phosphate compounds on the surface of fe zeolite a in the form of soluble al h2po4 3 al2 hpo4 3 and insoluble alpo4 bij and weckhuysen 2015 in the p desorbed xps spectrum of the 18th cycle the intensity of al 2p was found lower than that of the pristine one suggesting the loss of free al arising from the dealumination of zeolite framework in the aqueous phase as soluble al h2po4 3 xh2o bij and weckhuysen 2015 thus apart from fe ions framework al ions were found involved in the phosphate sorption process the na 1s peak of pristine fe zeolite a shifted from 1071 58 ev to 1072 18 ev in the adsorption phase of the 9th cycle and to 1072 08 ev in the desorption phase this 0 60 ev shift of na 1s in the adsorption phase and 0 10 ev reverse shift in the successive desorption phase suggests the involvement of na metal ion in the adsorption and desorption of phosphate ion a similar pattern in the peak shift of na 1s can be seen in the 18th cycle as well the intensity of the na 1s peak at 1071 58 ev kept on decreasing with each cycle showing the loss of na ions from fe zeolite a to the aqueous phase at a low ph protons interact chemically with the zeolite framework and are accompanied by the release of sodium ions into the aqueous phase which in turn leads to the formation of zeolite new adsorption centres the phosphate ions may have retained on the zeolite pores in the form of nah2po4 and na2hpo4 sabadash et al 2016 these soluble forms of phosphate may have been removed with na during the desorption process for this reason the intensity of the na 1s peak at 1071 58 ev kept on decreasing from the xrd analysis discussed in section 3 3 5 it was evident that rigorous acid base treatments in consecutive cycles changed the phase of the crystal zeolite framework to a highly amorphous phase it was due to precipitation of metal phosphates on the surface of fe zeolite a and leaching of sodium ions from the fe zeolite a frame due to the rigorous and uninterrupted acid base treatment 3 3 4 ft ir analysis the ft ir spectra of fe zeolite a in the pristine phosphate adsorbed and phosphate desorbed form has been reported in fig 7 in the region of 400 1000 cm 1 the bands observed can be assigned to zeolite backbones which were composed of stretching and bending of siosi and sioal mozgawa et al 2011 after the adsorption of phosphate in the 2nd cycle considerable changes in intensities shifts in the bands along with the disappearance of a band at 557 4 cm 1 were observed all these changes suggest a change in the morphology of fe zeolite a after adsorption as mentioned below in the xrd spectra as well a broad band in the 3800 3100 cm 1 range with the maximum at 3452 4 cm 1 along with a band at 1672 2 cm 1 correspond to oh stretching and bending respectively these bands originated from the hydroxyl groups that are present as a lattice termination silanol groups b hydroxyl groups occurring at defects and c hydroxyl groups attached to fe3 which compensate the negative charge of the framework bij and weckhuysen 2015 gupta et al 2019 anirudhan and senan 2010 the shifts in the bands 3452 4 3438 9 cm 1 and 1672 2 1651 0 cm 1 along with the fall in intensities after phosphate adsorption onto fe zeolite a strongly suggests the involvement of hydroxyl groups in the adsorption process this was further backed by the increase in intensities of bands along with shifts 3438 9 3446 6 cm 1 and 1651 0 1652 9 cm 1 after phosphate desorption 3 3 5 xrd analysis the xrd spectrum of fe zeolite a recorded after adsorption phase of the 1st cycle shows fall in crystallinity of the adsorbent whereas after the adsorption phase of the 18th cycle there is an abrupt fall in its crystallinity making the material an amorphous one fig 8 it is well documented that a lower level of crystallinity in an adsorbent favours the adsorption process which is due to rise of new active sites caused by the release of metal ions such as si and na bij and weckhuysen 2015 gupta et al 2019 the rigorous acid and alkali treatment received by the adsorbent for every adsorption desorption cycle resulted in the phase deterioration of fe zeolite a bij and weckhuysen 2015 precipitation of metal salts on the zeolite surface also might have also contributed to its amorphicity which can be observed in the adsorbed phase of sem images fig 5 the fall in desorption of po4 3 from the 2nd cycle to the 8th cycle fig 4a might be due to surplus precipitation adsorption where al and na contributed more in precipitation forming metal phosphate compounds on the surface of fe zeolite a and less in desorption of po4 3 the increase in desorption efficiency from the 9th cycle fig 4 throws light on the rapid fall in its crystallinity by dealumination as discussed above in section 3 3 3 and leaching of na ion fig 6 the rigorous acid base treatment might have caused the release of precipitated metal ions in the form of soluble metal salts led to the formation of more and more active sites on the surface of fe zeolite a enhancing its adsorption desorption capacity it is also supported by the eds data showing a decline in weight of al fe si and na 3 4 role of fe3 al3 and na metal ions in adsorption and desorption of phosphate in order to deduce the activity of the metal ions fe al and na present in the fe zeolite a framework in the adsorption and desorption of phosphate experimental studies along with microscopic and spectroscopic studies have been carried out the ph variation in the aqueous phase arising from adsorption and desorption of phosphate anion has shed some light on the involvement of oh ions in the process fig 9 with the passing time ph of the aqueous phase increased in the case of adsorption whereas a reverse trend was recorded for desorption suggesting an exchange of oh ions with that of phosphate ions at the active sites thus ligand exchange mechanism or inner sphere complexation mechanism was found predominantly involved in the adsorption desorption process the ft ir analysis illustrated that the intensities of the bands at 3452 4 cm 1 and 1672 2 cm 1 fell with the adsorption of phosphate ions suggesting the replacement of hydroxyl groups bound to fe ions with phosphate ions which was also confirmed by the peak shift observed in fe 2p spectrum after desorption of phosphate a complete reversal in the entire process was confirmed by increased intensities of hydroxyl bands in the ft ir spectrum mozgawa et al 2011 the ligand exchange mechanism for phosphate removal has been reported in the literature on several occasions where hydroxyl groups present on the metal ions la3 al3 fe3 etc in the doped zeolite framework are exchanged with phosphate ions during the adsorption process he et al 2017 xie et al 2015 kim et al 2013 apart from ligand exchange adsorption of phosphate onto fe zeolite a was also governed by surface precipitation in the higher number of cycles where aluminum leached from the zeolite framework formed insoluble phosphate alpo4 and thus precipitated onto the surface which was confirmed by the sem analysis apart from these mechanisms like diffusion too have played some role in the adsorption process as well as evident from the shift in the na 1s peak with an increasing number of cycles along with the decreasing intensities diffusion of phosphate ions into the pores followed by phosphate interaction with na ions leading to the formation of nah2po4 and na2hpo4 were highly probable sabadash et al 2016 the decreasing intensities may be due to the removal of these soluble phosphates from the zeolite surface during the phosphate desorption process weaker forces like electrostatic interactions by fe and hydrogen bonding by al might have contributed to a smaller extent in the phosphate adsorption and desorption process the xrd results shown in fig 8 illustrates the change of phase of fe zeolite a from crystalline to amorphous phase after 1st adsorption phase fig 8a it might be due to precipitation of al h2po4 3 al2 hpo4 3 na2hpo4 and nah2po4 on the zeolite surface and release of metal atoms from the network in the desorption alkaline phase the soluble nature of these salts might also have contributed to the amorphicity the zeolite material ultimately turned into a highly amorphous material in the 18th cycle might be due to rigorous acid base treatment which can be seen in the xrd image fig 8b ligand exchange mechanism encourages sorption of po4 3 in a reversible manner as shown in fig 6 for fe 2p but the coexistence of other mechanisms such as electrostatic attraction precipitation diffusion and hydrogen bonding exhibited by the metal ions in the aqueous solution might have led to a fall in desorption of po4 3 from the 2nd cycle to the 8th cycle fig 4a the precipitated phosphate couldn t desorb and the above interacting mechanisms kept adsorbing po4 3 well in each successive cycles 2nd cycle to 8th cycle the alkaline ph for desorption leached na metal ions and phosphate from its surface which were adsorbed in the adsorption process from the surface it is suggested by seeing the change in intensity of na 1s fig 6 rigorous acid base treatment removed metal ions from the network led to leaching or dealumination of na and al in the form of metal phosphate salts gave rise to new active sites on the surface making fe zeolite a more amorphous and efficient for adsorption desorption process henceforth the material increased its adsorption desorption capacity with the increase in the number of cycles fig 4b the change in elemental weight of the metal ions in the fe zeolite a shown in table 2 also endorses the change in phase finally the sem images fig 5 also shows that the change in the crystallinity of the zeolite might be due to precipitation of alpo4 al h2po4 3 al2 hpo4 3 na2hpo4 and nah2po4 on the surface bij and weckhuysen 2015 sabadash et al 2016 however three of the metal ions fe al and na interacted with po4 3 in the aqueous phase to adsorb and desorb it but fe3 exhibited better adsorption desorption of po4 3 over other metal ions the peak shift adsorption desorption pattern shown by xps of fe 2p fig 6 from the 1st cycle till the 18th cycle and no significant change in peak intensity unlike al 2p and na 1s strongly claims a stable and consistent reversible interaction with po4 3 most probably through ligand exchange principle no change in the peak intensity also suggests the firm incorporation of the doped fe in the fe zeolite a framework hence fe metal ions can be nominated as the dominant metal ion in the fe zeolite a frame which not only boosted the adsorption and desorption speed supplementary data d1 supplementary figs s1 s2 and s3 but also enabled the material to adsorb and desorb po4 3 reversibly for a large number of adsorption desorption cycles a diagrammatic illustration of the behavior of the metal ions is shown in fig 10 4 conclusions in this study fe3 na and al3 in the fe zeolite a participated in the adsorption desorption of phosphate through multiple interactions fe3 metal ions predominantly exhibited ligand exchange mechanism to adsorb and desorb po4 3 by oh exchange from the aqueous solution which enabled the sorption process to be consistently reversible until the last cycle other probable interactions exhibited by the metal ions are an electrostatic attraction by fe3 precipitation and hydrogen bonding by al3 and diffusion by na metal ions the xrd results confirmed that the rigorous acidic alkaline treatment transformed the phase of fe zeolite a surface from crystalline to highly amorphous due to the breaking of bonds a release of metal ions and precipitation the same was supported by the sem images the amorphicity generated new active sites leading to enhanced sorption efficiency fe zeolite a adsorbed 97 of the po4 3 mass within 1 min and it took only 10 min for complete removal for desorption it took only 1 min for 88 2 recovery and 30 min for 100 recovery it adsorbed and desorbed po4 3 unfailingly for 18 adsorption desorption cycles the adsorption data fitted well with the langmuir freundlich isotherm model the maximum adsorption capacity of fe loaded zeolite for phosphate is 18 154 mg g 1 this study concludes that fe zeolite a is a suitable adsorbent for quick adsorption desorption of po4 3 from wastewaters for multiple continuous cycles and its industrial application can be seen in the coming future acknowledgment the authors are very

18823,fish kills are widespread visible events perceived by the civil society as a major cause for concern about water quality and ecosystem health investigations conducted so far have linked fish kills to multiple factors but extensive studies examining quantitatively the likelihood of fish kills are missing in the present study factors related to fish kills in 67 mediterranean reservoirs located in the iberian peninsula were investigated moreover the variation in the likelihood of fish kills with the foreseen consequences of anthropogenically driven climate change upon temperature and precipitation was assessed during the 23 year period studied 1995 2017 the number of fish kills per reservoir varied from 0 to 3 and happened mostly in southern reservoirs and during the warmest months particularly in june twelve explanatory variables showed significant differences between reservoirs with and without fish die offs reservoir depth surface area oxygen and chlorophyll a concentrations were the variables that together best discriminated between reservoirs with and without fish kills explaining 67 2 of the total variation in the occurrence of fish die offs the variables retained in the mortality model explained unique parts of that variation but a considerable amount of the explained variation was shared by all the variables the number of fish kill events appears to be rising during the examined period and the projection made indicated an increase in the likelihood of fish kills towards the end of the 21st century particularly for the rcp8 5 emission scenario with the prevalence of fish kills reaching 0 865 in southern reservoirs in the future oligotrophication is likely the only strategy to consistently reduce fish kills in mediterranean

included those placed northwards the tagus river basin whereas southern ones included those placed in the tagus river basin and southwards the moving average of the yearly number of fish kills was determined to recognise temporal trends the number of fish kill events in each of the 12 year period studied was related with the deviation in the average annual precipitation and maximum annual

precipitation were identified and modelled through multiple linear regression using as explanatory variables these two climatic variables and other explanatory variables considered as potentially affecting their outcome model selection was also based in multimodel inference the resulting models were then used to predict the response variables under climate change scenarios which in turn were used as explanatory variables in the retained glm mortality model to obtain projections of probabilities of fish kill events under the same scenarios all statistical analyses were run using statistica

explanatory variables examined twelve were significantly different between reservoirs with and without fish kills table 2 overall reservoirs with fish kills were located in warmer and arid regions were shallower and larger and had higher organic matter content nutrient levels conductivity ph and chlorophyll a concentrations as well as lower transparency and dissolved oxygen than reservoirs without fish kill events reported the top ranked model predicting the probability of fish kill events retained four variables including two reservoir physical attributes surface area and mean depth one biotic indicator chlorophyll a and one physicochemical parameter oxygen according to the selected model the occurrence of fish kills was negatively related with mean depth and oxygen content and positively related with the reservoir surface area and chlorophyll a concentration table 3 these four variables were also ranked as the most important according to their frequency in models and their total akaike weights in the multimodel inference approach table s1 in supplementary material the variable with the highest absolute effect size was chlorophyll a although it was ranked in the second place after oxygen content according to the importance based on akaike weights the percentage of total variability explained by the top ranked model was 67 2 for the variation partitioning the relative contributions of reservoir size resulting from aggregating the contributions of reservoir mean depth and surface area chlorophyll a and oxygen were considered fig 6 each variable included in the mortality model explained unique fractions of the variation in the occurrence of fish kills totaling 30 1 but the larger part of the variation explained was simultaneously accounted for by more than one variable totaling 37 1 for example oxygen concentration explained 35 5 of the total variation in the occurrence of fish kills but only 7 0 of the variation was not shared by the effect of the remaining variables 4 1 of the variation was shared with chlorophyll a 13 5 was shared with morphology and 10 9 was shared with both chlorophyll a and morphology 3 3 projection of fish kill events for the period 2071 2100 among the four variables retained in the final model chlorophyll a and oxygen are expected to be the only ones potentially influenced by temperature and precipitation therefore a multiple linear model was fitted to each variable in which climatic descriptors mean annual temperature and precipitation predicted for the period 2071 2100 were considered as candidate explanatory variables for chlorophyll a total nitrogen and total phosphorus nutrient enrichment were also considered as candidate variables whereas for oxygen bod 5 chlorophyll a depth and reservoir area were included as additional candidate variables the retained model for chlorophyll a included temperature and total nitrogen both with a positive effect on chlorophyll a concentration whilst for oxygen only temperature was retained table 3 after replacing chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen concentrations by values resulting from temperature predictions under climate change scenarios table s2 in supplementary material both the likelihood of fish kills fig 7 and the prevalence of fish kills table 4 tend to increase for the period 2071 2100 among the studied reservoirs particularly for the rcp8 5 emission scenario with this emission scenario the prevalence of fish kill events for the period 2071 2100 reaches 0 865 in southern reservoirs 4 discussion the results of this investigation indicated that west iberian reservoirs with and without fish kills have distinctive characteristics in particular reservoirs with and without fish kills were separated according to depth surface area oxygen content and chlorophyll a levels all factors that have been previously related to primary production in lacustrine environments e g jørgensen et al 2005 high levels of primary production can influence fish kills in different ways namely through their effect on dissolved oxygen content thronson and quigg 2008 more productive water bodies promote the depletion of dissolved oxygen through the increased use of dissolved oxygen in the water column by living organisms respiration including primary producers but also fish during the night when photosynthesis stops the sudden collapse and subsequent decomposition of massive phytoplankton populations and the turnover of oxygen poor bottom waters and low oxygen contents have been identified as the major direct cause for fish kills in different types of water bodies e g calheiros and hamilton 1998 hoyer et al 2009 järvalt et al 2005 moss et al 2011 nicholls et al 1980 ruuhijärvi et al 2010 townsend et al 1992 thronson and quigg 2008 zhu et al 2008 although oxygen depletion is often missed in assessments as it can occur as a rapid transient phenomenon kangur et al 2016 average dissolved oxygen concentration together with chlorophyll a were retained in the mortality model as the top ranked variables moreover a considerable portion of the variation in the occurrence of fish kills accounted for by oxygen and chlorophyll a was shared by both variables supporting the notion that high levels of primary production lilely mediated the occurrence of an important part of the fish kills through their effect on dissolved oxygen content additionally blooms of toxic plankton cyanobacteria are more likely in eutrophic systems e g codd 2000 and have been linked to the mortality of fish jewel et al 2003 chellappa et al 2008 phytoplankton are expectedly the main primary producers in reservoirs as frequent oscillation in water levels restrict the establishment and development of macrophytes and phytobenthos in littoral areas and other primary producers e g photosynthetic and chemosynthetic bacteria are minor contributors to the system s total primary production kimmel and groeger 1984 although massive blooms of cyanobacteria frequently occur concomitantly with low levels of dissolved oxygen making it difficult to assess the contribution of each factor to the death of fishes both oxygen and chlorophyll a explained unique parts of the explained variation in the mortality model suggesting that both oxygen depletion and toxic phytoplankton production influenced fish kills in the studied reservoirs water depth has long been linked to phytoplanktonic productivity in natural lakes and reservoirs jørgensen et al 2005 despite the transitional fluvial lacustrine nature of the latter kimmel and groeger 1984 solar energy input influencing incidence irradiance and temperature a basic factor controlling phytoplankton production brylinski and mann 1973 is higher per unit of volume in shallower reservoirs due to their large surface to volume ratios nõges et al 2003 vadeboncoeur et al 2008 making them more productive if nutrients another major determinant of phytoplankton production e g guildford and hecky 2000 kimmel and groeger 1984 phillips et al 2008 are available although not entering the mortality model both total n and total p were higher in reservoirs with fish kills and chlorophyll a was positively related to both nutrients r2 0 403 f 21 57 p 0 001 shallower lakes and reservoirs are also more prone to eutrophication through the recycling of nutrients from sediments in anoxic conditions and their availablility in the euphotic zone during the warm period due the absence of a strong thermal stratification søndergaard et al 2003 but also due to fish excretion and their release from sediments via bioturbation by bottom feeding fishes brabrand et al 1990 starling et al 2002 primary production in reservoirs has been linked to fish biomass lara et al 2009 and therefore more productive reservoirs have higher fish biomass including common bottom feeding species such as introduced carp and native barbel in iberian reservoirs godinho et al 1998 reservoirs with larger surface areas could also provide more stable conditions for fish in mediterranean regions allowing steady increases in fish biomass and consequent increases in nutrient levels resulting from internal loading elsewhere fish kills often occur in productive aquatic systems for example in the large and shallow lake võrtsjärv estonia chlorophyll a was significantly higher in a year with a large fish kill compared with years without fish kills kangur et al 2016 in an extensive review of fish kills in texas bays and estuaries thronson and quigg 2008 found that systems with more kills had higher trophy whereas fish kills are reportedly quite common in shallow sub tropical eutrophic lakes brinkmann and santos 1973 starling et al 2002 hoyer et al 2009 also found that in florida fish kill events were more frequent in more productive lakes with higher phosphorus total nitrogen and chlorophyll and lower secchi depth similarly to what was found in some studies fish kills in mediterranean reservoirs were more frequent during the warmer months and in warmer reservoirs when conditions are prone to high levels of primary production kimmel and groeger 1984 being particularly frequent during the month of june in west iberian climate june is typically the month presenting the maximum solar radiation and also the largest increase in temperature table s3 in supplementary material whit some days during that month reaching temperatures close to the yearly maximum although july presents higher average temperatures the precipitation that can still occur until may allows the inflow of organic matter and nutrients to the reservoirs boosting primary production when solar energy input quickly increases in june when compared to lakes reservoirs have larger drainage areas and their levels of primary production are more dependent on the nutrient run off from the catchments during periods of precipitation kimmel and groeger 1984 environmental conditions thus exist during june that could promote a rapid and explosive increase in primary production in west iberian reservoirs in addition stratification is generally not stable during june which could facilitate the change in the physicochemical and biological conditions in all the water body the few fish kills more closely investigated in iberian freshwater ecosystems so far have been linked to an outbreak of infectious diseases after an increase in the fish s susceptibility due to the presence of a toxic chemical dehydroabietic acid in the tagus river muñoz et al 1994 and an anabaena spp bloom and associated low oxygen and high ammonia and sulphide levels in a reservoir in the northwest of spain toranzo et al 1990 parasitological analysis of death or dying fish collected during some fish kill events have showed parasite infection such as plerocercoid ligula intestinalis in introduced alburnus alburnus in castelo do bode reservoir ramos et al 2016 but the absence of additional environmental data with adequate frequency restricted the investigation of the drivers of those mortality events the analysis performed in the present study was successful in extracting major patterns related to the occurrence of fish kills in west iberian reservoirs but part of the total variation was not accounted for by the variables included in the model this may indicate that other mortality related factors such as toxic spills disease or parasite outbreak were independent of the explanatory variables used nevertheless the model derived was statistically significant and the results ecologically meaningful while eutrophic and anoxic environments could have existed in some iberian reservoirs independently of human activities on the drainage basins poikāne et al 2010 their occurrence is increasing despite the considerable investment in wastewater treatment plants and industrial pollution control systems according to the portuguese water basin management plans available at https www apambiente pt index php ref 16 subref 7 sub2ref 9 sub3ref 848 accessed in 2018 06 06 only a few discrete sources of pollution remain but widespread diffuse pollution from agriculture still exists uncontrolled in most river basins runoff from agricultural areas brings nutrients particularly phosphorus and nitrogen to waterbodies promoting the eutrophication of lakes and reservoirs torrent et al 2007 the number of fish kills appears to be rising in the studied reservoirs during the period considered 1995 2017 and the projection made with the mortality model chain considering the variation of chlorophyll and oxygen content related to the predicted increase in average temperature indicated an increase in the likelihood of fish kills towards the end of the 21st century given that chlorophyll a has a positive relation with temperature whereas oxygen content has a negative one namely via reduced saturation relative to air these results could be expected since an increase in temperature is forecasted by the climatic models used notwithstanding warming resulting from climate change may further enhance primary production by affecting factors such as internal nutrient loading evaporation rates and water levels jeppesen et al 2009 additionally the increase in global temperature may increase the frequency of cyanobacterial blooms and the biological oxygen demand paerl and huisman 2009 likely influencing the occurrence of fish kills for the iberian peninsula and in addition to increase in mean temperature and decrease in precipitation the ongoing global climate change may also produce more frequent extreme events christidis et al 2015 such as severe precipitation that could trigger nutrient pulses to water bodies and heat waves that could trigger rapid increases in water temperature both boosting reductions in oxygen levels and increases in primary production and the likelihood of fish kill events in addition to the precautionary removal of fish during drawdowns a measure that could face strong public opposition the results of this investigation suggest that the reduction of primary production levels oligotrophication is likely the only way to prevent fish kills in iberian reservoirs 5 conclusions the likelihood of fish kills in western mediterranean reservoirs was modelled by using data on the occurrence of fish die offs and a total of 18 potential explanatory variables overall 12 explanatory variables were different between reservoirs with and without fish kills and the top ranked model predicting the probability of fish kill events retained four variables fish kill events were more common in reservoirs that were shallower had lower oxygen content and had both larger surface area and higher chlorophyll a levels all factors related to higher levels of primary production in lacustrine environments oxygen concentration and chlorophyll a were the top ranked explanatory variables but a large part of the variation in the occurrence of fish kills was shared among the variables included in the model high levels of phytoplankton production likely mediate the occurrence of fish kills through their effect on dissolved oxygen content and the production of toxic plankton further strengthening the overall influence of primary production fish kills occurred mostly during warmer months when conditions are appropriate for rapid bursts of primary production the number of fish kills increased during the 23 year period studied and a projection made with a model chain indicated an increase in the likelihood of fish kills towards the end

18823,fish kills are widespread visible events perceived by the civil society as a major cause for concern about water quality and ecosystem health investigations conducted so far have linked fish kills to multiple factors but extensive studies examining quantitatively the likelihood of fish kills are missing in the present study factors related to fish kills in 67 mediterranean reservoirs located in the iberian peninsula were investigated moreover the variation in the likelihood of fish kills with the foreseen consequences of anthropogenically driven climate change upon temperature and precipitation was assessed during the 23 year period studied 1995 2017 the number of fish kills per reservoir varied from 0 to 3 and happened mostly in southern reservoirs and during the warmest months particularly in june twelve explanatory variables showed significant differences between reservoirs with and without fish die offs reservoir depth surface area oxygen and chlorophyll a concentrations were the variables that together best discriminated between reservoirs with and without fish kills explaining 67 2 of the total variation in the occurrence of fish die offs the variables retained in the mortality model explained unique parts of that variation but a considerable amount of the explained variation was shared by all the variables the number of fish kill events appears to be rising during the examined period and the projection made indicated an increase in the likelihood of fish kills towards the end of the 21st century particularly for the rcp8 5 emission scenario with the prevalence of fish kills reaching 0 865 in southern reservoirs in the future oligotrophication is likely the only strategy to consistently reduce fish kills in mediterranean

accumulation of dead fish and the consequent decomposition odour in fish kill events cause a strong social impact rising public concerns about water quality and the health of the affected ecosystem

pesticides contamination of aquatic environments giger 2009 mason 2002 muñoz et al 1994 thronson and quigg 2008 studies frequently identify several drivers as likely causes for the mortality of fish including the combination of natural and human induced stressors kangur et al 2016 moreover the mechanisms underlying many fish kills remain unknown la and cooke 2011 probably because the identification of the factors and paths leading to a fish kill event require monitoring of several parameters with a high frequency in order to understand the ecosystem dynamics during the mortality event kangur et al 2016 since most fish kills occur unexpectedly it is difficult to define and implement an experimental design to study the ecosystem before during and after a fish die off consequently few case studies are available in peer reviewed publications la and cooke 2011 and most of the published examples are a fortuitous outcome resulting from other coincident sampling protocols typically focusing on water quality or on the phytoplankton community e g calheiros and hamilton 1998 additionally global studies quantitatively examining factors influencing the likelihood of fish kills are lacking although they are essential to provide an overview of the mechanisms influencing those events this knowledge could be of paramount importance to recognise key characteristics associated with fish kills allowing the performance of a risk assessment the definition of sampling schemes and the implementation of preventive actions e g precautionary removal of fish biomass in reservoirs benejan et al 2008 reservoirs are a pervasive element in the iberian peninsula landscape a region almost devoid of natural lakes being built since roman times circa 2000 years ago to store water for human uses from wet to dry periods they are ecologically simple systems prone to eutrophication commonly with scarce macrophyte cover and with fish assemblages dominated by a few introduced species clavero et al 2013 godinho et al 1998 as elsewhere fish kills occur in iberian reservoirs and raise strong public concern being invariably recognised as the consequence of some type of pollution in the present study the occurrence of fish kills in mediterranean riverine reservoirs henceforth referred to simply as reservoirs located in the iberian peninsula is related to several explanatory variables aiming at the elucidation of the factors linked with increasing susceptibility of these water bodies to fish kills furthermore since the consequences of anthropogenically driven climate change upon temperature and precipitation patterns are likely to interfere with several factors associated with fish mortality jeppesen et al 2009 2010 cremona et al 2017 havens and jeppesen 2018 projections of fish kill events under climate change scenarios for the period 2071 2100 are also performed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data used the study took place in portugal

catchments where most of the rivers run in a ne sw direction towards the atlantic coast fig 1 although relatively small 89089 km2 portugal has a territory with considerable climate variability reflecting both the elevation and the proximity to the atlantic ocean and ranging from temperate oceanic on the northwest to mediterranean in most of the country miranda et al 2002 temperature increase southwards and mean annual precipitation is generally higher in the northern area average annual precipitation ranging from less than 300 in the south to above 3000 mm in the north the precipitation pattern is typically mediterranean exhibiting strong intra and inter annual variability with a dry summer period miranda et al 2002 in addition to climate and topography the variability in geology soil land use anthropogenic pressure e g almost 80 of the population inhabits the area near the coast and reservoir trophic state render portugal a good test area to examine large scale environmental patterns the studied reservoirs are included in the portuguese list of water bodies according to the european water framework directive directive 2000 60 ec of the european parliament and of the council and have a surface area at pool level above 0 38 km2 smaller reservoirs were excluded since fish kills could be related to the low water volumes frequently occurring during the end of the dry season august september only reservoirs older than 10 years old and fish kills occurring 5 years after the impoundment of a particular reservoir were considered most of the 67 reservoirs studied are warmwater monomictic and have bare littoral zones due to frequent water level fluctuations related with reservoirs uses mostly hydropower production irrigation and urban water supply fish assemblages are dominated by warmwater introduced species including cyprinidae mostly cyprinus carpio alburnus alburnus and carassius spp centrarchidae micropterus salmoides and lepomis gibbosus and

of 2017 and 2015 had the 1st and 3rd major deviation in annual mean maximum temperature relative to the reference period 1971 2000 whereas 2005 and 2007 were the driest years on record no difference was found between the number of fish kills occurring with water levels rising 52 5 or dropping 47 5 chi square test 0 10 p 0 05 d f 1 3 2 mortality model and variation partitioning from the 18 explanatory variables examined twelve were significantly different between reservoirs with and without fish kills table 2 overall reservoirs with fish kills were located in warmer and arid regions were shallower and larger and had higher organic matter content nutrient levels conductivity ph and chlorophyll a concentrations as well as lower transparency and dissolved oxygen than reservoirs without fish kill events reported the top ranked model predicting the probability of fish kill events retained four variables including two reservoir physical attributes surface area and mean depth one biotic indicator chlorophyll a and one physicochemical parameter oxygen according to the selected model the occurrence of fish kills was negatively related with mean depth and oxygen content and positively related with the reservoir surface area and chlorophyll a concentration table 3 these four variables were also ranked as the most important according to their frequency in models and their total akaike weights in the multimodel inference approach table s1 in supplementary material the variable with the highest absolute effect size was chlorophyll a although it was ranked in the second place after oxygen content according to the importance based on akaike weights the percentage of total variability explained by the top ranked model was 67 2 for the variation partitioning the relative contributions of reservoir size resulting from aggregating the contributions of reservoir mean depth and surface area chlorophyll a and oxygen were considered fig 6 each variable included in the mortality model explained unique fractions of the variation in the occurrence of fish kills totaling 30 1 but the larger part of the variation explained was simultaneously accounted for by more than one variable totaling 37 1 for example oxygen concentration explained 35 5 of the total variation in the occurrence of fish kills but only 7 0 of the variation was not shared by the effect of the remaining variables 4 1 of the variation was shared with chlorophyll a 13 5 was shared with morphology and 10 9 was shared with both chlorophyll a and morphology 3 3 projection of fish kill events for the period 2071 2100 among the four variables retained in the final model chlorophyll a and oxygen are expected to be the only ones potentially influenced by temperature and precipitation therefore a multiple linear model was fitted to each variable in which climatic descriptors mean annual temperature and precipitation predicted for the period 2071 2100 were considered as candidate explanatory variables for chlorophyll a total nitrogen and total phosphorus nutrient enrichment were also considered as candidate variables whereas for oxygen bod 5 chlorophyll a depth and reservoir area were included as additional candidate variables the retained model for chlorophyll a included temperature and total nitrogen both with a positive effect on chlorophyll a concentration whilst for oxygen only temperature was retained table 3 after replacing chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen concentrations by values resulting from temperature predictions under climate change scenarios table s2 in supplementary material both the likelihood of fish kills fig 7 and the prevalence of fish kills table 4 tend to increase for the period 2071 2100 among the studied reservoirs particularly for the rcp8 5 emission scenario with this emission scenario the prevalence of fish kill events for the period 2071 2100 reaches 0 865 in southern reservoirs 4 discussion the results of this investigation indicated that west iberian reservoirs with and without fish kills have distinctive characteristics in particular reservoirs with and without fish kills were separated according to depth surface area oxygen content and chlorophyll a levels all factors that have been previously related to primary production in lacustrine environments e g jørgensen et al 2005 high levels of primary production can influence fish kills in different ways namely through their effect on dissolved oxygen content thronson and quigg 2008 more productive water bodies promote the depletion of dissolved oxygen through the increased use of dissolved oxygen in the water column by living organisms respiration including primary producers but also fish during the night when photosynthesis stops the sudden collapse and subsequent decomposition of massive phytoplankton populations and the turnover of oxygen poor bottom waters and low oxygen contents have been identified as the major direct cause for fish kills in different types of water bodies e g calheiros and hamilton 1998 hoyer et al 2009 järvalt et al 2005 moss et al 2011 nicholls et al 1980 ruuhijärvi et al 2010 townsend et al 1992 thronson and quigg 2008 zhu et al 2008 although oxygen depletion is often missed in assessments as it can occur as a rapid transient phenomenon kangur et al 2016 average dissolved oxygen concentration together with chlorophyll a were retained in the mortality model as the top ranked variables moreover a considerable portion of the variation in the occurrence of fish kills accounted for by oxygen and chlorophyll a was shared by both variables supporting the notion that high levels of primary production lilely mediated the occurrence of an important part of the fish kills through their effect on dissolved oxygen content additionally blooms of toxic plankton cyanobacteria are more likely in eutrophic systems e g codd 2000 and have been linked to the mortality of fish jewel et al 2003 chellappa et al 2008 phytoplankton are expectedly the main primary producers in reservoirs as frequent oscillation in water levels restrict the establishment and development of macrophytes and phytobenthos in littoral areas and other primary producers e g photosynthetic and chemosynthetic bacteria are minor contributors to the system s total primary production kimmel and groeger 1984 although massive blooms of cyanobacteria frequently occur concomitantly with low levels of dissolved oxygen making it difficult to assess the contribution of each factor to the death of fishes both oxygen and chlorophyll a explained unique parts of the explained variation in the mortality model suggesting that both oxygen depletion and toxic phytoplankton production influenced fish kills in the studied reservoirs water depth has long been linked to phytoplanktonic productivity in natural lakes and reservoirs jørgensen et al 2005 despite the transitional fluvial lacustrine nature of the latter kimmel and groeger 1984 solar energy input influencing incidence irradiance and temperature a basic factor controlling phytoplankton production brylinski and mann 1973 is higher per unit of volume in shallower reservoirs due to their large surface to volume ratios nõges et al 2003 vadeboncoeur et al 2008 making them more productive if nutrients another major determinant of phytoplankton production e g guildford and hecky 2000 kimmel and groeger 1984 phillips et al 2008 are available although not entering the mortality model both total n and total p were higher in reservoirs with fish kills and chlorophyll a was positively related to both nutrients r2 0 403 f 21 57 p 0 001 shallower lakes and reservoirs are also more prone to eutrophication through the recycling of nutrients from sediments in anoxic conditions and their availablility in the euphotic zone during the warm period due the absence of a strong thermal stratification søndergaard et al 2003 but also due to fish excretion and their release from sediments via bioturbation by bottom feeding fishes brabrand et al 1990 starling et al 2002 primary production in reservoirs has been linked to fish biomass lara et al 2009 and therefore more productive reservoirs have higher fish biomass including common bottom feeding species such as introduced carp and native barbel in iberian reservoirs godinho et al 1998 reservoirs with larger surface areas could also provide more stable conditions for fish in mediterranean regions allowing steady increases in fish biomass and consequent increases in nutrient levels resulting from internal loading elsewhere fish kills often occur in productive aquatic systems for example in the large and shallow lake võrtsjärv estonia chlorophyll a was significantly higher in a year with a large fish kill compared with years without fish kills kangur et al 2016 in an extensive review of fish kills in texas bays and estuaries thronson and quigg 2008 found that systems with more kills had higher trophy whereas fish kills are reportedly quite common in shallow sub tropical eutrophic lakes brinkmann and santos 1973 starling et al 2002 hoyer et al 2009 also found that in florida fish kill events were more frequent in more productive lakes with higher phosphorus total nitrogen and chlorophyll and lower secchi depth similarly to what was found in some studies fish kills in mediterranean reservoirs were more frequent during the warmer months and in warmer reservoirs when conditions are prone to high levels of primary production kimmel and groeger 1984 being particularly frequent during the month of june in west iberian climate june is typically the month presenting the maximum solar radiation and also the largest increase in temperature table s3 in supplementary material whit some days during that month reaching temperatures close to the yearly maximum although july presents higher average temperatures the precipitation that can still occur until may allows the inflow of organic matter and nutrients to the reservoirs boosting primary production when solar energy input quickly increases in june when compared to lakes reservoirs have larger drainage areas and their levels of primary production are more dependent on the nutrient run off from the catchments during periods of precipitation kimmel and groeger 1984 environmental conditions thus exist during june that could promote a rapid and explosive increase in primary production in west iberian reservoirs in addition stratification is generally not stable during june which could facilitate the change in the physicochemical and biological conditions in all the water body the few fish kills more closely investigated in iberian freshwater ecosystems so far have been linked to an outbreak of infectious diseases after an increase in the fish s susceptibility due to the presence of a toxic chemical dehydroabietic acid in the tagus river muñoz et al 1994 and an anabaena spp bloom and associated low oxygen and high ammonia and sulphide levels in a reservoir in the northwest of spain toranzo et al 1990 parasitological analysis of death or dying fish collected during some fish kill events have showed parasite infection such as plerocercoid ligula intestinalis in introduced alburnus alburnus in castelo do bode reservoir ramos et al 2016 but the absence of additional environmental data with adequate frequency restricted the investigation of the drivers of those mortality events the analysis performed in the present study was successful in extracting major patterns related to the occurrence of fish kills in west iberian reservoirs but part of the total variation was not accounted for by the variables included in the model this may indicate that other mortality related factors such as toxic spills disease or parasite outbreak were independent of the explanatory variables used nevertheless the model derived was statistically significant and the results ecologically meaningful while eutrophic and anoxic environments could have existed in some iberian reservoirs independently of human activities on the drainage basins poikāne et al 2010 their occurrence is increasing despite the considerable investment in wastewater treatment plants and industrial pollution control systems according to the portuguese water basin management plans available at https www apambiente pt index php ref 16 subref 7 sub2ref 9 sub3ref 848 accessed in 2018 06 06 only a few discrete sources of pollution remain but widespread diffuse pollution from agriculture still exists uncontrolled in most river basins runoff from agricultural areas brings nutrients particularly phosphorus and nitrogen to waterbodies promoting the eutrophication of lakes and reservoirs torrent et al 2007 the number of fish kills appears to be rising in the studied reservoirs during the period considered 1995 2017 and the projection made with the mortality model chain considering the variation of chlorophyll and oxygen content related to the predicted increase in average temperature indicated an increase in the likelihood of fish kills towards the end of the 21st century given that chlorophyll a has a positive relation with temperature whereas oxygen content has a negative one namely via reduced saturation relative to air these results could be expected since an increase in temperature is forecasted by the climatic models used notwithstanding warming resulting from climate change may further enhance primary production by affecting factors such as internal nutrient loading evaporation rates and water levels jeppesen et al 2009 additionally the increase in global temperature may increase the frequency of cyanobacterial blooms and the biological oxygen demand paerl and huisman 2009 likely influencing the occurrence of fish kills for the iberian peninsula and in addition to increase in mean temperature and decrease in precipitation the ongoing global climate change may also produce more frequent extreme events christidis et al 2015 such as severe precipitation that could trigger nutrient pulses to water bodies and heat waves that could trigger rapid increases in water temperature both boosting reductions in oxygen levels and increases in primary production and the likelihood of fish kill events in addition to the precautionary removal of fish during drawdowns a measure that could face strong public opposition the results of this investigation suggest that the reduction of primary production levels oligotrophication is likely the only way to prevent fish kills in iberian reservoirs 5 conclusions the likelihood of fish kills in western mediterranean reservoirs was modelled by using data on the occurrence of fish die offs and a total of 18 potential explanatory variables overall 12 explanatory variables were different between reservoirs with and without fish kills and the top ranked model predicting the probability of fish kill events retained four variables fish kill events were more common in reservoirs that were shallower had lower oxygen content and had both larger surface area and higher chlorophyll a levels all factors related to higher levels of primary production in lacustrine environments oxygen concentration and chlorophyll a were the top ranked explanatory variables but a large part of the variation in the occurrence of fish kills was shared among the variables included in the model high levels of phytoplankton production likely mediate the occurrence of fish kills through their effect on dissolved oxygen content and the production of toxic plankton further strengthening the overall influence of primary production fish kills occurred mostly during warmer months when conditions are appropriate for rapid bursts of primary production the number of fish kills increased during the 23 year period studied and a projection made with a model chain indicated an increase in the likelihood of fish kills towards the end

18824,pressure transients have been identified as one of the major contributing factors in many pipe failures in water distribution systems wdss the behavior of these pressure transients is largely unknown and cannot be fully assessed by numerical simulation or modeling this study investigates the behavior of pressure transients in wdss as measured by high frequency pressure sensors a time series data mining tsdm approach is proposed to detect and cluster pressure transients to reveal recurrent and consistent patterns the proposed technique based on a modified two sided cumulative sum cusum algorithm is used to detect pressure transients dynamic time warping dtw is adopted to measure the similarity between the detected pressure transients and k means clustering algorithm is used to discover the characteristic patterns several performance scores are suggested to evaluate the quality of the clustering results including sum of squared error silhouette index and calinski harabaz index results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to reveal consistent and unique patterns across multiple sensing locations the proposed approach provides a fast and efficient way to discover the hidden information in wdss by analyzing high frequency pressure signals from distributed sensors graphical abstract image 1 keywords transients detection cusum dynamic time warping k

safe supply of drinking water usepa 2016 the american society of civil engineers asce estimates that the aging and deteriorating infrastructures are wasting 14 18 of the treated water asce 2017 due to the relation between pressure pipe failures and water loss pressure management has become one of the most popular management interventions implemented by water utilities in their efforts to reduce pipe failures and water loss mckenzie and wegelin 2009 the primary objective of almost all measures of pressure management constitutes reducing the maximum steady amplitude and the excessive unsteady variability of the pressure while the contributions of the former to pipe failure have been intensively studied kabir et al 2015 martínez codina et al 2015 there is a lack of quantitative research on the roles that the latter pressure variability plays in wdss ghorbanian et al 2016 flow conditions in pipelines can be disrupted by pipe failures background leakages and bursts system operations and demand fluctuations consequently creating corresponding unsteady changes in water pressure commonly termed pressure transients or water hammers these events occur quickly but have the potential to result in the pipe deterioration by introducing extreme pressure variability and intriguing fatigue starczewska et al 2015 despite the general understanding that pressure variability can contribute to pipe deterioration limited research has focused on investigating these relations quantitatively hoskins and stoianov 2014 historically the main reasons for this lack of understanding are the technological constraints such as the limited availability of high resolution pressure transmitters to measure the pressure and the computation capacity to process the data therefore most studies about pressure transients were restricted to modeling wylie et al 1993 ghidaoui et al 2005 using various of numerical simulation techniques de almeida and koelle 1992 karney and mcinnis 1992 boulos et al 2005 wood et al 2005 chaudhry 2014 on the basis of these numerical simulation various studies have been conducted to investigate drinking water quality due to pressure transients ebacher et al 2012 leak detection brunone and ferrante 2001 colombo et al 2009 pipe deterioration and corrosion assessment gong et al 2012 unfortunately without the availability of high resolution pressure data the validation of the numerical results has been limited over the past few years the rapid development of data logging and data mining technologies has relieved some of the aforementioned constraints and made it possible to investigate the pressure transients in wdss in a more rigorous manner the emerging applications of low cost high frequency transient pressure transmitters tpts introduced to continuously monitor water pressure directly contribute to the pressure management in wdss allen et al 2011 trimble water website 2018 visenti 2018 high frequency pressure data have been foremost utilized to validate and calibrate the simulation models by comparing and fitting the numerical results to collected pressure data friedman and friedman 2004 ebacher et al 2010 meseguer et al 2014 rathnayaka et al 2016 more recently data driven approaches have been proposed to detect and localize pipe bursts and leaks misiunas et al 2005 srirangarajan et al 2013 lee et al 2015b wu et al 2016 the scope of previous works has been limited due to the typically short duration of sensors deployment and more importantly low sampling frequency however pressure transients reflecting the responses of wdss to normal and abnormal changes are manifested as pressure waves traveling in the wdss with very high velocity in the range of 100 1400 m s ghidaoui et al 2005 this implies that lower sampling resolutions 5 15 min characteristic of supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems prevent from monitoring transient pressures and high resolution pressure data are necessary to capture and investigate the behavior of pressure transients srirangarajan et al 2013 tpts extend the capabilities of traditional scada systems by providing real time information at a fine spatial temporal resolution that was previously unavailable the high resolution pressure data reveals additional valuable information of wdss thus contributing to the improvement of network control pressure management water loss control pipe burst and leakage detection puust et al 2010 lee et al 2015a on the other hand the enormous volumes of high resolution pressure data as utilized in this work present new challenges in data analysis information extraction and knowledge discovery in addition none of the prior studies considered using the data collected by the tpts to characterize the typical patterns of pressure transients occurring in wdss and the corresponding usteady pressure variability motivated by the availability of high frequency pressure data collected over an extended period of time we propose a time series data mining procedure to detect the pressure changes and discover the patterns of pressure transients from high resolution pressure data collected by a network of tpts explicitly the objectives of this work are to a deploy a network of high frequency tpts for an extended period of time at various locations in a wds b automate the detection of transient pressure changes c automate the classification of transient pressure patterns and pressure intensity and d quantitatively assess and validate the proposed approach 2 methods in this study time series data mining tsdm is identified as a promising approach to explore the behavior of pressure transients in wdss tsdm refers to the process of non trivial extraction of implicit previously unknown and potentially useful information from time series data fayyad et al 1996 a two step tsdm approach is proposed for transient detection and pattern discovery based on high resolution pressure data collected by a network of pressure sensors in the first step raw pressure data are preprocessed from which pressure changes are detected based on a modified cumulative sum control chart cusum approach in the second step the pressure transients are extracted from the original time series and then clustered based on their similarity it follows then that a prototype is discovered for each cluster to represent the corresponding characteristic pattern finally pressure intensity plots are generated to assess the pressure variability for each characteristic transient the main steps of the proposed algorithm are described in subsequent sections and depicted in fig s1 in the supporting information si 2 1 time series representation due to the impulsive noises and large dimensionality presented in the raw pressure time series the first step in this analysis is to represent the time series in a lower dimensional space time series representation is integral in several perspectives aghabozorgi et al 2015 firstly it reduces the dimension of the original data so that efficiency of the tsdm techniques can be significantly improved keogh et al 2004 secondly it is capable of eliminating noises the distracting information in the raw data thus allowing the processes e g distance measurement and clustering to focus on the actual functional data while minimizing the bias towards noises ratanamahatana and keogh 2005 myriad techniques have been developed for time series representation including but not limited to fourier transformations agrawal et al 1993 keogh et al 2001 wavelets chan and fu 1999 symbolic aggregate approximation sax lin et al 2003 and piece wise aggregate approximation paa keogh and pazzani 2001 a comprehensive review of time series representation can be found in aghabozorgi et al 2015 and keogh et al 2004 in this study paa is adopted to reduce the dimensionality of the measured pressure time series due to its simplicity and high computational performance keogh et al 2004 the main idea behind paa is to reduce the dimensionality of the original data through data integration over time given a time series x x 1 x 2 x n and the dimension of the transformed space n we index 1 n n and assume that n is a factor of n then the time series x of length n can be represented in n space by a vector x x 1 x 2 x n the i t h element of x is calculated by the following equation keogh and pazzani 2001 1 x i n n n n i j n n i 1 1 x j ultimately paa algorithm reduces the time series from n dimensions to n dimensions by dividing the data into n equally sized segments the resolution of paa algorithm is then defined by the resolution of the resulting n dimensional data 2 2 change detection to demonstrate the proposed procedure it is imperative to define two events used throughout this work change defined in relation to the preceding data that is occurring faster than the expected rate and greater than the expected amplitude including positive raise and negative change drop the analysis in this section pertains to pressure change detection transient refers to any pressure wave that is short lived pressure transients may include several changes the analysis in the subsequent three sections pertains to pressure transient extraction a growing number of techniques have been developed to detect changes in high frequency pressure signals colombo et al 2009 xu and karney 2017 where discrete wavelet transformation dwt ferrante et al 2007 srirangarajan et al 2013 lee et al 2015b and cusum misiunas et al 2005 lee et al 2015b are the two most widely used techniques dwt based algorithms decompose the one dimensional pressure signal into different temporal and frequency scales by computing the convolution of the pressure signal with a given wavelet of different period and phase the decomposition permits the exploration of the temporal variability in the signal at different scales for example one can employ lower scale decompositions for the localization of high frequency components or apply higher scale decompositions for the localization of low frequency components to retain more global information as the decomposition level of dwt increases the noises in the signal are suppressed and the singularities are emphasized mallat and hwang 1992 ferrante et al 2007 this property makes dwt a promising approach for detecting abrupt changes however it does not serve as an appropriate option in our application for several reasons firstly it is possible that the minor pressure changes are emphasized and recognized as significant thereby leading to false alarms lee et al 2015b secondly the performance of dwt largely depends on the mother wavelet thus it is integral to choose a mother wavelet that resembles the natural variability of the data khalil and duchêne 1999 consequently it is difficult to choose an appropriate mother wavelet to resemble all pressure changes which are essentially different thirdly the parameters in dwt such as the level and the threshold of the decomposition coefficients are nonintuitive with vague physical meanings making it difficult to determine these parameters in this work we rely on the modified cusum detection scheme since it exhibits the following characteristics a the scheme has no bias on the change patterns and is able to detect changes of any shape as long as it occurs faster than expected rate and greater than expected amplitude and b the scheme is highly interpretable i e involving as few parameters as possible that have clear physical meanings and can be determined using design principles the traditional two sided cusum was proposed by page 1954 as two repeated uses of sequential probability tests for detecting an increase c and the decrease c in the mean of the signal gustafsson 2000 the cusum calculation is initialized by setting c 0 c 0 0 at each time step t cusum tracks the characteristics of the changes in the pressure signal i e rate and magnitude and compares these characteristics with control limits i e d r i f t and t h r e s h o l d as follows 2 dp t p t p t 1 c t c t 1 dp t d r i f t c t c t 1 dp t d r i f t where p t is the pressure data collected at time t d p t is the pressure variation between time t and t 1 and d r i f t represents the minimum countable change rate if either c t and c t are greater than zero indicating that the pressure change within one time step is larger than d r i f t then either c t or c t will increase respectively otherwise when the pressure change per time step is smaller than the minimum countable change rate d r i f t c t or c t will be set to zero and the corresponding time will be labeled as a candidate start time t s t of the prospective change then as the changes accumulate when either c t or c t exceed the specific control limit t h r e s h o l d an alarm is raised marking the detection of an abrupt change it follows then that the alarm t a t and the start t s t s times are recorded the physical meaning of the two parameters is clear d r i f t relates to the control limit of the pressure changes within one time step and t h r e s h o l d represents the control limit of the accumulative amplitude of change however quantitatively since c or c are subtracted by d r i f t every time step they are significantly smaller than the actual pressure change between the start point and the alarm point as a result t h r e s h o l d does not control the actual limit of the pressure change amplitude but a considerably smaller value instead especially when d r i f t is a large number to resolve this problem c r e a l and c r e a l are introduced to record the actual amplitude of the pressure change as defined below 3 c r e a l t c r e a l t 1 dp t c r e a l t c r e a l t 1 dp t as before per time step pressure changes that are smaller than d r i f t are eliminated by setting c c c r e a l and c r e a l to zeros and the candidate start time t s is labeled based on the positiveness of c and c the major modification is that c r e a l and c r e a l instead of c and c are adopted as the test statistics to test whether the amplitude of pressure changes exceed the t h r e s h o l d in other words the alarm timestamps t a are recorded based on the relative relation between c r e a l or c r e a l and t h r e s h o l d thereby the t h r e s h o l d can represent the exact amplitude limit for the pressure changes algorithm 1 summarizes the modified cusum algorithm to detect abrupt changes in the pressure signal image 2 to detect the end time of the change t e the same procedure is executed on the reverse time series then t s and t e respectively denote the starting and ending time of the change detected at alarm time t a in the results section we will show how c c c r e a l c r e a l are updated as well as how d r i f t and t h r e s h o l d are selected based on the events of interest at the end of the change detection process we are able to automatically detect rapid changes in the pressure signal 2 3 transient extraction a collection of subsequent pressure changes forms a pressure transient event as defined in the previous section after individual changes are detected pressure data of a certain duration i e window size are collected for further analysis the analysis window is required to contain sufficient amount of information to represent a complete transient event including several sequential pressure changes moreover as a pressure transient dissipates by the end of an analysis window we expect the unsteady pressure to stabilize without significant oscillations to identify the characteristic window size we define the absolute pressure difference between the last two points of the analysis window as 4 δ p p 1 p 2 where the pressure difference at the end of the transient should approach zero δ p 0 in the results section we provide details on selecting the characteristic window size for pressure transients based on the mean and variance of δ p 2 4 distance measure distance measure quantitatively illustrating the level of similarity between sequences is of fundamental importance to a variety of time series mining tasks including clustering time series distance measures could be classified into three categories model based metric non elastic metric and elastic metric aghabozorgi et al 2015 in model based metrics such as arma process kalpakis et al 2001 xiong and yeung 2002 the original data are first fitted into a certain statistical model and then distances are measured based on the parameters of the fitted model non elastic metrics such as euclidean distance operate in the time domain and measure the distance by comparing the values at each time step in contrast elastic metrics compensate for potential temporal misalignment through some elastic adjustment lines and bagnall 2015 thereby if the occurrence of the patterns in time is of concern elastic metrics such as dynamic time warping dtw berndt and clifford 1994 allow robust time distance calculation while non elastic metric can be extremely brittle because of their sensitive nature to distortions in time axis chu et al 2002 therefore the dtw elastic distance metric is adopted in this study the dtw algorithm as the most widely used elastic metric can be briefly introduced as follows keogh and pazzani 2001 to align two given time series x 1 x 11 x 12 x 1 n and x 2 x 21 x 22 x 2 m using dtw an n m euclidean distance matrix d is first constructed with d i j being the euclidean distance between points x 1 i and x 2 j predicated on the euclidean distance matrix the cumulative distance matrix γ and the corresponding wrapping path i e the path minimizing the warping cost between the two signals are calculated using dynamic programming as shown in equation 5 the control variable w restricts the bandwidth of the search path and thus limits the allowed temporal misalignment between the two signals fu et al 2008 5 γ i j d i j min γ i 1 j 1 γ i 1 j γ i j 1 j w i j w intuitively equation 5 recursively computes the least cost distance between each pair of points i j while considering the pairwise euclidean distance d i j plus the cumulative distances it takes to get to point i j from 0 0 and allowing for i and j to take any values i e not restricting the path to be i j as in the euclidean distance then γ n m represents the dtw distance fig 1 schematically illustrates the dtw distance measure with a limited bandwidth w where each cell in the shaded matrix represents the cumulative distance γ i j and the solid white line represents the warping path with minimum cost between the two signal x 1 and x 2 in our application different pressure signals are expected to exhibit temporal misalignment e g starting time of the signal as well as different shapes and magnitudes the dtw distance measure calculates the best match that accounts for the temporal shift elongation and compression of the signals in time domain hence the dtw distance allows capturing the general shape of the signal rather than the perfect matching once defined the dtw distance measure can be used to evaluate the similarity between different pressure transient signals extracted in previous step 2 5 pattern discovery the objective of pattern discovery is to identify an unknown subset of signals that occur frequently in a dataset and then make high level summaries of the massive data set accordingly in this study pressure transient signals have already been identified from the complete time series based on the detected changes and extracted transients in previous sections the next step is to classify the characteristic patterns from the set of extracted pressure transients for this objective clustering is the most commonly used technique fu 2011 as a solution for classifying enormous data without early knowledge about the classes aghabozorgi et al 2015 the problem of time series clustering is defined as follows aghabozorgi et al 2015 given a dataset d composed of n time series signals d x 1 x 2 x n the process of unsupervised partitioning of d into c c 1 c 2 c k in such a way that homogeneous time series are grouped together based on a certain similarity measure is called time series clustering then c i is called a cluster where d i 1 k c i and c i c j ø for i j various algorithms have been developed to cluster time series data including k means k medoids agglomerative hierarchical self organizing maps liao 2005 in myriad domains tran and wagner 2002 lee et al 2006 fu 2011 among all clustering algorithms k means clustering is the most popular one because of its computational efficiency and performance han et al 2001 wu et al 2008 the procedure of k means clustering can be briefly explained as follows initially k objects are randomly selected each of which represents an initial center or mean of a cluster secondly each object in the data set is assigned to the closest cluster based on the distance measured between an object in the dataset and the center of the cluster mean thirdly the new mean for each cluster is recalculated based on newly classified objects the process iterates until some criteria function converges or no improvement change is achieved the dtw distance measure is used to cluster pressure transients using the k means algorithm the objective of this study is to reveal recurrent and consistent patterns of the pressure transients therefore a prototype is required to represent each cluster herein the prototype of the i t h cluster is defined as its medoid m i whose dtw distance to all other transients in that cluster is minimal 3 results and discussion 3 1 data preparation the methodology proposed here is tested on real data collected by high frequency transient pressure transmitters distributed in a large water utility each tpt unit includes a pressure sensor taking 64 samples per second and a remote telemetry unit which transmits the data to a server the tpt unit is mounted on a fire hydrant as shown in fig 2 a an example of a pressure signal recorded by a tpt during one day is shown in fig 2 b the dataset available in this study is high resolution pressure data collected by tpts from october 2017 to august 2018 and is provided in the si as the preprocessing step paa segmentation is applied to the raw pressure data to reduce dimension and eliminate noises to determine the dimensionality reduction several resolutions are tested the effect of dimensionality reduction on the number of detected pressure changes per day are compared in fig s2 of the si as the paa resolution gets coarser the number of detected changes decreases because of the averaging nature of paa algorithm additionally the finer the paa resolution the more computation effort is required for the proposed algorithms therefore there is a trade off between efficiency and accuracy in the choice of paa resolutions in this study paa resolution is chosen to be 10 s as this provides the greatest gain in computational efficiency and only small compromise in accuracy 3 2 change detection the pressure changes detected by cusum algorithm are characterized by the start time t s and the pressure at start time p t s as well as the end time t e and the pressure at end time p t e the duration t of the pressure change is then defined by t t e t s this work focuses on significant and abrupt pressure changes satisfying the following requirements based on which the parameters in cusum algorithm are chosen 1 the pressure change is significant enough that the amplitude δ p is greater than 10 psi 6 δ p p t e p t s 10 psi accordingly the t h r e s h o l d parameter of cusum algorithm is set to 10 psi 2 the pressure change is abrupt enough that the rate of change is greater than 0 1 psi s 7 d p d t p n 1 p n t n 1 t n 0 1 psi s where d t is the paa resolution in this study d t equals 10 s because the paa resolution is set to be 10 s therefore the d r i f t parameter is set to 0 1 psi s 10 s 1 psi with the parameters discussed above fig 2 b shows cusum results of the pressure data collected from tpt 1 in the network within a typical day when 11 pressure changes are detected the right arrows represent the starting point t s p t s and the left arrows represent the ending points t e p t e of the detected changes fig 2 c illustrates the first two detected pressure change a pressure raise followed by a pressure drop the combination of which constitutes a pressure transient the corresponding cusum results for the first two detected changes are then presented in fig 2 d when the cusum value c r e a l or c r e a l exceeds the t h r e s h o l d represented by the red dashed line an alarm will be raised illustrated by the red dots consequently the start and end point will be recorded the cusum algorithm is then applied to pressure data collected by tpt 1 during the entire time period where 1314 pressure changes were detected the historical analysis of the pressure changes is represented in fig s3 showing the distribution of the pressure change amplitude δ p and pressure change duration t notably the amplitude distribution is not symmetric about 0 instead it is skewed towards the left indicating that more negative changes drop occurred than their positive counterparts raise during this time period the pressure change duration varies from 10 s to 150 s with an average duration of 60 s 3 3 transient extraction the analysis window represents the duration of the pressure transients and should encompass all necessary information to represent a complete pressure transient event typically comprised of several pressure changes for example the transient event shown in fig 2 c constitutes two sequential pressure changes one positive change and one negative change subsequently on the basis of detected changes in the previous section several window sizes for transient extraction are tested and the absolute pressure difference between last two points of the analysis window δ p is calculated for the entire data fig 3 shows the mean and variance of the δ p distribution it can be noticed that the mean and variance decrease as the window size increases from 1 min to 5 min and stabilize after that therefore 5 min as the knee point is chosen to be the window size to extract transient events and perform the following analysis based on the 1314 detected pressure changes 586 5 min transient events are extracted from the original data 3 4 similarity search in terms of similarity search our interests lie in the similarity in patterns instead of the absolute amplitude therefore the extracted pressure transients are normalized dtw distances between every pair of the 586 normalized transient events are calculated with bandwidth w 5 allowing a maximum temporal misalignment of 50 s which is shorter than the mean duration of a typical pressure change 60 s as shown in fig s3 thereby avoiding possible excessive misalignment consequently the pairwise dtw distances comprise a 586 586 distance matrix of which the i j t h element represents the dtw distance between i t h and j t h transient event the distance matrix between each pair of detected pressure transients based on their chronological appearance is shown in fig 4 a the darker the i j t h pixel the lower the value of i j t h element is and the more similar the i t h and j t h transient events are on the basis of dtw distance matrix the normalized pressure transients can then be mined by k means clustering since in k means algorithm the number of clusters has to be predefined we experiment with different number of clusters the results show that three clusters are most informative in terms of identifying and distinguishing the patterns for the given dataset the evaluation of the number of clusters is demonstrated in the next section after clustering the transient events are sorted based on their cluster labels and the corresponding distance matrix is shown in fig 4 b compared with the distance matrix before clustering as in fig 4 a the matrix after clustering is generally better organized specifically three distinguished partitions can be identified corresponding to the three identified clusters in addition the diagonal block matrices take lower values than the off diagonal ones indicating that the within cluster distances are smaller than the between cluster distances fig 5 shows the clustering results and the identified prototype patterns for each cluster explicitly c l u s t e r 0 includes 212 down surge pressure transients where pressure drops at the beginning of the transient event fluctuates and finally stabilizes if we define a pair of pressure increase and decrease as a cycle p a t t e r n 0 constitutes a major cycle and a minor cycle however c l u s t e r 1 comprises 251 up surge transient events characterized by starting with pressure raise and following by a pressure drop only one major cycle exists in this pattern and the pressure stabilizes at a higher pressure level than the original in c l u s t e r 2 which is made up of 123 transient events the representative pattern shares some similarity with p a t t e r n 1 but differs in that the pressure of p a t t e r n 2 returns to original level when it stabilized results for data collected at a different location tpt 2 are shown in fig s4 where four distinguishing patterns are identified significant differences can be noticed between the pressure patterns discovered in different stations several reasons can contribute to these differences 1 the relative location of the tpt to the pumping station in the pressure zone 2 the pumping operation routine in the corresponding pumping station and 3 the characteristics of the piped network these differences are instructive in understanding the relation between the transient patterns and pump operations or piped network characteristics and in turn their effects on pipe condition rapid changes in flow generate pressure waves that travel through the pipelines the pressure signals undergo reflection and attenuation but largely maintain their shape throughout the system lee et al 2015a the internal characteristics of the pipelines such as material diameter and friction as well as external characteristics such as leaks and blockages affect transient response and create changes to the shape of the pressure wave xu and karney 2017 for example the occurrence of a leak releases some amount of flow through the orifice thus providing partial transient protection for the system and modifying the magnitude of the transient pressure wave xu and karney 2017 by analyzing the pressure signals in the time and or frequency domain system uncertain characteristics and faults can be detected a variety of transient reflection damping and response technique as well as inverse optimization techniques exist for identifying pipeline characteristics and or faults by tracing the changes in the time of arrival magnitude and shape of the pressure transients colombo et al 2009 ghorbanian et al 2016 3 5 clustering results analysis numerical criteria to evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithm can be classified into two categories external index which is appropriate when the labels of ground truth are given and internal index which is appropriate when ground truth is unknown aghabozorgi et al 2015 in this study we do not know in advance the prototype of each cluster and which cluster each signal should belong to therefore only internal index is applicable we apply three internal indexes to evaluate the performance of the cluster results and determine the optimal number of clusters k 1 silhouette coefficient a measure of how well a signal x i is assigned to its cluster rousseeuw 1987 2 sum of squared error sse describes the coherence of the given clusters han et al 2011 and 3 calinski harabaz ch index defined as the ratio between the within cluster dispersion and the between cluster dispersion caliński and harabasz 1974 detailed explanation of the three indexes can be found in the si fig 6 shows silhouette coefficient sse and calinski harabaz index as a function of the number of clusters for pressure transients recorded at tpt 1 both averaged silhouette coefficient and calinski harabaz index peak at three clusters which is also the knee point for sse curve therefore cluster number of three is identified as the most informative setting for the given pressure data as shown in fig 5 similar analysis was conducted for tpt 2 which resulted in four significant transient clusters see figs s6 and s7 3 6 pressure intensity pressure transients as shown in this work are intrinsically cyclical due to the inherent diurnal pumping operations and demand patterns and may impose excessive internal stress on the pipelines cyclic load or fatigue is the most predominant mechanical force that can substantially contribute to pipe failures schijve 2009 yu et al 2016 fatigue failure is caused by repeated alternating stresses of an intensity considerably below the normal strength and it strongly depends on the frequency intensity and shape of the stress cycles cui 2002 schijve 2009 rajani and kleiner 2010 having identified the shapes of the characteristic transients we can evaluate the frequency and intensity of each type of transient event pressure intensity is calculated as the absolute difference between the minimum and maximum pressures in a given transient event and frequency is the number of times a given range of pressure intensity was observed fig 7 shows the cumulative probability distributions of pressure intensity for the three characteristic patterns identified in tpt 1 upsurge patterns solid gray and black lines show more frequent low intensity transient and less frequent high intensity transients contrary the downsurge patterns dashed black line show more frequent high intensity transients similar results for tpt 2 are shown in fig s8 in the si the frequency intensity and shape of the transient pressure patterns discovered and extracted by the proposed method can be applied to improve the work flow of the calibration of numerical transient models which cannot be calibrated nor validated without comparison with data for example in transient hydraulic analysis several pipeline parameters are required including wave speed and friction factor the evaluation of which is not a trivial task with the availability of pressure data collected by pressure sensors it is possible that these parameters can be calibrated more rigorously using inverse optimization techniques however if the calibration is performed by minimizing the difference of observed raw pressure and simulated pressure at each time step it is highly possible that the noises in the observed data would be exaggerated to resolve this problem the shape intensity and frequency of the patterns an be used as dynamic characteristics of transient pressure to calibrate the numerical models in a more effective and efficient manner in the context of condition assessment previous studies have shown that pipe failures are not only related by the minimum and maximum pressure as traditionally identified from transient hydraulic analysis but also highly correlated with the shape of pressure transient patterns including duration frequency amplitude as well as sequence of cycles yu et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 2017 however in water distribution systems the impact and specific contributing features of pressure transients on pipe failures are not yet clear therefore the proposed methodology provides a solid foundation for further studying the cause effect relationship between pressure transient patterns and pipe failures thereby contributing to a more comprehensive risk assessment 4 conclusion in this paper we propose a tsdm approach to investigate pressure variability in wds by extracting the shape intensity and frequency from high frequency pressure sensors the cusum algorithm was modified to directly relate parameters i e t h r e s h o l d and d r i f t to the physical characteristics of pressure changes i e amplitude and gradient the modified cusum change detection algorithm together with dtw distance measure and k means clustering technique was applied to detect and classify the pressure transient events into clusters for which the representative patterns were then discovered several performance scores were suggested to investigate the optimal number of clusters and evaluate the quality of the clustering results the proposed procedure was demonstrated using pressure data collected by two tpts located at different pressure zones where different transient patterns were discovered the example applications have shown tsdm to be a powerful tool for transient pressure analysis so as to reveal consistent and unique patterns across multiple sensing locations in wdss to maximize the full benefits of transient pressure analysis future research should be devoted to identifying the source of the transients and its effect on pipe condition and

18824,pressure transients have been identified as one of the major contributing factors in many pipe failures in water distribution systems wdss the behavior of these pressure transients is largely unknown and cannot be fully assessed by numerical simulation or modeling this study investigates the behavior of pressure transients in wdss as measured by high frequency pressure sensors a time series data mining tsdm approach is proposed to detect and cluster pressure transients to reveal recurrent and consistent patterns the proposed technique based on a modified two sided cumulative sum

means clustering 1 introduction spanning over one million miles across the united states u s water distribution systems wdss function as complex infrastructure networks to maintain the reliable and safe supply of drinking water usepa 2016 the american society of civil engineers asce estimates that the aging and deteriorating infrastructures are wasting 14 18 of the treated water asce 2017 due to the relation between pressure pipe failures and water loss pressure management has become one of the most popular management interventions implemented by water utilities in their efforts to reduce pipe failures and water loss mckenzie and wegelin 2009 the primary objective of almost all measures of pressure management constitutes reducing the maximum steady amplitude and the excessive unsteady variability of the pressure while the contributions of the former to pipe failure have been intensively studied kabir et al 2015 martínez codina et al 2015 there is a lack of quantitative research on the roles that the latter pressure variability plays in wdss ghorbanian et al 2016 flow conditions in pipelines can be disrupted by pipe failures background leakages and bursts system operations and demand fluctuations consequently creating corresponding unsteady changes in water pressure commonly termed pressure transients or water hammers these events occur quickly but have the potential to result in the pipe deterioration by introducing extreme pressure variability and intriguing fatigue starczewska et al 2015 despite the general understanding that pressure variability can contribute to pipe deterioration limited research has focused on investigating these relations quantitatively hoskins and stoianov 2014 historically the main reasons for this lack of understanding are the technological constraints such as the limited availability of high resolution pressure transmitters to measure the pressure and the computation capacity to process the data therefore most studies about pressure transients were restricted to modeling wylie et al 1993 ghidaoui et al 2005 using various of numerical simulation techniques de almeida and koelle 1992 karney and mcinnis 1992 boulos et al 2005 wood et al 2005 chaudhry 2014 on the basis of these numerical simulation various studies have been conducted to investigate drinking water quality due to pressure transients ebacher et al 2012 leak detection brunone and ferrante 2001 colombo et al 2009 pipe deterioration and corrosion assessment gong et al 2012 unfortunately without the availability of high resolution pressure data the validation of the numerical results has been limited over the past few years the rapid development of data logging and data mining technologies has relieved some of the aforementioned constraints and made it possible to investigate the pressure transients in wdss in a more rigorous manner the emerging applications of low cost high frequency transient pressure transmitters tpts introduced to continuously monitor water pressure directly contribute to the pressure management in wdss allen et al 2011 trimble water website 2018 visenti 2018 high frequency pressure data have been foremost utilized to validate and calibrate the simulation models by comparing and fitting the numerical results to collected pressure data friedman and friedman 2004 ebacher et al 2010 meseguer et al 2014 rathnayaka et al 2016 more recently data driven approaches have been proposed to detect and localize pipe bursts and leaks misiunas et al 2005 srirangarajan et al 2013 lee et al 2015b wu et al 2016 the scope of previous works has been limited due to the typically short duration of sensors deployment and more importantly low sampling frequency however pressure transients reflecting the responses of wdss to normal and abnormal changes are manifested as pressure waves traveling in the wdss with very high velocity in the range of 100 1400 m s ghidaoui et al 2005 this implies that lower sampling resolutions 5 15 min characteristic of supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems prevent from monitoring transient pressures and high resolution pressure data are necessary to capture and investigate the behavior of pressure transients srirangarajan et al 2013 tpts extend the capabilities of traditional scada systems by providing real time information at a fine spatial temporal resolution that was previously unavailable the high resolution pressure data reveals additional valuable information of wdss thus contributing to the improvement of network control pressure management water loss control pipe burst and leakage detection puust et al 2010 lee et al 2015a on the other hand the enormous volumes of high resolution pressure data as utilized in this work present new challenges in data analysis information extraction and knowledge discovery in addition none of the prior studies considered using the data collected by the tpts to characterize the typical patterns of pressure transients occurring in wdss and the corresponding usteady pressure variability motivated by the availability of high frequency pressure data collected over an extended period of time we propose a time series data mining procedure to detect the pressure changes and discover the patterns of pressure transients from high resolution pressure data collected by a network of tpts explicitly the objectives of this work are to a deploy a network of high frequency tpts for an extended period of time at various locations in a wds b automate the detection of transient pressure changes c automate the classification of transient pressure patterns and pressure intensity and d quantitatively assess and validate the proposed approach 2 methods in this study time series data mining tsdm is identified as a promising approach to explore the behavior of pressure transients in wdss tsdm refers to the process of non trivial extraction of implicit previously unknown and potentially useful information from time series data fayyad et al 1996 a two step tsdm approach is proposed for transient detection and pattern discovery based on high resolution pressure data collected by a network of pressure sensors in the first step raw pressure data are preprocessed from which pressure changes are detected based on a modified cumulative sum control chart cusum approach in the second step the pressure transients are extracted from the original time series and then clustered based on their similarity it follows then that a prototype is discovered for each cluster to represent the corresponding characteristic pattern finally pressure intensity plots are generated to assess the pressure variability for each characteristic transient the main steps of the proposed algorithm are described in subsequent sections and depicted in fig s1 in the supporting information si 2 1 time series representation due to the impulsive noises and large dimensionality presented in the raw pressure time series the first step in this analysis is to represent the time series in a lower dimensional space time series representation is integral in several perspectives aghabozorgi et al 2015 firstly it reduces the dimension of the original data so that efficiency of the tsdm techniques can be significantly improved keogh et al 2004 secondly it is capable of eliminating noises the distracting information in the raw data thus allowing the processes e g distance measurement and clustering to focus on the actual functional data while minimizing the bias towards noises ratanamahatana and keogh 2005 myriad techniques have been developed for time series representation including but not limited to fourier transformations agrawal et al 1993 keogh et al 2001 wavelets chan and fu 1999 symbolic aggregate approximation sax lin et al 2003 and piece wise aggregate approximation paa keogh and pazzani 2001 a comprehensive review of time series representation can be found in aghabozorgi et al 2015 and keogh et al 2004 in this study paa is adopted to reduce the dimensionality of the measured pressure time series due to its simplicity and high computational performance keogh et al 2004 the main idea behind paa is to reduce the dimensionality of the original data through data integration over time given a time series x x 1 x 2 x n and the dimension of the transformed space n we index 1 n n and assume that n is a factor of n then the time series x of length n can be represented in n space by a vector x x 1 x 2 x n the i t h element of x is calculated by the following equation keogh and pazzani 2001 1 x i n n n n i j n n i 1 1 x j ultimately paa algorithm reduces the time series from n dimensions to n dimensions by dividing the data into n equally sized segments the resolution of paa algorithm is then defined by the resolution of the resulting n dimensional data 2 2 change detection to demonstrate the proposed procedure it is imperative to define two events used throughout this work change defined in relation to the preceding data that is occurring faster than the expected rate and greater than the expected amplitude including positive raise and negative change drop the analysis in this section pertains to pressure change detection transient refers to any pressure wave that is short lived pressure transients may include several changes the analysis in the subsequent three sections pertains to pressure transient extraction a growing number of techniques have been developed to detect changes in high frequency pressure signals colombo et al 2009 xu and karney 2017 where discrete wavelet transformation dwt ferrante et al 2007 srirangarajan et al 2013 lee et al 2015b and cusum misiunas et al 2005 lee et al 2015b are the two most widely used techniques dwt based algorithms decompose the one dimensional pressure signal into different temporal and frequency scales by computing the convolution of the pressure signal with a given wavelet of different period and phase the decomposition permits the exploration of the temporal variability in the signal at different scales for example one can employ lower scale decompositions for the localization of high frequency components or apply higher scale decompositions for the localization of low frequency components to retain more global information as the decomposition level of dwt increases the noises in the signal are suppressed and the singularities are emphasized mallat and hwang 1992 ferrante et al 2007 this property makes dwt a promising approach for detecting abrupt changes however it does not serve as an appropriate option in our application for several reasons firstly it is possible that the minor pressure changes are emphasized and recognized as significant thereby leading to false alarms lee et al 2015b secondly the performance of dwt largely depends on the mother wavelet thus it is integral to choose a mother wavelet that resembles the natural variability of the data khalil and duchêne 1999 consequently it is difficult to choose an appropriate mother wavelet to resemble all pressure changes which are essentially different thirdly the parameters in dwt such as the level and the threshold of the decomposition coefficients are nonintuitive with vague physical meanings making it difficult to determine these parameters in this work we rely on the modified cusum detection scheme since it exhibits the following characteristics a the scheme has no bias on the change patterns and is able to detect changes of any shape as long as it occurs faster than expected rate and greater than expected amplitude and b the scheme is highly interpretable i e involving as few parameters as possible that have clear physical meanings and can be determined using design principles the traditional two sided cusum was proposed by page 1954 as two repeated uses of sequential probability tests for detecting an increase c and the decrease c in the mean of the signal gustafsson 2000 the cusum calculation is initialized by setting c 0 c 0 0 at each time step t cusum tracks the characteristics of the changes in the pressure signal i e rate and magnitude and compares these characteristics with control limits i e d r i f t and t h r e s h o l d as follows 2 dp t p t p t 1 c t c t 1 dp t d r i f t c t c t 1 dp t d r i f t where p t is the pressure data collected at time t d p t is the pressure variation between time t and t 1 and d r i f t represents the minimum countable change rate if either c t and c t are greater than zero indicating that the pressure change within one time step is larger than d r i f t then either c t or c t will increase respectively otherwise when the pressure change per time step is smaller than the minimum countable change rate d r i f t c t or c t will be set to zero and the corresponding time will be labeled as a candidate start time t s t of the prospective change then as the changes accumulate when either c t or c t exceed the specific control limit t h r e s h o l d an alarm is raised marking the detection of an abrupt change it follows then that the alarm t a t and the start t s t s times are recorded the physical meaning of the two parameters is clear d r i f t relates to the control limit of the pressure changes within one time step and t h r e s h o l d represents the control limit of the accumulative amplitude of change however quantitatively since c or c are subtracted by d r i f t every time step they are significantly smaller than the actual pressure change between the start point and the alarm point as a result t h r e s h o l d does not control the actual limit of the pressure change amplitude but a considerably smaller value instead especially when d r i f t is a large number to resolve this problem c r e a l and c r e a l are introduced to record the actual amplitude of the pressure change as defined below 3 c r e a l t c r e a l t 1 dp t c r e a l t c r e a l t 1 dp t as before per time step pressure changes that are smaller than d r i f t are eliminated by setting c c c r e a l and c r e a l to zeros and the candidate start time t s is labeled based on the positiveness of c and c the major modification is that c r e a l and c r e a l instead of c and c are adopted as the test statistics to test whether the amplitude of pressure changes exceed the t h r e s h o l d in other words the alarm timestamps t a are recorded based on the relative relation between c r e a l or c r e a l and t h r e s h o l d thereby the t h r e s h o l d can represent the exact amplitude limit for the pressure changes algorithm 1 summarizes the modified cusum algorithm to detect abrupt changes in the pressure signal image 2 to detect the end time of the change t e the same procedure is executed on the reverse time series then t s and t e respectively denote the starting and ending time of the change detected at alarm time t a in the results section we will show how c c c r e a l c r e a l are updated as well as how d r i f t and t h r e s h o l d are selected based on the events of interest at the end of the change detection process we are able to automatically detect rapid changes in the pressure signal 2 3 transient extraction a collection of subsequent pressure changes forms a pressure transient event as defined in the previous section after individual changes are detected pressure data of a certain duration i e window size are collected for further analysis the analysis window is required to contain sufficient amount of information to represent a complete transient event including several sequential pressure changes moreover as a pressure transient dissipates by the end of an analysis window we expect the unsteady pressure to stabilize without significant oscillations to identify the characteristic window size we define the absolute pressure difference between the last two points of the analysis window as 4 δ p p 1 p 2 where the pressure difference at the end of the transient should approach zero δ p 0 in the results section we provide details on selecting the characteristic window size for pressure transients based on the mean and variance of δ p 2 4 distance measure distance measure quantitatively illustrating the level of similarity between sequences is of fundamental importance to a variety of time series mining tasks including clustering time series distance measures could be classified into three categories model based metric non elastic metric and elastic metric aghabozorgi et al 2015 in model based metrics such as arma process kalpakis et al 2001 xiong and yeung 2002 the original data are first fitted into a certain statistical model and then distances are measured based on the parameters of the fitted model non elastic metrics such as euclidean distance operate in the time domain and measure the distance by comparing the values at each time step in contrast elastic metrics compensate for potential temporal misalignment through some elastic adjustment lines and bagnall 2015 thereby if the occurrence of the patterns in time is of concern elastic metrics such as dynamic time warping dtw berndt and clifford 1994 allow robust time distance calculation while non elastic metric can be extremely brittle because of their sensitive nature to distortions in time axis chu et al 2002 therefore the dtw elastic distance metric is adopted in this study the dtw algorithm as the most widely used elastic metric can be briefly introduced as follows keogh and pazzani 2001 to align two given time series x 1 x 11 x 12 x 1 n and x 2 x 21 x 22 x 2 m using dtw an n m euclidean distance matrix d is first constructed with d i j being the euclidean distance between points x 1 i and x 2 j predicated on the euclidean distance matrix the cumulative distance matrix γ and the corresponding wrapping path i e the path minimizing the warping cost between the two signals are calculated using dynamic programming as shown in equation 5 the control variable w restricts the bandwidth of the search path and thus limits the allowed temporal misalignment between the two signals fu et al 2008 5 γ i j d i j min γ i 1 j 1 γ i 1 j γ i j 1 j w i j w intuitively equation 5 recursively computes the least cost distance between each pair of points i j while considering the pairwise euclidean distance d i j plus the cumulative distances it takes to get to point i j from 0 0 and allowing for i and j to take any values i e not restricting the path to be i j as in the euclidean distance then γ n m represents the dtw distance fig 1 schematically illustrates the dtw distance measure with a limited bandwidth w where each cell in the shaded matrix represents the cumulative distance γ i j and the solid white line represents the warping path with minimum cost between the two signal x 1 and x 2 in our application different pressure signals are expected to exhibit temporal misalignment e g starting time of the signal as well as different shapes and magnitudes the dtw distance measure calculates the best match that accounts for the temporal shift elongation and compression of the signals in time domain hence the dtw distance allows capturing the general shape of the signal rather than the perfect matching once defined the dtw distance measure can be used to evaluate the similarity between different pressure transient signals extracted in previous step 2 5 pattern discovery the objective of pattern discovery is to identify an unknown subset of signals that occur frequently in a dataset and then make high level summaries of the massive data set accordingly in this study pressure transient signals have already been identified from the complete time series based on the detected changes and extracted transients in previous sections the next step is to classify the characteristic patterns from the set of extracted pressure transients for this objective clustering is the most commonly used technique fu 2011 as a solution for classifying enormous data without early knowledge about the classes aghabozorgi et al 2015 the problem of time series clustering is defined as follows aghabozorgi et al 2015 given a dataset d composed of n time series signals d x 1 x 2 x n the process of unsupervised partitioning of d into c c 1 c 2 c k in such a way that homogeneous time series are grouped together based on a certain similarity measure is called time series clustering then c i is called a cluster where d i 1 k c i and c i c j ø for i j various algorithms have been developed to cluster time series data including k means k medoids agglomerative hierarchical self organizing maps liao 2005 in myriad domains tran and wagner 2002 lee et al 2006 fu 2011 among all clustering algorithms k means clustering is the most popular one because of its computational efficiency and performance han et al 2001 wu et al 2008 the procedure of k means clustering can be briefly explained as follows initially k objects are randomly selected each of which represents an initial center or mean of a cluster secondly each object in the data set is assigned to the closest cluster based on the distance measured between an object in the dataset and the center of the cluster mean thirdly the new mean for each cluster is recalculated based on newly classified objects the process iterates until some criteria function converges or no improvement change is achieved the dtw distance measure is used to cluster pressure transients using the k means algorithm the objective of this study is to reveal recurrent and consistent patterns of the pressure transients therefore a prototype is required to represent each cluster herein the prototype of the i t h cluster is defined as its medoid m i whose dtw distance to all other transients in that cluster is minimal 3 results and discussion 3 1 data preparation the methodology proposed here is tested on real data collected by high frequency transient pressure transmitters distributed in a large water utility each tpt unit includes a pressure sensor taking 64 samples per second and a remote telemetry unit which transmits the data to a server the tpt unit is mounted on a fire hydrant as shown in fig 2 a an example of a pressure signal recorded by a tpt during one day is shown in fig 2 b the dataset available in this study is high resolution pressure data collected by tpts from october 2017 to august 2018 and is provided in the si as the preprocessing step paa segmentation is applied to the raw pressure data to reduce dimension and eliminate noises to determine the dimensionality reduction several resolutions are tested the effect of dimensionality reduction on the number of detected pressure changes per day are compared in fig s2 of the si as the paa resolution gets coarser the number of detected changes decreases because of the averaging nature of paa algorithm additionally the finer the paa resolution the more computation effort is required for the proposed algorithms therefore there is a trade off between efficiency and accuracy in the choice of paa resolutions in this study paa resolution is chosen to be 10 s as this provides the greatest gain in computational efficiency and only small compromise in accuracy 3 2 change detection the pressure changes detected by cusum algorithm are characterized by the start time t s and the pressure at start time p t s as well as the end time t e and the pressure at end time p t e the duration t of the pressure change is then defined by t t e t s this work focuses on significant and abrupt pressure changes satisfying the following requirements based on which the parameters in cusum algorithm are chosen 1 the pressure change is significant enough that the amplitude δ p is greater than 10 psi 6 δ p p t e p t s 10 psi accordingly the t h r e s h o l d parameter of cusum algorithm is set to 10 psi 2 the pressure change is abrupt enough that the rate of change is greater than 0 1 psi s 7 d p d t p n 1 p n t n 1 t n 0 1 psi s where d t is the paa resolution in this study d t equals 10 s because the paa resolution is set to be 10 s therefore the d r i f t parameter is set to 0 1 psi s 10 s 1 psi with the parameters discussed above fig 2 b shows cusum results of the pressure data collected from tpt 1 in the network within a typical day when 11 pressure changes are detected the right arrows represent the starting point t s p t s and the left arrows represent the ending points t e p t e of the detected changes fig 2 c illustrates the first two detected pressure change a pressure raise followed by a pressure drop the combination of which constitutes a pressure transient the corresponding cusum results for the first two detected changes are then presented in fig 2 d when the cusum value c r e a l or c r e a l exceeds the t h r e s h o l d represented by the red dashed line an alarm will be raised illustrated by the red dots consequently the start and end point will be recorded the cusum algorithm is then applied to pressure data collected by tpt 1 during the entire time period where 1314 pressure changes were detected the historical analysis of the pressure changes is represented in fig s3 showing the distribution of the pressure change amplitude δ p and pressure change duration t notably the amplitude distribution is not symmetric about 0 instead it is skewed towards the left indicating that more negative changes drop occurred than their positive counterparts raise during this time period the pressure change duration varies from 10 s to 150 s with an average duration of 60 s 3 3 transient extraction the analysis window represents the duration of the pressure transients and should encompass all necessary information to represent a complete pressure transient event typically comprised of several pressure changes for example the transient event shown in fig 2 c constitutes two sequential pressure changes one positive change and one negative change subsequently on the basis of detected changes in the previous section several window sizes for transient extraction are tested and the absolute pressure difference between last two points of the analysis window δ p is calculated for the entire data fig 3 shows the mean and variance of the δ p distribution it can be noticed that the mean and variance decrease as the window size increases from 1 min to 5 min and stabilize after that therefore 5 min as the knee point is chosen to be the window size to extract transient events and perform the following analysis based on the 1314 detected pressure changes 586 5 min transient events are extracted from the original data 3 4 similarity search in terms of similarity search our interests lie in the similarity in patterns instead of the absolute amplitude therefore the extracted pressure transients are normalized dtw distances between every pair of the 586 normalized transient events are calculated with bandwidth w 5 allowing a maximum temporal misalignment of 50 s which is shorter than the mean duration of a typical pressure change 60 s as shown in fig s3 thereby avoiding possible excessive misalignment consequently the pairwise dtw distances comprise a 586 586 distance matrix of which the i j t h element represents the dtw distance between i t h and j t h transient event the distance matrix between each pair of detected pressure transients based on their chronological appearance is shown in fig 4 a the darker the i j t h pixel the lower the value of i j t h element is and the more similar the i t h and j t h transient events are on the basis of dtw distance matrix the normalized pressure transients can then be mined by k means clustering since in k means algorithm the number of clusters has to be predefined we experiment with different number of clusters the results show that three clusters are most informative in terms of identifying and distinguishing the patterns for the given dataset the evaluation of the number of clusters is demonstrated in the next section after clustering the transient events are sorted based on their cluster labels and the corresponding distance matrix is shown in fig 4 b compared with the distance matrix before clustering as in fig 4 a the matrix after clustering is generally better organized specifically three distinguished partitions can be identified corresponding to the three identified clusters in addition the diagonal block matrices take lower values than the off diagonal ones indicating that the within cluster distances are smaller than the between cluster distances fig 5 shows the clustering results and the identified prototype patterns for each cluster explicitly c l u s t e r 0 includes 212 down surge pressure transients where pressure drops at the beginning of the transient event fluctuates and finally stabilizes if we define a pair of pressure increase and decrease as a cycle p a t t e r n 0 constitutes a major cycle and a minor cycle however c l u s t e r 1 comprises 251 up surge transient events characterized by starting with pressure raise and following by a pressure drop only one major cycle exists in this pattern and the pressure stabilizes at a higher pressure level than the original in c l u s t e r 2 which is made up of 123 transient events the representative pattern shares some similarity with p a t t e r n 1 but differs in that the pressure of p a t t e r n 2 returns to original level when it stabilized results for data collected at a different location tpt 2 are shown in fig s4 where four distinguishing patterns are identified significant differences can be noticed between the pressure patterns discovered in different stations several reasons can contribute to these differences 1 the relative location of the tpt to the pumping station in the pressure zone 2 the pumping operation routine in the corresponding pumping station and 3 the characteristics of the piped network these differences are instructive in understanding the relation between the transient patterns and pump operations or piped network characteristics and in turn their effects on pipe condition rapid changes in flow generate pressure waves that travel through the pipelines the pressure signals undergo reflection and attenuation but largely maintain their shape throughout the system lee et al 2015a the internal characteristics of the pipelines such as material diameter and friction as well as external characteristics such as leaks and blockages affect transient response and create changes to the shape of the pressure wave xu and karney 2017 for example the occurrence of a leak releases some amount of flow through the orifice thus providing partial transient protection for the system and modifying the magnitude of the transient pressure wave xu and karney 2017 by analyzing the pressure signals in the time and or frequency domain system uncertain characteristics and faults can be detected a variety of transient reflection damping and response technique as well as inverse optimization techniques exist for identifying pipeline characteristics and or faults by tracing the changes in the time of arrival magnitude and shape of the pressure transients colombo et al 2009 ghorbanian et al 2016 3 5 clustering results analysis numerical criteria to evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithm can be classified into two categories external index which is appropriate when the labels of ground truth are given and internal index which is appropriate when ground truth is unknown aghabozorgi et al 2015 in this study we do not know in advance the prototype of each cluster and which cluster each signal should belong to therefore only internal index is applicable we apply three internal indexes to evaluate the performance of the cluster results and determine the optimal number of clusters k 1 silhouette coefficient a measure of how well a signal x i is assigned to its cluster rousseeuw 1987 2 sum of squared error sse describes the coherence of the given clusters han et al 2011 and 3 calinski harabaz ch index defined as the ratio between the within cluster dispersion and the between cluster dispersion caliński and harabasz 1974 detailed explanation of the three indexes can be found in the si fig 6 shows silhouette coefficient sse and calinski harabaz index as a function of the number of clusters for pressure transients recorded at tpt 1 both averaged silhouette coefficient and calinski harabaz index peak at three clusters which is also the knee point for sse curve therefore cluster number of three is identified as the most informative setting for the given pressure data as shown in fig 5 similar analysis was conducted for tpt 2 which resulted in four significant transient clusters see figs s6 and s7 3 6 pressure intensity pressure transients as shown in this work are intrinsically cyclical due to the inherent diurnal pumping operations and demand patterns and may impose excessive internal stress on the pipelines cyclic load or fatigue is the most predominant mechanical force that can substantially contribute to pipe failures schijve 2009 yu et al 2016 fatigue failure is caused by repeated alternating stresses of an intensity considerably below the normal strength and it strongly depends on the frequency intensity and shape of the stress cycles cui 2002 schijve 2009 rajani and kleiner 2010 having identified the shapes of the characteristic transients we can evaluate the frequency and intensity of each type of transient event pressure intensity is calculated as the absolute difference between the minimum and maximum pressures in a given transient event and frequency is the number of times a given range of pressure intensity was observed fig 7 shows the cumulative probability distributions of pressure intensity for the three characteristic patterns identified in tpt 1 upsurge patterns solid gray and black lines show more frequent low intensity transient and less frequent high intensity transients contrary the downsurge patterns dashed black line show more frequent high intensity transients similar results for tpt 2 are shown in fig s8 in the si the frequency intensity and shape of the transient pressure patterns discovered and extracted by the proposed method can be applied to improve the work flow of the calibration of numerical transient models which cannot be calibrated nor validated without comparison with data for example in transient hydraulic analysis several pipeline parameters are required including wave speed and friction factor the evaluation of which is not a trivial task with the availability of pressure data collected by pressure sensors it is possible that these parameters can be calibrated more rigorously using inverse optimization techniques however if the calibration is performed by minimizing the difference of observed raw pressure and simulated pressure at each time step it is highly possible that the noises in the observed data would be exaggerated to resolve this problem the shape intensity and frequency of the patterns an be used as dynamic characteristics of transient pressure to calibrate the numerical models in a more effective and efficient manner in the context of condition assessment previous studies have shown that pipe failures are not only related by the minimum and maximum pressure as traditionally identified from transient hydraulic analysis but also highly correlated with the shape of pressure transient patterns including duration frequency amplitude as well as sequence of cycles yu et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 2017 however in water distribution systems the impact and specific contributing features of pressure transients on pipe failures are not yet clear therefore the proposed methodology provides a solid foundation for further studying the cause effect relationship between pressure transient patterns and pipe failures thereby contributing to a more comprehensive risk assessment 4 conclusion in this paper we propose a tsdm approach to investigate pressure variability in wds by extracting the shape intensity and frequency from high frequency pressure sensors the cusum algorithm was modified to directly relate parameters i e t h r e s h o l d and d r i f t to the physical characteristics of pressure changes i e amplitude and gradient the modified cusum change detection algorithm together with dtw distance measure and k means clustering technique was applied to detect and classify the pressure transient events into clusters for which the representative patterns were then discovered several performance scores were suggested to investigate the optimal number of clusters and evaluate the quality of the clustering results the proposed procedure was demonstrated using pressure data collected by two tpts located at different pressure zones where different transient patterns were discovered the example applications have shown tsdm to be a powerful tool for transient pressure analysis so as to reveal consistent and unique patterns across multiple sensing locations in wdss to maximize the full benefits of transient pressure analysis future research should be devoted to identifying the source of the transients and its effect on pipe condition and
