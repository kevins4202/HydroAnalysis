14615,ozonation is a viable option to improve the removal of micropollutants mps in wastewater treatment plants wwtps nevertheless the application of ozonation is hindered by its high energy requirements and by the uncertainties regarding the formation of toxic transformation products in the process energy requirements of ozonation can be reduced with a pre ozone treatment such as a biological activated carbon bac filter that removes part of the effluent organic matter before ozonation this study investigated a combination of bac filtration followed by ozonation the bo3 process to remove mps at low ozone doses and low energy input and focused on the formation of toxic organic and inorganic products during ozonation effluent from a wwtp was collected spiked with mps approximately 1 µg l and treated with the bo3 process different flowrates 0 25 4 l h and specific ozone doses 0 2 0 6 g o3 g toc were tested and mps ecotoxicity and bromate were analyzed for ecotoxicity assessment three in vivo daphnia algae and bacteria and six in vitro calux assays era gr pah p53 pr andnrf2 calux were used results show that the combination of bac filtration and ozonation has higher mp removal and higher ecotoxicity removal than only bac filtration and only ozonation the in vivo assays show a low ecotoxicity in the initial wwtp effluent samples and no clear trend with increasing ozone doses while most of the in vitro assays show a decrease in ecotoxicity with increasing ozone dose this suggests that for the tested bioassays feed water and ozone doses the overall ecotoxicity of the formed transformation products during ozonation was lower than the overall ecotoxicity of the parent compounds in the experiments with bromide spiking relevant formation of bromate was observed above specific ozone doses of approximately 0 4 o3 g toc and more bromate was formed for the samples with bac pre treatment this indirectly indicates the effectivity of the pre treatment in removing organic matter and making ozone more available to react with other compounds such as mps but also bromide but also underlines the importance of controlling the ozone dose to be below the threshold to avoid formation of bromate it was concluded that treatment of the tested wwtp effluent in the bo3 process at a specific ozone dose of 0 2 g o3 g toc results in high mp removal at limited energy input while no increase in ecotoxicity nor formation of bromate was observed under this condition this indicates that the hybrid bo3 process can be implemented to remove mps and improve the ecological quality of this wwtp effluent with a lower energy demand than conventional mp removal processes such as standalone ozonation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micropollutants biological activated carbon ozone bromate bioassay ecotoxicity 1 introduction in the last decades micropollutants mps such as pharmaceuticals pesticides and industrial chemicals have been detected in water matrixes all over the world balakrishna et al 2017 madikizela et al 2017 schröder et al 2016 sodré et al 2018 the ecotoxicological risks of mps were indicated clearly in several specific cases haberkamp et al 2007 oaks et al 2004 sanganyado et al 2020 but are hard to measure and predict in most cases due to prevalence of mps at trace concentrations ng µg l and in complex mixtures bizarro et al 2016 neale et al 2015 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are major sources from where mps enter the environment aemig et al 2021 therefore the limited removal of mps in conventional wwtps has been addressed as a growing concern schröder et al 2016 which underlines the importance of upgrading wwtps to increase their mp removal a treatment technology that has shown its potential to improve the mp removal capacity of wwtps is ozonation bourgin et al 2018 joss et al 2008 during ozonation the mps are oxidized directly by ozone molecules or indirectly by radicals e g oh that are formed during the degradation of ozone von gunten 2003a ozone treatment is widely used for drinking water treatment but the use of ozonation in wastewater treatment is still limited to a few countries camel and bermond 1998 kharel et al 2020 zimmermann et al 2011 as mp removal during wastewater treatment is being considered further application of ozonation in wwtps has two major challenges further application of ozonation in wwtps has two major challenges i producing ozone is energy and cost intensive and the presence of background dissolved organic matter dom in the wwtp effluent matrix greatly increases by a factor 100 or more compared to without dom the required amount of ozone to achieve significant mp removal van gijn et al 2021b von gunten 2019 and ii during ozonation most mps and background compounds are transformed and not mineralized leaving ozone transformation products otps and ozone by products obps in the water after the ozone treatment the large number of mps and organic background compounds results in an even larger number of organic otps and obps which could be as toxic or even more toxic than the parent compounds chen et al 2012 magdeburg et al 2014 pohl et al 2021 but are difficult to detect and quantify schollée et al 2018 moreover ecotoxicological information of otps and obps is hardly available the main reason for the high energy demand and costs of ozone treatment is that dom interferes with the ozonation of mps in wwtp effluents total organic matter om and dom are typically present at similar concentrations of approximately 5 20 mg toc or doc l van gijn et al 2022 which is a 103 106 times higher concentration than the concentrations of mps therefore the bulk of ozone added to the water reacts with dom and not with the target mps so the required ozone dose of a water sample is normally based on the quantity of organic matter in the water matrix nilsson et al 2017 von gunten 2019 reducing the amount of dom in the water before ozonation results in a lower ozone demand and in lower energy and cost input de wilt et al 2018 showed the potential of using biological pre treatment before ozonation but after the conventional wastewater treatment process to achieve this van gijn et al 2021a found that a biological activated carbon bac filter is the most suitable type of bioreactor to remove om from wwtp effluent even after operation of 38 000 bed volumes in drinking water treatment and 6000 bed volumes in wwtp effluent treatment the flowrate in the bioreactor controls the om removal the performance of a combination of bac filtration with ozone treatment the bo3 process to remove mps from wwtp effluent with realistic mp concentrations has not yet been tested the ecotoxicity of otps and obps is difficult to assess and different studies show differing results because of several reasons the type of mps and other background compounds their concentrations used sample pre treatments used ozone doses and used ecotoxicity assays all vary between studies because of this some studies find an increased ecotoxicity after ozonation magdeburg et al 2014 stalter et al 2010 whereas others find a decrease ma et al 2019 pohl et al 2019 völker et al 2019 it remains difficult to pinpoint which of the mentioned reasons is or are the cause of the observed differences in studies that found an increase in ecotoxicity after ozonation the increase in toxicity is often nullified with a biological post treatment e g sand filtration or activated carbon filtration after ozonation bourgin et al 2018 buchner et al 2019 magdeburg et al 2014 even though most toxic organic otps and obps can be removed in this way a number of otps and obps still remain in the water after post treatment gulde et al 2021 the example of bac filtration as post treatment after ozonation can improve the removal of om which is especially beneficial for potable water reuse and of more bio recalcitrant otps and obps which is beneficial for general water quality gifford et al 2018 peterson and summers 2021 such a post treatment is an extra treatment step which increases energy use costs and complexity of the total treatment process and should only be implemented when it has clear benefits because of the number of variables that affect the formation of potentially toxic otps and obps during ozonation it is challenging to decide whether the effluent is too toxic and implementation post treatment after ozonation is required bioassays or toxicity tests can be used to get information about the total toxicity of a complex mixture with unknown compounds by exposing an organism in vivo or a cell in vitro to a sample the response can give information about adverse effects of the samples on the organisms or cells a broad range of bioassays is available ranging from mammals to cells designed with specific receptors ideally all relevant species should be tested to know whether a sample is toxic but normally a selection of the most relevant assays is made due to cost constrains it can be challenging to make the link between results of a bioassay and environmentally relevant toxicity therefore the bioassay response can be expressed in equivalent of a toxic compounds and the relevance can be shown by comparing the toxic equivalents to effect based trigger values ebts escher et al 2018 phan et al 2021 in this way the environmentally relevant ecotoxicity of the wwtp effluent can be evaluated before and after ozonation next to organic otps and obps also inorganic obps can be relevant during ozonation the most challenging inorganic ozone obp is bromate which is formed from bromide bromate poses carcinogenic risks for humans at low concentrations low µg l range and is difficult to remove after it has been formed bourgin et al 2018 butler et al 2005 smit 2021 the presence of bromide in wastewater originates from various industrial emissions seaborne aerosol depositions seawater intrusion into the sewer and background concentrations in tap water relevant concentrations range from zero to one mg l falås et al 2022 von gunten 2003b when no bromide is present there is no risk of bromate formation if bromide is present the used ozone dose determines the amount of bromate that is formed yang et al 2019 the aim of this study was to evaluate the bo3 process for the removal of mps from wwtp effluent the main focus was on the formation and ecotoxicity of organic and inorganic bromate otps and obps and how this affects the potential for full scale implementation of the bo3 process to test this samples from a wwtp effluent were spiked with mps treated with the bac filter and ozonated at different doses after which mp removal ecotoxicity and bromate formation was assessed the results are used to assess the mp removal of the bo3 process to determine if post treatment is necessary and to gain insight in the conditions for which bromate formation occurs 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup during the experiments the feed water wwtp effluent was fed through a pre aerator where the water was aerated with pure oxygen before entering the bioreactors fig 1 the activated carbon in the bac filter 1 2 l filtrasorb tl830 granular activated carbon was used for 38 000 bed volumes in a full scale drinking water treatment plant before use in this study at the start the filter was inoculated with a mix of four different sludges as described in van gijn et al 2021a by the start of the flow rate experiments it had been used for an additional 15 000 bed volumes treating wwtp effluent in the lab scale setup ozone was generated from pure oxygen using an ozone generator com ad 02 anseros and the ozone input quantity was controlled and monitored using a mass flow controller brooks 5850 series and an ozone meter bmt 964 the ozone meter was connected to the off gas sporadically to confirm the absence of ozone in the off gas for ozonation without biological pre treatment the feed tank was connected directly to the ozone reactor 2 2 experimental design the bac filter and the ozone reactor were operated at three flowrates of 0 37 0 91 and 3 62 l h equal to empty bed contact times ebcts of 3 21 1 32 and 0 33 h in the bac filter and hydraulic retention times of 1 34 0 55 and 0 14 h in the ozone reactor after setting each flowrate a two week stabilization period was applied where only organic matter om removal was monitored in the biofilters followed by a one week period where the effluent of the biofilters was ozonated and also mp concentrations were measured after the experiments at different flowrates one flowrate was selected and applied in the following two tests with the bac filter and the ozone reactor in the first test the feed was spiked with bromide approximately 0 4 mg l and formation of bromate was monitored at different specific ozone doses from 0 1 0 7 g o3 g toc in the second test the toxicity of the formed otps and obps was monitored using nine bioassays at specific ozone doses of approximately 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 g o3 g toc additionally only ozonated samples without pre treatment collected using the same ozone reactor and the same feed were included in all experiments as reference 2 3 feed water effluent from the municipal wwtp in bennekom the netherlands was collected in dry weather conditions and used as feed for the reactors bennekom wwtp is equipped with a conventional biological nutrient removal system the effluent contained 8 4 1 3 mg l of toc and ammonia was typically below 2 mg n l on the sampled days under dry weather conditions for the stabilization periods the wwtp effluent was stored in a 3 m3 tank that was cooled to 7 c and from there fed to the reactors for the measurement periods wwtp effluent was collected in a 300 l container and spiked with a mix of 19 mps to final concentrations of approximately 1 µg l for each mp before spiking the solvent of the mp mix acetonitrile was evaporated to avoid the presence of solvent in the feed the mp mix contained a mix of pharmaceuticals pesticides and industrial compounds 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d 4 and 5 methyl benzotriazole 2 6 dichlorobenzamide bam benzotriazole caffeine carbamazepine clarithromycin n n diethyl meta toluamide deet desphenyl chloridazon diclofenac dimetridazole erythromycin furosemide irbesartan mecoprop metoprolol propranolol sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim these mps were selected based on their occurrence in wwtp effluent and to ensure the inclusion of mps with different biodegradability s and ozone reactivities in the experiment van gijn et al 2021a the spiked feed was fed to the reactors from the 300 l container fig 1 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 organic matter and micropollutants uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 total organic carbon toc chemical oxygen demand and fluorescence were measured to monitor om removal in the

measured at emission ranges 280 550 nm and excitation ranges 220 480 nm using a perkin elmer luminescence spectrometer ls50b mps were detected with an liquid chromatography system equipped with a tandem mass spectrometer both from sciex and quantified against a calibration curve ranging from 50 1000 ng l r2 values are presented in table s2 in the appendix loq was 50 ng l for all mps details of the om and mp measurements are described in van gijn et al 2022 2 4 2 ions and nutrients bromide nitrite nitrate and phosphate were measured using a dionex ics 6000 dual pump ion chromatography system

detailed protocol the calux assays performed by bds were era for estrogens gr for glucocorticoids pah for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons p53 for genotoxicity pr for progesterone and nrf2 for oxidative stress calux sample were extracted before analysis using oasis hlb columns and analyzed according to phan et al 2021 and alygizakis et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 micropollutant and organic matter removal the experiments at three different flowrates showed that mp removal increases with decreasing flowrate in the bac filter fig 2 the removal stabilized at flowrates lower than 0 91 l h ebct of 1 32 h the slightly lower mp removal at the lowest flow rate of 0 37 l h could be related to limiting substrate or nutrient conditions but this could not be confirmed the observed relationship between mp removal and flowrate matches with the results for om removal in this study table s7 and with our previous study into om removal in the same reactors van gijn et al 2021a based on these results the bac reactor and a flowrate of approximately 1 l h equal to an ebct of approximately 1 h were selected as the optimal conditions to use in our further experiments to monitor the toxicity of formed otp and obps when bac filtration is combined with ozonation a broader range of mps can be removed compared to the removal with only bac filtration or only ozonation fig 2 and fig 3 the removal potential is shown at the lowest ozone dose of 0 18 g o3 g toc with an average mp removal of 95 7 similar removal in the stand alone ozone process is only reached at a specific ozone dose of approximately 0 59 g o3 g toc 69 lower ozone dose for bo3 additionally the bac reactor removes om thus reducing the absolute amount of ozone input even further using 30 toc removal in the bac filter based on measurements in this study table s7 and our previous study van gijn et al 2021a and combining this with the 69 lower relative ozone dose this results in an absolute ozone dose in g o3 l which is approximately 78 lower in the bo3 process compared to stand alone ozonation the lower absolute amount of ozone required shows the benefit of the bo3 process for saving energy and therefore limiting co2 emissions and costs a direct comparison of only the ozone treatment in the bo3 process to stand alone ozonation because several of the mps were already at or close to detection limits after bac treatment these results confirm the findings of previous studies that underline the synergies between biological treatment and ozonation for the removal of mps from wwtp effluent de wilt et al 2018 van gijn et al 2021a nevertheless the high mp removals do not guarantee the ecotoxicological safety of the treated effluent 3 2 ecotoxicity of parent compounds the tier 1 risk quotients rqs of the mps in the samples peterson 2006 were calculated by dividing the measured mp concentration by the lowest predicted no effect concentrations pnec for freshwater obtained from the norman database table s1 to gain insight in the potential toxic risk of the parent compounds in the samples rqs are used in low tier risk assessment which means that they are a conservative indicator of whether a toxic effect can be expected if the rq is lower than 1 0 no risk is expected while a rq higher than 1 0 shows that an adverse effect could occur and further ecotoxicological assessment is required a worst case scenario was used where the receiving surface water consists for 100 of wwtp effluent this is a relevant scenario for many small wwtp in summer conditions in the netherlands several rqs were higher than 1 0 in the feed and even though all rqs decreased with all treatments some rqs were still higher than 1 0 after only bac or only ozone treatment table 1 this means that the parent compounds in the feed bac and ozone samples could cause an ecotoxicological concern after treatment with the bo3 process rqs were lower than 1 0 for all mps at all ozone doses which means that in these samples no adverse effects are expected for the measured parent compounds 3 3 ecotoxicity of organic transformation products the ecotoxicity of wwtp effluent toc of 12 9 mg l treated with a combination of bac filtration which decreased toc to 9 4 mg l and ozonation bo3 and with only ozonation o3 was tested using three in vivo bioassays and six in vitro calux assays results from the daphnia immobilization assay show no significant ecotoxicity in any of the samples fig 4 this means that the formed otps and obps at the tested ozone doses were not toxic to daphnia another study found formation of formaldehydes during ozonation of wwtp effluent at a concentration that is toxic to daphnia park et al 2016 while two other studies found a stable or decreasing ecotoxicity for daphnia with increasing ozone dose cao et al 2009 magdeburg et al 2012 this while cao et al 2009 used a higher ozone dose than park et al 2016 and magdeburg et al 2012 used longer exposure times than park et al 2016 these differing results from literature underline the complexity and case to case dependency of ecotoxicity of otps and obps in wwtp effluent dopp et al 2021 growth inhibition of algae did not show a clear relation with applied specific ozone dose fig 5 higher ecotoxicity 31 was observed at the highest ozone dose without bac pre treatment o3 this could mean that otps and obps toxic to algae are only formed at higher specific ozone doses higher than 0 4 g o3 g toc on the other hand in the 2x 4x and 8x diluted samples in the agia assay no increased ecotoxicity was observed figure s1 which makes the results of this datapoint weak fig 5 shows that ozone treatment preceded by bac filtration bo3 does not result in the formation of otps and obps that are toxic to algae other studies also found stable or decreasing ecotoxicity to algae after ozone treatment escher et al 2009 itzel et al 2017 margot et al 2013 inhibition of luminescent bacteria was stable with an increasing ozone dose both with and without bac pre treatment fig 6 this means that ozonation did not reduce the limited ecotoxicity that was present in the wwtp effluent but the otps and obps formed during treatment also were not more toxic to the bacteria than the parent compounds samples with bac pre treatment had slightly lower ecotoxicity although this trend was less clear for the dilutions figure s2 other studies find both increasing li et al 2019 and decreasing escher et al 2009 reungoat et al 2012 ecotoxicity to luminescent bacteria after ozonation the reason for these differing results could be that the experiment of li et al 2019 was not performed under realistic conditions but used high starting concentration of deet 200 mg l and high ozone doses up to several g o3 l the era for estrogens gr for glucocorticoids pah for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons p53 for genotoxicity pr for progesterone and nrf2 for oxidative stress calux assays were selected because of their relevance for surface water quality illustrated by the fact they are included in the dutch suggestions for biological effect monitoring stowa 2020 van der oost et al 2017 additionally the nrf2 assay was included to detect oxidative stress because of its relevance for ozonated samples these in vitro calux assays showed a decrease in ecotoxicity fig 7a d or stable ecotoxicity fig 7e and f with increasing ozone doses this suggests that the formed otps and obps had a lower or equal toxic potential compared to the parent compounds nevertheless the pre treatment method used for the calux assays spe was not tested for the recovery of otps and obps which makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions for all assays where ecotoxicity was observed the ecotoxicity in the samples with bac pre treatment bo3 showed lower ecotoxicity than the samples without o3 fig 7 this means that the bac treatment contributed to the removal of compounds that cause adverse effects for the tested endpoints for most assays of which ebts are available in literature equivalent concentrations in all samples were below the ebts table s10 only for the glucocorticoids assay fig 7c the measured hormonal ecotoxicity in the wwtp effluent was above the ebt of 100 ng dexamethasone eq l and was reduced to below the ebt after treatment overall this suggests that observed in vitro ecotoxicity for the tested assays was decreased to environmentally safe levels after treatment with the bo3 process the overall decrease of toxicity observed in the calux assays during ozonation fig 7 matches with other findings in literature phan et al 2021 also found a decrease in estrogenic and pah ecotoxicity fig 7a and c and fluctuating oxidative stress fig 7f with ozonation occurrence of genotoxicity using different genotoxicity assays varies strongly in different studies de baat et al 2020 dopp et al 2021 which can explain the complete absence of genotoxic in the samples measured in this study 3 4 formation of bromate bromate formation was tested in a separate experiment where bromide was spiked to the feed tank which had a toc concentration of 9 9 mg l bromide concentrations after spiking were 0 32 0 04 mg l for the samples with bac pre treatment bo3 and 0 47 0 01 mg l for the samples without bac pre treatment o3 toc and other om characteristics decreased by 30 45 during bac treatment table s11 bromate concentrations in the bo3 samples exceeded the dutch regulatory limit of 1 µg l in drinking water and surface water at a specific nitrite corrected ozone dose of 0 44 g o3 g toc and 0 49 g o3 g toc for the bo3 and o3 samples respectively fig 8 this bromate concentration represents the concentration in a wwtp effluent so before being relevant for surface water there would be dilution of the concentration nevertheless the observed bromate formation does illustrate the risk of bromate formation in bromide containing effluents fig 8 shows that at the lowest specific ozone doses 0 4 g o3 g toc bromate formation remained below the lowest regulatory limits 1 µg l and mostly even below the detection limit 0 2 µg l if the ozone dose is very low lower than the instantaneous ozone demand or initial ozonation demand defined as the decrease of ozone concentration in the first 30 s after dosing all ozone is consumed by other reactions and bromate formation does not occur buffle et al 2006 wert et al 2007 this means that as long as the ozone dose can be kept below the initial ozone demand the risk for bromate formation can be limited bromate formation is also influenced by the initial bromide concentration at higher ozone doses a higher bromide concentration starting from 50 µg l results in more formation of bromate von gunten 2003b on the other hand especially at lower ozone doses a higher initial bromide concentration can result in lower bromate formation the reason for this is that at a higher bromide concentration more ozone is consumed in the initial reaction from br to hobr obr increasing the initial ozone demand after which insufficient ozone remains to continue the reaction from hobr obr to bromate von gunten and oliveras 1998 yang et al 2019 this means that hobr obr will be remain in the water which poses less environmental risks than bromate von gunten 2003b bromate formation at similar specific ozone doses is higher in the bo3 samples than in the o3 samples in this study fig 8 and also higher than in other studies that monitored bromate formation during ozone treatment bourgin et al 2018 garcia villanova et al 2010 this high bromate formation in the bo3 samples underlines the importance of monitoring and limiting bromate formation by controlling the applied ozone dose additionally it indicates that the availability of ozone or ozone exposure at similar specific ozone doses is higher in the bo3 samples than in the o3 samples this means that om with higher ozone reactivity is removed to a higher extent than om with average ozone reactivity in the bac filter therefore toc should not be used to determine the required amount of ozone for the bo3 process because this can result in overdosing of ozone and in formation of bromate instead other parameters than toc that quantify the ozone reactive part of the om should be used ozone doses standardized to absorbance at 254 nm and to fluorescence regions i and ii relating to protein like om chen et al 2003 showed a better potential to predict bromate formation when comparing the samples with and without bac pre treatment fig 9 other studies also found that fluorescence indicators e g humic and vulvic acids are valuable tools to predict bromate formation wu et al 2018 the last factor that could affect bromate formation in the samples is the ammonium concentration 1 5 mg n l in the o3 samples and 0 in the bo3 samples although the potential of ammonium to reduce bromate formation is hard to judge in these samples due to the low bromate formation in the o3 samples 3 5 considerations for implementation 3 5 1 pre treatment before ozonation the bo3 process achieves higher mp removal and ecotoxicity reduction in wwtp effluent than conventional standalone ozonation at the same specific ozone doses expressed as g o3 g toc figs 2 9 figure s3 4 moreover the om removal in the bac filter results in a lower energy requirement for ozonation with bac pre treatment absolute ozone dose as was discussed thoroughly in our previous paper van gijn et al 2021a mp removal in the bac filter remained high compared to other studies at the time of the bromate experiments by which the activated carbon had been used for approximately 25 000 bed volumes with wwtp effluent on top of the 38 000 bed volumes in drinking water treatment benstoem et al 2017 fundneider et al 2021 the reason for the high mp removal in this bac filter could be related to the combination of the relatively high ebct 1 h and the high availability of oxygen due to pre aeration with pure oxygen applied in this study as was also shown in our previous study van gijn et al 2021a it was assumed that spiking of the mps did not affect the removal performance of the bac filter because overall mps and om were always present at similar concentrations in the real wwtp effluent based on results from the bromate formation experiment it is advised to apply low specific ozone doses approximately 0 2 g o3 g toc for treatment of bromide containing waters to avoid the formation of bromate at this low ozone dose the high removal potential and low energy requirements make implementation of the bo3 treatment for mp removal from wwtp effluents more feasible and more effective than the conventional standalone ozone treatment in this study a baco3 was compared to a standalone o3 for the removal of mps from wwtp effluent the question rises how the baco3 would compare to an o3 bac which was already tested for a number of different applications chuang et al 2019 gerrity et al 2011 vatankhah et al 2022 wang et al 2019 reungoat et al 2012 showed high 90 removal of a broad range of mps during full scale o3 bac treatment in three wwtps while using higher ozone doses 0 2 0 8 g o3 g doc and lower ebcts for the bac 9 45 min results of such studies are challenging to compare to the results in the current study due to differences in mps measured background om concentrations and applied ozone doses and ebcts in general the emphasis of an baco3 is on energy and costs savings while the emphasis of an o3 bac is on the further removal of background om obps and otps chuang et al 2019 reungoat et al 2012 further removal of background om is mainly relevant for potable reuse cases gerrity et al 2014 while the relevance of further removal of obps and otps is more complex to determine 3 5 2 post treatment after ozonation based on the results from this study ecotoxicity in the tested wwtp effluent decreased to environmentally safe levels after treatment with the bo3 process this suggests that the formed otps and obps during treatment had similar or lower toxic potential than the parent compounds present before treatment nevertheless a number of studies recommend the implementation of a post treatment for example a biological sand filtration or a bac filter after ozonation because of the concern regarding the formation of toxic otps and obps bourgin et al 2018 sauter et al 2021 there are studies that find adverse effects on fish development of ozonated wwtp effluents stalter et al 2010 and even a decrease and increase in adverse effects on a single endpoint genotoxicity depending on the specific assay umuc or ames that was used magdeburg et al 2014 it should be noted that the latter two studies used relatively high ozone doses and different feed waters 0 4 1 0 and 0 7 g o3 g toc respectively which also illustrates the challenges when comparing ecotoxicological results from different studies other broader review studies show that in the majority of the cases ozonation of wwtp effluents reduces ecotoxicity dopp et al 2021 itzel et al 2020 völker et al 2019 because of the broad range of mps spiked and the broad range of bioassays tested in this study we argue that formation of toxic otps and obps are not a risk for a bo3 treatment applied at most municipal wwtps and post treatment is not in all cases required nevertheless factors such as bromide concentrations in the feed water and applied ozone doses play a big role finally energy consumption and carbon footprint are also becoming more relevant factors to consider for the implementation of tertiary mp removal treatment adding an additional post treatment after ozonation increases the energy demand and should only be used in cases where it is beneficial for application at full scale especially in cases where more industrial water is treated in the wwtp it is recommended to test the formation of toxic otps and obps with a pilot scale plant first the current study can be used as a starting point for such a study after which it can be decided whether bo3 treatment is sufficient or an additional biological post treatment bo3b is required de wilt et al 2018 4 conclusion high micropollutant removal was observed during treatment of wwtp effluent with biological activated carbon filtration and ozonation the bo3 process an average micropollutant removal of 95 7 was measured at an empty bed contact time in the bac filter of approximately 1 h and a specific ozone dose of approximately 0 2 g o3 g toc to achieve similar mp removal with stand alone ozonation a four times higher absolute ozone dose is required which underlines the potential of the bo3 process to achieve high micropollutant removal at low energy input ecotoxicity measured with three in vivo assays and six in vitro assays was stable or reduced after ozonation these results suggests that the ecotoxicity of the formed transformation products during ozonation was overall lower than the ecotoxicity of the parent compounds based on the tested bioassays and for the tested conditions a biological post treatment to remove the formed ozone transformation products after the bo3 process was not required we argue that the need for a biological post treatment after ozonation should be determined on a case to case basis in the experiments where bromide was spiked to the feed bromate formation was below the dutch regulatory limit 1 µg l at specific ozone doses lower than 0 4 g o3 g toc additionally at specific ozone doses above 0 4 g o3 g toc bromate formation in the bo3 process was higher than in the reference samples with only ozonation and without bac pre treatment this high bromate formation indicates the high availability of ozone after bac treatment while it also underlines the importance of monitoring bromide and organic matter concentrations in the feed of the ozone reactor to avoid overdosing of ozone which could result in the formation of bromate for the samples measured in this study absorbance at 254 nm and fluorescence peaks related to protein like compounds was a more reliable inline measurement used to standardize ozone doses compared to the conventional toc measurement declaration of competing

14615,ozonation is a viable option to improve the removal of micropollutants mps in wastewater treatment plants wwtps nevertheless the application of ozonation is hindered by its high energy requirements and by the uncertainties regarding the formation of toxic transformation products in the process energy requirements of ozonation can be reduced with a pre ozone treatment such as a biological activated carbon bac filter that removes part of the effluent organic matter before ozonation this study investigated a combination of bac filtration followed by ozonation the bo3 process to remove mps at low ozone doses and low energy input and focused on the formation of toxic organic and inorganic products during ozonation effluent from a wwtp was collected spiked with mps approximately 1 µg l and treated with the bo3 process different flowrates 0 25 4 l h and specific ozone doses 0 2 0 6 g o3 g toc were tested and mps ecotoxicity and bromate were analyzed for ecotoxicity assessment three in vivo daphnia algae and bacteria and six in vitro calux assays era gr pah p53 pr andnrf2 calux were used results show that the combination of bac filtration and ozonation has higher mp removal and higher ecotoxicity removal than only bac filtration and only ozonation the in vivo assays show a low ecotoxicity in the initial wwtp effluent samples and no clear trend with increasing ozone doses while most of the in vitro assays show a decrease in ecotoxicity with increasing ozone dose this suggests that for the tested bioassays feed water and ozone doses the overall ecotoxicity of the formed transformation products during ozonation was lower than the overall ecotoxicity of the parent compounds in the experiments with bromide spiking relevant formation of bromate was observed above specific ozone doses of approximately 0 4 o3 g toc and more bromate was formed for the samples with bac pre treatment this indirectly indicates the effectivity of the pre treatment in removing organic matter and making ozone more available to react with other compounds such as mps but also bromide but also underlines the importance of controlling the ozone dose to be below the threshold to avoid formation of bromate it was concluded that treatment of the tested wwtp effluent in the bo3 process at a specific ozone dose of 0 2 g o3 g toc results in high mp removal at limited energy input while no increase in ecotoxicity nor formation of bromate was observed under this condition this indicates that the hybrid bo3 process can be implemented to remove mps and improve the ecological quality of this wwtp effluent with a lower energy demand than conventional mp removal processes such as standalone ozonation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micropollutants biological activated carbon ozone bromate bioassay ecotoxicity 1 introduction in the last decades micropollutants mps such as pharmaceuticals pesticides and industrial chemicals have been detected in water matrixes all over the world balakrishna et al 2017 madikizela et al 2017 schröder et al 2016 sodré et al 2018 the ecotoxicological risks of mps were indicated clearly in several specific cases haberkamp et al 2007 oaks et al 2004 sanganyado et al 2020 but are hard to measure and predict in most cases due to prevalence of mps at trace concentrations ng µg l and in complex mixtures bizarro et al 2016 neale et al 2015 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are major sources from where mps enter the environment aemig et al 2021 therefore the limited removal of mps in conventional wwtps has been addressed as a growing concern schröder et al 2016 which underlines the importance of upgrading wwtps to increase their mp removal a treatment technology that has shown its potential to improve the mp removal capacity of wwtps is ozonation bourgin et al 2018 joss et al 2008 during ozonation the mps are oxidized directly by ozone molecules or indirectly by radicals e g oh that are formed during the degradation of ozone von gunten 2003a ozone treatment is widely used for drinking water treatment but the use of ozonation in wastewater treatment is still limited to a few countries camel and bermond 1998 kharel et al 2020 zimmermann et al 2011 as mp removal during wastewater treatment is being considered further application of ozonation in wwtps has two major challenges further application of ozonation in wwtps has two major challenges i producing ozone is energy and cost intensive and the presence of background dissolved organic matter dom in the wwtp effluent matrix greatly increases by a factor 100 or more compared to without dom the required amount of ozone to achieve significant mp removal van gijn et al 2021b von gunten 2019 and ii during ozonation most mps and background compounds are transformed and not mineralized leaving ozone transformation products otps and ozone by products obps in the water after the ozone treatment the large number of mps and organic background compounds results in an even larger number of organic otps and obps which could be as toxic or even more toxic than the parent compounds chen et al 2012 magdeburg et al 2014 pohl et al 2021 but are difficult to detect and quantify schollée et al 2018 moreover ecotoxicological information of otps and obps is hardly available the main reason for the high energy demand and costs of ozone treatment is that dom interferes with the ozonation of mps in wwtp effluents total organic matter om and dom are typically present at similar concentrations of approximately 5 20 mg toc or doc l van gijn et al 2022 which is a 103 106 times higher concentration than the concentrations of mps therefore the bulk of ozone added to the water reacts with dom and not with the target mps so the required ozone dose of a water sample is normally based on the quantity of organic matter in the water matrix nilsson et al 2017 von gunten 2019 reducing the amount of dom in the water before ozonation results in a lower ozone demand and in lower energy and cost input de wilt et al 2018 showed the potential of using biological pre treatment before ozonation but after the conventional wastewater treatment process to achieve this van gijn et al 2021a found that a biological activated carbon bac filter is the most suitable type of bioreactor to remove om from wwtp effluent even after operation of 38 000 bed volumes in drinking water treatment and 6000 bed volumes in wwtp effluent treatment the flowrate in the bioreactor controls the om removal the performance of a combination of bac filtration with ozone treatment the bo3 process to remove mps from wwtp effluent with realistic mp concentrations has not yet been tested the ecotoxicity of otps and obps is difficult to assess and different studies show differing results because of several reasons the type of mps and other background compounds their concentrations used sample pre treatments used ozone doses and used ecotoxicity assays all vary between studies because of this some studies find an increased ecotoxicity after ozonation magdeburg et al 2014 stalter et al 2010 whereas others find a decrease ma et al 2019 pohl et al 2019 völker et al 2019 it remains difficult to pinpoint which of the mentioned reasons is or are the cause of the observed differences in studies that found an increase in ecotoxicity after ozonation the increase in toxicity is often nullified with a biological post treatment e g sand filtration or activated carbon filtration after ozonation bourgin et al 2018 buchner et al 2019 magdeburg et al 2014 even though most toxic organic otps and obps can be removed in this way a number of otps and obps still remain in the water after post treatment gulde et al 2021 the example of bac filtration as post treatment after ozonation can improve the removal of om which is especially beneficial for potable water reuse and of more bio recalcitrant otps and obps which is beneficial for general water quality gifford et al 2018 peterson and summers 2021 such a post treatment is an extra treatment step which increases energy use costs and complexity of the total treatment process and should only be implemented when it has clear benefits because of the number of variables that affect the formation of potentially toxic otps and obps during ozonation it is challenging to decide whether the effluent is too toxic and implementation post treatment after ozonation is required bioassays or toxicity tests can be used to get information about the total toxicity of a complex mixture with unknown compounds by exposing an organism in vivo or a cell in vitro to a sample the response can give information about adverse effects of the samples on the organisms or cells a broad range of bioassays is available ranging from mammals to cells designed with specific receptors ideally all relevant species should be tested to know whether a sample is toxic but normally a selection of the most relevant assays is made due to cost constrains it can be challenging to make the link between results of a bioassay and environmentally relevant toxicity therefore the bioassay response can be expressed in equivalent of a toxic compounds and the relevance can be shown by comparing the toxic equivalents to effect based trigger values ebts escher et al 2018 phan et al 2021 in this way the environmentally relevant ecotoxicity of the wwtp effluent can be evaluated before and after ozonation next to organic otps and obps also inorganic obps can be relevant during ozonation the most challenging inorganic ozone obp is bromate which is formed from bromide bromate poses carcinogenic risks for humans at low concentrations low µg l range and is difficult to remove after it has been formed bourgin et al 2018 butler et al 2005 smit 2021 the presence of bromide in wastewater originates from various industrial emissions seaborne aerosol depositions seawater intrusion into the sewer and background concentrations in tap water relevant concentrations range from zero to one mg l falås et al 2022 von gunten 2003b when no bromide is present there is no risk of bromate formation if bromide is present the used ozone dose determines the amount of bromate that is formed yang et al 2019 the aim of this study was to evaluate the bo3 process for the removal of mps from wwtp effluent the main focus was on the formation and ecotoxicity of organic and inorganic bromate otps and obps and how this affects the potential for full scale implementation of the bo3 process to test this samples from a wwtp effluent were spiked with mps treated with the bac filter and ozonated at different doses after which mp removal ecotoxicity and bromate formation was assessed the results are used to assess the mp removal of the bo3 process to determine if post treatment is necessary and to gain insight in the conditions for which bromate formation occurs 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup during the experiments the feed water wwtp effluent was fed through a pre aerator where the water was aerated with pure oxygen before entering the bioreactors fig 1 the activated carbon in the bac filter 1 2 l filtrasorb tl830 granular activated carbon was used for 38 000 bed volumes in a full scale drinking water treatment plant before use in this study at the start the filter was inoculated with a mix of four different sludges as described in van gijn et al 2021a by the start of the flow rate experiments it had been used for an additional 15 000 bed volumes treating wwtp effluent in the lab scale setup ozone was generated from pure oxygen using an ozone generator com ad 02 anseros and the ozone input quantity was controlled and monitored using a mass flow controller brooks 5850 series and an ozone meter bmt 964 the ozone meter was connected to the off gas sporadically to confirm the absence of ozone in the off gas for ozonation without biological pre treatment the feed tank was connected directly to the ozone reactor 2 2 experimental design the bac filter and the ozone reactor were operated at three flowrates of 0 37 0 91 and 3 62 l h equal to empty bed contact times ebcts of 3 21 1 32 and 0 33 h in the bac filter and hydraulic retention times of 1 34 0 55 and 0 14 h in the ozone reactor after setting each flowrate a two week stabilization period was applied where only organic matter om removal was monitored in the biofilters followed by a one week period where the effluent of the biofilters was ozonated and also mp concentrations were measured after the experiments at different flowrates one flowrate was selected and applied in the following two tests with the bac filter and the ozone reactor in the first test the feed was spiked with bromide approximately 0 4 mg l and formation of bromate was monitored at different specific ozone doses from 0 1 0 7 g o3 g toc in the second test the toxicity of the formed otps and obps was monitored using nine bioassays at specific ozone doses of approximately 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 g o3 g toc additionally only ozonated samples without pre treatment collected using the same ozone reactor and the same feed were included in all experiments as reference 2 3 feed water effluent from the municipal wwtp in bennekom the netherlands was collected in dry weather conditions and used as feed for the reactors bennekom wwtp is equipped with a conventional biological nutrient removal system the effluent contained 8 4 1 3 mg l of toc and ammonia was typically below 2 mg n l on the sampled days under dry weather conditions for the stabilization periods the wwtp effluent was stored in a 3 m3 tank that was cooled to 7 c and from there fed to the reactors for the measurement periods wwtp effluent was collected in a 300 l container and spiked with a mix of 19 mps to final concentrations of approximately 1 µg l for each mp before spiking the solvent of the mp mix acetonitrile was evaporated to avoid the presence of solvent in the feed the mp mix contained a mix of pharmaceuticals pesticides and industrial compounds 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d 4 and 5 methyl benzotriazole 2 6 dichlorobenzamide bam benzotriazole caffeine carbamazepine clarithromycin n n diethyl meta toluamide deet desphenyl chloridazon diclofenac dimetridazole erythromycin furosemide irbesartan mecoprop metoprolol propranolol sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim these mps were selected based on their occurrence in wwtp effluent and to ensure the inclusion of mps with different biodegradability s and ozone reactivities in the experiment van gijn et al 2021a the spiked feed was fed to the reactors from the 300 l container fig 1 2 4

oxidative stress calux sample were extracted before analysis using oasis hlb columns and analyzed according to phan et al 2021 and alygizakis et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 micropollutant and organic matter removal the experiments at three different flowrates showed that mp removal increases with decreasing flowrate in the bac filter fig 2 the removal stabilized at flowrates lower than 0 91 l h ebct of 1 32 h the slightly lower mp removal at the lowest flow rate of 0 37 l h could be related to limiting substrate or nutrient conditions but this could not be confirmed the observed relationship between mp removal and flowrate matches with the results for om removal in this study table s7 and with our previous study into om removal in the same reactors van gijn et al 2021a based on these results the bac reactor and a flowrate of approximately 1 l h equal to an ebct of approximately 1 h were selected as the optimal conditions to use in our further experiments to monitor the toxicity of formed otp and obps when bac filtration is combined with ozonation a broader range of mps can be removed compared to the removal with only bac filtration or only ozonation fig 2 and fig 3 the removal potential is shown at the lowest ozone dose of 0 18 g o3 g toc with an average mp removal of 95 7 similar removal in the stand alone ozone process is only reached at a specific ozone dose of approximately 0 59 g o3 g toc 69 lower ozone dose for bo3 additionally the bac reactor removes om thus reducing the absolute amount of ozone input even further using 30 toc removal in the bac filter based on measurements in this study table s7 and our previous study van gijn et al 2021a and combining this with the 69 lower relative ozone dose this results in an absolute ozone dose in g o3 l which is approximately 78 lower in the bo3 process compared to stand alone ozonation the lower absolute amount of ozone required shows the benefit of the bo3 process for saving energy and therefore limiting co2 emissions and costs a direct comparison of only the ozone treatment in the bo3 process to stand alone ozonation because several of the mps were already at or close to detection limits after bac treatment these results confirm the findings of previous studies that underline the synergies between biological treatment and ozonation for the removal of mps from wwtp effluent de wilt et al 2018 van gijn et al 2021a nevertheless the high mp removals do not guarantee the ecotoxicological safety of the treated effluent 3 2 ecotoxicity of parent compounds the tier 1 risk quotients rqs of the mps in the samples peterson 2006 were calculated by dividing the measured mp concentration by the lowest predicted no effect concentrations pnec for freshwater obtained from the norman database table s1 to gain insight in the potential toxic risk of the parent compounds in the samples rqs are used in low tier risk assessment which means that they are a conservative indicator of whether a toxic effect can be expected if the rq is lower than 1 0 no risk is expected while a rq higher than 1 0 shows that an adverse effect could occur and further ecotoxicological assessment is required a worst case scenario was used where the receiving surface water consists for 100 of wwtp effluent this is a relevant scenario for many small wwtp in summer conditions in the netherlands several rqs were higher than 1 0 in the feed and even though all rqs decreased with all treatments some rqs were still higher than 1 0 after only bac or only ozone treatment table 1 this means that the parent compounds in the feed bac and ozone samples could cause an ecotoxicological concern after treatment with the bo3 process rqs were lower than 1 0 for all mps at all ozone doses which means that in these samples no adverse effects are expected for the measured parent compounds 3 3 ecotoxicity of organic transformation products the ecotoxicity of wwtp effluent toc of 12 9 mg l treated with a combination of bac filtration which decreased toc to 9 4 mg l and ozonation bo3 and with only ozonation o3 was tested using three in vivo bioassays and six in vitro calux assays results from the daphnia immobilization assay show no significant ecotoxicity in any of the samples fig 4 this means that the formed otps and obps at the tested ozone doses were not toxic to daphnia another study found formation of formaldehydes during ozonation of wwtp effluent at a concentration that is toxic to daphnia park et al 2016 while two other studies found a stable or decreasing ecotoxicity for daphnia with increasing ozone dose cao et al 2009 magdeburg et al 2012 this while cao et al 2009 used a higher ozone dose than park et al 2016 and magdeburg et al 2012 used longer exposure times than park et al 2016 these differing results from literature underline the complexity and case to case dependency of ecotoxicity of otps and obps in wwtp effluent dopp et al 2021 growth inhibition of algae did not show a clear relation with applied specific ozone dose fig 5 higher ecotoxicity 31 was observed at the highest ozone dose without bac pre treatment o3 this could mean that otps and obps toxic to algae are only formed at higher specific ozone doses higher than 0 4 g o3 g toc on the other hand in the 2x 4x and 8x diluted samples in the agia assay no increased ecotoxicity was observed figure s1 which makes the results of this datapoint weak fig 5 shows that ozone treatment preceded by bac filtration bo3 does not result in the formation of otps and obps that are toxic to algae other studies also found stable or decreasing ecotoxicity to algae after ozone treatment escher et al 2009 itzel et al 2017 margot et al 2013 inhibition of luminescent bacteria was stable with an increasing ozone dose both with and without bac pre treatment fig 6 this means that ozonation did not reduce the limited ecotoxicity that was present in the wwtp effluent but the otps and obps formed during treatment also were not more toxic to the bacteria than the parent compounds samples with bac pre treatment had slightly lower ecotoxicity although this trend was less clear for the dilutions figure s2 other studies find both increasing li et al 2019 and decreasing escher et al 2009 reungoat et al 2012 ecotoxicity to luminescent bacteria after ozonation the reason for these differing results could be that the experiment of li et al 2019 was not performed under realistic conditions but used high starting concentration of deet 200 mg l and high ozone doses up to several g o3 l the era for estrogens gr for glucocorticoids pah for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons p53 for genotoxicity pr for progesterone and nrf2 for oxidative stress calux assays were selected because of their relevance for surface water quality illustrated by the fact they are included in the dutch suggestions for biological effect monitoring stowa 2020 van der oost et al 2017 additionally the nrf2 assay was included to detect oxidative stress because of its relevance for ozonated samples these in vitro calux assays showed a decrease in ecotoxicity fig 7a d or stable ecotoxicity fig 7e and f with increasing ozone doses this suggests that the formed otps and obps had a lower or equal toxic potential compared to the parent compounds nevertheless the pre treatment method used for the calux assays spe was not tested for the recovery of otps and obps which makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions for all assays where ecotoxicity was observed the ecotoxicity in the samples with bac pre treatment bo3 showed lower ecotoxicity than the samples without o3 fig 7 this means that the bac treatment contributed to the removal of compounds that cause adverse effects for the tested endpoints for most assays of which ebts are available in literature equivalent concentrations in all samples were below the ebts table s10 only for the glucocorticoids assay fig 7c the measured hormonal ecotoxicity in the wwtp effluent was above the ebt of 100 ng dexamethasone eq l and was reduced to below the ebt after treatment overall this suggests that observed in vitro ecotoxicity for the tested assays was decreased to environmentally safe levels after treatment with the bo3 process the overall decrease of toxicity observed in the calux assays during ozonation fig 7 matches with other findings in literature phan et al 2021 also found a decrease in estrogenic and pah ecotoxicity fig 7a and c and fluctuating oxidative stress fig 7f with ozonation occurrence of genotoxicity using different genotoxicity assays varies strongly in different studies de baat et al 2020 dopp et al 2021 which can explain the complete absence of genotoxic in the samples measured in this study 3 4 formation of bromate bromate formation was tested in a separate experiment where bromide was spiked to the feed tank which had a toc concentration of 9 9 mg l bromide concentrations after spiking were 0 32 0 04 mg l for the samples with bac pre treatment bo3 and 0 47 0 01 mg l for the samples without bac pre treatment o3 toc and other om characteristics decreased by 30 45 during bac treatment table s11 bromate concentrations in the bo3 samples exceeded the dutch regulatory limit of 1 µg l in drinking water and surface water at a specific nitrite corrected ozone dose of 0 44 g o3 g toc and 0 49 g o3 g toc for the bo3 and o3 samples respectively fig 8 this bromate concentration represents the concentration in a wwtp effluent so before being relevant for surface water there would be dilution of the concentration nevertheless the observed bromate formation does illustrate the risk of bromate formation in bromide containing effluents fig 8 shows that at the lowest specific ozone doses 0 4 g o3 g toc bromate formation remained below the lowest regulatory limits 1 µg l and mostly even below the detection limit 0 2 µg l if the ozone dose is very low lower than the instantaneous ozone demand or initial ozonation demand defined as the decrease of ozone concentration in the first 30 s after dosing all ozone is consumed by other reactions and bromate formation does not occur buffle et al 2006 wert et al 2007 this means that as long as the ozone dose can be kept below the initial ozone demand the risk for bromate formation can be limited bromate formation is also influenced by the initial bromide concentration at higher ozone doses a higher bromide concentration starting from 50 µg l results in more formation of bromate von gunten 2003b on the other hand especially at lower ozone doses a higher initial bromide concentration can result in lower bromate formation the reason for this is that at a higher bromide concentration more ozone is consumed in the initial reaction from br to hobr obr increasing the initial ozone demand after which insufficient ozone remains to continue the reaction from hobr obr to bromate von gunten and oliveras 1998 yang et al 2019 this means that hobr obr will be remain in the water which poses less environmental risks than bromate von gunten 2003b bromate formation at similar specific ozone doses is higher in the bo3 samples than in the o3 samples in this study fig 8 and also higher than in other studies that monitored bromate formation during ozone treatment bourgin et al 2018 garcia villanova et al 2010 this high bromate formation in the bo3 samples underlines the importance of monitoring and limiting bromate formation by controlling the applied ozone dose additionally it indicates that the availability of ozone or ozone exposure at similar specific ozone doses is higher in the bo3 samples than in the o3 samples this means that om with higher ozone reactivity is removed to a higher extent than om with average ozone reactivity in the bac filter therefore toc should not be used to determine the required amount of ozone for the bo3 process because this can result in overdosing of ozone and in formation of bromate instead other parameters than toc that quantify the ozone reactive part of the om should be used ozone doses standardized to absorbance at 254 nm and to fluorescence regions i and ii relating to protein like om chen et al 2003 showed a better potential to predict bromate formation when comparing the samples with and without bac pre treatment fig 9 other studies also found that fluorescence indicators e g humic and vulvic acids are valuable tools to predict bromate formation wu et al 2018 the last factor that could affect bromate formation in the samples is the ammonium concentration 1 5 mg n l in the o3 samples and 0 in the bo3 samples although the potential of ammonium to reduce bromate formation is hard to judge in these samples due to the low bromate formation in the o3 samples 3 5 considerations for implementation 3 5 1 pre treatment before ozonation the bo3 process achieves higher mp removal and ecotoxicity reduction in wwtp effluent than conventional standalone ozonation at the same specific ozone doses expressed as g o3 g toc figs 2 9 figure s3 4 moreover the om removal in the bac filter results in a lower energy requirement for ozonation with bac pre treatment absolute ozone dose as was discussed thoroughly in our previous paper van gijn et al 2021a mp removal in the bac filter remained high compared to other studies at the time of the bromate experiments by which the activated carbon had been used for approximately 25 000 bed volumes with wwtp effluent on top of the 38 000 bed volumes in drinking water treatment benstoem et al 2017 fundneider et al 2021 the reason for the high mp removal in this bac filter could be related to the combination of the relatively high ebct 1 h and the high availability of oxygen due to pre aeration with pure oxygen applied in this study as was also shown in our previous study van gijn et al 2021a it was assumed that spiking of the mps did not affect the removal performance of the bac filter because overall mps and om were always present at similar concentrations in the real wwtp effluent based on results from the bromate formation experiment it is advised to apply low specific ozone doses approximately 0 2 g o3 g toc for treatment of bromide containing waters to avoid the formation of bromate at this low ozone dose the high removal potential and low energy requirements make implementation of the bo3 treatment for mp removal from wwtp effluents more feasible and more effective than the conventional standalone ozone treatment in this study a baco3 was compared to a standalone o3 for the removal of mps from wwtp effluent the question rises how the baco3 would compare to an o3 bac which was already tested for a number of different applications chuang et al 2019 gerrity et al 2011 vatankhah et al 2022 wang et al 2019 reungoat et al 2012 showed high 90 removal of a broad range of mps during full scale o3 bac treatment in three wwtps while using higher ozone doses 0 2 0 8 g o3 g doc and lower ebcts for the bac 9 45 min results of such studies are challenging to compare to the results in the current study due to differences in mps measured background om concentrations and applied ozone doses and ebcts in general the emphasis of an baco3 is on energy and costs savings while the emphasis of an o3 bac is on the further removal of background om obps and otps chuang et al 2019 reungoat et al 2012 further removal of background om is mainly relevant for potable reuse cases gerrity et al 2014 while the relevance of further removal of obps and otps is more complex to determine 3 5 2 post treatment after ozonation based on the results from this study ecotoxicity in the tested wwtp effluent decreased to environmentally safe levels after treatment with the bo3 process this suggests that the formed otps and obps during treatment had similar or lower toxic potential than the parent compounds present before treatment nevertheless a number of studies recommend the implementation of a post treatment for example a biological sand filtration or a bac filter after ozonation because of the concern regarding the formation of toxic otps and obps bourgin et al 2018 sauter et al 2021 there are studies that find adverse effects on fish development of ozonated wwtp effluents stalter et al 2010 and even a decrease and increase in adverse effects on a single endpoint genotoxicity depending on the specific assay umuc or ames that was used magdeburg et al 2014 it should be noted that the latter two studies used relatively high ozone doses and different feed waters 0 4 1 0 and 0 7 g o3 g toc respectively which also illustrates the challenges when comparing ecotoxicological results from different studies other broader review studies show that in the majority of the cases ozonation of wwtp effluents reduces ecotoxicity dopp et al 2021 itzel et al 2020 völker et al 2019 because of the broad range of mps spiked and the broad range of bioassays tested in this study we argue that formation of toxic otps and obps are not a risk for a bo3 treatment applied at most municipal wwtps and post treatment is not in all cases required nevertheless factors such as bromide concentrations in the feed water and applied ozone doses play a big role finally energy consumption and carbon footprint are also becoming more relevant factors to consider for the implementation of tertiary mp removal treatment adding an additional post treatment after ozonation increases the energy demand and should only be used in cases where it is beneficial for application at full scale especially in cases where more industrial water is treated in the wwtp it is recommended to test the formation of toxic otps and obps with a pilot scale plant first the current study can be used as a starting point for such a study after which it can be decided whether bo3 treatment is sufficient or an additional biological post treatment bo3b is required de wilt et al 2018 4 conclusion high micropollutant removal was observed during treatment of wwtp effluent with biological activated carbon filtration and ozonation the bo3 process an average micropollutant removal of 95 7 was measured at an empty bed contact time in the bac filter of approximately 1 h and a specific ozone dose of approximately 0 2 g o3 g toc to achieve similar mp removal with stand alone ozonation a four times higher absolute ozone dose is required which underlines the potential of the bo3 process to achieve high micropollutant removal at low energy input ecotoxicity measured with three in vivo assays and six in vitro assays was stable or reduced after ozonation these results suggests that the ecotoxicity of the formed transformation products during ozonation was overall lower than the ecotoxicity of the parent compounds based on the tested bioassays and for the tested conditions a biological post treatment to remove the formed ozone transformation products after the bo3 process was not required we argue that the need for a biological post treatment after ozonation should be determined on a case to case basis in the experiments where bromide was spiked to the feed bromate formation was below the dutch regulatory limit 1 µg l at specific ozone doses lower than 0 4 g o3 g toc additionally at specific ozone doses above 0 4 g o3 g toc bromate formation in the bo3 process was higher than in the reference samples with only ozonation and without bac pre treatment this high bromate formation indicates the high availability of ozone after bac treatment while it also underlines the importance of monitoring bromide and organic matter concentrations in the feed of the ozone reactor to avoid overdosing of ozone which could result in the formation of bromate for the samples measured in this study absorbance at 254 nm and fluorescence peaks related to protein like compounds was a more reliable inline measurement used to standardize ozone doses compared to the conventional toc measurement declaration of competing

14616,methylmercury mehg uptake by phytoplankton represents a key step in determining the exposure risks of aquatic organisms and human beings to this potent neurotoxin phytoplankton uptake is believed to be negatively related to dissolved organic matter dom concentration in water however microorganisms can rapidly change dom concentration and composition and subsequent impact on mehg uptake by phytoplankton has rarely been tested here we explored the influences of microbial degradation on the concentrations and molecular compositions of dom derived from three common algal sources and tested their subsequent impacts on mehg uptake by the widespread phytoplankton species microcystis elabens our results indicated that dissolved organic carbon was degraded by 64 3 74 1 within 28 days of incubating water with microbial consortia from a natural meso eutrophic river protein like components in dom were more readily degraded while the numbers of molecular formula for peptides like compounds had increased after 28 days incubation probably due to the production and release of bacterial metabolites microbial degradation made dom more humic like which was consistent with the positive correlations between changes in proportions of peaks a and c and bacterial abundance in bacterial community structures as illustrated by 16s rrna gene sequencing despite rapid losses of the bulk dom during the incubation we found that dom degraded after 28 days still reduced the mehg uptake by microcystis elabens by 32 7 52 7 relative to a control without microbial decomposers our findings emphasize that microbial degradation of dom would not necessarily enhance the mehg uptakes by phytoplankton and may become more powerful in inhibiting mehg uptakes by phytoplankton the potential roles of microbes in degrading dom and changing the uptakes of mehg at the base of food webs should now be incorporated into future risk assessments of aquatic hg cycling graphical abstract

available on request 1 introduction due to its high rate of bioaccumulation in aquatic food webs and potent neurotoxicity mehg has been long prioritized as a pollutant to control in the us china and many other countries selin et al 2006 2008 feng et al 2022 mehg uptake by phytoplankton is a crucial step by which it enters and bioaccumulates in food webs luengen et al 2012 yoshino et al 2020 ogorek et al 2021 li et al 2022a b mehg uptake by phytoplankton is regulated by many factors in water including chemical speciation of mehg and ligand types such as thiols oh and cl mason et al 1996 miles et al 2001 kim et al 2014 lee and fisher 2017 dissolved organic matter dom is one of the most important metal binding ligands in surface water dieguez et al 2013 graham et al 2013 chiasson gould et al 2014 luo et al 2022 many studies have investigated how dom affects the mehg uptake by phytoplankton often reporting a negative association between dom concentration and mehg uptake rate including cases from the san francisco bay luengen et al 2012 the laurentian great lakes ogorek et al 2021 and streams in eastern minnesota tsui and finlay 2011 typically bulk dom in inland water is predominantly allochthonous yet the autochthonous dom e g from algal productions and microbial exudates is more labile and it has a larger influence on geochemical cycles of heavy metals leclerc et al 2015 bouchet et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 catalán et al 2021 algae derived dom aom constitutes the bulk of labile autochthonous dom in many inland waters particularly eutrophic waters he et al 2016a xie et al 2020 liu et al 2022 emerging studies have explored the roles of aom in biotic methylation of inorganic hg lei et al 2021 yin et al 2022 and bioaccumulation of mehg in aquatic food webs li et al 2022a most of these studies conclude that aom has a more active role than allochthonous dom in hg cycling and biotransformation in aquatic ecosystems lei et al 2021 li et al 2022a microbial and photochemical degradation could reduce concentrations of dom and reshape its molecular compositions cory et al 2014 li et al 2014a he et al 2016b xu et al 2016 thereby altering its potential interactions with mehg for example microbial degradation has been estimated to remove around 60 of the dom obtained from fallen leaves incubated in the dark at 25 c for 14 days zheng et al 2019 as the most labile component in dom aom could provide especially rich and essential nutrients for the growths of heterotrophs zheng et al 2019 such as proteins carbohydrate and functional groups e g carboxylic phenolic carbonyl sulfhydryl kellerman et al 2014 xu and guo 2017 changes in aom could then result in the even faster changes in the concentrations and relative abundances of different molecular compounds additionally microbial metabolites can also change compositions of dom microbial remains and endo and exo metabolomes mainly include the compounds 1500 da in mass with a large fraction between 250 and 550 da noriega ortega et al 2019 these compounds include labile amino acids low molecular thioalcohol zhou et al 2021 and peptide derived natural product choudhury et al 2014 ortega and van der donk 2016 romano et al 2018 although some studies reported that microbial metabolites are an important component in degraded dom few have examined their influence on the mehg uptake by phytoplankton microorganisms also vary in their preferences for different compounds in dom that could shape the interactions between dom and mehg brailsford et al 2019 2020 found that amino acids have faster microbial uptake rates than sugars or other organic acids with amino acid like component from diatoms degraded within as quickly as five days in some studies lian et al 2021 generally the relative abundance of small molecular mass compounds and humic like fluorophores could increase after the biodegradations catalán et al 2021 by contrast more biodegradable protein like compounds could turn over more quickly brailsford et al 2020 together these changes can oxidize or decompose the groups that strongly bind with mehg in water the objective of this study was to explore how the aom modified by microbial degradation regulates mehg bioavailability and uptake by freshwater phytoplankton we inoculated natural river water with aom produced by three common phytoplankton species we have tracked the changes in the dom composition through time using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc q tof ms three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy 3d eems and the ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was applied to characterize the composition of microbes associated with the dom degradation we then collected the degraded dom and tested its influence on mehg uptakes by a common freshwater phytoplankton species microcystis elabens the integrated set of methods can provide new insights into how microbial degradation of dom regulates mehg uptake and accumulation into aquatic food webs 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgal cultivation and preparation of aom amendments we cultivated three common freshwater phytoplankton to obtain algae derived dom nostoc sp fachb 95 microcystis elabens fachb 916 and s quadricauda fachb 44 fig s1 all three species are widely distributed in inland waters and frequently cause algal blooms hu and wei 2006 safi et al 2014 cook et al 2020 purified algae were obtained from the freshwater algae culture collections at the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences algae were cultivated in the bg 11 media in a controlled incubator temperature 25 c light 2500 lux 12 12 h light dark cycle cultures were shaken gently three times daily to avoid sedimentation to ensure the purity cultures were regularly examined under an olympus light microscope by 200 magnification algae in mid exponential growth phase as determined from the growth curve had been separated for the extraction of aom and mehg exposure tests skrobonja et al 2019 ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid was removed from the bg 11 media to avoid its competitive binding with mehg gorski et al 2006 skrobonja et al 2019 aom was extracted from phytoplankton by a freezing thawing method daly et al 2007 li et al 2012 li et al 2014b and labelled aom n aom m and aom s for nostoc sp microcystis elabens and s quadricauda respectively the specific method is described further in text s1 to assess the biological lability of aom we undertook a 28 day lab incubation fig s2 we added 20 ml ultrapure waters to 100 ml amber glass bottles mixed with 10 ml of filtered water 0 8 μm cellulose acetate filter collected from surfaces of a natural and meso eutrophic river latitude 38 99 n longitude 117 31 e before the summer bloom periods on june 23 2022 to serve as a microbial inoculum vonk et al 2015 we then added aom amendments to a target doc concentration of 15 mg c l liu et al 2021 shelton et al 2022 with a final volume in the bottles of 100 ml any remaining volume was supplemented with ultrapure water the doc concentration in the raw waters was a mean se of 5 01 0 87 mg c l and mehg concentration was 0 32 0 08 ng l n 3 to avoid nutrient limitation in the incubation kno3 and na2hpo4 were added to the final concentrations of 0 48 mg n l and 0 10 mg p l as in the previous studies mostovaya et al 2016 wasswa et al 2022 the bottles were maintained aerobic but isolated from the airborne bacteria and dust using the breathable sealing films and shaken at 120 r min the bottles were wrapped in aluminum foils to avoid photodegradation of aom the experiment was conducted in the dark at a constant temperature 25 c the aliquots for dom characterization were collected on days 0 1 2 3 7 14 21 and 28 filtered through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate filters and stored at 80 c until analyzed 2 2 mehg exposure test by phytoplankton we compared the mehg uptake by microcystis elabens in the presence of the degraded and original aom see fig s2 to be consistent with the previous studies li et al 2022a mehg exposure duration was set to be 240 min at the initial mehg concentration of 100 ng l this exposure concentration approached the previous studies and was much lower than the already known sub lethal concentration of mehg 1 1 11 μg l to algae beauvais flück et al 2017 slaveykova et al 2021 we mixed 16 ml of aom from days 0 2 3 7 14 21 and 28 of the microbial degradation incubations with 30 ml ultrapure waters in the acid washed and high temperature treated 540 c erlenmeyer flasks we also included a control treatment without aom amendment each treatment was replicated three times the mixtures of mehg and aom were then shaken gently for 120 min in the dark to equilibrate the mehg binding with the aom miller et al 2009 luengen et al 2012 afterwards algae microcystis elabens were added at an initial cell density of 104 105 cell ml since the mehg exposure was short we considered that algae biomass did not change during the exposure and built a linear relationship between the cell density cell ml determined by a hemocytometer and optical density at a wavelength of 680 nm tomar and jajoo 2021 jiang et al 2022 at the end of the exposures algae cells were separated from medium by vacuum filtration with 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membranes and washed three times with ultrapure waters to flush away the residual and free mehg on the membranes mehg concentrations in whole algae cells and media were measured as described below 2 3 dom characterization mehg analysis and microbiological analysis to characterize changes in dom compositions during microbial degradation we combined uv vis bowen et al 2020 3d eems chen et al 2003 and uplc q tof ms lu et al 2018 2021 liao et al 2021 patriarca et al 2021 uv vis spectra were measured using the uv vis 8453 spectrophotometer agilent technologies at 200 800 nm the blank corrections were performed with milli q water we extracted the absorptions at 210 nm a210 254 nm a254 and 280 nm a280 that have been frequently applied to characterize the microbial activities aromaticity and protein components table s1 the fluorescence spectroscopy for each dom sample had been measured by a hitachi f2000 fluorometer with 1 cm quartz cell the excitations ranged from 220 to 480 nm every 5 nm and emissions ranged from 250 to 600 nm every 5 nm pmt voltage was set to 700 v and the slit width of excitation and emission was 2 5 nm efc v1 2 software was used for the subsequent data processing and major peaks in dom components were identified using fluorescence regional integration chen et al 2003 six major components including the peak a humic like em 380 460 nm ex 250 260

protein like em 300 310 nm ex 230 nm were identified chen et al 2003 he et al 2016a liu et al 2021 several dom quality indices were calculated table s1 including the biological freshness index bix with values of 1 indicating an aquatic bacterial source of dom humification index hix with a higher value indicating an increasing degree of humification and fluorescence index fi with a value of 1 9

al 2019 ijoma et al 2021 bai et al 2022 further details were provided in the text s3 2 4 statistical analysis we applied first order kinetics to study dom decay for each of doc concentration a254 a280 and the six major fluorescence components we had modelled their value c after t days of incubation as 1 c c 0 e k t where c0 represents the initial value of the parameter and k is the estimated first order kinetic constant day 1 models were fitted with the origin 2019 differences in the dom properties or mehg uptake between different treatments were compared using one way analysis of variance anova data normality was examined using a shapiro wilk test with spss 22 0 ibm usa before analysis a nonparametric sign test was used to compare m z of protein like and peptide like substances identified from uplc q tof ms the spearman s correlation analyses were applied to explore the relationships between different variables 3 results 3 1 aom decays during 28 days of microbial degradation we found large decreases in the aom across the three sources despite similar decay kinetics fig s3 doc decay coefficients were a mean se of 0 34 0 01 day 1 for aom m 0 36 0 01 day 1 for aom n and 0 39 0 01 day 1 for aom s respectively over the 28 day incubation n 3 however higher dom decay rates were observed in the first five days after the start of the incubation the doc concentration declined from 15 0 mg c l on day 0 to 5 60 0 10 mg c l for aom m 5 00 0 40 mg c l for aom n and 3 88 0 21 mg c l for aom s after 28 days 64 3 0 6 of the aom m 66 7 2 7 of the aom n and 74 1 1 4 of the aom s was degraded based on the doc concentrations at the end of bio incubation the percentage of dom degraded was similar regardless of the aom sources fig s3 anova f 0 18 p 0 1 3 2 changes in dom composition based on the spectrum analysis the fluorescent components with the large abundances were identified from the fluorescence spectra including the humic like component peak a the fulvic like component peak c and protein like component peaks s t d and b figs s4 and 1a after 28 days of incubations the fluorescence signal intensity declined for almost all the components identified by 3d eems although magnitudes of the declines varied among components based on the first order kinetic model we estimated the decay rates for different aom components fig s5 unsurprisingly the protein like components such as peaks s t d and b were more sensitive to the microbial degradations with an average decay coefficient of 0 22 0 74 day 1 across the three sources by contrast the decay coefficients for the humic like peak a and fulvic like component peak c were much lower with the values of 0 02 0 08 day 1 and 0 06 0 09 day 1 respectively table s2 and fig 1b due to the differences in decay rates the relative abundances of different dom components changed substantially during the microbial decompositions after 28 days of incubations up to 86 7 93 5 of the protein like substances were estimated to be degraded while humic like and fulvic like substances had persisted i e 4 2 14 0 and 1 8 11 5 losses respectively fig 1 consequently the relative abundances of protein like components had decreased from 1 1 to 35 0 for the three aom sources before incubation to 0 8 27 4 after the incubation anova f 4 30 p 0 01 by contrast the relative abundances of humic like and fulvic like substances increased in relative abundances from 4 2 to 25 4 to 19 3 32 0 and 1 8 47 4 to 12 4 52 3 by the end of the incubation respectively anova f 4 03 p 0 01 fig s6 dom quality indices further indicated that dom was being produced from bacterial sources e g microbial metabolites during degradation the fi for which increasing values indicate a smaller contribution of terrestrial relative to microbial sources to the dom pool suggested that dom from the phytoplankton production had undergone bacterial processing unlike raw river waters at the start of the incubation with a fi of only 1 8 fi values in the aom amended waters after 28 days were much higher 3 9 for aom m 5 8 for aom n and 2 8 for aom s fig s7a this result was further supported by the bix which was above 1 0 for all the groups after incubations and generally increased as compared to the initial value except aom s indicating an increasingly autochthonous origin of dom fig s7b despite the general declines of fluorescence signals associated with decays of aom fig 1a we found the intensified absorptions between 200 and 250 nm suggesting that the microbial activities also produced new compounds uv absorption between 200 and 250 nm unexpectedly rose after 28 days incubation particularly for aom m and aom n while absorption between 250 and 800 nm had decreased gradually over this period fig 2 based on the kinetic models absorption at 254 and 280 nm a254 and a280 decreased by 2 44 5 33 day 1 and 3 85 9 07 day 1 respectively fig s8 and table s2 however absorption at 210 nm a210 increased from only 0 49 0 66 before the incubation to 0 59 1 89 after 28 days fig s8 anova f 0 02 p 0 05 3 3 changes in molecular composition based on uplc q tof ms we further explored the changes in molecular compositions of dom including the numbers compound classes and m z values of molecules during the incubations figs 3 s9 and s10 because thiols have been well known to influence the mehg uptakes by phytoplankton lee and fisher 2017 skrobonja et al 2019 we focused on the change of sulfur containing compounds including chons and chos the molecules containing elements of c h o n and or s for the initial aom at the start of the incubation the numbers of chons formulae were 13 047 13 895 and 11 049 and numbers of chos formulae were 5620 5096 and 4920 in the aom m aom n and aom s treatments respectively as indicated in figs s9 and s10 however after 28 days incubation numbers of molecules increased in all the three aom amended groups for example the numbers of chons increased by 848 2512 and 3062 for aom m aom n and aom s treatments respectively indicating that microbial degradation of aom had made sulfur containing dom more complex fig s9 we further analyzed the peptides and protein like molecules that might contain thiols our results suggested that the numbers of peptide molecules in the degraded aom increased from 3202 2436 and 2901 in aom m aom n and aom s treatments at the beginning of the incubation to 3351 3445 and 3386 after 28 days incubation respectively fig 3 protein like compounds had displayed a similar trend fig 3 in terms of molecular compositions the changes were mainly associated with the formulae with low h c and o c ratio as found for the protein like compounds fig 3 in addition there were also substantial increases in the molecular sizes of the degraded dom for peptide like compounds the average m z value was similar among the treatments at 697 8 216 3 694 3 218 4 and 684 2 218 9 for aom m aom n and aom s before starting the incubation increasing to 704 1 241 8 702 0 215 1 and 698 7 214 9 afterwards respectively sign tests z 46 45 to 53 58 p 0 05 3 4 changes in bacterial communities and their relationship with dom changes in dom concentration and composition were driven by microbial activities so we analyzed the changes in bacterial communities during the incubation based on 16s rrna gene sequencing we found that for all incubations regardless of aom sources bacterial community became more diverse with a longer incubation time as shown with the increasing values of the α diversity indices including chao1 shannon and simpson indices table s3 for example the shannon index had increased from only 1 40 1 77 on day 1 to 3 22 3 71 on day 14 and then stabilized fig s11 dom and bacterial community compositions had also interacted for instance actinobacteria increased in the relative abundance increasing from 0 4 0 7 to 11 4 42 3 by the end of the incubation fig s12 and table s4 the specie is related with humic substances li et al 2014b bai et al 2017 correspondingly some bacterial families were strongly associated with the changes in aom as determined using the spearman correlations fig s13 for example positive correlations between the change in proportions of peaks a and c and bacterial abundance indicated that microbial degradation had made the dom more humic like there were also changes in microbial functional genes in incubations fig s14 for example we found that the abundances of genes associated with the dark oxidation of sulfur compounds increasing with incubation time which indicated that protein like components were being transformed fig s15 3 5 impacts of degraded aom on mehg uptake by phytoplankton we found evidence that aom amendment prevented mehg uptake by microcystis elabens figs 4 and s16 after 240 mins exposure to mehg treatments without aom amendments had the higher mehg concentrations in algal cells 0 55 0 00 amol cell as compared to the treatments amended with non biodegraded aom m 0 41 0 01 amol cell aom n 0 47 0 00 amol cell and aom s 0 48 0 01 amol cell anova f 2 99 p 0 05 regardless of sources mehg uptake by phytoplankton first decreased and then increased among 28 days figs 4a 4c aom that was degraded for a longer period more strongly inhibited the mehg uptake by phytoplankton for instance after 240 mins of exposures to mehg in the presence of aom m that was degraded for 28 days only 42 7 60 6 of mehg in waters was accumulated by microcystis elabens at a doc concentration level of 5 mg c l this value was much lower than the 67 3 78 7 mehg uptake in the presence of aom m which had not been degraded at the same doc concentration level mehg concentration in algal cells exposed to mehg with the degraded aom m was 0 26 0 01 amol cell which was nearly only half the concentration found in the cells within the initial aom m treatments fig 4d anova f 3 63 p 0 01 mehg uptake was similarly reduced when the algal cells were exposed to other aom treatment fig 4 mehg uptake could be affected by characteristics of dom we found that mehg uptake by microcystis elabens was negatively correlated with the absorbance at 210 nm and fi for which the increasing values of both measures implied greater microbial activity fig 5 other characteristics of dom were not associated with mehg uptakes by microcystis elabens as shown in fig s17 4 discussion mehg uptake by phytoplankton is believed to be negatively related to dom concentrations in the waters tsui and finlay 2011 luengen et al 2012 ogorek et al 2021 rapid decay of aom is therefore assumed to enhance the mehg accumulation in aquatic food webs however here we found that the losses of dom did not enhance the mehg uptake by phytoplankton our study instead suggest that the microbial derived metabolites can inhibit mehg uptakes figs 4 and 5 inoculated bacteria introduced new components into the dom pool during our incubations characterize microbial activities aromaticity and protein components huang et al 2016 brezinski and gorczyca 2019 as evidenced by the changes in absorbances at 210 nm figs 2 and s8c and increased numbers of chons and chos compounds after 28 days of biodegradation figs s9 and s10 using mass spectrometry we found the microbial release of sulfur containing compound in inhibiting mehg uptake by microcystis elabens reactivity of dom is largely perceived as an intrinsic property of its molecular composition freeman et al 2022 hu et al 2022 compared to the dom from terrestrial source aom is more labile and bioavailable to microorganisms leclerc et al 2015 bouchet et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 catalán et al 2021 as indicated by the 3d eems most of the aom in our study consisted of the protein like substances occupying 74 to 94 of the total fluorescence intensity across our three aom sources fig s5 these components usually have rich thiols and other functional groups e g cysteine glutathione that have strong binding affinities with dissolved mehg in water lee and fisher 2017 skrobonja et al 2019 the observation has always been applied to explain the negative relationship between mehg uptake by phytoplankton and doc concentration lee and fisher 2017 bouchet et al 2018 li et al 2022a and here we shine a molecular light onto understanding this observation protein like components especially could be more easily and rapidly degraded by the microorganisms brailsford et al 2020 our results support this interpretation as we found that decay rates of protein like substances sum of peaks s t d and b were many times higher than for the humic and fulvic like substances fig 1 brailsford et al al 2019 similarly reported that amino acids had much faster microbial uptake kinetics and rate of decay than the other compounds types in particular the s containing amino acids cysteine and methionine could be rapidly depleted in mesotrophic and oligotrophic waters by microorganisms with a halving time of 1 h brailsford et al 2020 lian et al al 2021 also found that proteins and amino acid like substances in the dom that derived from thalassiosira pseudonana can be rapidly degraded within five days rapid decay of protein like components indicates that the thiols and some other functional groups e g cysteine glutathione in proteins strongly complexed with mehg can also be consumed or converted to other compounds the loss of these compounds may reduce bonding strengths between mehg and ligands at the early stages fig 4 for example skrobonja et al 2019 had reported that the thermodynamically less stable complexes formed by mehg and ligands in water led to a higher cellular uptake rate for algae cells in contrast to rapid declines of protein like components during the incubation mehg uptake by phytoplankton did not change monotonically with the time aom that was degraded for a longer time after 28 days biodegradation could better inhibit mehg uptake by phytoplankton fig 4 s containing compounds have been studied as a way to inhibit the mehg uptake by phytoplankton lee and fisher 2017 skrobonja et al 2019 and our results showed that thiol containing peptide and protein like compounds produced by microbial activities from aom might be a source of this potential relative to stability constants of oh log k 4 5 and cl log k 5 3 mason et al 1996 miles et al 2001 kim et al 2014 lee and fisher 2017 mehg is believed to form a stronger and more stable complex with the thiols lee and fisher 2017 skrobonja et al 2019 sulfur containing compounds derived from microbial activities could be produced through two major pathways choudhury et al 2014 moran and durham 2019 the first is the metabolism of dissolved organic sulfur dos contained in aom moran and durham 2019 reported that after incorporating dos compound into biosynthetic pathway bacteria could release these compounds back into the environments in the reduced forms such as cysteine glutathione and methionine wirth et al 2020 wu et al 2021 these reduced sulfur compounds could individually occur at concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 ng ml kido soule et al 2015 johnson et al 2017 second the microorganisms could produce metabolites including antimicrobial peptides to gain the advantages competition under the nutrient limited conditions choudhury et al 2014 ortega and van der donk 2016 romano et al 2018 such as in later stages of our bio incubation where doc concentration was reduced by over 60 fig s3 consistent with this interpretation the functional genes that were responsible for the membrane translocation of antimicrobial peptides were more abundant later in the bio incubations fig s15b together our results indicate that microbial metabolites especially the thiol containing compounds produced during aom degradations could limit mehg availabilities in freshwaters hur 2011 xu et al 2018 lian et al 2021 chen et al 2022 5 conclusion our study has identified new and important roles of microbial metabolites produced during aom incubations in aquatic hg cycling that have rarely been emphasized algal blooms are a frequent occurrence in many inland waters globally glibert 2017 wang et al 2021 so there is an emerging need to pay attention to how aom degradation as a dom source influences the mehg uptake by phytoplankton previous studies report a negative association between aom concentration and mehg uptake by plankton but without understanding underlying mechanisms and influences of biodegradation our study reveals that rapid microbial degradations of dom can help limit mehg uptake by phytoplankton thus the potential role of microbes in degrading aom and changing the uptakes of mehg by phytoplankton should now be incorporated into the future risk assessments of aquatic hg cycling declaration of competing

14616,methylmercury mehg uptake by phytoplankton represents a key step in determining the exposure risks of aquatic organisms and human beings to this potent neurotoxin phytoplankton uptake is believed to be negatively related to dissolved organic matter dom concentration in water however microorganisms can rapidly change dom concentration and composition and subsequent impact on mehg uptake by phytoplankton has rarely been tested here we explored the influences of microbial degradation on the concentrations and molecular compositions of dom derived from three common algal sources and tested their subsequent impacts on mehg uptake by the widespread phytoplankton species microcystis elabens our results indicated that dissolved organic carbon was degraded by 64 3 74 1 within 28 days of incubating water with microbial consortia from a natural meso eutrophic river protein like components in dom were more readily degraded while the numbers of molecular formula for peptides like compounds had increased after 28 days incubation probably due to the production and release of bacterial metabolites microbial degradation made dom more humic like which was consistent with the positive correlations between changes in proportions of peaks a and c and bacterial abundance in bacterial community structures as illustrated by 16s rrna gene sequencing despite rapid losses of the bulk dom during the incubation we found that dom degraded after 28 days still reduced the mehg uptake by microcystis elabens by 32 7 52 7 relative to a control without microbial decomposers our findings emphasize that microbial degradation of dom would not necessarily enhance the mehg uptakes by phytoplankton and may become more powerful in inhibiting mehg uptakes by phytoplankton the potential roles of microbes in degrading dom and changing the uptakes of mehg at the base of food webs should now be incorporated into future risk assessments of aquatic hg cycling graphical abstract

many other countries selin et al 2006 2008 feng et al 2022 mehg uptake by phytoplankton is a crucial step by which it enters and bioaccumulates in food webs luengen et al 2012 yoshino et al 2020 ogorek et al 2021 li et al 2022a b mehg uptake by phytoplankton is regulated by many factors in water including chemical speciation of mehg and ligand types such as thiols oh and cl mason et al 1996 miles et al 2001 kim et al 2014 lee and fisher 2017 dissolved organic matter dom is one of the most important metal binding ligands in surface water dieguez et al 2013 graham et al 2013 chiasson gould et al 2014 luo et al 2022 many studies have investigated how dom affects the mehg uptake by phytoplankton often reporting a negative association between dom concentration and mehg uptake rate including cases from the san francisco bay luengen et al 2012 the laurentian great lakes ogorek et al 2021 and streams in eastern minnesota tsui and finlay 2011 typically bulk dom in inland water is predominantly allochthonous yet the autochthonous dom e g from algal productions and microbial exudates is more labile and it has a larger influence on geochemical cycles of heavy metals leclerc et al 2015 bouchet et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 catalán et al 2021 algae derived dom aom constitutes the bulk of labile autochthonous dom in many inland waters particularly eutrophic waters he et al 2016a xie et al 2020 liu et al 2022 emerging studies have explored the roles of aom in biotic methylation of inorganic hg lei et al 2021 yin et al 2022 and bioaccumulation of mehg in aquatic food webs li et al 2022a most of these studies conclude that aom has a more active role than allochthonous dom in hg cycling and biotransformation in aquatic ecosystems lei et al 2021 li et al 2022a microbial and photochemical degradation could reduce concentrations of dom and reshape its molecular compositions cory et al 2014 li et al 2014a he et al 2016b xu et al 2016 thereby altering its potential interactions with mehg for example microbial degradation has been estimated to remove around 60 of the dom obtained from fallen leaves incubated in the dark at 25 c for 14 days zheng et al 2019 as the most labile component in dom aom could provide especially rich and essential nutrients for the growths of heterotrophs zheng et al 2019 such as proteins carbohydrate and functional groups e g carboxylic phenolic carbonyl sulfhydryl kellerman et al 2014 xu and guo 2017 changes in aom could then result in the even faster changes in the concentrations and relative abundances of different molecular compounds additionally microbial metabolites can also change compositions of dom microbial remains and endo and exo metabolomes mainly include the compounds 1500 da in mass with a large fraction between 250 and 550 da noriega ortega et al 2019 these compounds include labile amino acids low molecular thioalcohol zhou et al 2021 and peptide derived natural product choudhury et al 2014 ortega and van der donk 2016 romano et al 2018 although some studies reported that microbial metabolites are an important component in degraded dom few have examined their influence on the mehg uptake by phytoplankton microorganisms also vary in their preferences for different compounds in dom that could shape the interactions between dom and mehg brailsford et al 2019 2020 found that amino acids have faster microbial uptake rates than sugars or other organic acids with amino acid like component from diatoms degraded within as quickly as five days in some studies lian et al 2021 generally the relative abundance of small molecular mass compounds and humic like fluorophores could increase after the biodegradations catalán et al 2021 by contrast more biodegradable protein like compounds could turn over more quickly brailsford et al 2020 together these changes can oxidize or decompose the groups that strongly bind with mehg in water the objective of this study was to explore how the aom modified by microbial degradation regulates mehg bioavailability and uptake by freshwater phytoplankton we inoculated natural river water with aom produced by three common phytoplankton species we have tracked the changes in the dom composition through time using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc q tof ms three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy 3d eems and the ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was applied to characterize the composition of microbes associated with the dom degradation we then collected the degraded dom and tested its influence on mehg uptakes by a common freshwater phytoplankton species microcystis elabens the integrated set of methods can provide new insights into how microbial degradation of dom regulates mehg uptake and accumulation into aquatic food webs 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgal cultivation and preparation of aom amendments we cultivated three common freshwater phytoplankton to obtain algae derived dom nostoc sp fachb 95 microcystis elabens fachb 916 and s quadricauda fachb 44 fig s1 all three species are widely distributed in inland waters and frequently cause algal blooms hu and wei 2006 safi et al 2014 cook et al 2020 purified algae were obtained from the freshwater algae culture collections at the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences algae were cultivated in the bg 11 media in a controlled incubator temperature 25 c light 2500 lux 12 12 h light dark cycle cultures were shaken gently three times daily to avoid sedimentation to ensure the purity cultures were regularly examined under an olympus light microscope by 200 magnification algae in mid exponential growth phase as determined from the growth curve had been separated for the extraction of aom and mehg exposure tests skrobonja et al 2019 ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid was removed from the bg 11 media to avoid its competitive binding with mehg gorski et al 2006 skrobonja et al 2019 aom was extracted from phytoplankton by a freezing thawing method daly et al 2007 li et al 2012 li et al 2014b and labelled aom n aom m and aom s for nostoc sp microcystis elabens and s quadricauda respectively the specific method is described further in text s1 to assess the biological lability of aom we undertook a 28 day lab incubation fig s2 we added 20 ml ultrapure waters to 100 ml amber glass bottles mixed with 10 ml of filtered water 0 8 μm cellulose acetate filter collected from surfaces of a natural and meso eutrophic river latitude 38 99 n longitude 117 31 e before the summer bloom periods on june 23 2022 to serve as a microbial inoculum vonk et al 2015 we then added aom amendments to a target doc concentration of 15 mg c l liu et al 2021 shelton et al 2022 with a final volume in the bottles of 100 ml any remaining volume was supplemented with ultrapure water the doc concentration in the raw waters was a mean se of 5 01 0 87 mg c l and mehg concentration was 0 32 0 08 ng l n 3 to avoid nutrient limitation in the incubation kno3 and na2hpo4 were added to the final concentrations of 0 48 mg n l and 0 10 mg p l as in the previous studies mostovaya et al 2016 wasswa et al 2022 the bottles were maintained aerobic but isolated from the airborne bacteria and dust using the breathable sealing films and shaken at 120 r min the bottles were wrapped in aluminum foils to avoid photodegradation of aom the experiment was conducted in the dark at a constant temperature 25 c the aliquots for dom characterization were collected on days 0 1 2 3 7 14 21 and 28 filtered through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate filters and stored at 80 c until analyzed 2 2 mehg exposure test by phytoplankton we compared the mehg uptake by microcystis elabens in the presence of the degraded and original aom see fig s2 to be consistent with the previous studies li et al 2022a mehg exposure duration was set to be 240 min at the initial mehg concentration of 100 ng l this exposure concentration approached the previous studies and was much lower than the already known sub lethal concentration of mehg 1 1 11 μg l to algae beauvais flück et al 2017 slaveykova et al 2021 we mixed 16 ml of aom from days 0 2 3 7 14 21 and 28 of the microbial degradation incubations with 30 ml ultrapure waters in the acid washed and high temperature treated 540 c erlenmeyer flasks we also included a control treatment without aom amendment each treatment was replicated three times the mixtures of mehg and aom were then shaken gently for 120 min in the dark to equilibrate the mehg binding with the aom miller et al 2009 luengen et al 2012 afterwards algae microcystis elabens were added at an initial cell density of 104 105 cell ml since the mehg exposure was short we considered that algae biomass did not change during the exposure and built a linear relationship between the cell density cell ml determined by a hemocytometer and optical density at a wavelength of 680 nm tomar and jajoo 2021 jiang et al 2022 at the end of the exposures algae cells were separated from medium by vacuum filtration with 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membranes and washed three times with ultrapure waters to flush away the residual and free mehg on the membranes mehg concentrations in whole algae cells and media were measured as described below 2 3 dom characterization mehg analysis and microbiological analysis to characterize changes in dom compositions during microbial degradation we combined uv vis bowen et al 2020 3d eems chen et al 2003 and uplc q tof ms lu et al 2018 2021 liao et al 2021 patriarca et al 2021 uv vis spectra were measured using the uv vis 8453 spectrophotometer agilent technologies at 200 800 nm the blank corrections were performed with milli q water we extracted the absorptions at 210 nm a210 254 nm a254 and 280 nm a280 that have been frequently applied to characterize the microbial activities aromaticity and protein components table s1 the fluorescence spectroscopy for each dom sample had been measured by a hitachi f2000 fluorometer with 1 cm quartz cell the excitations ranged from 220 to 480 nm every 5 nm and emissions ranged from 250 to 600 nm every 5 nm pmt voltage was set to 700 v and the slit width of excitation and emission was 2 5 nm efc v1 2 software was used for the subsequent data processing and major peaks in dom components were identified using fluorescence regional integration chen et al 2003 six major components including the peak a humic like em 380 460 nm ex 250 260

protein like em 300 310 nm ex 230 nm were identified chen et al 2003 he et al 2016a liu et al 2021 several dom quality indices were calculated table s1 including the biological freshness index bix with values of 1 indicating an aquatic bacterial source of dom humification index hix with a higher value indicating an increasing degree of humification and fluorescence index fi with a value of 1 9

al 2019 ijoma et al 2021 bai et al 2022 further details were provided in the text s3 2 4 statistical analysis we applied first order kinetics to study dom decay for each of doc concentration a254 a280 and the six major fluorescence components we had modelled their value c after t days of incubation as 1 c c 0 e k t where c0 represents the initial value of the parameter and k is the estimated first order kinetic constant day 1 models were fitted with the origin 2019 differences in the dom properties or mehg uptake between different treatments were compared using one way analysis of variance anova data normality was examined using a shapiro wilk test with spss 22 0 ibm usa before analysis a nonparametric sign test was used to compare m z of protein like and peptide like substances identified from uplc q tof ms the spearman s correlation analyses were applied to explore the relationships between different variables 3 results 3 1 aom decays during 28 days of microbial degradation we found large decreases in the aom across the three sources despite similar decay kinetics fig s3 doc decay coefficients were a mean se of 0 34 0 01 day 1 for aom m 0 36 0 01 day 1 for aom n and 0 39 0 01 day 1 for aom s respectively over the 28 day incubation n 3 however higher dom decay rates were observed in the first five days after the start of the incubation the doc concentration declined from 15 0 mg c l on day 0 to 5 60 0 10 mg c l for aom m 5 00 0 40 mg c l for aom n and 3 88 0 21 mg c l for aom s after 28 days 64 3 0 6 of the aom m 66 7 2 7 of the aom n and 74 1 1 4 of the aom s was degraded based on the doc concentrations at the end of bio incubation the percentage of dom degraded was similar regardless of the aom sources fig s3 anova f 0 18 p 0 1 3 2 changes in dom composition based on the spectrum analysis the fluorescent components with the large abundances were identified from the fluorescence spectra including the humic like component peak a the fulvic like component peak c and protein like component peaks s t d and b figs s4 and 1a after 28 days of incubations the fluorescence signal intensity declined for almost all the components identified by 3d eems although magnitudes of the declines varied among components based on the first order kinetic model we estimated the decay rates for different aom components fig s5 unsurprisingly the protein like components such as peaks s t d and b were more sensitive to the microbial degradations with an average decay coefficient of 0 22 0 74 day 1 across the three sources by contrast the decay coefficients for the humic like peak a and fulvic like component peak c were much lower with the values of 0 02 0 08 day 1 and 0 06 0 09 day 1 respectively table s2 and fig 1b due to the differences in decay rates the relative abundances of different dom components changed substantially during the microbial decompositions after 28 days of incubations up to 86 7 93 5 of the protein like substances were estimated to be degraded while humic like and fulvic like substances had persisted i e 4 2 14 0 and 1 8 11 5 losses respectively fig 1 consequently the relative abundances of protein like components had decreased from 1 1 to 35 0 for the three aom sources before incubation to 0 8 27 4 after the incubation anova f 4 30 p 0 01 by contrast the relative abundances of humic like and fulvic like substances increased in relative abundances from 4 2 to 25 4 to 19 3 32 0 and 1 8 47 4 to 12 4 52 3 by the end of the incubation respectively anova f 4 03 p 0 01 fig s6 dom quality indices further indicated that dom was being produced from bacterial sources e g microbial metabolites during degradation the fi for which increasing values indicate a smaller contribution of terrestrial relative to microbial sources to the dom pool suggested that dom from the phytoplankton production had undergone bacterial processing unlike raw river waters at the start of the incubation with a fi of only 1 8 fi values in the aom amended waters after 28 days were much higher 3 9 for aom m 5 8 for aom n and 2 8 for aom s fig s7a this result was further supported by the bix which was above 1 0 for all the groups after incubations and generally increased as compared to the initial value except aom s indicating an increasingly autochthonous origin of dom fig s7b despite the general declines of fluorescence signals associated with decays of aom fig 1a we found the intensified absorptions between 200 and 250 nm suggesting that the microbial activities also produced new compounds uv absorption between 200 and 250 nm unexpectedly rose after 28 days incubation particularly for aom m and aom n while absorption between 250 and 800 nm had decreased gradually over this period fig 2 based on the kinetic models absorption at 254 and 280 nm a254 and a280 decreased by 2 44 5 33 day 1 and 3 85 9 07 day 1 respectively fig s8 and table s2 however absorption at 210 nm a210 increased from only 0 49 0 66 before the incubation to 0 59 1 89 after 28 days fig s8 anova f 0 02 p 0 05 3 3 changes in molecular composition based on uplc q tof ms we further explored the changes in molecular compositions of dom including the numbers compound classes and m z values of molecules during the incubations figs 3 s9 and s10 because thiols have been well known to influence the mehg uptakes by phytoplankton lee and fisher 2017 skrobonja et al 2019 we focused on the change of sulfur containing compounds including chons and chos the molecules containing elements of c h o n and or s for the initial aom at the start of the incubation the numbers of chons formulae were 13 047 13 895 and 11 049 and numbers of chos formulae were 5620 5096 and 4920 in the aom m aom n and aom s treatments respectively as indicated in figs s9 and s10 however after 28 days incubation numbers of molecules increased in all the three aom amended groups for example the numbers of chons increased by 848 2512 and 3062 for aom m aom n and aom s treatments respectively indicating that microbial degradation of aom had made sulfur containing dom more complex fig s9 we further analyzed the peptides and protein like molecules that might contain thiols our results suggested that the numbers of peptide molecules in the degraded aom increased from 3202 2436 and 2901 in aom m aom n and aom s treatments at the beginning of the incubation to 3351 3445 and 3386 after 28 days incubation respectively fig 3 protein like compounds had displayed a similar trend fig 3 in terms of molecular compositions the changes were mainly associated with the formulae with low h c and o c ratio as found for the protein like compounds fig 3 in addition there were also substantial increases in the molecular sizes of the degraded dom for peptide like compounds the average m z value was similar among the treatments at 697 8 216 3 694 3 218 4 and 684 2 218 9 for aom m aom n and aom s before starting the incubation increasing to 704 1 241 8 702 0 215 1 and 698 7 214 9 afterwards respectively sign tests z 46 45 to 53 58 p 0 05 3 4 changes in bacterial communities and their relationship with dom changes in dom concentration and composition were driven by microbial activities so we analyzed the changes in bacterial communities during the incubation based on 16s rrna gene sequencing we found that for all incubations regardless of aom sources bacterial community became more diverse with a longer incubation time as shown with the increasing values of the α diversity indices including chao1 shannon and simpson indices table s3 for example the shannon index had increased from only 1 40 1 77 on day 1 to 3 22 3 71 on day 14 and then stabilized fig s11 dom and bacterial community compositions had also interacted for instance actinobacteria increased in the relative abundance increasing from 0 4 0 7 to 11 4 42 3 by the end of the incubation fig s12 and table s4 the specie is related with humic substances li et al 2014b bai et al 2017 correspondingly some bacterial families were strongly associated with the changes in aom as determined using the spearman correlations fig s13 for example positive correlations between the change in proportions of peaks a and c and bacterial abundance indicated that microbial degradation had made the dom more humic like there were also changes in microbial functional genes in incubations fig s14 for example we found that the abundances of genes associated with the dark oxidation of sulfur compounds increasing with incubation time which indicated that protein like components were being transformed fig s15 3 5 impacts of degraded aom on mehg uptake by phytoplankton we found evidence that aom amendment prevented mehg uptake by microcystis elabens figs 4 and s16 after 240 mins exposure to mehg treatments without aom amendments had the higher mehg concentrations in algal cells 0 55 0 00 amol cell as compared to the treatments amended with non biodegraded aom m 0 41 0 01 amol cell aom n 0 47 0 00 amol cell and aom s 0 48 0 01 amol cell anova f 2 99 p 0 05 regardless of sources mehg uptake by phytoplankton first decreased and then increased among 28 days figs 4a 4c aom that was degraded for a longer period more strongly inhibited the mehg uptake by phytoplankton for instance after 240 mins of exposures to mehg in the presence of aom m that was degraded for 28 days only 42 7 60 6 of mehg in waters was accumulated by microcystis elabens at a doc concentration level of 5 mg c l this value was much lower than the 67 3 78 7 mehg uptake in the presence of aom m which had not been degraded at the same doc concentration level mehg concentration in algal cells exposed to mehg with the degraded aom m was 0 26 0 01 amol cell which was nearly only half the concentration found in the cells within the initial aom m treatments fig 4d anova f 3 63 p 0 01 mehg uptake was similarly reduced when the algal cells were exposed to other aom treatment fig 4 mehg uptake could be affected by characteristics of dom we found that mehg uptake by microcystis elabens was negatively correlated with the absorbance at 210 nm and fi for which the increasing values of both measures implied greater microbial activity fig 5 other characteristics of dom were not associated with mehg uptakes by microcystis elabens as shown in fig s17 4 discussion mehg uptake by phytoplankton is believed to be negatively related to dom concentrations in the waters tsui and finlay 2011 luengen et al 2012 ogorek et al 2021 rapid decay of aom is therefore assumed to enhance the mehg accumulation in aquatic food webs however here we found that the losses of dom did not enhance the mehg uptake by phytoplankton our study instead suggest that the microbial derived metabolites can inhibit mehg uptakes figs 4 and 5 inoculated bacteria introduced new components into the dom pool during our incubations characterize microbial activities aromaticity and protein components huang et al 2016 brezinski and gorczyca 2019 as evidenced by the changes in absorbances at 210 nm figs 2 and s8c and increased numbers of chons and chos compounds after 28 days of biodegradation figs s9 and s10 using mass spectrometry we found the microbial release of sulfur containing compound in inhibiting mehg uptake by microcystis elabens reactivity of dom is largely perceived as an intrinsic property of its molecular composition freeman et al 2022 hu et al 2022 compared to the dom from terrestrial source aom is more labile and bioavailable to microorganisms leclerc et al 2015 bouchet et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 catalán et al 2021 as indicated by the 3d eems most of the aom in our study consisted of the protein like substances occupying 74 to 94 of the total fluorescence intensity across our three aom sources fig s5 these components usually have rich thiols and other functional groups e g cysteine glutathione that have strong binding affinities with dissolved mehg in water lee and fisher 2017 skrobonja et al 2019 the observation has always been applied to explain the negative relationship between mehg uptake by phytoplankton and doc concentration lee and fisher 2017 bouchet et al 2018 li et al 2022a and here we shine a molecular light onto understanding this observation protein like components especially could be more easily and rapidly degraded by the microorganisms brailsford et al 2020 our results support this interpretation as we found that decay rates of protein like substances sum of peaks s t d and b were many times higher than for the humic and fulvic like substances fig 1 brailsford et al al 2019 similarly reported that amino acids had much faster microbial uptake kinetics and rate of decay than the other compounds types in particular the s containing amino acids cysteine and methionine could be rapidly depleted in mesotrophic and oligotrophic waters by microorganisms with a halving time of 1 h brailsford et al 2020 lian et al al 2021 also found that proteins and amino acid like substances in the dom that derived from thalassiosira pseudonana can be rapidly degraded within five days rapid decay of protein like components indicates that the thiols and some other functional groups e g cysteine glutathione in proteins strongly complexed with mehg can also be consumed or converted to other compounds the loss of these compounds may reduce bonding strengths between mehg and ligands at the early stages fig 4 for example skrobonja et al 2019 had reported that the thermodynamically less stable complexes formed by mehg and ligands in water led to a higher cellular uptake rate for algae cells in contrast to rapid declines of protein like components during the incubation mehg uptake by phytoplankton did not change monotonically with the time aom that was degraded for a longer time after 28 days biodegradation could better inhibit mehg uptake by phytoplankton fig 4 s containing compounds have been studied as a way to inhibit the mehg uptake by phytoplankton lee and fisher 2017 skrobonja et al 2019 and our results showed that thiol containing peptide and protein like compounds produced by microbial activities from aom might be a source of this potential relative to stability constants of oh log k 4 5 and cl log k 5 3 mason et al 1996 miles et al 2001 kim et al 2014 lee and fisher 2017 mehg is believed to form a stronger and more stable complex with the thiols lee and fisher 2017 skrobonja et al 2019 sulfur containing compounds derived from microbial activities could be produced through two major pathways choudhury et al 2014 moran and durham 2019 the first is the metabolism of dissolved organic sulfur dos contained in aom moran and durham 2019 reported that after incorporating dos compound into biosynthetic pathway bacteria could release these compounds back into the environments in the reduced forms such as cysteine glutathione and methionine wirth et al 2020 wu et al 2021 these reduced sulfur compounds could individually occur at concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 ng ml kido soule et al 2015 johnson et al 2017 second the microorganisms could produce metabolites including antimicrobial peptides to gain the advantages competition under the nutrient limited conditions choudhury et al 2014 ortega and van der donk 2016 romano et al 2018 such as in later stages of our bio incubation where doc concentration was reduced by over 60 fig s3 consistent with this interpretation the functional genes that were responsible for the membrane translocation of antimicrobial peptides were more abundant later in the bio incubations fig s15b together our results indicate that microbial metabolites especially the thiol containing compounds produced during aom degradations could limit mehg availabilities in freshwaters hur 2011 xu et al 2018 lian et al 2021 chen et al 2022 5 conclusion our study has identified new and important roles of microbial metabolites produced during aom incubations in aquatic hg cycling that have rarely been emphasized algal blooms are a frequent occurrence in many inland waters globally glibert 2017 wang et al 2021 so there is an emerging need to pay attention to how aom degradation as a dom source influences the mehg uptake by phytoplankton previous studies report a negative association between aom concentration and mehg uptake by plankton but without understanding underlying mechanisms and influences of biodegradation our study reveals that rapid microbial degradations of dom can help limit mehg uptake by phytoplankton thus the potential role of microbes in degrading aom and changing the uptakes of mehg by phytoplankton should now be incorporated into the future risk assessments of aquatic hg cycling declaration of competing

14617,the eu bathing water directive bwd requires member states to assess bathing water quality according to the levels of faecal indicator bacteria fib in designated bathing areas however this criterion has two significant limitations given that the bwd does not i account for differences in hydrodynamic properties of bathing waters and ii assumes that all faecal pathogens decay equally in aquatic environments this study simulated sewage discharge events in three hypothetical aquatic environments characterised by different advection and dispersion parameters in the solute transport equation temporal changes in the downstream concentration of six faecal indicators were determined in simulations that utilised measured decay rates of each faecal indicator from a programme of controlled microcosm experiments in fresh and seawater environments the results showed that the decay rates of faecal indicators are not a critical parameter in advection dominant water bodies such as in fast flowing rivers therefore faecal indicator selection is less important in such systems and for these fib remains the most cost effective faecal indicator to monitor the public health impacts of faecal contamination in contrast consideration of faecal indicator decay is important when assessing dispersion and advection dispersion dominant systems which would pertain to transitional estuarine and coastal waterbodies results suggest that the inclusion of viral indicators such as crassphage and pmmov could improve the reliability of water quality modelling and minimise the risk of waterborne illnesses from faecal contamination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bathing water directive decay rate advection and dispersion crassphage pmmov faecal indicator bacteria data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bathing water quality in the european union eu is governed by the eu bathing water directive 2006 which classifies coastal and inland bathing waters as excellent good sufficient and poor these classifications are based on the 95th and 90th percentiles of the concentrations of two faecal indicator bacteria fib escherichia coli e coli and intestinal enterococci over a four year period eu 2006 the levels of these two fib are correlated to the risk of contracting a gastrointestinal and respiratory disease wade et al 2003 wade et al 2006 in the context of recreational bathing waters the presence of human specific enteric pathogens in particular human enteric viruses is of particular concern regarding the risks of gastrointestinal illnesses kay et al 1994 fleisher et al 1996 although the implementation of this eu directive has improved bathing water quality in the eu world health organisation 2007 significant shortcomings need to be addressed to update these regulatory standards in line with epidemiology for example the bathing water directive does not consider the biological source of faecal contamination which impacts the risk of gastrointestinal and respiratory disease soller et al 2010 soller et al 2014 this study addresses two major limitations which result from the use of just two types of faecal indicator bacteria as a proxy for faecally derived pathogens in the aquatic environment these are the assumptions that i all bathing waters have the same hydrodynamic properties and ii that all faecally derived pathogens decay at the same rate in aquatic environments although the eu bathing water directive differentiates between inland and coastal bathing waters the hydrodynamic characteristics of the waterbody are not considered rivers lakes and coastal waters being undifferentiated in this regard this is a potentially important issue in that the physical transport parameters of a waterbody which are governed by advection and dispersion are important to assess the transport and fate of pathogenic organisms numerical models and frameworks have been developed to simulate the transport and fate of sewage associated microorganisms in both fluvial and coastal systems pascual benito et al 2020 jalliffier verne et al 2016 scroccaro et al 2010 bedri et al 2015 and these models provide understanding of the environmental dynamics of infectious agents several studies have shown that the decay rate of pathogens may be significantly different from those of e coli and intestinal enterococci greaves et al 2020 furthermore recent studies have shown conflicting results with regard to the quantifiable relationships between fib and the presence of viral and protozoan waterborne pathogens such as cryptosporidium cabelli et al 1982 wu et al 2011 lalancette et al 2014 therefore if fib is not detected in a bathing water it does not necessarily imply that faecally derived pathogens are not present in recent years several alternative faecal indicators or human associated microbial source tracking mst markers have been proposed that may be more suitable as a proxy for viral pathogens these include somatic coliphages f rna bacteriophages moce llivina et al 2005 havelaar 1991 the bacteroidales associated human faecal marker hf183 seurinck et al 2005 green et al 2014 boehm and soller 2020 the pepper mild mottle virus pmmov rosario et al 2009 and crassphage stachler et al 2017 dutilh et al 2014 this study aims to examine whether e coli and intestinal enterococci are appropriate proxies for the presence of pathogens in the aquatic environment we determined the decay rates of ten alternative faecal indicators and used these decay rates in hypothetical hydrodynamic models of waterbodies characterised by different advection and dispersion parameters we show that decay rates of faecal indicators are not a critical parameter in advection dominant water bodies and hence the use of e coli and intestinal enterococci as fib is appropriate however in dispersion dominant systems consideration of the decay rate of potential faecal indicators is critical to assess the impact of faecal contamination on public health 2 materials and methods 2 1 viral stocks e coli strain atcc 700 078 and salmonella typhimurium strain wg49 nctc 12 484 were used for phix174

considered for the simulation of sewage discharges into different water bodies the first was an advection dominant water system with u 0 2 m s and d 5 m 2 s to reflect a typical river system the second was an advection dispersion dominant system with u 0 05 m s and d 50 m 2 s characteristic of an estuarine or coastal system and the third was a dispersion dominant water system with u 0 001 m s and d 1 m 2 s typical of a freshwater lake to determine the impact of the hydrodynamic properties on the spatial concentration of faecal indicators in the different water systems six faecal indicators reflecting a variety of decay rates were selected for analytical modelling indicators included e coli intestinal enterococci crassphage pmmov hf183 and somatic coliphages and all were simulated in a hypothetical sewage spill of 2 h duration over a 10 km distance for 200 h the initial concentrations table s4 of the simulated indicators and molecular markers at the point of spill were the calculated means determined from untreated influent sewage samples n 10 taken from the ringsend wwtp the decay rates for each indicator determined from the microcosm experiments section 2 2 were used in these simulations 2 7 data analysis data were analysed and plotted using graphpad prism9 graphpad software usa decay rates for culturable microorganisms and molecular markers in freshwater and seawater were calculated assuming the first order exponential model chick 1908 defined by the equations 5 n t n 0 e k t 6 ln n t n 0 kt where nt and n0 are the concentrations of the viable microorganism or the molecular marker in the microcosm at time t and time 0 respectively and k is the decay rate a linear and a biphasic decay model was determined for each indicator using segmented pairwise regression a break point between segments was identified and decay rate constants k1 and k2 were calculated for each of the two segments the best fit model was determined by comparing the linear and biphasic decay models using the akaike information criteria aic r2 rmse and wald wolfowitz runs test supplemental material the time required to reduce the concentration by 1 log10 unit t90 and 2 log10 units t99 was determined as follows 7 t 90 ln 0 1 k 8 t 99 ln 0 01 k 3 results 3 1 decay of culturable faecal indicator bacteria and their associated marker genes in fresh and seawater to compare the decay rates of different faecal indicators in freshwater and seawater we first determined the culturable and molecular bacterial indicator decay rates of fib included in the bathing water directive 2006 in a microcosm system fig 1 the decay profile of culturable e coli was biphasic in all microcosm experiments with the exception of the seawater microcosm at 18 c table 1 2 for both freshwater and seawater at the lower temperature 4 c e coli remained stable for five days and seven days respectively after which decay rates for the two waters became similar k 0 45 days 1 t90 5 1 k 0 49 days 1 t90 4 7 days respectively e coli in freshwater at 20 2 c exhibited a rapid decay in the first phase k 0 43 days 1 t90 5 2 days followed by a slower decay in the second phase k 0 24 days 1 t90 9 3 days the highest decay rate was observed in seawater at 18 c k 1 10 days 1 t90 2 1 days in contrast to culturable e coli the decay profile of the e coli 16s rrna gene was linear for all experimental conditions except for seawater at 18 c table 1 2 under these conditions the gene marker decayed rapidly in the first phase k 0 65 days 1 t90 3 5 days and remained stable for the remaining 13 days of the experiment in contrast the e coli gene marker was more stable in freshwater at 18 c t90 9 3 days at 4 c the decay rates of the e coli gene marker were comparable in freshwater and seawater k 0 21 0 23 t90 9 9 10 7 days similar to culturable e coli intestinal enterococci were characterised by a biphasic decay profile in three out of four conditions however the two faecal indicators showed different decay profiles fig 1a c fig s1a c the intestinal enterococci decay was higher t90 3 9 days than that for e coli t90 5 2 days in freshwater at 18 c whereas intestinal enterococci were more stable in seawater at 18 c t90 4 5 days than e coli t90 2 1 days at 4 c intestinal enterococci remained reasonably stable in freshwater and seawater for the first 10 days but from this time levels decayed more rapidly in freshwater than in seawater t90 22 9 and 26 3 days respectively similarly the enterococcus faecalis gene marker remained constant for the duration of the experiment at 4 c however and somewhat surprisingly the decay rate of this gene in freshwater at 18 c was 2 fold higher than in seawater k 0 21 days 1 t90 11 days and k 0 10 days 1 t90 22 2 days respectively 3 2 decay of infectious bacteriophages and their associated marker gene in fresh and seawater somatic coliphages and f specific rna bacteriophages are abundant in human faeces and have been suggested as indicators of human viral pathogens of faecal origin balleste et al 2021 jebri et al 2017 somatic coliphages followed a biphasic decay profile in freshwater and seawater at 18 c which remained stable for four days however from this time decay was similar in both microcosms k2 0 28 and 0 25 days 1 for freshwater and seawater unlike the decay of bacterial indicators at 4 c somatic coliphages remained stable in all treatments for the duration of the experiment at this temperature fig 2 a both f rna bacteriophages and the ms2 rna markers followed a linear decay model table 1 2 interestingly the two infectious bacteriophages decayed at very different rates f rna bacteriophages decaying more rapidly than somatic coliphages under all conditions most notably in freshwater at 18 c at 4 c f rna decay rates were similar in both fresh and seawaters k 0 12 and 0 25 days 1 a similar decay profile was observed for the ms2 marker which was stable for the duration of the experiment 30 days furthermore at 18 c the f rna decay rate was 1 8 fold higher in freshwater k 0 97 days 1 t90 2 4 days than in seawater k 0 55 days 1 t90 4 2 days in contrast the decay rates for ms2 rna were similar at 4 c with t90 values of 12 2 and 12 4 days respectively being determined in freshwater and seawater 3 3 decay of human sewage associated molecular marker genes in fresh and seawater we evaluated the decay rate of the crassphage pmmov and hf183 which are used as human source tracking markers fig 2d e f table 1 2 the hf183 marker decayed more rapidly at 18 c in freshwater k 0 71 days 1 t90 3 3 days than in seawater k 0 50 days 1 t90 4 6 days at 4 c the hf183 marker remained stable for 11 days in seawater before it began to decay the crassphage marker was more persistent than the hf183 marker under all conditions for example at 18 c under both conditions the t90 values for crassphage were around three times higher than that of hf183 table 2 however similar to the hf183 marker crassphage levels decreased 1 7 fold faster in freshwater k 0 22 days 1 t90 10 4 days than in seawater at 18 c k 0 14 days 1 t90 17 2 days moreover the crassphage marker remained stable in freshwater at 4 c for the duration of the experiment in comparison to all other indicators the viral pmmov rna marker was the only indicator to remain stable under all tested conditions for the entire experiment 30 days and therefore no decay parameters were determined for this marker 3 4 sewage overflow event simulation in different water systems as described in section 2 6 six of 10 in table 2 faecal indicators were simulated in a hypothetical sewage spill of 2 h duration over a 10 km distance for 200 h data for three indicators a faecal bacterial species e coli a phage crassphage and a virus pmmov are shown in fig 3 data for intestinal enterococci somatic coliphages and the human marker hf183 exhibited similar trends and are shown in fig s3 in the simulation of the advection dominant river system fig 3 a d and g the sewage spill was shown to have minimal impact over time on the downstream water quality but the peak concentrations further downstream were shown to be significantly higher than for both the advection dispersion dominant estuarine coastal fig 3 b e and h and dispersion dominant lake systems fig 3 c f and i all indicators displayed a sharp rise and fall over a relatively short period of time fig 4 a the rate of decay had only a limited impact on the downstream indicator concentrations as the t90 and t99 values were shown to be greater than the time it took for the indicators to be distributed over the 10 km model length in contrast the downstream concentration was impacted for a much longer period in the estuarine coastal system but with a lower peak concentration compared to the river system the decrease in concentration was observed over a considerably longer time period in the estuarine coastal and lake systems than the river system fig 4 furthermore the concentration of indicators with higher decay rates such as e coli intestinal enterococci and hf183 were shown to decrease more rapidly than the stable indicators such as somatic coliphages and pmmov fig 4 b c in the estuarine coastal and lake systems in the lake system none of the faecal indicators travelled further than 7 km from the point of discharge over the 200 hour simulation period fig 3 c f and i the stable indicators such as somatic coliphages fig s3 i and pmmov fig 3 i were shown to continue spreading to further downstream cross sections after the 200 hour period and until the concentration stabilised while indicators with higher decay rates such as e coli fig 3 c intestinal enterococci fig s3 c and hf183 fig s3 f were shown to not impact the further downstream cross sections since at the end of the 200 hour simulation the areal extent of the simulated domain being impacted was already diminishing 4 discussion the use of fib to assess bathing water quality and the accompanying risk of contracting gastrointestinal and or respiratory disease as required by the eu bathing water directive 2006 has led to a significant increase in bathing water quality throughout the european union world health organisation 2007 however the eu bathing water directive does not consider the hydrodynamic properties of a given waterbody nor does it consider the decay rates of faecal indicators in the aquatic environment a systematic review of decay rates of mammalian viruses of public health concern in aquatic environments including norovirus rotavirus and enterovirus reported k values that are considerably smaller than those of e coli and intestinal enterococci the authors of this review conclude that fib may therefore have limited use in assessing the risks to public health by mammalian enteric viruses introduced by faecal contamination boehm et al 2019 our study considered whether the two fib in the bathing water directive e coli and intestinal enterococci are sufficient in different waterbodies with differing hydrodynamic properties to fully assess public health risks associated with faecal contamination with e coli and intestinal enterococci we determined decay rates from experimental microcosms of four additional faecal indicators in hypothetical simulations of river estuarine coastal and lake systems to identify the appropriate faecal indicators with some not currently included in the bathing water directive to adequately reflect the public health risks associated with waterborne pathogens the model simulation results show that the decay rate of each indicator had a minimal impact on the concentration levels of faecal indicators in advection dominant river systems all faecal indicators showed a similarly sharp rise and fall in concentration and were below the detection limit within six hours the rate at which the marker concentration increased and decreased in the simulated domain was substantially higher than the corresponding measured decay rates in this study this means that the transport profiles of mammalian viruses of public health concern with low k values e g norovirus rotavirus or enterovirus under these conditions is highly similar to those of fib which have a greater k value boehm et al 2019 therefore the choice of a particular faecal indicator is not critical in advection dominant river systems systems and in these fib remain the most cost effective indicators to assess public health risks associated with faecal contamination however of the approximately 22 000 designated bathing waters across the eu 6 are river systems the vast majority over 85 of eu designated bathing areas are coastal with the remainder comprising the non river inland waterbodies european environment agency 2021 in less dynamic waterbodies that include estuarine coastal water bodies and lakes faecal indicator selection is critical in assessing faecal pollution dispersion rather than advection is the primary driver of contaminant transport in these settings in advection dispersion estuarine coastal settings and dispersion lake settings simulations the faecal indicators were observed in the model domain for longer time periods as the water movement is slower than in the advection driven model the lake simulation showed that the faecal indicators remained detectable within seven km of the discharge point over a 200 hr simulation period suggesting that water quality remains compromised for a longer period of time than that for the estuarine coastal and river systems that were simulated furthermore after 4 5 days in an estuarine coastal system the levels of intestinal enterococci are shown to decrease below the no observed adverse effect levels noaels of less than 40 cfu 100 ml who 2003 the noael applies to healthy adult bathers exposed to marine water and does not consider other activities nor individuals with a lower immunity such as children the elderly or immunocompromised persons the simulation shows that when intestinal enterococci levels fall below the noael other indicators with k values similar to some human viral pathogens are still present at substantial levels indicating that a risk to public health may remain overall the indicator specific decay rates were shown to have greater impacts on reductions in faecal indicator concentrations in scenarios where the t90 values were lower than the rate of dispersal it should also be noted that the observed t90 values for fib are comparable to other studies ranging from 1 52 to 6 19 days and 1 15 to 5 46 days for culturable e coli and intestinal enterococci respectively balleste et al 2018 ahmed et al 2021 have reported a biphasic decay profile for culturable e coli under similar conditions as reported here in both the freshwater and seawater simulations the bacteriophage markers were shown to persist for longer periods than the culturable and molecular bacterial indicators therefore these markers are arguably more suitable as a proxy for viral pathogens because as previously indicated those viral pathogens have k values that are considerably smaller than those of bacterial indicators somatic coliphage and f rna phage plaque assays are valuable as they measure the level of infectious particles in the water however as is the case for e coli and intestinal enterococci culturable bacteriophages and the ms2 marker are not exclusively associated with human contamination the crassphage and pmmov markers are more representative of human viral pathogens in water quality analysis as they have been shown to be correlated to the presence of human specific gastrointestinal viruses in the aquatic environment jennings et al 2020 gonzalez fernandez et al 2021 moreover crank et al 2019 demonstrated a relationship between observed pmmov and crassphage concentrations and the probability of bather illness in sewage polluted waters pmmov and crassphage markers are also highly abundant in sewage kato et al 2018 wu et al 2020 crank et al 2020 with no seasonal fluctuations reported in addition studies have shown a good correlation between the crassphage marker and other faecal indicators such as fib hf183 and somatic coliphages ahmed et al 2020 balleste et al 2019 sala comorera et al 2021 furthermore the k values observed for crassphage are within the range observed in other studies for example ahmed et al 2021 other studies have reported a higher persistence for pmmov under similar conditions greaves et al 2020 in comparison to other stable indicators i e somatic coliphages the pmmov was detectable for the longest time period because of its high sewage content and low decay rate it is therefore a suitable indicator in situations where a stable marker is required to monitor long term spatial trends of a sewage spill because the decrease in pmmov levels is due to the dispersal rate rather than its decay rate monitoring human pathogens in the environment remains challenging adopting a more conservative approach by selecting a viral marker with a higher decay rate and higher concentration could improve the reliability of water quality monitoring in estuarine coastal waterbodies and lakes our results confirm that choosing the most appropriate faecal indicator markers is dependent on the type of water body and the nature of the spill the study results point toward the increased level of public health protection that could be realised by using site specific risk control measures for different recreational water bodies depending on the resources available to responsible authorities regulatory agencies and policymakers 5 conclusions this study investigated whether the two fib that underpin the current implementation of the eu bathing water directive namely e coli and intestinal enterococci are sufficient for assessing the public health risks associated with faecal contamination in bathing waters the model simulation results demonstrated that decay rates of faecal indicators are not a critical parameter in advection dominant water bodies as the faecal indicators will be below the limit of detection before the viability or integrity of their genetic material is lost therefore the choice of e coli and intestinal enterococci as fib are appropriate however in dispersion and advection dispersion dominant systems which includes the vast majority of eu bathing waters the consideration of the decay rates of potential faecal indicators is critical to assess the impact of faecal contamination on public health therefore more consideration should be given to marker selection when modelling waterbodies such as coastal beaches and estuaries inclusion of stable viral markers such as crassphage and pmmov will improve the reliability of water quality modelling and minimise the risk of waterborne illnesses from faecal contamination funding sources this research acclimatize was part funded by the

14617,the eu bathing water directive bwd requires member states to assess bathing water quality according to the levels of faecal indicator bacteria fib in designated bathing areas however this criterion has two significant limitations given that the bwd does not i account for differences in hydrodynamic properties of bathing waters and ii assumes that all faecal pathogens decay equally in aquatic environments this study simulated sewage discharge events in three hypothetical aquatic environments characterised by different advection and dispersion parameters in the solute transport equation temporal changes in the downstream concentration of six faecal indicators were determined in simulations that utilised measured decay rates of each faecal indicator from a programme of controlled microcosm experiments in fresh and seawater environments the results showed that the decay rates of faecal indicators are not a critical parameter in advection dominant water bodies such as in fast flowing rivers therefore faecal indicator selection is less important in such systems and for these fib remains the most cost effective faecal indicator to monitor the public health impacts of faecal contamination in contrast consideration of faecal indicator decay is important when assessing dispersion and advection dispersion dominant systems which would pertain to transitional estuarine and coastal waterbodies results suggest that the inclusion of viral indicators such as crassphage and pmmov could improve the reliability of water quality modelling and minimise the risk of waterborne illnesses from faecal contamination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bathing water directive decay rate advection and dispersion crassphage pmmov faecal indicator bacteria data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bathing water quality in the european union eu is governed by the eu bathing water directive 2006 which classifies coastal and inland bathing waters as excellent good sufficient and poor these classifications are based on the 95th and 90th percentiles of the concentrations of two faecal indicator bacteria fib escherichia coli e coli and intestinal enterococci over a four year period eu 2006 the levels of these two fib are correlated to the risk of contracting a gastrointestinal and respiratory disease wade et al 2003 wade et al 2006 in the context of recreational bathing waters the presence of human specific enteric pathogens in particular human enteric viruses is of particular concern regarding the risks of gastrointestinal illnesses kay et al 1994 fleisher et al 1996 although the implementation of this eu directive has improved bathing water quality in the eu world health organisation 2007 significant shortcomings need to be addressed to update these regulatory standards in line with epidemiology for example the bathing water directive does not consider the biological source of faecal contamination which impacts the risk of gastrointestinal and respiratory disease soller et al 2010 soller et al 2014 this study addresses two major limitations which result from the use of just two types of faecal indicator bacteria as a proxy for faecally derived pathogens in the aquatic environment these are the assumptions that i all bathing waters have the same hydrodynamic properties and ii that all faecally derived pathogens decay at the same rate in aquatic environments although the eu bathing water directive differentiates between inland and coastal bathing waters the hydrodynamic characteristics of the waterbody are not considered rivers lakes and coastal waters being undifferentiated in this regard this is a potentially important issue in that the physical transport parameters of a waterbody which are governed by advection and dispersion are important to assess the transport and fate of pathogenic organisms numerical models and frameworks have been developed to simulate the transport and fate of sewage associated microorganisms in both fluvial and coastal systems pascual benito et al 2020 jalliffier verne et al 2016 scroccaro et al 2010 bedri et al 2015 and these models provide understanding of the environmental dynamics of infectious agents several studies have shown that the decay rate of pathogens may be significantly different from those of e coli and intestinal enterococci greaves et al 2020 furthermore recent studies have shown conflicting results with regard to the quantifiable relationships between fib and the presence of viral and protozoan waterborne pathogens such as cryptosporidium cabelli et al 1982 wu et al 2011 lalancette et al 2014 therefore if fib is not detected in a bathing water it does not necessarily imply that faecally derived pathogens are not present in recent years several alternative faecal indicators or human associated microbial source tracking mst markers have been proposed that may be more suitable as a proxy for viral pathogens these include somatic coliphages f rna bacteriophages moce llivina et al 2005 havelaar 1991 the bacteroidales associated human faecal marker hf183 seurinck et al 2005 green et al 2014 boehm and soller 2020 the pepper mild mottle virus pmmov rosario et al 2009 and crassphage stachler et al 2017 dutilh et al 2014 this study aims to examine whether e coli and intestinal enterococci are appropriate proxies for the presence of pathogens in the aquatic environment we determined the decay rates of ten alternative faecal indicators and used these decay rates in hypothetical hydrodynamic models of waterbodies characterised by different advection and dispersion parameters we show that decay rates of faecal indicators are not a critical parameter in advection dominant water bodies and hence the use of e coli and intestinal enterococci as fib is appropriate however in dispersion dominant systems consideration of the decay rate of potential faecal indicators is critical to assess the impact of faecal contamination on public health 2 materials and methods 2 1 viral stocks e coli strain atcc 700 078 and salmonella typhimurium strain wg49 nctc 12 484 were used for phix174

considered for the simulation of sewage discharges into different water bodies the first was an advection dominant water system with u 0 2 m s and d 5 m 2 s to reflect a typical river system the second was an advection dispersion dominant system with u 0 05 m s and d 50 m 2 s characteristic of an estuarine or coastal system and the third was a dispersion dominant water system with u 0 001 m s and d 1 m 2 s typical of a freshwater lake to determine the impact of the hydrodynamic properties on the spatial concentration of faecal indicators in the different water systems six faecal indicators reflecting a variety of decay rates were selected for analytical modelling indicators included e coli intestinal enterococci crassphage pmmov hf183 and somatic coliphages and all were simulated in a hypothetical sewage spill of 2 h duration over a 10 km distance for 200 h the initial concentrations table s4 of the simulated indicators and molecular markers at the point of spill were the calculated means determined from untreated influent sewage samples n 10 taken from the ringsend wwtp the decay rates for each indicator determined from the microcosm experiments section 2 2 were used in these simulations 2 7 data analysis data were analysed and plotted using graphpad prism9 graphpad software usa decay rates for culturable microorganisms and molecular markers in freshwater and seawater were calculated assuming the first order exponential model chick 1908 defined by the equations 5 n t n 0 e k t 6 ln n t n 0 kt where nt and n0 are the concentrations of the viable microorganism or the molecular marker in the microcosm at time t and time 0 respectively and k is the decay rate a linear and a biphasic decay model was determined for each indicator using segmented pairwise regression a break point between segments was identified and decay rate constants k1 and k2 were calculated for each of the two segments the best fit model was determined by comparing the linear and biphasic decay models using the akaike information criteria aic r2 rmse and wald wolfowitz runs test supplemental material the time required to reduce the concentration by 1 log10 unit t90 and 2 log10 units t99 was determined as follows 7 t 90 ln 0 1 k 8 t 99 ln 0 01 k 3 results 3 1 decay of culturable faecal indicator bacteria and their associated marker genes in fresh and seawater to compare the decay rates of different faecal indicators in freshwater and seawater we first determined the culturable and molecular bacterial indicator decay rates of fib included in the bathing water directive 2006 in a microcosm system fig 1 the decay profile of culturable e coli was biphasic in all microcosm experiments with the exception of the seawater microcosm at 18 c table 1 2 for both freshwater and seawater at the lower temperature 4 c e coli remained stable for five days and seven days respectively after which decay rates for the two waters became similar k 0 45 days 1 t90 5 1 k 0 49 days 1 t90 4 7 days respectively e coli in freshwater at 20 2 c exhibited a rapid decay in the first phase k 0 43 days 1 t90 5 2 days followed by a slower decay in the second phase k 0 24 days 1 t90 9 3 days the highest decay rate was observed in seawater at 18 c k 1 10 days 1 t90 2 1 days in contrast to culturable e coli the decay profile of the e coli 16s rrna gene was linear for all experimental conditions except for seawater at 18 c table 1 2 under these conditions the gene marker decayed rapidly in the first phase k 0 65 days 1 t90 3 5 days and remained stable for the remaining 13 days of the experiment in contrast the e coli gene marker was more stable in freshwater at 18 c t90 9 3 days at 4 c the decay rates of the e coli gene marker were comparable in freshwater and seawater k 0 21 0 23 t90 9 9 10 7 days similar to culturable e coli intestinal enterococci were characterised by a biphasic decay profile in three out of four conditions however the two faecal indicators showed different decay profiles fig 1a c fig s1a c the intestinal enterococci decay was higher t90 3 9 days than that for e coli t90 5 2 days in freshwater at 18 c whereas intestinal enterococci were more stable in seawater at 18 c t90 4 5 days than e coli t90 2 1 days at 4 c intestinal enterococci remained reasonably stable in freshwater and seawater for the first 10 days but from this time levels decayed more rapidly in freshwater than in seawater t90 22 9 and 26 3 days respectively similarly the enterococcus faecalis gene marker remained constant for the duration of the experiment at 4 c however and somewhat surprisingly the decay rate of this gene in freshwater at 18 c was 2 fold higher than in seawater k 0 21 days 1 t90 11 days and k 0 10 days 1 t90 22 2 days respectively 3 2 decay of infectious bacteriophages and their associated marker gene in fresh and seawater somatic coliphages and f specific rna bacteriophages are abundant in human faeces and have been suggested as indicators of human viral pathogens of faecal origin balleste et al 2021 jebri et al 2017 somatic coliphages followed a biphasic decay profile in freshwater and seawater at 18 c which remained stable for four days however from this time decay was similar in both microcosms k2 0 28 and 0 25 days 1 for freshwater and seawater unlike the decay of bacterial indicators at 4 c somatic coliphages remained stable in all treatments for the duration of the experiment at this temperature fig 2 a both f rna bacteriophages and the ms2 rna markers followed a linear decay model table 1 2 interestingly the two infectious bacteriophages decayed at very different rates f rna bacteriophages decaying more rapidly than somatic coliphages under all conditions most notably in freshwater at 18 c at 4 c f rna decay rates were similar in both fresh and seawaters k 0 12 and 0 25 days 1 a similar decay profile was observed for the ms2 marker which was stable for the duration of the experiment 30 days furthermore at 18 c the f rna decay rate was 1 8 fold higher in freshwater k 0 97 days 1 t90 2 4 days than in seawater k 0 55 days 1 t90 4 2 days in contrast the decay rates for ms2 rna were similar at 4 c with t90 values of 12 2 and 12 4 days respectively being determined in freshwater and seawater 3 3 decay of human sewage associated molecular marker genes in fresh and seawater we evaluated the decay rate of the crassphage pmmov and hf183 which are used as human source tracking markers fig 2d e f table 1 2 the hf183 marker decayed more rapidly at 18 c in freshwater k 0 71 days 1 t90 3 3 days than in seawater k 0 50 days 1 t90 4 6 days at 4 c the hf183 marker remained stable for 11 days in seawater before it began to decay the crassphage marker was more persistent than the hf183 marker under all conditions for example at 18 c under both conditions the t90 values for crassphage were around three times higher than that of hf183 table 2 however similar to the hf183 marker crassphage levels decreased 1 7 fold faster in freshwater k 0 22 days 1 t90 10 4 days than in seawater at 18 c k 0 14 days 1 t90 17 2 days moreover the crassphage marker remained stable in freshwater at 4 c for the duration of the experiment in comparison to all other indicators the viral pmmov rna marker was the only indicator to remain stable under all tested conditions for the entire experiment 30 days and therefore no decay parameters were determined for this marker 3 4 sewage overflow event simulation in different water systems as described in section 2 6 six of 10 in table 2 faecal indicators were simulated in a hypothetical sewage spill of 2 h duration over a 10 km distance for 200 h data for three indicators a faecal bacterial species e coli a phage crassphage and a virus pmmov are shown in fig 3 data for intestinal enterococci somatic coliphages and the human marker hf183 exhibited similar trends and are shown in fig s3 in the simulation of the advection dominant river system fig 3 a d and g the sewage spill was shown to have minimal impact over time on the downstream water quality but the peak concentrations further downstream were shown to be significantly higher than for both the advection dispersion dominant estuarine coastal fig 3 b e and h and dispersion dominant lake systems fig 3 c f and i all indicators displayed a sharp rise and fall over a relatively short period of time fig 4 a the rate of decay had only a limited impact on the downstream indicator concentrations as the t90 and t99 values were shown to be greater than the time it took for the indicators to be distributed over the 10 km model length in contrast the downstream concentration was impacted for a much longer period in the estuarine coastal system but with a lower peak concentration compared to the river system the decrease in concentration was observed over a considerably longer time period in the estuarine coastal and lake systems than the river system fig 4 furthermore the concentration of indicators with higher decay rates such as e coli intestinal enterococci and hf183 were shown to decrease more rapidly than the stable indicators such as somatic coliphages and pmmov fig 4 b c in the estuarine coastal and lake systems in the lake system none of the faecal indicators travelled further than 7 km from the point of discharge over the 200 hour simulation period fig 3 c f and i the stable indicators such as somatic coliphages fig s3 i and pmmov fig 3 i were shown to continue spreading to further downstream cross sections after the 200 hour period and until the concentration stabilised while indicators with higher decay rates such as e coli fig 3 c intestinal enterococci fig s3 c and hf183 fig s3 f were shown to not impact the further downstream cross sections since at the end of the 200 hour simulation the areal extent of the simulated domain being impacted was already diminishing 4 discussion the use of fib to assess bathing water quality and the accompanying risk of contracting gastrointestinal and or respiratory disease as required by the eu bathing water directive 2006 has led to a significant increase in bathing water quality throughout the european union world health organisation 2007 however the eu bathing water directive does not consider the hydrodynamic properties of a given waterbody nor does it consider the decay rates of faecal indicators in the aquatic environment a systematic review of decay rates of mammalian viruses of public health concern in aquatic environments including norovirus rotavirus and enterovirus reported k values that are considerably smaller than those of e coli and intestinal enterococci the authors of this review conclude that fib may therefore have limited use in assessing the risks to public health by mammalian enteric viruses introduced by faecal contamination boehm et al 2019 our study considered whether the two fib in the bathing water directive e coli and intestinal enterococci are sufficient in different waterbodies with differing hydrodynamic properties to fully assess public health risks associated with faecal contamination with e coli and intestinal enterococci we determined decay rates from experimental microcosms of four additional faecal indicators in hypothetical simulations of river estuarine coastal and lake systems to identify the appropriate faecal indicators with some not currently included in the bathing water directive to adequately reflect the public health risks associated with waterborne pathogens the model simulation results show that the decay rate of each indicator had a minimal impact on the concentration levels of faecal indicators in advection dominant river systems all faecal indicators showed a similarly sharp rise and fall in concentration and were below the detection limit within six hours the rate at which the marker concentration increased and decreased in the simulated domain was substantially higher than the corresponding measured decay rates in this study this means that the transport profiles of mammalian viruses of public health concern with low k values e g norovirus rotavirus or enterovirus under these conditions is highly similar to those of fib which have a greater k value boehm et al 2019 therefore the choice of a particular faecal indicator is not critical in advection dominant river systems systems and in these fib remain the most cost effective indicators to assess public health risks associated with faecal contamination however of the approximately 22 000 designated bathing waters across the eu 6 are river systems the vast majority over 85 of eu designated bathing areas are coastal with the remainder comprising the non river inland waterbodies european environment agency 2021 in less dynamic waterbodies that include estuarine coastal water bodies and lakes faecal indicator selection is critical in assessing faecal pollution dispersion rather than advection is the primary driver of contaminant transport in these settings in advection dispersion estuarine coastal settings and dispersion lake settings simulations the faecal indicators were observed in the model domain for longer time periods as the water movement is slower than in the advection driven model the lake simulation showed that the faecal indicators remained detectable within seven km of the discharge point over a 200 hr simulation period suggesting that water quality remains compromised for a longer period of time than that for the estuarine coastal and river systems that were simulated furthermore after 4 5 days in an estuarine coastal system the levels of intestinal enterococci are shown to decrease below the no observed adverse effect levels noaels of less than 40 cfu 100 ml who 2003 the noael applies to healthy adult bathers exposed to marine water and does not consider other activities nor individuals with a lower immunity such as children the elderly or immunocompromised persons the simulation shows that when intestinal enterococci levels fall below the noael other indicators with k values similar to some human viral pathogens are still present at substantial levels indicating that a risk to public health may remain overall the indicator specific decay rates were shown to have greater impacts on reductions in faecal indicator concentrations in scenarios where the t90 values were lower than the rate of dispersal it should also be noted that the observed t90 values for fib are comparable to other studies ranging from 1 52 to 6 19 days and 1 15 to 5 46 days for culturable e coli and intestinal enterococci respectively balleste et al 2018 ahmed et al 2021 have reported a biphasic decay profile for culturable e coli under similar conditions as reported here in both the freshwater and seawater simulations the bacteriophage markers were shown to persist for longer periods than the culturable and molecular bacterial indicators therefore these markers are arguably more suitable as a proxy for viral pathogens because as previously indicated those viral pathogens have k values that are considerably smaller than those of bacterial indicators somatic coliphage and f rna phage plaque assays are valuable as they measure the level of infectious particles in the water however as is the case for e coli and intestinal enterococci culturable bacteriophages and the ms2 marker are not exclusively associated with human contamination the crassphage and pmmov markers are more representative of human viral pathogens in water quality analysis as they have been shown to be correlated to the presence of human specific gastrointestinal viruses in the aquatic environment jennings et al 2020 gonzalez fernandez et al 2021 moreover crank et al 2019 demonstrated a relationship between observed pmmov and crassphage concentrations and the probability of bather illness in sewage polluted waters pmmov and crassphage markers are also highly abundant in sewage kato et al 2018 wu et al 2020 crank et al 2020 with no seasonal fluctuations reported in addition studies have shown a good correlation between the crassphage marker and other faecal indicators such as fib hf183 and somatic coliphages ahmed et al 2020 balleste et al 2019 sala comorera et al 2021 furthermore the k values observed for crassphage are within the range observed in other studies for example ahmed et al 2021 other studies have reported a higher persistence for pmmov under similar conditions greaves et al 2020 in comparison to other stable indicators i e somatic coliphages the pmmov was detectable for the longest time period because of its high sewage content and low decay rate it is therefore a suitable indicator in situations where a stable marker is required to monitor long term spatial trends of a sewage spill because the decrease in pmmov levels is due to the dispersal rate rather than its decay rate monitoring human pathogens in the environment remains challenging adopting a more conservative approach by selecting a viral marker with a higher decay rate and higher concentration could improve the reliability of water quality monitoring in estuarine coastal waterbodies and lakes our results confirm that choosing the most appropriate faecal indicator markers is dependent on the type of water body and the nature of the spill the study results point toward the increased level of public health protection that could be realised by using site specific risk control measures for different recreational water bodies depending on the resources available to responsible authorities regulatory agencies and policymakers 5 conclusions this study investigated whether the two fib that underpin the current implementation of the eu bathing water directive namely e coli and intestinal enterococci are sufficient for assessing the public health risks associated with faecal contamination in bathing waters the model simulation results demonstrated that decay rates of faecal indicators are not a critical parameter in advection dominant water bodies as the faecal indicators will be below the limit of detection before the viability or integrity of their genetic material is lost therefore the choice of e coli and intestinal enterococci as fib are appropriate however in dispersion and advection dispersion dominant systems which includes the vast majority of eu bathing waters the consideration of the decay rates of potential faecal indicators is critical to assess the impact of faecal contamination on public health therefore more consideration should be given to marker selection when modelling waterbodies such as coastal beaches and estuaries inclusion of stable viral markers such as crassphage and pmmov will improve the reliability of water quality modelling and minimise the risk of waterborne illnesses from faecal contamination funding sources this research acclimatize was part funded by the

14618,the extensive utilization of both legacy and novel brominated flame retardants bfrs leads to high environmental concentrations which would be bioaccumulated by organisms and further transferred through the food webs causing potential risks to humans in this study five bfrs that showed high detection frequencies and concentrations in sediments from an e waste dismantling site in southern

pollutants in the lab constructed aquatic food web as part of a micro ecosystem to investigate their distribution bioaccumulation and trophic transfer patterns the significant correlations between different samples in the food web indicated that the dietary uptake appeared to influence the levels of bfrs in organisms significant negative correlations were observed between the trophic level of organisms and the lipid normalized concentrations of btbpe and dbdpe indicating the occurrence of trophic dilution after 5 month exposure however the average values of bioaccumulation factors bafs were from 2 49 to 5 17 l kg underscoring the importance of continued concern for environmental risks of bfrs the organisms occupying higher trophic levels with greater bioaccumulation capacities may play a pivotal role in determining the trophic magnification potentials of bfrs this research provides a helpful reference for studying the impacts of feeding habits on bioaccumulation and biomagnification as well as for identifying the fate of bfrs in aquatic environment graphical abstract synopsis statement minimal research exists on bfrs co exposure to a food web in the laboratory

substances into the environment during the manufacturing use and disposal altarawneh et al 2019 some legacy bfrs have been listed in the stockholm convention as persistence organic pollutants pops unep 2017 consequently novel brominated flame retardants nbfrs including hexabromobenzene hbb 2 3 4 5 6 pentabromotoluene pbt 1 2 bis 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy ethane btbpe and decabromodiphenyl ethane dbdpe have been increasingly used as alternatives the total annual production of nbfrs was between 100 to 180 kt in 2009 and obviously current production volumes are set to increase zuiderveen et al 2020 nbfrs became ubiquitous in the environment xiong et al 2019 nbfrs in aquatic environments tended to sink in sediments and then were bioaccumulated by aquatic organisms transferred on the food chain potentially leading to ecological risks hou et al 2021 the study conducted at an e waste recycling site in south china showed high logarithmic bioaccumulation factors log bafs for btbpe 3 32 6

river he et al 2012 the south china sea hou et al 2022 and lake taihu zheng et al 2018 the lab exposure experiment showed that dbdpe had a similar bioconcentration potential with decabromodiphenyl ether bde209 in zebrafish larvae wang et al 2019b considering their structures it suggested dbdpe and bde209 may have similar bioaccumulation characteristics the transfer of nbfrs among different trophic levels tls through the predator prey relations in aquatic organisms may lead to biomagnification which can be indicated by biomagnification factors bmfs or trophic magnification factors tmfs greater than 1 studies conducted in bohai and south china sea showed that pbt hbb and btbpe underwent trophic magnification hou et al 2022 liu et al 2021b while in qingyuan country pbt and hbb were trophically diluted liu et al 2020b dbdpe and bde209 showed great trophic magnification in lake winnipeg law et al 2006 but biodilution occurred in other regions such as bohai lake taihu and qingyuan country liu et al 2021b liu et al 2020b zheng et al 2018 these results demonstrate the variability in bfrs biomagnification among different food webs which was influenced by biological characteristics climate exposure levels and the structure of food webs hou et al 2022 one of the critical questions to the mechanism of biomagnification is whether additional bfrs uptake from food would increase the steady state concentrations in aquatic organisms compared with waterborne only uptake wang et al 2019a the occurrence of biomagnification means that feeding relationships play a crucial role in exposing organisms to chemical contaminants russell et al 1999 therefore determining the routes for bfrs entering aquatic organisms is crucial in our previous investigation pbt hbb btbpe and dbdpe were detected at high levels in the sediments from typical e waste dismantling sites in china with bde209 being the dominant pbdes the highest levels in sediments were 133 1530 36800 35000 and 379000 ng g dw respectively ling et al 2022 thus these five bfrs were selected as target pollutants the physical properties are displayed in table s1 initially we constructed a food web spiked with bfrs in the sediments and exposed for 35 days to determine the concentrations and transfer paths of bfrs in aquatic organisms subsequently a freshwater ecosystem was constructed for five months to simulate real environmental scenarios and explore the trophic magnification potentials of bfrs the stable isotopes of carbon δ13c and nitrogen δ15n were analyzed to determine the food web structure the bafs and tmfs were then calculated it is the first study to construct a simulated freshwater microcosm to explore the fate of bfrs in an aquatic environment it also provides a reference for further research on other pollutants in laboratory settings 2 materials and method 2 1 reagents the five target bfrs powder used in the sediment exposure were purchased from adamas shanghai china pbt hbb btbpe and dbdpe standard substances were bought from accustandard connecticut usa bde209 and isotope labeled standards 13c6 hbb 13c12 pcb208 and 13c12 bde209 were purchased from cambridge isotope laboratories andover massachusetts usa cu powder anhydrous sodium sulfate and quartz sand were obtained from macklin biochemical shanghai china neutral alumina and silica gel were obtained from aladdin shanghai china high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade n hexane and dichloromethane dcm were from general reagent shanghai china and acetone as well as toluene were from sinopharm chemical reagent shanghai china 2 2 preparation of bfrs spiked sediments the sediment spiking method was based on the methodology established in our previous work wang et al 2020b the bfrs background contents of sediment collected from a pollution free pool in qingpu district shanghai n30 98 17 18 e121 01 71 73 were below the instrument detection limit the sediment was air dried ground and sieved through a 2 mm sieve 0 15 g powders of the five bfrs were dissolved in toluene diluting with n hexane and then added into 3 kg sediment to reach 50 mg kg dw an environmentally relevant concentration ling et al 2022 another 3 kg sediment mixed with the same amount of toluene and n hexane was set as the control check ck all the groups were thoroughly stirred and placed in a fume hood until the solvent was evaporated entirely the dry bfrs spiked and ck sediments were then transferred into 30 cm 30 cm 30 cm glass tanks respectively covered with 15 cm depth of aerated tap water the sediment water systems were stirred and stood still for two weeks to settle the suspended solids 2 3 experimental design the freshwater microcosm consisting of water sediments and organisms was referred to the research of zhao et al 2017 with some modifications in the 35 day exposure experiment waterweeds egeria densa planch filamentous algae spirogyra communis apple snails planorbarius corneus and chinese bitterlings rhodeus sinensis were selected for the test in the 5 month exposure test grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella and asian clams corbicula fluminea were added additionally to construct a more complete microcosm the organisms were pre acclimated for two weeks in the laboratory all the biota species were commonly found in south china comprised a micro ecosystem naturally occurring in zhejiang and guangdong provinces two typical cities with developed e waste dismantling industries additional aerators were used to ensure dissolved oxygen in the water the microcosms were carried out at 24 0 5 c under 16 h light 8 h dark cycle in the 35 day exposure pre aerated tap water was supplemented every week the water and biota samples were collected every seven days in the 5 month exposure test water was refreshed every two weeks the samples of water sediment and organisms were gathered at the end of the exposure all biota samples were rinsed with milli q water the leaves of e densa and the soft part of p corneus were collected the muscles gills and intestines of r sinensis were dissected in the 35 day exposure while in the 5 month study only the fish muscles for both r sinensi and c idella were dissected for analysis hou et al 2022 sediment and biota samples were homogenized freeze dried and stored at 20 c until analysis a total of three replicates were carried out for the exposure and ck group details about the organisms are listed in table s2 and s3 2 4 sample preparation and gc ms analysis the sample preparation was referred to a previous study wang et al 2020b with slight modifications the details for extraction and purification procedure of water sediment and biota samples are listed in text s1 the analyses of bfrs were performed by agilent 7890a 5975c gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms with an electron capture negative ionization ecni under the selected ion monitoring mode sim the detailed instrument analysis parameters are listed in text s2 the retention time and selected ions of bfrs are in table s4 2 5 stable isotope analysis and calculation the classic stable carbon and nitrogen isotope methods were applied to determine the food web structure liu et al 2021b about 0 1 g dry powders of sediment and biota samples were used to determine the δ13c and δ15n values using tc ea thermo fisher mat 253 for aquatic animals the δ13c values were mathematically adjusted by the c n ratio to reduce the lipid effect castro jimenez et al 2021 post et al 2007 δ 13 c n o r m a l i z e d δ 13 c 3 32 0 99 c n tls were calculated by the δ15n

critical decision in the application of stable isotopes for studying trophic magnification typically primary consumers such as mussels midges mayflies zooplankton and primary producers are used as baseline species borgå et al 2012 kidd et al 2019 in this study the primary producer e densa was utilized as δ15n baseline with a corresponding tlbaseline of 1 tmf was estimated by the slope of the

the glasswares were heated at 450 c and washed with hplc grade n hexane before use a procedure blank and a spiked matrix sample were included for every ten samples the limit of quantification loq was defined as the concentration when the signal noise ratio s n was at ten details of the loq are illustrated in the table s6 bfrs were not detected in the procedure blank samples the recoveries of 13c6 hbb 13c12 bde209 and 13c12 pcb208 were 101 8 33 106 15 7 and 104 14 1 respectively 2 7 statistical analysis the statistical analyses of bfrs concentrations were performed by excel microsoft usa the comparisons of bfrs in water between different sampling time were conducted in spss ibm spss statistics 25 using a one way analysis of variance one way anova followed by tukey hsd tests origin 2021 originlab usa was used for the data charting linear fitting and the spearman correlation coefficient matrix 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations of bfrs in the 35 day exposure bfrs were transferred from the sediment phase and dissolved in the water column hbb btbpe and dbdpe showed a stable concentration while pbt and bde209 exhibited significant fluctuations at the end of exposure p 0 05 table 1 the dissolution of hydrophobic organic compounds hocs was influenced by various factors such as their physical and chemical properties temperature total organic carbon and suspended particulate matter liu et al 2020a liu et al 2021a zhen et al 2018 additionally biological perturbation bioconcentration and excretion activities contributed to the changes in the concentrations of bfrs in this study the bfrs concentrations in the organisms during the 35 day exposure are displayed in fig 1 the data on r sinensis referred to the concentrations in muscles during the 35 day exposure dbdpe was the main bfr in primary producers in e densa bfrs levels increased rapidly reaching peak levels on the 7th day with 2 83 1 30 4 60 1 50 5 66 1 80 1 63 0 270 and 28 2 0 168 mg kg dw for pbt hbb btbpe bde209 and dbdpe respectively bde209 consistently exhibited the lowest concentration the amount of bfrs bioaccumulated by s communis was relatively high on the 14th and 35th day especially for btbpe and dbdpe which was measured 15 3 3 24 and 47 6 5 78 mg kg dw on the 14th day and 4 16 0 546 and 29 1 0 152 mg kg dw on the 35th day respectively as an aquatic plant e densa plays a vital role in water purification and pollutant absorption feijoó et al 1996 previous studies have demonstrated its potential for phytoremediation of organic pollutants alonso et al 2021 e densa was also used to investigate the distribution of pesticides in a water plant fish sediment microcosm and showed fast adsorption of methoxyfenozide chen et al 2021 algae have high binding capacity to hocs due to sulfated polysaccharides proteins lipids and nucleic acids on the cellular walls and plays a crucial role in transferring hocs through food chains to higher tls qiu et al 2017 wang et al 2007 reported that spirogyra could bioconcentrate high levels of bde209 in an aquatic environment contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and pbdes which was contrary to our findings where s communis contained high dbdpe but relatively low bde209 this may be attributed to the lowest concentration of bde209 in water table 1 it was noteworthy that the sudden increase of bfrs on days 14 and 35 in s communis may result in elevated levels of relevant contaminants in their predators apple snails are widely used as bioindicators of organic chemicals such as pcbs and pbdes fu et al 2011 wu et al 2019a they can control the biomass of filamentous algae and consume some macrophytes when the food is scarce fang et al 2010 yang et al 2020 r sinensis is an omnivorous fish commonly seen in south china tao et al 2019 in the 35 day exposure dbdpe was the predominant bfr in snails the concentrations of pbt continued to increase while other bfrs fluctuated over time the contents of bde209 were lower than its substitute dbdpe which was consistent with the results observed in e densa and s communis however a different situation occurred in r sinensis during day 7 to 28 the levels of bde209 were higher than those of dbdpe on the days 7 14 and 28 or comparable day 21 only on the 35th day did the dbdpe exceed bde209 and become the highest bfr the concentration of btbpe remained high throughout the exposure process 3 2 transfer of bfrs in the 35 day exposure the concentrations of bfrs in r sinensis gills and intestines were measured to explore the transfer pathways of bfrs between tissues and different organisms fig 1e and 1f waterborne exposure is considered to be an essential route for fish to absorb most chemicals but the contribution of dietary uptake has also been confirmed lebrun et al 2014 the gills absorbed bfrs from water and the intestines served as the organ for storing and further digesting substances the different concentrations of bfrs in water and primary producers partially accounted for the differences observed in r sinensis gills and intestines spearman correlation analysis of bfrs in water and biota samples at each sampling time was conducted to determine the transfer behavior of bfrs in the food web fig 2 the bfrs detected in r sinensis intestines demonstrated a positive correlation with s communis p 0 05 suggesting s communis was the food source for the fish significant positive correlations were observed between r sinensis gills intestines and muscles indicating that the bfrs stored in the muscles were derived from both waterborne and dietborne uptake substances ingested by fish through their gills and intestines were transported throughout the body via blood circulation and then accumulated in the muscles wang et al 2020a the bfrs in apple snails showed a positive correlation with water p 0 05 s communis p 0 05 and e densa p 0 01 revealing a wide range of bfrs sources in apple snails noteworthy the concentrations in organisms and water samples were not significantly related with sampling time as evidenced by the rapid increase of bfrs in the organisms during the early stage of the experiment fig 1 additionally the sediment water system was left to settle for two weeks before the experiment commenced which may have allowed the bfrs equilibrium between the water and sediment table 1 3 3 bioaccumulation of bfrs in the 5 month exposure there was a slight decrease of bfrs in sediments after 5 months table s7 which was attributed to the dissolution into water absorption and metabolism by organisms the levels and profiles of bfrs in the biota species are displayed in fig 3 total bfrs concentrations in organisms followed the order s communis p corneus r sinensis e densa c fluminea c idella fig s1 the high bfrs enrichment of s communis and p corneus indicated their bioaccumulation potential algae both phytoplankton and macroalgae can bioconcentrate hocs wang et al 1997 and are known to play a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycles of pops russell et al 1999 e densa exhibited a specific bioaccumulation potential for btbpe and particularly for dbdpe composition analysis fig 3b indicated dbdpe was the dominant bfr in most organisms except for c fluminea with btbpe being the second highest this likely reflected the predator prey relationship leading to similar bioaccumulation patterns between consumers and producers compared to r sinensis apple snails displayed higher bfrs contents due to enrichment via various ways as discussed in section 3 2 c fluminea is a benthic organism whose living habits and short scavenging half lives of bfrs resulted in low bioaccumulation zhou et al 2022 total bfrs in c idella were also low possibly related to their food source as discussed in section 3 4 or selective metabolism the average scavenging half lives of target bfrs were found to be variable among organisms qiao et al 2023 wang et al 2020b even within different tissues of the same organism zhou et al 2022 bde209 exhibited a low proportion among the bfrs based on table 1 and s7 it is speculated that the prolonged increase of dissolved bde209 resulting in less bioavailability besides bde209 commonly underwent metabolism in organisms generating lower brominated products chen et al 2012 letcher et al 2014 mi et al 2017 and methoxylated bdes meo bdes hydroxylated bdes oh bdes feng et al 2012 which led to the decrease of measurable bde209 in the organisms however the metabolites of bde209 may pose a greater health risk due to their potentially higher toxicity feng et al 2010 dbdpe shares a similar biotransformation process with bde209 qiao et al 2023 wang et al 2019b zhou et al 2022 but recent studies suggest that dbdpe is more resistant to degradation in the environment and more prone to bioaccumulation in organisms he et al 2012 kajiwara et al 2008 pbt and hbb with lower log kow values were more bioavailable but may also be rapidly eliminated resulting in low bioaccumulation drouillard et al 2007 previous research found btbpe displayed a high bioaccumulation potential which was linked to its hydrophobicity and molecular mass wu et al 2011 the different biological processes such as uptake elimination and metabolism of bfrs between the organisms alongside the varying hydrophobicity and molecular mass among the five chemicals may account for the results depicted in fig 3 the wet weight based log bafs are displayed in table 2 e densa and s communis showed a relatively higher bioaccumulation potential for the five bfrs as primary producers posing risks to the other organisms bfrs showed vb potentials in p corneus due to its various enrichment channels conder et al 2008 significant relationships occurred between log bafs and log kow in p corneus negative correlation with p 0 001 c idella and c fluminea parabolic relationships with p 0 001 and p 0 05 respectively fig 4 no significant relations were found in e densa s communis and r sinensis fig s2 in p corneus log bafs decreased with the increase of log kow consistent with previous findings wang et al 2007 zhu et al 2015 it may be attributed to the higher hydrophobicity and more considerable molecular mass which impeded the penetration of contaminants into cellular membranes she et al 2013 the parabolic relationship observed in c idella and c fluminea was in line with prior studies conducted in south china wu et al 2008 and canada frouin et al 2013 this phenomenon can be attributed to two factors a substances with lower kow values have higher bioavailability and are often rapidly eliminated from organisms b substances with higher kow values exhibit strong binding to sediment and their molecular steric hindrance further restrict contaminant penetration into cell membranes she et al 2013 zhou et al 2022 3 4 trophic transfer of bfrs one of the strong assumptions for stable isotope analysis sia to determine the diet structures of food webs and track animal movements as well as niche shifting is that stable isotope ratios between consumers and their diet reach equilibrium ballutaud et al 2022 shipley et al 2021 consequently the isotopic turnover rates of organisms which depend on both the growth and metabolic rate should be considered oliveira et al 2017 xia et al 2013 only when the interval is greater than the isotopic turnover time new isotope equilibrium can occur typically consumers are considered to be at equilibrium with their diet after 4 5 half lives busst et al 2018 carbon and nitrogen stable isotope turnover rates for similar aquatic organisms are provided in table s8 most organisms isotopic equilibration times were calculated to fall within the duration of the present experimental period based on three considerations 1 literature reports on similar aquatic organisms table s8 2 the growth stage of the tested organisms table s2 and 3 the duration of a similar lab constructed freshwater ecosystem 49 days he et al 2022 it is assumed that the microcosm had achieved isotopic equilibrium as little trophic fractionation occurred δ13c values were indicative of diet composition while δ15n reflects the tls with its enrichment of 15n relative to 14n post 2002 the δ13c values ranged from 35 17 e densa to 20 76 c idella and the δ15n range was 4 26 s communis to 12 21 r sinensis fig 5 apart from e dense c fluminea and c idella the other biota species were distributed in the vicinity of the mean value of δ13c 25 96 suggesting that the dietary sources of e dense c fluminea and c idella may be different from the other organisms as submerged aquatic vegetation the growth of e densa was closely related to co2 hussner et al 2015 capturing co2 from the air resulted in the lowest δ13c values in e densa zhao et al 2017 the δ13c values of c fluminea 23 02 0 15 and c idella 21 00 0 27 were close to that of sediment 21 84 0 38 given that c fluminea was benthic and fed on sediment he et al 2022 zhao et al 2017 the δ15n of c idella 6 68 0 09 was not significantly different from e densa 5 68 0 20 or s communis 5 66 1 00 p 0 05 considering the δn was 3 4 in this study post 2002 c idella did not prey on e densa or s communis the detritus in the sediments was likely to be the main component of c idella diet this simplistic food source also accounted for its low bfrs concentrations in section 3 3 therefore c idella and c fluminea were excluded from this study s tmf calculation as an omnivorous fish r sinensis is known to consume a variety of foods including zooplankton aquatic plants and benthic invertebrates guo et al 2023 while the δ15n values of r sinensis 10 81 1 01 were comparable to those of p corneus 10 91 0 62 and not one tl higher than those of c fluminea 8 58 0 08 thus it is suggested that the food sources for all consumers in this ecosystem were mainly s communis and e densa although there were no obvious three level food chain it is still a food web naturally occurring in south china which could represent the state of an aquatic ecosystem at a certain stage the tls were from 0 665 s communis to 3 00 r sinensis with a range of 2 34 as shown in fig 6 significant negative correlations were found between lipid normalized concentrations and tls in btbpe and dbdpe p 0 05 indicating that these two nbfrs underwent trophic dilution in the constructed microcosm the tmf of pbt hbb and bde209 were smaller than one but not statistically significant p 0 05 the sequences and values of tmfs were pbt 0 488 hbb 0 478 bde209 0 465 btbpe 0 444 dbdpe 0 426 limited studies have been conducted on the trophic transfer of the target bfrs in aquatic food webs the trophic dilution potential of bfrs in this study were consistent with those in the guangdong province excluding btbpe liu et al 2020b while contrary results were observed in the south china sea with significant trophic magnification of pbt hbb btbpe and dbdpe hou et al 2022 the tmfs for dbdpe and bde209 in lack winnipeg were 8 6 and 10 4 respectively which to our knowledge were the highest reported to date law et al 2006 the tmfs comparison of target bfrs in different studies are listed in table s9 it was reported that the tmfs were influenced by log kow cao et al 2023 liu et al 2021b found that the tmf values of bfrs had a trend of first rising and then falling against the log kow values p 0 05 and the trophic magnification potentials of superhydrophobic compounds may be inhibited due to the influence of bioavailability the significant parabolic relationship between tmfs and log kow for pcbs was observed in a freshwater food web from south china wu et al 2009 however no significant relationship was found in this study fig s3 walters et al 2016 analyzed 1500 tmfs of organic chemical ocs and concluded that the ocs with slow metabolic rates by animals km 0 01 day 1 and moderate hydrophobicity log kow 6 8 had the highest tmfs a field investigation of the food web in the south china sea also supported that the tmfs were related to not only the kow of nbfrs but also in vitro biotransformation rates of organisms hou et al 2022 the discontinuity and randomness of dietary uptake could also partly explain the different tmfs wang et al 2019a the effectiveness of biomagnification of the same substances was influenced by the kinds of food webs the predator prey relationships the individual organism and its wet and lipid weight wang et al 2021 which to some extent could be reflected by the bafs of organisms in this research therefore the relations between log bafs and tmfs were analyzed in p corneus and r sinensis which occupied relatively high tls a significant positive relationship was found in p corneus p 0 05 but not in r sinensis fig 7 compared with r sinensis p corneus had a higher bioaccumulation potential of five bfrs table 2 this was the comprehensive result of bioconcentration uptake metabolism excretion growth dilution and other factors therefore it was inferred that the organisms with greater bioaccumulation capacity among the high tls might be the key factor in determining the trophic magnification potentials of bfrs however more research is still needed to fully explore the underlying mechanisms 4 conclusion there are many studies focused on the exposure of single organisms to bfrs however the complex predation relationship in the natural environment will further affect the enrichment of bfrs the field experiments cannot easily track and detect the dynamic transfer direction of target substances in this study we selected pbt hbb btbpe dbdpe and bde209 as target substances and set an environmentally relevant concentration in sediment exposure the dynamic bfrs results showed that the predator prey relationship would affect the contents in organisms in a 35 day food web exposure in the simulated micro ecosystem the primary producers e densa and s communis displayed relatively high bioaccumulative capacities although the tmf results indicated that five bfrs were not trophically magnified their environmental risks still needed to be closely concerned organisms with greater bioaccumulation capacity among the high tls may be key in determining the trophic magnification potentials of bfrs the findings provided valuable insights into the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of bfrs in aquatic systems future work can focus on how the metabolism dietary intake biological growth dilution and dissolved organic matter would jointly affect trophic transfer and magnification declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

unep 2017 consequently novel brominated flame retardants nbfrs including hexabromobenzene hbb 2 3 4 5 6 pentabromotoluene pbt 1 2 bis 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy ethane btbpe and decabromodiphenyl ethane dbdpe have been increasingly used as alternatives the total annual production of nbfrs was between 100 to 180 kt in 2009 and obviously current production volumes are set to increase zuiderveen et al 2020 nbfrs became ubiquitous in the environment xiong et al 2019 nbfrs in aquatic environments tended to sink in sediments and then were bioaccumulated by aquatic organisms transferred on the food chain potentially leading to ecological risks hou et al 2021 the study conducted at an e waste recycling site in south china showed high logarithmic bioaccumulation factors log bafs for btbpe 3 32 6 08 pbt 2 04 4 77 pbeb 2 72 4 09 and hbb 3 31 5 543 demonstrating their bioaccumulative properties wu et al 2011 nbfrs were also reported in fish in the laurentian great lakes wu et al 2019b dongjiang river he et al 2012 the south china sea hou et al 2022 and lake taihu zheng et al 2018 the lab exposure experiment showed that dbdpe had a similar bioconcentration potential with decabromodiphenyl ether bde209 in zebrafish larvae wang et al 2019b considering their structures it suggested dbdpe and bde209 may have similar bioaccumulation characteristics the transfer of nbfrs among different trophic levels tls through the predator prey relations in aquatic organisms may lead to biomagnification which can be indicated by biomagnification factors bmfs or trophic magnification factors tmfs greater than 1 studies conducted in bohai and south china sea showed that pbt hbb and btbpe underwent trophic magnification hou et al 2022 liu et al 2021b while in qingyuan country pbt and hbb were trophically diluted liu et al 2020b dbdpe and bde209 showed great trophic magnification in lake winnipeg law et al 2006 but biodilution occurred in other regions such as bohai lake taihu and qingyuan country liu et al 2021b liu et al 2020b zheng et al 2018 these results demonstrate the variability in bfrs biomagnification among different food webs which was influenced by biological characteristics climate exposure levels and the structure of food webs hou et al 2022 one of the critical questions to the mechanism of biomagnification is whether additional bfrs uptake from food would increase the steady state concentrations in aquatic organisms compared with waterborne only uptake wang et al 2019a the occurrence of biomagnification means that feeding relationships play a crucial role in exposing organisms to chemical contaminants russell et al 1999 therefore determining the routes for bfrs entering aquatic organisms is crucial in our previous investigation pbt hbb btbpe and dbdpe were detected at high levels in the sediments from typical e waste dismantling sites in china with bde209 being the dominant pbdes the highest levels in sediments were 133 1530 36800 35000 and 379000 ng g dw respectively ling et al 2022 thus these five bfrs were selected as target pollutants the physical properties are displayed in table s1 initially we constructed a food web spiked with bfrs in the sediments and exposed for 35 days to determine the concentrations and transfer paths of bfrs in aquatic organisms subsequently a freshwater ecosystem was constructed for five months to simulate real environmental scenarios and explore the trophic magnification potentials of bfrs the stable isotopes of carbon δ13c and nitrogen δ15n were analyzed to determine the food web structure the bafs and tmfs were then calculated it is the first study to construct a simulated freshwater microcosm to explore the fate of bfrs in an aquatic environment it also provides a reference for further research on other pollutants in laboratory settings 2 materials and method 2 1 reagents the five target bfrs powder used in the sediment exposure were purchased from adamas shanghai china pbt hbb btbpe and dbdpe standard substances were bought from accustandard connecticut usa bde209 and isotope labeled standards 13c6 hbb 13c12 pcb208 and 13c12 bde209 were purchased from cambridge isotope laboratories andover massachusetts usa cu powder anhydrous sodium sulfate and quartz sand were obtained from macklin biochemical shanghai china neutral alumina and silica gel were obtained from aladdin shanghai china high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade n hexane and dichloromethane dcm were from general reagent shanghai china and acetone as well as toluene were from sinopharm chemical reagent shanghai china 2 2 preparation of bfrs spiked sediments the sediment spiking method was based on the methodology established in our previous work wang et al 2020b the bfrs background contents of sediment collected from a pollution free pool in qingpu district shanghai n30 98 17 18 e121 01 71 73 were below the instrument detection limit the sediment was air dried ground and sieved through a 2 mm sieve 0 15 g powders of the five bfrs were dissolved in toluene diluting with n hexane and then added into 3 kg sediment to reach 50 mg kg dw an environmentally relevant concentration ling et al 2022 another 3 kg sediment mixed with the same amount of toluene and n hexane was set as the control check ck all the groups were thoroughly stirred and placed in a fume hood until the solvent was evaporated entirely the dry bfrs spiked and ck sediments were then transferred into 30 cm 30 cm 30 cm glass tanks respectively covered with 15 cm depth of aerated tap water the sediment water systems were stirred and stood still for two weeks to settle the suspended solids 2 3 experimental design the freshwater microcosm consisting of water sediments and organisms was referred to the research of zhao et al 2017 with some modifications in the 35 day exposure experiment waterweeds egeria densa planch filamentous algae spirogyra communis apple snails planorbarius corneus and chinese bitterlings rhodeus sinensis were selected for the test in the 5 month exposure test grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella and asian clams corbicula fluminea were added additionally to construct a more complete microcosm the organisms were pre acclimated for two weeks in the laboratory all the biota species were commonly found in south china comprised a micro ecosystem naturally occurring in zhejiang and guangdong provinces two typical cities with developed e waste dismantling industries additional aerators were used to ensure dissolved oxygen in the water the microcosms were carried out at 24 0 5 c under 16 h light 8 h dark cycle in the 35 day exposure pre aerated tap water was supplemented every week the water and biota samples were collected every seven days in the 5 month exposure test water was refreshed every two weeks the samples of water sediment and organisms were gathered at the end of the exposure all biota samples were rinsed with milli q water the leaves of e densa and the soft part of p corneus were collected the muscles gills and intestines of r sinensis were dissected in the 35 day exposure while in the 5 month study only the fish muscles for both r sinensi and c idella were dissected for analysis hou et al 2022 sediment and biota samples were homogenized freeze dried and stored at 20 c until analysis a total of three replicates were carried out for the exposure and ck group details about the organisms are listed in table s2 and s3 2 4 sample preparation and gc ms analysis the sample preparation was referred to a previous study wang et al 2020b with slight modifications the details for extraction and purification procedure of water sediment and biota samples are listed in text s1 the analyses of bfrs were performed by agilent 7890a 5975c gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms with an electron capture negative ionization ecni under the selected ion monitoring mode sim the detailed instrument analysis parameters are listed in text s2 the retention time and selected ions of bfrs are in table s4 2 5 stable isotope analysis and calculation the classic stable carbon and nitrogen isotope methods were applied to determine the food web structure liu et al 2021b about 0 1 g dry powders of sediment and biota samples were used to determine the δ13c and δ15n values using tc ea thermo fisher mat 253 for aquatic animals the δ13c values were mathematically adjusted by the c n ratio to reduce the lipid effect castro jimenez et al 2021 post et al 2007 δ 13 c n o r m a l i z e d δ 13 c 3 32 0 99 c n tls were calculated by the δ15n

critical decision in the application of stable isotopes for studying trophic magnification typically primary consumers such as mussels midges mayflies zooplankton and primary producers are used as baseline species borgå et al 2012 kidd et al 2019 in this study the primary producer e densa was utilized as δ15n baseline with a corresponding tlbaseline of 1 tmf was estimated by the slope of the linear relationship between the lipid normalized concentrations of bfrs versus tls he et al 2022 log c o n c e n t r a t i o n s a b t l t m f 10 b baf describes the bioaccumulation potential of

conder et al 2008 b a f c b i o t a c w a t e r where cbiota and cwater are the concentrations of bfrs in organisms mg kg ww and water ng l in this study the concentrations on a lipid and wet weight

the glasswares were heated at 450 c and washed with hplc grade n hexane before use a procedure blank and a spiked matrix sample were included for every ten samples the limit of quantification loq was defined as the concentration when the signal noise ratio s n was at ten details of the loq are illustrated in the table s6 bfrs were not detected in the procedure blank samples the recoveries of 13c6 hbb 13c12 bde209 and 13c12 pcb208 were 101 8 33 106 15 7 and 104 14 1 respectively 2 7 statistical analysis the statistical analyses of bfrs concentrations were performed by excel microsoft usa the comparisons of bfrs in water between different sampling time were conducted in spss ibm spss statistics 25 using a one way analysis of variance one way anova followed by tukey hsd tests origin 2021 originlab usa was used for the data charting linear fitting and the spearman correlation coefficient matrix 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations of bfrs in the 35 day exposure bfrs were transferred from the sediment phase and dissolved in the water column hbb btbpe and dbdpe showed a stable concentration while pbt and bde209 exhibited significant fluctuations at the end of exposure p 0 05 table 1 the dissolution of hydrophobic organic compounds hocs was influenced by various factors such as their physical and chemical properties temperature total organic carbon and suspended particulate matter liu et al 2020a liu et al 2021a zhen et al 2018 additionally biological perturbation bioconcentration and excretion activities contributed to the changes in the concentrations of bfrs in this study the bfrs concentrations in the organisms during the 35 day exposure are displayed in fig 1 the data on r sinensis referred to the concentrations in muscles during the 35 day exposure dbdpe was the main bfr in primary producers in e densa bfrs levels increased rapidly reaching peak levels on the 7th day with 2 83 1 30 4 60 1 50 5 66 1 80 1 63 0 270 and 28 2 0 168 mg kg dw for pbt hbb btbpe bde209 and dbdpe respectively bde209 consistently exhibited the lowest concentration the amount of bfrs bioaccumulated by s communis was relatively high on the 14th and 35th day especially for btbpe and dbdpe which was measured 15 3 3 24 and 47 6 5 78 mg kg dw on the 14th day and 4 16 0 546 and 29 1 0 152 mg kg dw on the 35th day respectively as an aquatic plant e densa plays a vital role in water purification and pollutant absorption feijoó et al 1996 previous studies have demonstrated its potential for phytoremediation of organic pollutants alonso et al 2021 e densa was also used to investigate the distribution of pesticides in a water plant fish sediment microcosm and showed fast adsorption of methoxyfenozide chen et al 2021 algae have high binding capacity to hocs due to sulfated polysaccharides proteins lipids and nucleic acids on the cellular walls and plays a crucial role in transferring hocs through food chains to higher tls qiu et al 2017 wang et al 2007 reported that spirogyra could bioconcentrate high levels of bde209 in an aquatic environment contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and pbdes which was contrary to our findings where s communis contained high dbdpe but relatively low bde209 this may be attributed to the lowest concentration of bde209 in water table 1 it was noteworthy that the sudden increase of bfrs on days 14 and 35 in s communis may result in elevated levels of relevant contaminants in their predators apple snails are widely used as bioindicators of organic chemicals such as pcbs and pbdes fu et al 2011 wu et al 2019a they can control the biomass of filamentous algae and consume some macrophytes when the food is scarce fang et al 2010 yang et al 2020 r sinensis is an omnivorous fish commonly seen in south china tao et al 2019 in the 35 day exposure dbdpe was the predominant bfr in snails the concentrations of pbt continued to increase while other bfrs fluctuated over time the contents of bde209 were lower than its substitute dbdpe which was consistent with the results observed in e densa and s communis however a different situation occurred in r sinensis during day 7 to 28 the levels of bde209 were higher than those of dbdpe on the days 7 14 and 28 or comparable day 21 only on the 35th day did the dbdpe exceed bde209 and become the highest bfr the concentration of btbpe remained high throughout the exposure process 3 2 transfer of bfrs in the 35 day exposure the concentrations of bfrs in r sinensis gills and intestines were measured to explore the transfer pathways of bfrs between tissues and different organisms fig 1e and 1f waterborne exposure is considered to be an essential route for fish to absorb most chemicals but the contribution of dietary uptake has also been confirmed lebrun et al 2014 the gills absorbed bfrs from water and the intestines served as the organ for storing and further digesting substances the different concentrations of bfrs in water and primary producers partially accounted for the differences observed in r sinensis gills and intestines spearman correlation analysis of bfrs in water and biota samples at each sampling time was conducted to determine the transfer behavior of bfrs in the food web fig 2 the bfrs detected in r sinensis intestines demonstrated a positive correlation with s communis p 0 05 suggesting s communis was the food source for the fish significant positive correlations were observed between r sinensis gills intestines and muscles indicating that the bfrs stored in the muscles were derived from both waterborne and dietborne uptake substances ingested by fish through their gills and intestines were transported throughout the body via blood circulation and then accumulated in the muscles wang et al 2020a the bfrs in apple snails showed a positive correlation with water p 0 05 s communis p 0 05 and e densa p 0 01 revealing a wide range of bfrs sources in apple snails noteworthy the concentrations in organisms and water samples were not significantly related with sampling time as evidenced by the rapid increase of bfrs in the organisms during the early stage of the experiment fig 1 additionally the sediment water system was left to settle for two weeks before the experiment commenced which may have allowed the bfrs equilibrium between the water and sediment table 1 3 3 bioaccumulation of bfrs in the 5 month exposure there was a slight decrease of bfrs in sediments after 5 months table s7 which was attributed to the dissolution into water absorption and metabolism by organisms the levels and profiles of bfrs in the biota species are displayed in fig 3 total bfrs concentrations in organisms followed the order s communis p corneus r sinensis e densa c fluminea c idella fig s1 the high bfrs enrichment of s communis and p corneus indicated their bioaccumulation potential algae both phytoplankton and macroalgae can bioconcentrate hocs wang et al 1997 and are known to play a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycles of pops russell et al 1999 e densa exhibited a specific bioaccumulation potential for btbpe and particularly for dbdpe composition analysis fig 3b indicated dbdpe was the dominant bfr in most organisms except for c fluminea with btbpe being the second highest this likely reflected the predator prey relationship leading to similar bioaccumulation patterns between consumers and producers compared to r sinensis apple snails displayed higher bfrs contents due to enrichment via various ways as discussed in section 3 2 c fluminea is a benthic organism whose living habits and short scavenging half lives of bfrs resulted in low bioaccumulation zhou et al 2022 total bfrs in c idella were also low possibly related to their food source as discussed in section 3 4 or selective metabolism the average scavenging half lives of target bfrs were found to be variable among organisms qiao et al 2023 wang et al 2020b even within different tissues of the same organism zhou et al 2022 bde209 exhibited a low proportion among the bfrs based on table 1 and s7 it is speculated that the prolonged increase of dissolved bde209 resulting in less bioavailability besides bde209 commonly underwent metabolism in organisms generating lower brominated products chen et al 2012 letcher et al 2014 mi et al 2017 and methoxylated bdes meo bdes hydroxylated bdes oh bdes feng et al 2012 which led to the decrease of measurable bde209 in the organisms however the metabolites of bde209 may pose a greater health risk due to their potentially higher toxicity feng et al 2010 dbdpe shares a similar biotransformation process with bde209 qiao et al 2023 wang et al 2019b zhou et al 2022 but recent studies suggest that dbdpe is more resistant to degradation in the environment and more prone to bioaccumulation in organisms he et al 2012 kajiwara et al 2008 pbt and hbb with lower log kow values were more bioavailable but may also be rapidly eliminated resulting in low bioaccumulation drouillard et al 2007 previous research found btbpe displayed a high bioaccumulation potential which was linked to its hydrophobicity and molecular mass wu et al 2011 the different biological processes such as uptake elimination and metabolism of bfrs between the organisms alongside the varying hydrophobicity and molecular mass among the five chemicals may account for the results depicted in fig 3 the wet weight based log bafs are displayed in table 2 e densa and s communis showed a relatively higher bioaccumulation potential for the five bfrs as primary producers posing risks to the other organisms bfrs showed vb potentials in p corneus due to its various enrichment channels conder et al 2008 significant relationships occurred between log bafs and log kow in p corneus negative correlation with p 0 001 c idella and c fluminea parabolic relationships with p 0 001 and p 0 05 respectively fig 4 no significant relations were found in e densa s communis and r sinensis fig s2 in p corneus log bafs decreased with the increase of log kow consistent with previous findings wang et al 2007 zhu et al 2015 it may be attributed to the higher hydrophobicity and more considerable molecular mass which impeded the penetration of contaminants into cellular membranes she et al 2013 the parabolic relationship observed in c idella and c fluminea was in line with prior studies conducted in south china wu et al 2008 and canada frouin et al 2013 this phenomenon can be attributed to two factors a substances with lower kow values have higher bioavailability and are often rapidly eliminated from organisms b substances with higher kow values exhibit strong binding to sediment and their molecular steric hindrance further restrict contaminant penetration into cell membranes she et al 2013 zhou et al 2022 3 4 trophic transfer of bfrs one of the strong assumptions for stable isotope analysis sia to determine the diet structures of food webs and track animal movements as well as niche shifting is that stable isotope ratios between consumers and their diet reach equilibrium ballutaud et al 2022 shipley et al 2021 consequently the isotopic turnover rates of organisms which depend on both the growth and metabolic rate should be considered oliveira et al 2017 xia et al 2013 only when the interval is greater than the isotopic turnover time new isotope equilibrium can occur typically consumers are considered to be at equilibrium with their diet after 4 5 half lives busst et al 2018 carbon and nitrogen stable isotope turnover rates for similar aquatic organisms are provided in table s8 most organisms isotopic equilibration times were calculated to fall within the duration of the present experimental period based on three considerations 1 literature reports on similar aquatic organisms table s8 2 the growth stage of the tested organisms table s2 and 3 the duration of a similar lab constructed freshwater ecosystem 49 days he et al 2022 it is assumed that the microcosm had achieved isotopic equilibrium as little trophic fractionation occurred δ13c values were indicative of diet composition while δ15n reflects the tls with its enrichment of 15n relative to 14n post 2002 the δ13c values ranged from 35 17 e densa to 20 76 c idella and the δ15n range was 4 26 s communis to 12 21 r sinensis fig 5 apart from e dense c fluminea and c idella the other biota species were distributed in the vicinity of the mean value of δ13c 25 96 suggesting that the dietary sources of e dense c fluminea and c idella may be different from the other organisms as submerged aquatic vegetation the growth of e densa was closely related to co2 hussner et al 2015 capturing co2 from the air resulted in the lowest δ13c values in e densa zhao et al 2017 the δ13c values of c fluminea 23 02 0 15 and c idella 21 00 0 27 were close to that of sediment 21 84 0 38 given that c fluminea was benthic and fed on sediment he et al 2022 zhao et al 2017 the δ15n of c idella 6 68 0 09 was not significantly different from e densa 5 68 0 20 or s communis 5 66 1 00 p 0 05 considering the δn was 3 4 in this study post 2002 c idella did not prey on e densa or s communis the detritus in the sediments was likely to be the main component of c idella diet this simplistic food source also accounted for its low bfrs concentrations in section 3 3 therefore c idella and c fluminea were excluded from this study s tmf calculation as an omnivorous fish r sinensis is known to consume a variety of foods including zooplankton aquatic plants and benthic invertebrates guo et al 2023 while the δ15n values of r sinensis 10 81 1 01 were comparable to those of p corneus 10 91 0 62 and not one tl higher than those of c fluminea 8 58 0 08 thus it is suggested that the food sources for all consumers in this ecosystem were mainly s communis and e densa although there were no obvious three level food chain it is still a food web naturally occurring in south china which could represent the state of an aquatic ecosystem at a certain stage the tls were from 0 665 s communis to 3 00 r sinensis with a range of 2 34 as shown in fig 6 significant negative correlations were found between lipid normalized concentrations and tls in btbpe and dbdpe p 0 05 indicating that these two nbfrs underwent trophic dilution in the constructed microcosm the tmf of pbt hbb and bde209 were smaller than one but not statistically significant p 0 05 the sequences and values of tmfs were pbt 0 488 hbb 0 478 bde209 0 465 btbpe 0 444 dbdpe 0 426 limited studies have been conducted on the trophic transfer of the target bfrs in aquatic food webs the trophic dilution potential of bfrs in this study were consistent with those in the guangdong province excluding btbpe liu et al 2020b while contrary results were observed in the south china sea with significant trophic magnification of pbt hbb btbpe and dbdpe hou et al 2022 the tmfs for dbdpe and bde209 in lack winnipeg were 8 6 and 10 4 respectively which to our knowledge were the highest reported to date law et al 2006 the tmfs comparison of target bfrs in different studies are listed in table s9 it was reported that the tmfs were influenced by log kow cao et al 2023 liu et al 2021b found that the tmf values of bfrs had a trend of first rising and then falling against the log kow values p 0 05 and the trophic magnification potentials of superhydrophobic compounds may be inhibited due to the influence of bioavailability the significant parabolic relationship between tmfs and log kow for pcbs was observed in a freshwater food web from south china wu et al 2009 however no significant relationship was found in this study fig s3 walters et al 2016 analyzed 1500 tmfs of organic chemical ocs and concluded that the ocs with slow metabolic rates by animals km 0 01 day 1 and moderate hydrophobicity log kow 6 8 had the highest tmfs a field investigation of the food web in the south china sea also supported that the tmfs were related to not only the kow of nbfrs but also in vitro biotransformation rates of organisms hou et al 2022 the discontinuity and randomness of dietary uptake could also partly explain the different tmfs wang et al 2019a the effectiveness of biomagnification of the same substances was influenced by the kinds of food webs the predator prey relationships the individual organism and its wet and lipid weight wang et al 2021 which to some extent could be reflected by the bafs of organisms in this research therefore the relations between log bafs and tmfs were analyzed in p corneus and r sinensis which occupied relatively high tls a significant positive relationship was found in p corneus p 0 05 but not in r sinensis fig 7 compared with r sinensis p corneus had a higher bioaccumulation potential of five bfrs table 2 this was the comprehensive result of bioconcentration uptake metabolism excretion growth dilution and other factors therefore it was inferred that the organisms with greater bioaccumulation capacity among the high tls might be the key factor in determining the trophic magnification potentials of bfrs however more research is still needed to fully explore the underlying mechanisms 4 conclusion there are many studies focused on the exposure of single organisms to bfrs however the complex predation relationship in the natural environment will further affect the enrichment of bfrs the field experiments cannot easily track and detect the dynamic transfer direction of target substances in this study we selected pbt hbb btbpe dbdpe and bde209 as target substances and set an environmentally relevant concentration in sediment exposure the dynamic bfrs results showed that the predator prey relationship would affect the contents in organisms in a 35 day food web exposure in the simulated micro ecosystem the primary producers e densa and s communis displayed relatively high bioaccumulative capacities although the tmf results indicated that five bfrs were not trophically magnified their environmental risks still needed to be closely concerned organisms with greater bioaccumulation capacity among the high tls may be key in determining the trophic magnification potentials of bfrs the findings provided valuable insights into the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of bfrs in aquatic systems future work can focus on how the metabolism dietary intake biological growth dilution and dissolved organic matter would jointly affect trophic transfer and magnification declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

14619,electrochemistry is a potential method for water softening an essential disadvantage is oh ions from water electrolysis accumulate on cathode surface inducing the generation of the insulating caco3 layer and then interrupting the electrochemical reaction in order to propel oh diffusion into the bulk solution instead of aggregation at cathode we designed an electrochemical reactor whose electrodes were placed horizontally in the middle of the reactor and the bubbles created by water electrolysis move upward while the water flows downward the visual evidence displayed that the unique reactor structure allowed oh to spread to almost all the solution rapidly average ph value of bulk solution reached 10 6 in only 3 min therefore homogeneous nucleation of caco3 in bulk solution would take primary responsibility for water softening and the softening efficiency is up to 212 9 g caco3 h m2 higher than reported results the reactor is easy to scale up providing a new idea for the softening of circulating cooling water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water softening electrochemistry oh diffusion homogeneous nucleation softening efficiency 1 introduction scaling phenomenon is the inherent trouble of circulating cooling water system liu et al 2012 scale will obstruct pipes or interference heat exchange generating economic lost and explosion risks touir et al 2009 wang and liang 2017 the scaling phenomenon is usually caused by the supersaturated precipitation of caco3 or mg oh 2 seo et al 2010 to prevent scaling scale inhibitor neveux et al 2016 chemical precipitation c zhang et al 2020 ion exchanging apell and boyer 2010 and reverse osmosis elazhar et al al 2021 have been utilized however these technologies have inherent drawbacks scale inhibitors are usually chelating agents besides organic pollutants are brought into water they only delayed the precipitation without removing hardness ions chemical precipitation requires raising ph values firstly to promote precipitation of caco3 or mg oh 2 and then lowering ph values to neutral for recycling l zhang et al 2020 the cost of chemicals the large amount of precipitation and the elevation of salinity are all undesirable ion exchange has to employ high salinity water for backwashing which brings high cost and discharge burden karabelas et al 2020 reverse osmosis cannot avoid membrane pollution and high energy consumption antony et al 2011 thus alternative technologies need be explored electrochemical water softening is distinguished in scale prevention field by chemical free and easy automation yu et al 2019 zhi and zhang 2014 this method depends on oh generated by cathode during water electrolysis to convert hco3 to co3 2 further combining ca2 to compose caco3 or to straightly integrate with mg2 to produce mg oh 2 zhi and zhang 2014 most of these solid deposits on the cathode surface zeppenfeld 2011 resulting in the hardness decrease in water there are two points limiting the practical application of electrochemical softening one is electrode area dependence the typical deposition rate is only around 50 g caco3 h m2 hasson et al 2010 it requires s a large electrode area for practical application the other is that the cathodic surface will be covered by the insulating caco3 layer under the dominance of heterogeneous nucleation obviously electrochemical softening will be interrupted and cathode regeneration has to be done frequently gabrielli et al 2006 oh distribution determines the nucleation range of caco3 in a normal electrochemical reactor both cathode and anode are arranged perpendicularly to the horizontal plane during water electrolysis because there is no driving force most of oh ions accumulate on the cathodic surface and only a few diffuse towards the anode depending on the concentration gradient furthermore h ions produced on the anode will transfer to the cathode and neutralize oh ions in bulk solution so that only the cathode surface appears sufficient oh to induce caco3 precipitate gabrielli et al 2006 li et al 2020 if most of oh may be driven away from the cathodic surface and maintain a high concentration in the solution the homogeneous nucleation in solution is overwhelmingly superior to the heterogeneous nucleation on the cathodic surface kang et al 2023 in order to achieve this goal separators such as carbon felt yang et al 2022 ion exchange membrane hasson et al 2010 diaz nieto et al 2019 hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene microfiltration membrane liu et al 2022 and nylon mesh kang et al 2023 have been added between two electrodes to avoid neutralization of h and oh for an example using ion exchange membrane as separator a softening efficiency of 167 g caco3 h m2 was achieved hasson et al 2010 this value was significantly higher than that of membrane free reactor 20 70 g caco3 h m2 yu et al 2019 c zhang et al 2020 jin et al 2019 the softening efficiency does be improved via using separators but separators will obstruct charge migration and increases energy consumption and moreover the pores of separators are easy to be blocked lei et al 2019 thus promoting oh diffusion without separators becomes a valuable work in the research area with respect to electrochemical degradation of organics random diffusion of hydrogen bubbles from water electrolysis were observed to lead to the turbulence around electrodes huang et al 2021 besides the direction of water flow was demonstrated to accelerate the diffusion of specific ions chen et al 2021 meng et al 2022 inspired by these reports it may be safely inferred that bubble motion and water flow may act as driving forces for the diffusion of oh ions away from the cathode surface sequentially the application limitation of electrochemical water softening will be broken through however as far as we know no reports have focused on this topic herein we design a membrane free reactor compared with conventional ones it has two features 1 whose electrodes are placed horizontally the upward moving bubbles from water electrolysis and the downward flowing water act as driving forces to promote the rapid diffusion of oh ions throughout the reactor 2 water flows through the cathode firstly and then through the anode this design ensures that the main reactor space is alkaline while the outlet is near neutral by intensifying homogeneous nucleation of caco3 we hope to keep electrochemical softening out of troubles such as cathode area dependence and cathode frequent regeneration and thus to achieve high softening

504 g nahco3 in per liter of tap water including the background value of tap water the total harness was about 400 mg caco3 l the conductivity and ph were 1650 μs cm and 8 2 respectively during water softening processes sccw flowed down through the central pipe and the mesh cathode in turn after bottoming sccw flowed upward through the mesh anode and out through the overflow weir 2 3 analysis methods the concentration of ca2 and mg2 in solution were determined by ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta titration methods to measure ca and mg elements in the sediment in the sludge hopper and

motion and water flow electrochemical water softening bases on the reaction between oh generated by the cathode and original hco3 in water to produce co3 2 ions which further react with ca2 ions to form caco3 precipitate generally once insulating caco3 layer covered the cathode surface electrochemical softening process will be interrupted and cathode regeneration has to be performed frequently in order to address this issue we designed a novel reactor to propel oh diffusion into the bulk solution with the help of bubble movement and water flow the performance of the oh diffusion was evaluated through visualization and quantification methods to visualize the spatial and temporal distribution of oh 8 mg l thymolphthalein as an indicator which exhibits blue at ph values greater than 9 4 was added into a solution of 0 8 g l na2so4 after that electrolysis experiment was conducted and the color change of the solution was monitored by a digital camera whose videos are enclosed online after applying the current the solution on the electrode surface turns blue indicating oh generation near the cathode surface subsequently a portion of oh ions were carried upward by h2 bubbles from water electrolysis rising from the cathode surface and filled the entire central pipe after 30 s fig 2 a while the remaining oh ions were carried downward by water flow and filled the sludge hopper fig 2 b these observations demonstrated that based on the unique reactor structure the upward moving bubbles from water electrolysis and downward flowing water could indeed facilitate the rapid diffusion of oh ions throughout the reactor benefiting from the horizontal electrodes the electrochemical process could avoid the neutralization of h and oh and quickly create an alkaline region with high ph value at the central pipe and sludge hopper without any membrane separators following the visualization the quantization of oh ions diffusion in the central pipe and the sludge hopper was conducted where ph value is an important factor affecting softening efficiency when 0 8 g l na2so4 solution flowed into the reactor ph value changes were monitored as fig 3 a exhibited the ph value inside central pipe increased from 6 8 to 10 6 after electrolysis for 3 min and continued to rise stabilizing at around 11 2 the similar trend was observed for ph values inside sludge hopper whose stable value was around 11 5 slightly higher than that inside central pipe the similar ph trend between central pipe and sludge hopper was ascribed to the turbulence caused by bubble motion and water flow this result confirmed the function of the reactor in propelling oh diffusion while for the effluent ph values dropped deeply from 6 8 to 3 2 in the first 6 min and then recovered gradually it didn t get close to neutral until 120 min the oh diffusion promoted only by upward bubble motion was investigated by recording ph values at flow rate of 0 l h as fig s2 displayed since the 10th minute ph values inside and outside the central pipe were stable at about 11 7 and 3 0 respectively the value 11 7 was a little higher than the stable ph value 11 2 under the combined effect of the upward motion of bubbles and the downward motion of the fluid on basis of this comparison it is reasonable to estimate without of the downward flow of water the upward motion of bubbles will push more oh ions to gather in central pipe when treating sccw at 80 a m2 and 6 l h the stable ph value in both the central pipe and sludge hopper was only 9 7 less than that in na2so4 solution fig 3 b that was because hco3 ions in sccw acted as a buffering to limit ph variation to identify the lower limit of ph value that needed to precipitate hardness ions the theoretical fractions of calcium and magnesium varied by ph value were calculated according to acid base ionization equilibrium and solid dissolution equilibrium theory fig s3 it was illustrated that when the total calcium was 3 5 mmol l and total carbonate was 6 0 mmol l in sccw once ph value exceeding 9 5 almost all ca2 would be translated to crystal or solid form in fact the actual ph value in central pipe was 9 7 meeting the requirement for caco3 nucleation 3 2 homogeneous nucleation and crystallization as above mentioned in this electrochemical reactor under the action of upward moving bubbles and downward flowing water oh ions may break away from the cathode interface and rapidly diffuse throughout the reactor and the hardness ions may meet the necessary ph conditions for nucleation before meeting the cathode predictably homogeneous nucleation in solution will be facilitated the turbidity in the central pipe may serve as evidence of homogeneous nucleation the initial turbidity of sccw was 0 7 ntu as shown in fig 4 a within the first 15 min of electrolysis the turbidity within the central pipe increased sharply reaching 117 8 ntu this indicates generation of insoluble particles after 15 min the turbidity dropped distinctly meaning the gradual aggregation of suspended particles and sedimentation after 30 min the turbidity stabilized at approximately 78 ntu as for the effluent turbidity stabilizing at approximately 20 ntu after 30 min of the reaction indicating that a large number of suspended particles precipitated moreover to catch direct evidence of homogeneous nucleation a pcm system was used and the result picture were displayed in fig 4 b e no particles were observed before electrolysis from the 5th minute scattered particles about 8 μm of diameter appeared indicating that nucleation started within five minutes with continuous electrolysis and sccw feeding in particles increased and grew a portion of which reached 13 μm at the 15th minute when both ph and turbidity kept stable since the 60th minute suspended particles grew to 24 μm no larger particles were due to gravity driven spontaneous precipitation therefore it is inferred that there were three main steps in the electrochemical water softening process in our reactor new nucleus creation crystal growth and particle precipitation during electrolysis oh ions produced at the cathode raise ph value firstly making the hardness ions aggregate and form small crystal nuclei as the reaction continues new ions ca2 and hco3 are continuously supplied into the reactor with inflow sccw and these ions further precipitate on the surface of crystal nuclei promoting the crystal growth the small particles remain suspended in the central pipe when crystals were large enough to generate gravity precipitation they will drop into the sludge hopper this was consistent with the experimental observation of a significant reduction in turbidity from the central pipe to the effluent fig 4 a the sediment was observed using sem as fig 4 f showed the particle size distribution was between 12 and 24 μm no smaller particles observed in the sediment was consisted with pcm pictures the rhombohedral particles are the conventional morphology of calcite caco3 cölfen and qi 2001 the butterfly like particles may be both calcite and vaterite zhao et al 2013 fig s4 showed that the sediment in the sludge hopper contained three crystal types calcite aragonite and brucite and the calcite was dominant to detect the proportion of homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation the hardness distribution after 140 min of continuous experiment was measured hardness ions have three places to go attached to cathode attached to reactor wall and in the sediment the part in the sediment was ascribed to homogeneous nucleation and the other two parts were attributed to heterogeneous nucleation the solids in these three parts were dissolved separately by utilizing dilute hydrochloric acid for edta titration measurement calcium hardness from homogeneous nucleation accounted for 82 3 while 10 7 of calcium hardness was attached to the reactor wall and 7 0 of calcium hardness appeared on the cathode surface fig 4 g the results showed that in this electrochemical system most of the calcium hardness was generated by homogeneous nucleation rather than aggregation on the cathode in fig s5 the xrd pattern for the pristine cathode only displayed peaks correspond to copper for the used cathode besides cu peaks weak calcite aragonite and brucite signals were detected as well it indicated only a bit of scale attached to the electrode additionally calcium hardness accounted for 94 6 of the total hardness removal due to the ph limitation and lower crystallinity of magnesium hydroxide in the reactor liu et al 2019 magnesium hardness removal was lower than calcium hardness and mostly adhered to the solid liquid interface 3 3 softening efficiency the above experiments demonstrated the function of bubble motion and water flow on propelling oh diffusion and intensifying homogeneous nucleation the results provided the precipitation may occur in bulk solution as long as ph values meet the requirement to evaluate the benefit of propelling oh diffusion on the softening efficiency the experiments were conducted with and without the central pipe in this electrochemical reactor the central pipe played the role to arrange the flow direction and avoid contact between oh and h as exhibited in fig 5 a for the reactor with the central pipe the hardness removed was around 190 mg caco3 l in 140 min while merely 25 mg caco3 l hardness was removed without the central pipe in the absence of the central pipe once oh ions diffused from the cathode to bulk solution they would soon be neutralized by h transferred from anode resulting in ph value of bulk solution lower than the requirements of precipitation and leaving the precipitating process confined to cathode surface as fig s6 shown if the central pipe was removed only imperceptible blue in the visualization of oh diffusion could be seen during 8 min of reaction process while with the central pipe it only took 30 s to see the distinct blue color fig 2 this result supported that without the central pipe oh ions diffused from the cathode would soon be neutralized by h transferred from anode resulting in near neutral solution this comparative experiment demonstrated that the promotion of oh diffusion by bubble motion and water flow was the reason for homogeneous nucleation and sequentially the improving softening efficiency on basis of the curves in fig 5 a during softening reaction it was slight of the hardness removal increase in the first 10 min because at this stage hco3 ions in the solution limited the increase of ph inside the reactor subsequently the effluent hardness decreased rapidly due to the oh accumulation along with electrolyzing and after 1 hour it tended to be stable in this duration new nucleus creation crystal growth and particle precipitation occurred simultaneously and were in dynamic equilibrium however according to the precipitation dissolution equilibrium controlled by thermodynamics the hardness in the effluent should ideally be at a lower level when the measured ph value was reached in the reactor rather than still a certain amount of hardness in the effluent the incomplete softening might be count on the kinetics of the crystal growth process gal et al 2002 which limited the crystal forming resulting in part of hardness ions were driven out of the alkaline region by continuous water flow before precipitation the current density determined the rate of electrochemical reaction the experiment was conducted at a fixed water flow rate of 6 l h to investigate the hardness removal under different current densities and the result was displayed in fig 5 b the hardness removal increased rapidly with the increase of current densities when the current density reached 100 a m2 the increase slowed down the hardness removal was about 200 mg caco3 l which was only slightly higher than that at 80 a m2 and the softening efficiency calculated by the formula in text s1 just increased from 151 2 to 159 2 g caco3 h m2 fig 5 c therefore simply increasing the current density would not infinitely improve the treating efficiency the reason is that when the current was too high the oh ions generated by cathode would migrate along the electric field direction and partially neutralize with the h ions generated by anode yu et al 2019 which cannot be maximally retained by the diffusion of bubble motion legitimately current efficiency calculated by the formula in text s1 dropped as the current density increased fig 5 c at a current density of 20 a m2 the current efficiency was about 64 0 but it declined to about 43 5 when the current density was increased to 100 a m2 this indicated with the increase of current density more oh ions were wasted by neutralization reaction and proportion of oh utilized for the softening decreased even so the current efficiency of this reactor at high current densities 43 5 at 100 a m2 was still superior to that of existing membrane free electrochemical water softening research 20 0 at 100 a m2 fig s7 the effect of residence time was also evaluated for flow rates of 3 0 4 5 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 l h residence times were calculated to be 38 0 25 3 19 0 15 2 and 12 7 min respectively as fig s8 a shown with the increase of the residence time from 12 7 min to 38 0 min the hardness removal was enhanced from 102 mg caco3 l to 232 mg caco3 l the corresponding softening efficiency increases first and then decreases and the highest value was reached at flow rate of 6 l h residence time of 19 0 min accordingly fig s8 b this result was distinct from previous reports where the faster the flow rate the higher the softening efficiency yu et al 2019 the reason may be the high flow rate would dilute the alkaline region and insufficient hardness ions limit the crystallization when treating different solutions with various calcium hardness fig s9 as the initial hardness increased from 100 to 600 mg caco3 l the hardness removal elevated from 32 mg caco3 l to 243 mg caco3 l when the removal reached a plateau the enhanced initial concentration benefitted to improve the softening efficiency therefore it was deduced that inflow water with higher hardness was also helpful to bubble detachment 100 h continuous flow experiment was conducted to evaluate the long term running performance of this electrochemical reactor fig 5 d showed almost same hardness removal with the short time experiment after running for 100 h the hardness removal amount of the reactor was about 105 56 g caco3 or 14 00 kg caco3 per square meter electrode the voltage didn t show an upward trend when electrolyzing in a consistent current this indicated that the insulation layer covering the electrode may be negligible which would be a guarantee for continuous water softening the softening efficiency was compared with representative electrochemical water softening works fig 5 e tab s1 the softening efficiency of this study under given conditions was 212 9 g caco3 h m2 significantly higher than the existing membrane free electrochemical water softening technologies with a maximum value of 71 1 g caco3 h m2 and even higher than some membrane involved works for the traditional parallel electrode module bubbles and flowing water also may push oh diffusion but both oh and h follow free diffusion and they will meet each other in the bulk solution and then neutralize into water obviously the alkaline zone exists only in the thin layer on the cathode surface as a result heterogeneous nucleation confined to the cathode surface are dominant and softening efficiency is low in some studies ionic membranes were used to block neutralization process but their high price and short lifetime prevent their practical application however for the reactor in this work the unique structure guided bubble motion and water flow and then control the diffusion direction of oh ions consequently a membrane free oh aggregation zone was created rapidly the energy consumption of this electrochemical reactor was also found to be at a relatively low level fig s10 which was 4 29 kw h kg caco3 at 20 a m2 the traditional parallel arrangement of anode and cathode plates cannot greatly utilize the oh ions generated by cathode resulting in low current efficiency and wasted electrical energy these results indicated that compared with the traditional parallel arrangement of anode and cathode plates the designed reactor could realize the rapid diffusion of oh into the solution and complete the homogeneous nucleation thus accelerating the softening efficiency 4 conclusion a novel electrochemical reactor configuration was proposed for the energetic water softening driven by the upward moving bubbles and the downward flowing water oh ions diffused throughout the reactor and homogeneous nucleation of caco3 in bulk solution was demonstrated to replace heterogeneous nucleation on the cathode surface notably the ph values reached 10 6 in only 3 min of electrolysis and hardness removal via homogeneous nucleation accounted for 82 3 of the calcium hardness removal benefiting from the larger proportion of homogeneous nucleation the softening efficiency reached 212 9 g caco3 h m2 higher than the reported results the novel electrochemical reactor might generally be an inspiration for further innovation water softening technology with high softening efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

14619,electrochemistry is a potential method for water softening an essential disadvantage is oh ions from water electrolysis accumulate on cathode surface inducing the generation of the insulating caco3 layer and then interrupting the electrochemical reaction in order to propel oh diffusion into the bulk solution instead of aggregation at cathode we designed an electrochemical reactor whose electrodes were placed horizontally in the middle of the reactor and the bubbles created by water electrolysis move upward while the water flows downward the visual evidence displayed that the unique reactor structure allowed oh to spread to almost all the solution rapidly average ph value of bulk solution reached 10 6 in only 3 min therefore homogeneous nucleation of caco3 in bulk solution would take primary responsibility for water softening and the softening efficiency is up to 212 9 g caco3 h m2 higher than reported results the reactor is easy to scale up providing a new idea for the softening of circulating cooling water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water softening electrochemistry oh diffusion homogeneous nucleation softening efficiency 1 introduction scaling phenomenon is the inherent trouble of circulating cooling water system liu et al 2012 scale will obstruct pipes or interference heat exchange generating economic lost and explosion risks touir et al 2009 wang and liang 2017 the scaling phenomenon is usually caused by the supersaturated precipitation of caco3 or mg oh 2 seo et al 2010 to prevent scaling scale inhibitor neveux et al 2016 chemical precipitation c zhang et al 2020 ion exchanging apell and boyer 2010 and reverse osmosis elazhar et al al 2021 have been utilized however these technologies have inherent drawbacks scale inhibitors are usually chelating agents besides organic pollutants are brought into water they only delayed the precipitation without removing hardness ions chemical precipitation requires raising ph values firstly to promote precipitation of caco3 or mg oh 2 and then lowering ph values to neutral for recycling l zhang et al 2020 the cost of chemicals the large amount of precipitation and the elevation of salinity are all undesirable ion exchange has to employ high salinity water for backwashing which brings high cost and discharge burden karabelas et al 2020 reverse osmosis cannot avoid membrane pollution and high energy consumption antony et al 2011 thus alternative technologies need be explored electrochemical water softening is distinguished in scale prevention field by chemical free and easy automation yu et al 2019 zhi and zhang 2014 this method depends on oh generated by cathode during water electrolysis to convert hco3 to co3 2 further combining ca2 to compose caco3 or to straightly integrate with mg2 to produce mg oh 2 zhi and zhang 2014 most of these solid deposits on the cathode surface zeppenfeld 2011 resulting in the hardness decrease in water there are two points limiting the practical application of electrochemical softening one is electrode area dependence the typical deposition rate is only around 50 g caco3 h m2 hasson et al 2010 it requires s a large electrode area for practical application the other is that the cathodic surface will be covered by the insulating caco3 layer under the dominance of heterogeneous nucleation obviously electrochemical softening will be interrupted and cathode regeneration has to be done frequently gabrielli et al 2006 oh distribution determines the nucleation range of caco3 in a normal electrochemical reactor both cathode and anode are arranged perpendicularly to the horizontal plane during water electrolysis because there is no driving force most of oh ions accumulate on the cathodic surface and only a few diffuse towards the anode depending on the concentration gradient furthermore h ions produced on the anode will transfer to the cathode and neutralize oh ions in bulk solution so that only the cathode surface appears sufficient oh to induce caco3 precipitate gabrielli et al 2006 li et al 2020 if most of oh may be driven away from the cathodic surface and maintain a high concentration in the solution the homogeneous nucleation in solution is overwhelmingly superior to the heterogeneous nucleation on the cathodic surface kang et al 2023 in order to achieve this goal separators such as carbon felt yang et al 2022 ion exchange membrane hasson et al 2010 diaz nieto et al 2019 hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene microfiltration membrane liu et al 2022 and nylon mesh kang et al 2023 have been added between two electrodes to avoid neutralization of h and oh for an example using ion exchange membrane as separator a softening efficiency of 167 g caco3 h m2 was achieved hasson et al

al 2019 magnesium hardness removal was lower than calcium hardness and mostly adhered to the solid liquid interface 3 3 softening efficiency the above experiments demonstrated the function of bubble motion and water flow on propelling oh diffusion and intensifying homogeneous nucleation the results provided the precipitation may occur in bulk solution as long as ph values meet the requirement to evaluate the benefit of propelling oh diffusion on the softening efficiency the experiments were conducted with and without the central pipe in this electrochemical reactor the central pipe played the role to arrange the flow direction and avoid contact between oh and h as exhibited in fig 5 a for the reactor with the central pipe the hardness removed was around 190 mg caco3 l in 140 min while merely 25 mg caco3 l hardness was removed without the central pipe in the absence of the central pipe once oh ions diffused from the cathode to bulk solution they would soon be neutralized by h transferred from anode resulting in ph value of bulk solution lower than the requirements of precipitation and leaving the precipitating process confined to cathode surface as fig s6 shown if the central pipe was removed only imperceptible blue in the visualization of oh diffusion could be seen during 8 min of reaction process while with the central pipe it only took 30 s to see the distinct blue color fig 2 this result supported that without the central pipe oh ions diffused from the cathode would soon be neutralized by h transferred from anode resulting in near neutral solution this comparative experiment demonstrated that the promotion of oh diffusion by bubble motion and water flow was the reason for homogeneous nucleation and sequentially the improving softening efficiency on basis of the curves in fig 5 a during softening reaction it was slight of the hardness removal increase in the first 10 min because at this stage hco3 ions in the solution limited the increase of ph inside the reactor subsequently the effluent hardness decreased rapidly due to the oh accumulation along with electrolyzing and after 1 hour it tended to be stable in this duration new nucleus creation crystal growth and particle precipitation occurred simultaneously and were in dynamic equilibrium however according to the precipitation dissolution equilibrium controlled by thermodynamics the hardness in the effluent should ideally be at a lower level when the measured ph value was reached in the reactor rather than still a certain amount of hardness in the effluent the incomplete softening might be count on the kinetics of the crystal growth process gal et al 2002 which limited the crystal forming resulting in part of hardness ions were driven out of the alkaline region by continuous water flow before precipitation the current density determined the rate of electrochemical reaction the experiment was conducted at a fixed water flow rate of 6 l h to investigate the hardness removal under different current densities and the result was displayed in fig 5 b the hardness removal increased rapidly with the increase of current densities when the current density reached 100 a m2 the increase slowed down the hardness removal was about 200 mg caco3 l which was only slightly higher than that at 80 a m2 and the softening efficiency calculated by the formula in text s1 just increased from 151 2 to 159 2 g caco3 h m2 fig 5 c therefore simply increasing the current density would not infinitely improve the treating efficiency the reason is that when the current was too high the oh ions generated by cathode would migrate along the electric field direction and partially neutralize with the h ions generated by anode yu et al 2019 which cannot be maximally retained by the diffusion of bubble motion legitimately current efficiency calculated by the formula in text s1 dropped as the current density increased fig 5 c at a current density of 20 a m2 the current efficiency was about 64 0 but it declined to about 43 5 when the current density was increased to 100 a m2 this indicated with the increase of current density more oh ions were wasted by neutralization reaction and proportion of oh utilized for the softening decreased even so the current efficiency of this reactor at high current densities 43 5 at 100 a m2 was still superior to that of existing membrane free electrochemical water softening research 20 0 at 100 a m2 fig s7 the effect of residence time was also evaluated for flow rates of 3 0 4 5 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 l h residence times were calculated to be 38 0 25 3 19 0 15 2 and 12 7 min respectively as fig s8 a shown with the increase of the residence time from 12 7 min to 38 0 min the hardness removal was enhanced from 102 mg caco3 l to 232 mg caco3 l the corresponding softening efficiency increases first and then decreases and the highest value was reached at flow rate of 6 l h residence time of 19 0 min accordingly fig s8 b this result was distinct from previous reports where the faster the flow rate the higher the softening efficiency yu et al 2019 the reason may be the high flow rate would dilute the alkaline region and insufficient hardness ions limit the crystallization when treating different solutions with various calcium hardness fig s9 as the initial hardness increased from 100 to 600 mg caco3 l the hardness removal elevated from 32 mg caco3 l to 243 mg caco3 l when the removal reached a plateau the enhanced initial concentration benefitted to improve the softening efficiency therefore it was deduced that inflow water with higher hardness was also helpful to bubble detachment 100 h continuous flow experiment was conducted to evaluate the long term running performance of this electrochemical reactor fig 5 d showed almost same hardness removal with the short time experiment after running for 100 h the hardness removal amount of the reactor was about 105 56 g caco3 or 14 00 kg caco3 per square meter electrode the voltage didn t show an upward trend when electrolyzing in a consistent current this indicated that the insulation layer covering the electrode may be negligible which would be a guarantee for continuous water softening the softening efficiency was compared with representative electrochemical water softening works fig 5 e tab s1 the softening efficiency of this study under given conditions was 212 9 g caco3 h m2 significantly higher than the existing membrane free electrochemical water softening technologies with a maximum value of 71 1 g caco3 h m2 and even higher than some membrane involved works for the traditional parallel electrode module bubbles and flowing water also may push oh diffusion but both oh and h follow free diffusion and they will meet each other in the bulk solution and then neutralize into water obviously the alkaline zone exists only in the thin layer on the cathode surface as a result heterogeneous nucleation confined to the cathode surface are dominant and softening efficiency is low in some studies ionic membranes were used to block neutralization process but their high price and short lifetime prevent their practical application however for the reactor in this work the unique structure guided bubble motion and water flow and then control the diffusion direction of oh ions consequently a membrane free oh aggregation zone was created rapidly the energy consumption of this electrochemical reactor was also found to be at a relatively low level fig s10 which was 4 29 kw h kg caco3 at 20 a m2 the traditional parallel arrangement of anode and cathode plates cannot greatly utilize the oh ions generated by cathode resulting in low current efficiency and wasted electrical energy these results indicated that compared with the traditional parallel arrangement of anode and cathode plates the designed reactor could realize the rapid diffusion of oh into the solution and complete the homogeneous nucleation thus accelerating the softening efficiency 4 conclusion a novel electrochemical reactor configuration was proposed for the energetic water softening driven by the upward moving bubbles and the downward flowing water oh ions diffused throughout the reactor and homogeneous nucleation of caco3 in bulk solution was demonstrated to replace heterogeneous nucleation on the cathode surface notably the ph values reached 10 6 in only 3 min of electrolysis and hardness removal via homogeneous nucleation accounted for 82 3 of the calcium hardness removal benefiting from the larger proportion of homogeneous nucleation the softening efficiency reached 212 9 g caco3 h m2 higher than the reported results the novel electrochemical reactor might generally be an inspiration for further innovation water softening technology with high softening efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
