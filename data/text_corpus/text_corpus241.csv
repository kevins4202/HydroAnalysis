1205,this work presents a novel technique consisting in the use of yield stress fluids as blocking agents in porous media presenting pore scale heterogeneities the key feature of this method is that yield stress fluids only flow through the pores having a minimum size that depends on the applied pressure gradient these fluids remain immobile in more and more pores as the pressure gradient is decreased therefore the dimension of the pores which are invaded by the yield stress fluid can be controlled by adjusting the applied pressure gradient moreover yield stress fluids are highly suitable blocking agents given the extremely high viscosity values that they exhibit in the pores this allows for the diversion of the flow from greater to smaller pores during subsequent waterflooding stages thus enhancing pollutant removal from the flow paths of small hydraulic conductance a series of multiphase flow experiments were conducted in this study using well characterized cores of artificial a10 sintered silicate in these experiments semidilute aqueous solutions of xanthan gum biopolymer were used as yield stress fluids to block the greatest pores by doing so considerably more pollutant was recovered by waterflooding furthermore it was shown that an increase in polymer concentration does not always lead to a decrease in the size of the pores invaded by the blocking agent indeed concentrated polymer solutions generate higher pressure gradients throughout the porous medium which facilitates the invasion of small pores nevertheless depending on the value of the yield stress pressure gradient ratio they may also develop extremely high viscosities that slow down their flow through such small pores this work also presents a method to measure the volume of blocked pores using the results of tracer tests the reported results suggest that using a polymer solution developing a yield stress as a selective blocking agent is a promising technique for soil remediation

a high hydrocarbon content ambaye et al 2022 ministère de la transition écologique et solidaire 2022 these pollutants which are poorly miscible or immiscible in water represent a threat to health and the environment indeed the non aqueous liquid phases can infiltrate through the unsaturated zone of aquifers under the effect of gravity and capillary forces polluting the groundwater and the vadose zone therefore decontaminating these sites has become a challenging task in environmental engineering in contrast to field remediation techniques by excavation in situ methods do not require the movement of soil in a large number of in situ remedial treatments a fluid is injected in order to displace the pollutant through the interstices of the porous medium the transport of fluids in porous media depends on the geometry and topology of the microstructure consisting of a network of pore throats and bodies chatzis et al 1983 ross and kovscek 2002 tang et al 2019 as a consequence different microscopic phenomena such as viscous and capillary fingering limit the efficiency of remediation techniques dias and payatakes 1986 injecting non newtonian fluids during in situ remediation allows for an increase in the amount of recovered pollutant in many cases this can be either as a consequence of enhanced viscosifying and tension active effects or through blockage of the most permeable layers of a soil marie et al 2018 studied the generation and propagation of surfactant foam in the vadose zone these authors considered a wide range of soil properties using soils samples packed in glass columns the effects of the foam formation method soil permeability grain size wettability and shape factor of the soil particles were analysed and the results were compared to the use of xanthan gum solutions previous works have shown the relevance of using foams and polymer solutions as blocking agents to divert flow from highly permeable regions hirasaki et al 1997a 1997b kovscek and bertin 2003 muggeridge et al 2014 davarzani et al 2021 forey et al 2021 in a recent experimental work bouzid and fatin rouge 2022 studied the removal of dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl of chlorinated organic hydrocarbons in sandboxes with macro continuum scale heterogeneity for physically modelling an aquifer these authors assessed the increase in pollutant removal obtained by blocking the most permeable layers either with foam or with 2000 ppm xanthan gum solutions and subsequently flushing such a flushing was performed with a range of aqueous flushing fluids including pure water 100 200 ppm xanthan gum solutions and surfactant foams despite being slightly less efficient than foams as blocking agents xanthan gum solutions were shown to be more controllable and robust as flushing fluids blocking agents such as foams are commonly injected in stratified soils presenting macroscopic heterogeneity so that the less permeable layers can be flushed by water the idea of using a blocking agent to divert water flow is not new portois et al 2018 davarzani et al 2021 and this type of treatment has been shown to improve overall pollutant removal in contaminated sites with respect to traditional waterflooding however while traditional blocking agents can efficiently reduce pollutant trapping due to stratification type heterogeneities no method is currently available to specifically address microscopic trapping this represents a vital issue given that an important volume of residual oil still remains trapped in the waterflooded layers of a soil which are homogeneous from a macroscopic point of view due to the presence of pores of different sizes within a single layer therefore the possibility of selectively blocking the high conductance flow paths within the interstices of the soil and modifying the trajectory of the fluid through the pore space is deeply interesting the objective of this work is to propose a novel soil remediation method allowing for the pore size based discrimination of the flow paths available for waterflooding in macroscopically homogeneous media presenting pores of different sizes the original aspect of the proposed soil remediation strategy consists in saturating the high conductance flow paths with a fluid of extremely high viscosity by doing so the streamlines generated during subsequent injection of water will circumvent the plug of high viscosity fluid thus leading to enhanced pollutant removal from the flow paths of low hydraulic conductance in order to achieve this goal concentrated polymer solutions developing a yield stress were used as microscopic blocking agents the efficiency of such a remediation strategy was experimentally assessed by means of darcy scale experiments in which a yield stress fluid was injected through previously water flooded rock representative artificial cores at their residual oil saturation once the flow through pores of selected sizes were blocked further waterflooding was conducted in order to measure the increase in pollutant recovery this work can bring more insights into the interest of using xanthan gum solutions with concentrations ranging from 2000 to 8000 ppm to divert water flow to the initially unswept regions of highly permeable sintered materials 2 experiments 2 1 materials three analogous cylindrical samples of aerolith 10 sintered silicate a10 with a diameter d of 5 cm and a length l of 10 cm were used in these experiments a10 is a consolidated synthetic porous medium mainly constitued of silica 90 and alumina 5 with trace amounts of other oxides the cores are produced by fusing graded silica powder and have been widely used in previous studies eilertsen et al 1997 pentland 2010 fleury 2018 the ranges of porosities pore throat size distributions and permeabilities of a10 are similar to those of sand packs of uniform grain sizes morris and johnson 1967 moreover its petrophysical characteristics are reproducible hamon and vidal 1986 aluminium flow distributors were installed at the inlet and the outlet of the cores ion exchange between the aluminium injector plates and the sample was prevented by coating the inner surface of the plates with teflon a nonwetting epoxy resin was used to coat the lateral wall of each core the same wall was subsequently wrapped with epoxy coated fiberglass it should be noted that this lateral wall must be impervious and provide sufficient mechanical strength during the flow experiments the pore size distribution psd of a10 samples was determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry mip yield stress fluid porosimetry method ysm and x ray microtomography throat size as displayed in fig 1 from rodríguez de castro et al 2021 radius was adopted in the psd provided in fig 1 it is important to make a distinction here between a large pore section situated at a given position within a streamline and a flow path of high hydraulic conductance to illustrate this point an example of a 2d flow channel with varying cross section and the equivalent hydraulic aperture is provided in fig s1 of the supplementary material while the pore cross sectional area is a locally defined geometrical quantity the hydraulic conductance of a flow path is defined by taking into account the history of the flow from the inlet to the outlet of the sample this means that the hydraulic conductance of a flow path consisting of a set of pores connected in series is affected by the pore cross sectional areas of all these individual pores it is the hydrodynamic radius of a flow path rather than the geometrical radius of a single pore cross sectional area which determines whether the pores are blocked or not the distribution of local cross sectional area can be characterized by using pore network modelling approaches to do so a digital image of the analysed medium is a required input which can be provided by microtomography measurements however mip or better still yield stress fluid porosimetry method ysm can be used to directly measure the distribution of the hydraulic conductances this topic was specifically addressed in a previous work in which the pore size distribution of a set of artificial and real consolidated cores including a a10 sintered silicate core were experimentally characterized using mip ysm and microtomography rodríguez de castro et al 2021 a light mineral oil with a density of 833 kg m3 and a dynamic viscosity of 3 05 10 2 pa s at 20 c was used as pollutant phase previous research showed that semidilute xanthan gum solutions closely emulate the behaviour of yield stress fluid provided that polymer concentrations c p is sufficiently high rodríguez de castro et al 2016a 2016b rodríguez de castro 2019 herschel bulkley empirical equation is commonly used to represent the shear behaviour of yield stress fluids assuming simple shear and steady state conditions herschel bulkey equation herschel and bulkley 1926 can be expressed as follows 1 τ τ 0 k γ n for τ τ 0 γ 0 for τ τ 0 with τ being the shear stress γ being the shear rate and τ 0 k and n being the yield stress the consistency and the flow index of the fluid respectively three xanthan gum aqueous solutions were prepared with c p values of 2000 4000 and 8000 ppm and their bulk shear rheology was subsequently characterized to do so the rheograms of the three solutions were obtained using a rheometer equipped with a cone and plate geometry then these rheograms were fitted to eq 1 the values of the herschel bulkley parameters of the three injected polymer solutions are listed in table 1 also the measurements provided by the rheometer are presented in fig 2 together with the fits to eq 1 each rheological measurement was repeated three times the uncertainties in the values of τ 0 k and n listed in table 1 were calculated as the relative standard deviation of the obtained fitted values for the three repetitions of a same fluid 2 for τ 0 4 for k and 1 for n despite eq 1 providing a good fit to most experimental measurements see fig 2 a c e some divergences are observed at the lowest values of γ see the regions γ 1 s 1 in fig 2 b c f such differences can be explained by the long times required to attain steady state when γ is lower than 1 s 1 to illustrate this point fig s2 of the supplementary material displays the dependence of the measured viscosity below the yield stress on the sampling time for a 7000 ppm xanthan gum solution in agreement with these observations møller et al 2006 2009 experimentally showed that when a sample of yield stress fluid is subjected to stresses smaller than a critical stress the measured viscosity increases in time until the flow is halted altogether on the contrary for a stress only slightly above the critical stress the viscosity decreases with time towards a steady state value 2 2 procedure this section describes the experimental procedure followed in this work for ease of understanding fig 3 displays schemes and pictures of the experimental setups used during the waterflooding wf polymer injection pi and tracer tests that will be described in the following paragraphs the experimental setup used for wf and pi stages were identical apart from the pumped fluid water for wf polymer solution for pi the cores were saturated with co2 higher solubility in water than air prior to saturation with de ionized and filtered water to avoid air trapping during the experiments the water was filtered using an a type 0 2 μm water filter the pore volume v p was calculated by weighting the core before and after initial water saturation as 2 v p mass of water saturated core mass of co 2 saturated core density of water then porosity ε was calculated as 3 ε v p al with a being the cross sectional area of the core and l being its length k was measured by using darcy s law darcy 1856 in the absence of gravitational forces 4 q ka μ w l p with q being the injection flow rate and μ w being the dynamic viscosity of water at room temperature taken as 0 001 pa s p is the absolute value of the average pressure gradient calculated by dividing the total pressure drop p between the ends of the porous medium by l assuming 1d flow at this testing scale water was injected at different values of q through the core placed horizontally and p was measured then the intrinsic permeability k was calculated from the slope of the q p experimental data the reynolds number re was much lower than 1 in these measurements after the measurements of k the dispersion of the injection front in the a10 silicate samples was measured by injecting a tracer 20 000 ppm sodium chloride brine at the initial time the cores were fully saturated with water then the tracer was injected at a q corresponding to a péclet number pe 1 so as to ensure the homogeneous penetration of the fluid pe was defined as follows sheng 2011 5 pe u p d g d where u p is the average pore velocity d is the dispersion coefficient taken as 10 9 m2 s perkins and jonhston 1963 cussler 1997 and d g is the average solid grain size estimated from kozeny carman equation assuming spherical grains 6 d g 180 k 1 ε 2 ε 3 1 2 pe 1 is an arbitrary value that is chosen corresponding to a balance between diffusion and dispersion regimes leading to an applied q that allows for good experimental data recording u p can be calculated as u ε before drainage stage with u being darcy velocity darcy 1856 the relative density of the effluent fluid d was monitored until it reached the brine relative density value once the core was fully saturated with brine water was injected and d was monitored in the same manner the uncertainty of d measurements was 0 0002 the relative density of the fluid injected during the tracer tests either brine or water will be named d i while the relative density of the fluid initially saturating the core will be named d 0 when solving the convection diffusion equation for a semi infinite medium the evolution of the ratio d d 0 d i d 0 over time t i e the breakthrough curves btcs can be approximated by the following complementary error function sheng 2011 ogata and banks 1961 7 d d 0 d i d 0 1 2 erfc l u p t 2 ψt where ψ is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient the results of the tracer injection tests were fitted to eq 7 allowing for the determination of ψ and u p it must be highlighted that the values of u p provided by eq 7 were essentially identical to u p u ε used in eq 5 at this stage given that the core was fully saturated either with water or brine and the whole pore space was therefore accessible to the tracer however this will not necessarily be true during the next stages in presence of an immiscible fluid oil and a blocking agent given that a part of the pore space will become inaccessible to the tracer for this reason the pore volume being accessible to the tracer and water will be henceforth calculated as 8 v p ql u p with u p being the pore velocity as provided by the adjustment of the experimentally measured btc to eq 7 the next step after single phase flow consisted in draining the mineral oil through the porous samples at a flow rate of 1 v p per hour the resulting water and oil saturations were measured at the steady state as well as the effective oil permeability k o water and oil saturations after drainage s wi and s or dr were obtained from mass balance by monitoring the mass of effluent with an electronic precision balance the calculated saturation values were confirmed by measuring the volume of oil and water in the graduated cylinder used to collect the effluents fig 3 these volumes were measured once the steady state was reached and oil injection was stopped after the drainage stage slow imbibition of water through the cores was performed at a low flow rate of 0 3 m day in order to emulate the invasion of the polluted region of a soil by underground water the resulting phase saturations s or imb and s w imb and the effective water permeability k w were also measured as for the drainage stage and a tracer test was conducted for two of the three investigated cores a10 2 and 3 to determine the accessible pore volume to water v p imb and the value of ψ imb the end of slow imbibition constituted the starting point of the remediation operations and the residual pollutant saturation s or at this stage was used as the reference to calculate cumulative recovery in the subsequent stages the previous preliminary operations were followed by four initial wf stages wf 1 to 4 in which the capillary number was progressively increased and the incremental oil recovery was measured at the steady state the values of q used during the initial wf stages were 25 ml h for wf 1 50 ml h for wf 2 100 ml h for wf 3 and 500 ml h for wf 4 these values of q corresponded to u equal to 3 54 10 6 m s 7 07 10 6 m s 1 41 10 5 m s and 7 07 10 5 m s respectively once no extra pollutant could be removed through wf k w was measured and a tracer test was performed to measure v p wf4 and ψ wf4 then a polymer solution in high concentration was injected at q 1 2 ml h u 1 70 10 7 m s so as to block the high hydraulic conductance flow paths the 8000 4000 and 2000 ppm xanthan gum solutions were injected through the samples named a10 1 a10 2 and a10 3 respectively in the current study no slip condition was assumed at the boundary between the fluids and the solid grain during flow through the porous medium when injected at a given p the herschel bulkley fluid only travels from one end of the sample to the other through the flow paths presenting a critical hydrodynamic radius r 0 calculated as ambari et al 1990 rodríguez de castro et al 2014 9 r 0 2 τ 0 p eq 9 can be deduced from momentum balance under equilibrium state applied to the flow of a herschel bulkley fluid assuming no slip condition consequently it is in principle possible to select the hydrodynamic radius of the flow paths that will be blocked by injecting the yield stress fluid at a controlled value of p p l after polymer injection pi subsequent wf stages were performed wf 5 to 8 and the increase in pollutant recovery was again monitored the values of q used during the final wf stages were 1 2 ml h for wf 5 6 ml h for wf 6 50 ml h for wf 7 and 500 ml h for wf 8 these values of q corresponded to u equal to 1 70 10 7 m s 8 49 10 7 m s 7 07 10 6 m s and 7 07 10 5 m s respectively the btcs were also measured after wf 8 by performing a tracer test in order to determine v p wf8 p between the inlet and the outlet of the core was continuously measured during pi and wf stages described in this subsection different injection flow rates were used for wf 5 to wf 7 as compared to wf 1 to 3 the reason is that p generated after pi is much higher than that obtained in the first wf series this is due to the high viscosity of the yield stress fluid using the same q in wf 5 as in wf 1 would be more costly in the real application and might produce leaks in the experimental setup used in this work it was decided to progressively increase q from wf 5 in which the pi flow rate was used to wf 8 in which wf 4 flow rate was used this led to progressive replacement of partially mobilized yield stress fluid and oil by water thus generating moderate p the relative standard deviation of the p measurements was close to 1 the room temperature was kept constant at 20 c 0 1 c during all the experiments capillary number ca will be used to present and analyze the results of the current experiments in this work it was decided to define a local ca in the pores open to water flow using the average interstitial velocity u p as characteristic velocity 10 ca u p μ w σ with σ being the interfacial tension between the light mineral oil and water taken as 31 mn m 1 it is worth mentioning that the values of ca after the injection of the blocking agent are expected to be different to those obtained in the initial wf stages for a given value of u indeed the effective cross sectional area of water flow decreases as a consequence of some pores being blocked therefore u p can be estimated to be roughly 11 u p u ε 1 s or s ysf using the residual saturation of pollutant s or and the saturation of the yield stress fluid s ysf selected in this work such an increase in ca within the flow paths of low hydraulic conductance should result in increased p which may lead to pollutant ganglia mobilization and or fragmentation stegemeier 1974 re was calculated using the average pore diameter as characteristic length the highest value of re used in these experiments was 4 10 6 the core characteristics and the values of the effective permeabilities and longitudinal dispersion coefficients measured at the different stages of the experiments are listed in table 2 it can be seen in table 2 that all the analysed cores had similar k and ε values the values of k o and k w after drainage and slow imbibition respectively were also similar the procedure to calculate s ysf and s or will be explained below and the obtained values will be compared and analysed cumulative recovery at a given stage i will be defined as 12 r i 1 s or i s or imb where s or imb is the residual saturation of the trapped pollutant after slow water imbibition and s or i is the residual saturation of pollutant after the considered stage i the incremental recovery at each stage will be defined as 13 r i s or i 1 s or i s or imb a flow chart showing the different stages of the experimental procedure and the physical quantities measured at each step is provided in fig s3 of the supplementary material 3 results the evolution of r i during the different stages of the experimental procedure presented in subsection 2 2 is shown in fig 4 a r i is represented in fig 4 b for example r wf5 40 in core a10 1 means that 40 of the initial pollutant was recovered from wf 1 to wf 5 r wf1 r wf2 r wf3 0 r wf4 31 7 r pi 2 9 and r wf5 5 4 it can be observed that no significant pollutant recovery is obtained during the initial wf stages wf 1 to 3 these stages correspond to the lowest values of ca 5 10 5 to 2 10 6 however an important amount of pollutant is recovered during wf 4 at 500 ml h which corresponds to ca 8 10 6 according to eq 10 this agrees with previous modelling studies based on percolation theory larson et al 1977 which predict a constant s or at low ca followed by a monotonic decrease in s or as ca is increased almost negligible increase in pollutant recovery was observed during pi which may suggest that the blocking agent invaded the flow paths which had already been cleaned by initial wf fig 4 also shows that the s or is efficiently reduced during the successive wf stages wf 5 to 8 following pi for all the tested polymer solutions for example pollutant recovery attained 84 when an 8000 ppm was used in the pi stage consequently an extra recovery of 52 was obtained after injecting the yield stress fluid it is reminded that this percentage is calculated with respect to the volume of residual oil after initial slow imbibition this shows the interest of the proposed remediation method a lenormand type diagram in fig a1 of the appendix figure 5 presents the results of the tracer tests performed before drainage after wf 4 and after wf 8 the black and blue btcs shown in fig 5 a c e were fitted to eq 7 to calculate the values of ψ before drainage and after wf4 ψ wf4 and the results are listed in table 2 the btcs measured after slow imbibition are not shown in the manuscript but the obtained values of ψ imb can be consulted in table 2 the shape of the btcs obtained after wf 8 red btcs in fig 5 was significantly different to the other btcs for this reason these btcs were not fitted to eq 7 and will be analysed separately it is reminded that three liquid phases are present in the pores after wf 8 oil water and polymer solution the different shape of the btc may be either a consequence of a redistribution of oil and water phases after the injection of the blocking agent or an increased heterogeneity of the effective hydrodynamic radius available for water flow this aspect requires further investigation as it cannot be clearly discerned from core scale experiments however important information can still be extracted from this btc as will be explained below thorough inspection of table 2 shows no important increase in k w between initial slow imbibition and wf 4 e g k w 1 65 10 12 m2 after slow imbibition and k w wf4 1 97 10 12 m2 for a10 1 indeed despite the significant pollutant recovery obtained during wf 4 k w wf4 is still far from the intrinsic permeability value of the sample k 8 67 10 12 m2 for a10 1 permeability value is mainly controlled by the size of the pore constrictions pore throats in which most pressure drop is generated therefore the fact that k w wf4 is much lower than k may be a consequence of oil ganglia still occupying a substantial portion of the largest pore sections throughout the flow paths after wf 4 diverting water flow to smaller constrictions it is also observed that the order of magnitude of ψ was 10 9 m2 s for the three cores these values remained similar after wf 4 apart from a10 2 for which a significant increase was observed after slow imbibition ψ imb 1 75 10 8 m2 s this is consistent with the higher s or obtained after this stage for a10 2 as can be seen in table 3 this table lists the phase saturations at each stage the injected volume and the ca the value of s or measured after wf 4 named s or wf4 was calculated from the horizontal shift between the initial btc before drainage and the one obtained after wf 4 as displayed in fig 5 a c e in order words 14 s or wf 4 v p v p wf 4 v p with v p being the total pore volume and v p wf4 being the volume of pores accessible to tracer after wf 4 the s or wf4 values obtained in this manner were in good agreement with the ones obtained through mass balance of the effluents using the volume of oil and water measured in the graduate cylinders the uncertainty of the measurements of oil volume in the effluents using the graduate cylinders was 0 5 ml s or at the final stage named s or wf8 was calculated by subtracting the volume of oil recovered in the effluents from wf 5 to wf 8 measured in the graduate cylinders from the volume of oil after wf 4 s or wf4 v p and then dividing by v p the expected btc if no pore volume had been blocked by polymer was calculated by manually shifting the initial btc to the left by a distance of s or wf8 such expected btc correspond to the dashed lines in fig 5 b d f as can be observed in fig 5 the shape of the btc after wf8 is significantly different to the one of the other btcs and is not well described by the complementary error function given by eq 7 for this reason the total pore volume being accessible to the tracer after wf 8 v p wf8 was calculated as explained in the appendix fig a2 then the fraction of the pore volume being saturated with the yield stress fluid named s ysf was calculated from the difference between the expected volume of pores accessible to the tracer after wf 8 if no pore volume had been blocked by the yield stress fluid and v p wf8 as shown in fig 5 b d f the obtained values of s ysf and s or at all intermediate stages are listed in table 3 these values were used to correct the effective u p used in the calculation of ca as explained above the obtained values of ca are also listed in table 3 in order to assess whether the effects of miscibility of water and polymer solution on the measured quantities were significant or not the btcs obtained after wf 8 when using 20 000 ppm brine more concentrated than the polymer solutions and water less concentrated than the polymer solutions were compared in fig 6 a different btcs would be expected for brine and water injection in presence of significant dilution of the polymer solution in the tracer indeed if polymer solution dilution was important the increase in d d 0 d i d 0 during brine btc would be slower as the effluents would first contain a mixture of brine 20 000 ppm and a less concentrated fluid 2000 to 8000 ppm in contrast the increase in d d 0 d i d 0 during water btc would be faster due to dilution of the more concentrated fluid 2000 to 8000 ppm in water 0 ppm however both curves overlap indicating that the effects of miscibility are not significant furthermore a steady state p was obtained at the end of wf 8 as shown in fig 6 b p should evolve without attaining a steady state if miscibility effects were important contrarily to what was observed also viscosity of the effluents was controlled after wf 8 and the measured value was similar to μ w a key feature of the results is that the lowest values of s or wf8 were obtained for c p 8000 ppm i e for the more concentrated polymer solution it can also be observed that s or wf8 was not always reduced by increasing c p in order to elucidate the reasons for this behaviour the value of r 0 eq 9 should be first determined for the different polymer solutions this can be done through inspection of p between the ends of the sample as measured during pi an example of p evolution for pi and wf 4 to 8 is provided in fig 6 b corresponding to the a10 2 sample the final value of p before pi stops named p c was deduced from these curves p is expressed in absolute value and is listed in table 3 then r 0 was calculated by using eq 9 with p p c l the obtained values were r 0 10 9 μm 26 7 μm and 20 5 μm for the 8000 ppm 4000 ppm and 2000 ppm solutions respectively the yield stress fluid was not expected to flow from one end to the other of the sample through the flow paths having a hydrodynamic radius smaller than r 0 it should be noted that q was controlled 1 2 ml h instead of p during pi the three polymer solutions were injected using the same q therefore p c was higher for the higher c p fluids with higher c p develop higher viscosities this increase in p c when increasing c p can be counterbalanced by the increase in τ 0 when using eq 9 to calculate r 0 consequently even if p c must increase with increasing c p r 0 does not necessarily do the same this explains that the highest value of r 0 was obtained for the intermediate c p it can also be deduced from the psds presented in fig 1 that very few pores present a radius 26 7 μm the preceding observation suggests that the 4000 ppm solution will only flow from one end to the other of the core through a very limited number of flow paths leading to its accumulation within the core this is consistent with the higher values of s ysf obtained for the 4000 ppm solution the lower recovery values obtained for the 4000 ppm solution may therefore be explained by non selective blockage of the high conductance flow paths due to polymer accumulation to facilitate the analysis fig 7 shows the values of r 0 s ysf and s or wf8 for the different values of c p the three quantities have a similar dependence on c p reaching a maximum for 4000 ppm the values of k w measured after wf 8 named k wf8 are also consistent with the preceding observations as can be observed in fig 7 d higher k wf8 values correspond to the cases in which s ysf is lower it should also be outlined that the value of ca was altered after polymer blockage for water injection under the same q as deduced from table 3 and highlighted in the appendix fig a3 4 devised remediation strategy capillary pressure p c can be defined as the pressure difference p 1 p 2 existing between two neighbouring points located on either side of the interface between a non wetting fluid 1 and a wetting fluid 2 under equilibrium conditions young laplace equation expresses the relationship between p c σ and the principal radii of curvature in the case of a cylindrical duct of radius r e g an idealized pore this relationship can be written as 15 p c 2 σcosθ rt with θ being the contact angle and t being the tortuosity factor stegemeier 1974 the variables in eq 15 are displayed in a schematic plot presented in fig s4 of the supplementary material the displacement of a non wetting contaminant by a wetting remediation agent through a medium with pores of different sizes will now be considered in particular the case of a non aqueous phase liquid napl spill will be used to illustrate the devised remediation strategy given that capillarity and wettability play a central role in trapping mechanisms at the microscale the use of simple model pore networks such as pore doublet models pdm can be revealing they may be formed by an arrangement of a large capillary tube branched off with a narrower one chatzis and dullien 1983 sorbie et al 1995 to consider the capillary overflow between both scales more complex pdm considering continuous connected pore doublets were proposed in a previous theoretical study wielhorski et al 2013 in our study and for the sake of understanding it will be assumed that the porous medium can be represented by a bundle of parallel unconnected pore doublets with different pore sizes and hydraulic conductances as schematized in fig 8 a in this model each pore doublet represents a flow path with a given hydraulic conductance the hydraulic conductance of a flow path i i 1 2 3 8 in fig 8 a can be defined as 16 g i 1 8 μ π r i 4 l i with r i being the radius of a straight cylindrical pore of constant cross sectional area which produces the same pressure drop as the pore doublet under a given flow rate hydrodynamic radius chauveteau et al 1996 and l i being the length of the flow path in the main flow direction given that μ is fluid dependent the quantity g i is sometimes used to analyze the effects of microscopic geometry on the hydraulic conductance of the considered duct rodríguez de castro and goyeau 2021 17 g i 1 8 π r i 4 l i g i μ after a napl spill the pollutant is drained through the soil displacing the air of the unsaturated zone of the aquifer and eventually attaining the water table or a low permeability layer the subsequent movement of the water table may result in slow i e capillary driven imbibition of water through the zone occupied by the napl when the water napl displacement front encounters a pore doublet the pollutant is expected to get trapped in the pore of largest cross sectional area due to spontaneous imbibition through the small pores and insufficient viscous pressure drop between the ends of the blob to cause mobilization in the considered bundle of parallel unconnected pore doublets model the resulting phase distribution after slow imbibition can be assimilated to the one presented in fig 8 b to displace the trapped non wetting phase from a pore the viscous pressure drop across the non wetting ganglion must exceed p c stegemeier 1974 given by eq 15 it is worth highlighting that the configuration schematized in fig 8 b i e the situation after slow imbibition was considered to be the starting point of the treatments presented in the current experiments traditional wf consists in injecting water through the polluted soil at increasing values of ca in order to achieve either mobilization or fragmentation and posterior mobilization of the trapped hydrocarbon ganglia however the efficiency of traditional wf is impaired by the generation of viscous fingering through the high conductance flow paths of the porous medium due to the unfavourable viscosity ratio this leads to oil only being removed from the high conductance flow paths as illustrated in fig 8 c it will therefore be useful to block such high conductance flow paths so that water flow can concentrate on the rest of the pore space the distribution of the liquid phases after the injection of the yield stress fluid is schematized in fig 8 d with the yield stress fluid occupying the high conductance flow paths to illustrate this point fig 9 shows the velocity maps computed in a previous work rodríguez de castro et al 2020 for the single phase flow of a yield stress through a 2d sand pack once the high conductance flow paths have been blocked subsequent wf is expected to be diverted to the flow paths in which most residual pollutant remains trapped after the initial wf fig 8 e it should be noted that in the pi stage of the devised strategy other fluid phases occupy the pores during the injection of the yield stress fluid multiphase flow therefore under flow rate controlled conditions p is expected to evolve until no further change of phases distribution occurs for this reason eq 9 can be used to determine the value of r 0 only once the steady state has been attained in the pi stage however such steady state condition requires the injection of a large volume of yield stress fluid in practice costly soil remediation operations are usually discarded the injection of yield stress fluids such as concentrated polymer solutions is often expensive as compared to water injection because of the cost of the chemicals and the high pressures involved the interested reader can consult the review of muggeridge et al 2014 for budgeting of a field polymer injection operation with the objective of developing a cost effective strategy the injected volume of yield stress fluid has been limited to 0 7 vp with vp being the total volume of the pores this means that polymer injection was manually stopped after the injection of 0 7 vp in our experiments 0 7 vp was also very close to the volume of water saturating the cores before polymer injection r 0 was calculated with eq 9 by using the final value of p before pi stops named p c however the value of r 0 thus obtained can only be regarded as a rough estimate 5 conclusions and prospects core flooding experiments were conducted in this work on a set of sintered porous samples presenting a well characterized microstructure and exhibiting a range of different pore dimensions after initial pollutant drainage slow water imbibition and waterflooding a yield stress fluid was used to block the high hydraulic conductance flow paths with the aim of diverting the flow of subsequently injected water and improving pollutant recovery water and aqueous polymer solutions with concentrations ranging from 2000 to 8000 ppm were used the range of injection flow rates went from 1 2 to 500 ml h and the capillary numbers during waterflooding ranged from 4 88 10 7 to 1 16 10 5 the present results show that the injection of a xanthan gum solution acting as a yield stress fluid can considerably improve the amount of pollutant being recovered in the considered configuration the main conclusions are summarized below the devised strategy allows for a significant reduction in residual pollutant saturation for the three investigated yield stress fluids the most concentrated polymer solution provides the highest pollutant recovery a method to measure the volume of blocked pores using the results of tracer tests performed at the initial and final stages of the procedure has been presented flow rate controlled experiments do not guarantee a decrease in the size of the blocked flow paths by increasing polymer concentration local capillary number is affected by the modification of the effective cross sectional area available for fluid flow this effective area is reduced by the presence of the blocking agent and increased by progressive pollutant removal selective pore blocking with yield stress fluids constitutes a promising novel method for soil remediation as it provides a means to decide on the characteristic dimension of the flow paths being invaded by a remediation agent water was used in this work but other agents can be explored the size of the blocked pores can be deliberately selected by controlling the maximum value of p allowed during polymer injection therefore injecting alternating slugs of polymer and water under increasing pressures may be an interesting strategy allowing for the progressive removal of pollutant in the flow paths available for water flow these results must now be extended to other types of consolidated media presenting different degrees of wettability microstructural heterogeneity and different pore sizes furthermore the blocking effect which has been characterized at the core scale must be further investigated by means of specific pore scale experiments in this sense microfluidic devices and pore scale numerical simulations could serve in future works to shed more light on the dynamics of

image a 2 comparison of ca obtained by wf before and after polymer blockage two wf stages under the same q wf 4 and wf 8 led to different values of ca due to polymer blockage for example an increase of 31 in the value of ca was observed between wf 4 and wf 8 for 4000 ppm however such an increase was not observed for 8000 ppm and 2000 ppm because the pi induced decrease in flow conductible cross sectional area was counterbalanced by pollutant mobilization smaller values of s or wf4 and s or wf8 fig a3 ca obtained during wf 4 black symbols and wf 8 red symbols for the different samples a10 1

example an increase of 31 in the value of ca was observed between wf 4 and wf 8 for 4000 ppm however such an increase was not observed for 8000 ppm and 2000 ppm because the reduction of available cross sectional area for fluid flow resulting from polymer blockage was counterbalanced by pollutant mobilization unlabelled image 
1205,this work presents a novel technique consisting in the use of yield stress fluids as blocking agents in porous media presenting pore scale heterogeneities the key feature of this method is that yield stress fluids only flow through the pores having a minimum size that depends on the applied pressure gradient these fluids remain immobile in more and more pores as the pressure gradient is decreased therefore the dimension of the pores which are invaded by the yield stress fluid can be controlled by adjusting the applied pressure gradient moreover yield stress fluids are highly suitable blocking agents given the extremely high viscosity values that they exhibit in the pores this allows for the diversion of the flow from greater to smaller pores during subsequent waterflooding stages thus enhancing pollutant removal from the flow paths of small hydraulic conductance a series of multiphase flow experiments were conducted in this study using well characterized cores of artificial a10 sintered silicate in these experiments semidilute aqueous solutions of xanthan gum biopolymer were used as yield stress fluids to block the greatest pores by doing so considerably more pollutant was recovered by waterflooding furthermore it was shown that an increase in polymer concentration does not always lead to a decrease in the size of the pores invaded by the blocking agent indeed concentrated polymer solutions generate higher pressure gradients throughout the porous medium which facilitates the invasion of small pores nevertheless depending on the value of the yield stress pressure gradient ratio they may also develop extremely high viscosities that slow down their flow through such small pores this work also presents a method to measure the volume of blocked pores using the results of tracer tests the reported results suggest that using a polymer solution developing a yield stress as a selective blocking agent is a promising technique for soil remediation

a high hydrocarbon content ambaye et al 2022 ministère de la transition écologique et solidaire 2022 these pollutants which are poorly miscible or immiscible in water represent a threat to health and the environment indeed the non aqueous liquid phases can infiltrate through the unsaturated zone of aquifers under the effect of gravity and capillary forces polluting the groundwater and the vadose zone therefore decontaminating these sites has become a challenging task in environmental engineering in contrast to field remediation techniques by excavation in situ methods do not require the movement of soil in a large number of in situ remedial treatments a fluid is injected in order to displace the pollutant through the interstices of the porous medium the transport of fluids in porous media depends on the geometry and topology of the microstructure consisting of a network of pore throats and bodies chatzis et al 1983 ross and kovscek 2002 tang et al 2019 as a consequence different microscopic phenomena such as viscous and capillary fingering limit the efficiency of remediation techniques dias and payatakes 1986 injecting non newtonian fluids during in situ remediation allows for an increase in the amount of recovered pollutant in many cases this can be either as a consequence of enhanced viscosifying and tension active effects or through blockage of the most permeable layers of a soil marie et al 2018 studied the generation and propagation of surfactant foam in the vadose zone these authors considered a wide range of soil properties using soils samples packed in glass columns the effects of the foam formation method soil permeability grain size wettability and shape factor of the soil particles were analysed and the results were compared to the use of xanthan gum solutions previous works have shown the relevance of using foams and polymer solutions as blocking agents to divert flow from highly permeable regions hirasaki et al 1997a 1997b kovscek and bertin 2003 muggeridge et al 2014 davarzani et al 2021 forey et al 2021 in a recent experimental work bouzid and fatin rouge 2022 studied the removal of dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl of chlorinated organic hydrocarbons in sandboxes with macro continuum scale heterogeneity for physically modelling an aquifer these authors assessed the increase in pollutant removal obtained by blocking the most permeable layers either with foam or with 2000 ppm xanthan gum solutions and subsequently flushing such a flushing was performed with a range of aqueous flushing fluids including pure water 100 200 ppm xanthan gum solutions and surfactant foams despite being slightly less efficient than foams as blocking agents xanthan gum solutions were shown to be more controllable and robust as flushing fluids blocking agents such as foams are commonly injected in stratified soils presenting macroscopic heterogeneity so that the less permeable layers can be flushed by water the idea of using a blocking agent to divert water flow is not new portois et al 2018 davarzani et al 2021 and this type of treatment has been shown to improve overall pollutant removal in contaminated sites with respect to traditional waterflooding however while traditional blocking agents can efficiently reduce pollutant trapping due to stratification type heterogeneities no method is currently available to specifically address microscopic trapping this represents a vital issue given that an important volume of residual oil still remains trapped in the waterflooded layers of a soil which are homogeneous from a macroscopic point of view due to the presence of pores of different sizes within a single layer therefore the possibility of selectively blocking the high conductance flow paths within the interstices of the soil and modifying the trajectory of the fluid through the pore space is deeply interesting the objective of this work is to propose a novel soil remediation method allowing for the pore size based discrimination of the flow paths available for waterflooding in macroscopically homogeneous media presenting pores of different sizes the original aspect of the proposed soil remediation strategy consists in saturating the high conductance flow paths with a fluid of extremely high viscosity by doing so the streamlines generated during subsequent injection of water will circumvent the plug of high viscosity fluid thus leading to enhanced pollutant removal from the flow paths of low hydraulic conductance in order to achieve this goal concentrated polymer solutions developing a yield stress were used as microscopic blocking agents the efficiency of such a remediation strategy was experimentally assessed by means of darcy scale experiments in which a yield stress fluid was injected through previously water flooded rock representative artificial cores at their residual oil saturation once the flow through pores of selected sizes were blocked further waterflooding was conducted in order to measure the increase in pollutant recovery this work can bring more insights into the interest of using xanthan gum solutions with concentrations ranging from 2000 to 8000 ppm to divert water flow to the initially unswept regions of highly permeable sintered materials 2 experiments 2 1 materials three analogous cylindrical samples of aerolith 10 sintered silicate a10 with a diameter d of 5 cm and a length l of 10 cm were used in these experiments a10 is a consolidated synthetic porous medium mainly constitued of silica 90 and alumina 5 with trace amounts of other oxides the cores are produced by fusing graded silica powder and have been widely used in previous studies eilertsen et al 1997 pentland 2010 fleury 2018 the ranges of porosities pore throat size distributions and permeabilities of a10 are similar to those of sand packs of uniform grain sizes morris and johnson 1967 moreover its petrophysical characteristics are reproducible hamon and vidal 1986 aluminium flow distributors were installed at the inlet and the outlet of the cores ion exchange between the aluminium injector plates and the sample was prevented by coating the inner surface of the plates with teflon a nonwetting epoxy resin was used to coat the lateral wall of each core the same wall was subsequently wrapped with epoxy coated fiberglass it should be noted that this lateral wall must be impervious and provide sufficient mechanical strength during the flow experiments the pore size distribution psd of a10 samples was determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry mip yield stress fluid porosimetry method ysm and x ray microtomography throat size as displayed in fig 1 from rodríguez de castro et al 2021 radius was adopted in the psd provided in fig 1 it is important to make a distinction here between a large pore section situated at a given position within a streamline and a flow path of high hydraulic conductance to illustrate this point an example of a 2d flow channel with varying cross section and the equivalent hydraulic aperture is provided in fig s1 of the supplementary material while the pore cross sectional area is a locally defined geometrical quantity the hydraulic conductance of a flow path is defined by taking into account the history of the flow from the inlet to the outlet of the sample this means that the hydraulic conductance of a flow path consisting of a set of pores connected in series is affected by the pore cross sectional areas of all these individual pores it is the hydrodynamic radius of a flow path rather than the geometrical radius of a single pore cross sectional area which determines whether the pores are blocked or not the distribution of local cross sectional area can be characterized by using pore network modelling approaches to do so a digital image of the analysed medium is a required input which can be provided by microtomography measurements however mip or better still yield stress fluid porosimetry method ysm can be used to directly measure the distribution of the hydraulic conductances this topic was specifically addressed in a previous work in which the pore size distribution of a set of artificial and real consolidated cores including a a10 sintered silicate core were experimentally characterized using mip ysm and microtomography rodríguez de castro et al 2021 a light mineral oil with a density of 833 kg m3 and a dynamic viscosity of 3 05 10 2 pa s at 20 c was used as pollutant phase previous research showed that semidilute xanthan gum solutions closely emulate the behaviour of yield stress fluid provided that polymer concentrations c p is sufficiently high rodríguez de castro et al 2016a 2016b rodríguez de castro 2019 herschel bulkley empirical equation is commonly used to represent the shear behaviour of yield stress fluids assuming simple shear and steady state conditions herschel bulkey equation herschel and bulkley 1926 can be expressed as follows 1 τ τ 0 k γ n for τ τ 0 γ 0 for τ τ 0 with τ being the shear stress γ being the shear rate and τ 0 k and n being the yield stress the consistency and the flow index of the fluid respectively three xanthan gum aqueous solutions were prepared with c p values of 2000 4000 and 8000 ppm and their bulk shear rheology was subsequently characterized to do so the rheograms of the three solutions were obtained using a rheometer equipped with a cone and plate geometry then these rheograms were fitted to eq 1 the values of the herschel bulkley parameters of the three injected polymer solutions are listed in table 1 also the measurements provided by the rheometer are presented in fig 2 together with the fits to eq 1 each rheological measurement was repeated three times the uncertainties in the values of τ 0 k and n listed in table 1 were calculated as the relative standard deviation of the obtained fitted values for the three repetitions of a same fluid 2 for τ 0 4 for k and 1 for n despite eq 1 providing a good fit to most experimental measurements see fig 2 a c e some divergences are observed at the lowest values of γ see the regions γ 1 s 1 in fig 2 b c f such differences can be explained by the long times required to attain steady state when γ is lower than 1 s 1 to illustrate this point fig s2 of the supplementary material displays the dependence of the measured viscosity below the yield stress on the sampling time for a 7000 ppm xanthan gum solution in agreement with these observations møller et al 2006 2009 experimentally showed that when a sample of yield stress fluid is subjected to stresses smaller than a critical stress the measured viscosity increases in time until the flow is halted altogether on the contrary for a stress only slightly above the critical stress the viscosity decreases with time towards a steady state value 2 2 procedure this section describes the experimental procedure followed in this work for ease of understanding fig 3 displays schemes and pictures of the experimental setups used during the waterflooding wf polymer injection pi and tracer tests that will be described in the following paragraphs the experimental setup used for wf and pi stages were identical apart from the pumped fluid water for wf polymer solution for pi the cores were saturated with co2 higher solubility in water than air prior to saturation with de ionized and filtered water to avoid air trapping during the experiments the water was filtered using an a type 0 2 μm water filter the pore volume v p was calculated by weighting the core before and after initial water saturation as 2 v p mass of water saturated core mass of co 2 saturated core density of water then porosity ε was calculated as 3 ε v p al with a being the cross sectional area of the core and l being its length k was measured by using darcy s law darcy 1856 in the absence of gravitational forces 4 q ka μ w l p with q being the injection flow rate and μ w being the dynamic viscosity of water at room temperature taken as 0 001 pa s p is the absolute value of the average pressure gradient calculated by dividing the total pressure drop p between the ends of the porous medium by l assuming 1d flow at this testing scale water was injected at different values of q through the core placed horizontally and p was measured then the intrinsic permeability k was calculated from the slope of the q p experimental data the reynolds number re was much lower than 1 in these measurements after the measurements of k the dispersion of the injection front in the a10 silicate samples was measured by injecting a tracer 20 000 ppm sodium chloride brine at the initial time the cores were fully saturated with water then the tracer was injected at a q corresponding to a péclet number pe 1 so as to ensure the homogeneous penetration of the fluid pe was defined as follows sheng 2011 5 pe u p d g d where u p is the average pore velocity d is the dispersion coefficient taken as 10 9 m2 s perkins and jonhston 1963 cussler 1997 and d g is the average solid grain size estimated from kozeny carman equation assuming spherical grains 6 d g 180 k 1 ε 2 ε 3 1 2 pe 1 is an arbitrary value that is chosen corresponding to a balance between diffusion and dispersion regimes leading to an applied q that allows for good experimental data recording u p can be calculated as u ε before drainage stage with u being darcy velocity darcy 1856 the relative density of the effluent fluid d was monitored until it reached the brine relative density value once the core was fully saturated with brine water was injected and d was monitored in the same manner the uncertainty of d measurements was 0 0002 the relative density of the fluid injected during the tracer tests either brine or water will be named d i while the relative density of the fluid initially saturating the core will be named d 0 when solving the convection diffusion equation for a semi infinite medium the evolution of the ratio d d 0 d i d 0 over time t i e the breakthrough curves btcs can be approximated by the following complementary error function sheng 2011 ogata and banks 1961 7 d d 0 d i d 0 1 2 erfc l u p t 2 ψt where ψ is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient the results of the tracer injection tests were fitted to eq 7 allowing for the determination of ψ and u p it must be highlighted that the values of u p provided by eq 7 were essentially identical to u p u ε used in eq 5 at this stage given that the core was fully saturated either with water or brine and the whole pore space was therefore accessible to the tracer however this will not necessarily be true during the next stages in presence of an immiscible fluid oil and a blocking agent given that a part of the pore space will become inaccessible to the tracer for this reason the pore volume being accessible to the tracer and water will be henceforth calculated as 8 v p ql u p with u p being the pore velocity as provided by the adjustment of the experimentally measured btc to eq 7 the next step after single phase flow consisted in draining the mineral oil through the porous samples at a flow rate of 1 v p per hour the resulting water and oil saturations were measured at the steady state as well as the effective oil permeability k o water and oil saturations after drainage s wi and s or dr were obtained from mass balance by monitoring the mass of effluent with an electronic precision balance the calculated saturation values were confirmed by measuring the volume of oil and water in the graduated cylinder used to collect the effluents fig 3 these volumes were measured once the steady state was reached and oil injection was stopped after the drainage stage slow imbibition of water through the cores was performed at a low flow rate of 0 3 m day in order to emulate the invasion of the polluted region of a soil by underground water the resulting phase saturations s or imb and s w imb and the effective water permeability k w were also measured as for the drainage stage and a tracer test was conducted for two of the three investigated cores a10 2 and 3 to determine the accessible pore volume to water v p imb and the value of ψ imb the end of slow imbibition constituted the starting point of the remediation operations and the residual pollutant saturation s or at this stage was used as the reference to calculate cumulative recovery in the subsequent stages the previous preliminary operations were followed by four initial wf stages wf 1 to 4 in which the capillary number was progressively increased and the incremental oil recovery was measured at the steady state the values of q used during the initial wf stages were 25 ml h for wf 1 50 ml h for wf 2 100 ml h for wf 3 and 500 ml h for wf 4 these values of q corresponded to u equal to 3 54 10 6 m s 7 07 10 6 m s 1 41 10 5 m s and 7 07 10 5 m s respectively once no extra pollutant could be removed through wf k w was measured and a tracer test was performed to measure v p wf4 and ψ wf4 then a polymer solution in high concentration was injected at q 1 2 ml h u 1 70 10 7 m s so as to block the high hydraulic conductance flow paths the 8000 4000 and 2000 ppm xanthan gum solutions were injected through the samples named a10 1 a10 2 and a10 3 respectively in the current study no slip condition was assumed at the boundary between the fluids and the solid grain during flow through the porous medium when injected at a given p the herschel bulkley fluid only travels from one end of the sample to the other through the flow paths presenting a critical hydrodynamic radius r 0 calculated as ambari et al 1990 rodríguez de castro et al 2014 9 r 0 2 τ 0 p eq 9 can be deduced from momentum balance under equilibrium state applied to the flow of a herschel bulkley fluid assuming no slip condition consequently it is in principle possible to select the hydrodynamic radius of the flow paths that will be blocked by injecting the yield stress fluid at a controlled value of p p l after polymer injection pi subsequent wf stages were performed wf 5 to 8 and the increase in pollutant recovery was again monitored the values of q used during the final wf stages were 1 2 ml h for wf 5 6 ml h for wf 6 50 ml h for wf 7 and 500 ml h for wf 8 these values of q corresponded to u equal to 1 70 10 7 m s 8 49 10 7 m s 7 07 10 6 m s and 7 07 10 5 m s respectively the btcs were also measured after wf 8 by performing a tracer test in order to determine v p wf8 p between the inlet and the outlet of the core was continuously measured during pi and wf stages described in this subsection different injection flow rates were used for wf 5 to wf 7 as compared to wf 1 to 3 the reason is that p generated after pi is much higher than that obtained in the first wf series this is due to the high viscosity of the yield stress fluid using the same q in wf 5 as in wf 1 would be more costly in the real application and might produce leaks in the experimental setup used in this work it was decided to progressively increase q from wf 5 in which the pi flow rate was used to wf 8 in which wf 4 flow rate was used this led to progressive replacement of partially mobilized yield stress fluid and oil by water thus generating moderate p the relative standard deviation of the p measurements was close to 1 the room temperature was kept constant at 20 c 0 1 c during all the experiments capillary number ca will be used to present and analyze the results of the current experiments in this work it was decided to define a local ca in the pores open to water flow using the average interstitial velocity u p as characteristic velocity 10 ca u p μ w σ with σ being the interfacial tension between the light mineral oil and water taken as 31 mn m 1 it is worth mentioning that the values of ca after the injection of the blocking agent are expected to be different to those obtained in the initial wf stages for a given value of u indeed the effective cross sectional area of water flow decreases as a consequence of some pores being blocked therefore u p can be estimated to be roughly 11 u p u ε 1 s or s ysf using the residual saturation of pollutant s or and the saturation of the yield stress fluid s ysf selected in this work such an increase in ca within the flow paths of low hydraulic conductance should result in increased p which may lead to pollutant ganglia mobilization and or fragmentation stegemeier 1974 re was calculated using the average pore diameter as characteristic length the highest value of re used in these experiments was 4 10 6 the core characteristics and the values of the effective permeabilities and longitudinal dispersion coefficients measured at the different stages of the experiments are listed in table 2 it can be seen in table 2 that all the analysed cores had similar k and ε values the values of k o and k w after drainage and slow imbibition respectively were also similar the procedure to calculate s ysf and s or will be explained below and the obtained values will be compared and analysed cumulative recovery at a given stage i will be defined as 12 r i 1 s or i s or imb where s or imb is the residual saturation of the trapped pollutant after slow water imbibition and s or i is the residual saturation of pollutant after the considered stage i the incremental recovery at each stage will be defined as 13 r i s or i 1 s or i s or imb a flow chart showing the different stages of the experimental procedure and the physical quantities measured at each step is provided in fig s3 of the supplementary material 3 results the evolution of r i during the different stages of the experimental procedure presented in subsection 2 2 is shown in fig 4 a r i is represented in fig 4 b for example r wf5 40 in core a10 1 means that 40 of the initial pollutant was recovered from wf 1 to wf 5 r wf1 r wf2 r wf3 0 r wf4 31 7 r pi 2 9 and r wf5 5 4 it can be observed that no significant pollutant recovery is obtained during the initial wf stages wf 1 to 3 these stages correspond to the lowest values of ca 5 10 5 to 2 10 6 however an important amount of pollutant is recovered during wf 4 at 500 ml h which corresponds to ca 8 10 6 according to eq 10 this agrees with previous modelling studies based on percolation theory larson et al 1977 which predict a constant s or at low ca followed by a monotonic decrease in s or as ca is increased almost negligible increase in pollutant recovery was observed during pi which may suggest that the blocking agent invaded the flow paths which had already been cleaned by initial wf fig 4 also shows that the s or is efficiently reduced during the successive wf stages wf 5 to 8 following pi for all the tested polymer solutions for example pollutant recovery attained 84 when an 8000 ppm was used in the pi stage consequently an extra recovery of 52 was obtained after injecting the yield stress fluid it is reminded that this percentage is calculated with respect to the volume of residual oil after initial slow imbibition this shows the interest of the proposed remediation method a lenormand type diagram in fig a1 of the appendix figure 5 presents the results of the tracer tests performed before drainage after wf 4 and after wf 8 the black and blue btcs shown in fig 5 a c e were fitted to eq 7 to calculate the values of ψ before drainage and after wf4 ψ wf4 and the results are listed in table 2 the btcs measured after slow imbibition are not shown in the manuscript but the obtained values of ψ imb can be consulted in table 2 the shape of the btcs obtained after wf 8 red btcs in fig 5 was significantly different to the other btcs for this reason these btcs were not fitted to eq 7 and will be analysed separately it is reminded that three liquid phases are present in the pores after wf 8 oil water and polymer solution the different shape of the btc may be either a consequence of a redistribution of oil and water phases after the injection of the blocking agent or an increased heterogeneity of the effective hydrodynamic radius available for water flow this aspect requires further investigation as it cannot be clearly discerned from core scale experiments however important information can still be extracted from this btc as will be explained below thorough inspection of table 2 shows no important increase in k w between initial slow imbibition and wf 4 e g k w 1 65 10 12 m2 after slow imbibition and k w wf4 1 97 10 12 m2 for a10 1 indeed despite the significant pollutant recovery obtained during wf 4 k w wf4 is still far from the intrinsic permeability value of the sample k 8 67 10 12 m2 for a10 1 permeability value is mainly controlled by the size of the pore constrictions pore throats in which most pressure drop is generated therefore the fact that k w wf4 is much lower than k may be a consequence of oil ganglia still occupying a substantial portion of the largest pore sections throughout the flow paths after wf 4 diverting water flow to smaller constrictions it is also observed that the order of magnitude of ψ was 10 9 m2 s for the three cores these values remained similar after wf 4 apart from a10 2 for which a significant increase was observed after slow imbibition ψ imb 1 75 10 8 m2 s this is consistent with the higher s or obtained after this stage for a10 2 as can be seen in table 3 this table lists the phase saturations at each stage the injected volume and the ca the value of s or measured after wf 4 named s or wf4 was calculated from the horizontal shift between the initial btc before drainage and the one obtained after wf 4 as displayed in fig 5 a c e in order words 14 s or wf 4 v p v p wf 4 v p with v p being the total pore volume and v p wf4 being the volume of pores accessible to tracer after wf 4 the s or wf4 values obtained in this manner were in good agreement with the ones obtained through mass balance of the effluents using the volume of oil and water measured in the graduate cylinders the uncertainty of the measurements of oil volume in the effluents using the graduate cylinders was 0 5 ml s or at the final stage named s or wf8 was calculated by subtracting the volume of oil recovered in the effluents from wf 5 to wf 8 measured in the graduate cylinders from the volume of oil after wf 4 s or wf4 v p and then dividing by v p the expected btc if no pore volume had been blocked by polymer was calculated by manually shifting the initial btc to the left by a distance of s or wf8 such expected btc correspond to the dashed lines in fig 5 b d f as can be observed in fig 5 the shape of the btc after wf8 is significantly different to the one of the other btcs and is not well described by the complementary error function given by eq 7 for this reason the total pore volume being accessible to the tracer after wf 8 v p wf8 was calculated as explained in the appendix fig a2 then the fraction of the pore volume being saturated with the yield stress fluid named s ysf was calculated from the difference between the expected volume of pores accessible to the tracer after wf 8 if no pore volume had been blocked by the yield stress fluid and v p wf8 as shown in fig 5 b d f the obtained values of s ysf and s or at all intermediate stages are listed in table 3 these values were used to correct the effective u p used in the calculation of ca as explained above the obtained values of ca are also listed in table 3 in order to assess whether the effects of miscibility of water and polymer solution on the measured quantities were significant or not the btcs obtained after wf 8 when using 20 000 ppm brine more concentrated than the polymer solutions and water less concentrated than the polymer solutions were compared in fig 6 a different btcs would be expected for brine and water injection in presence of significant dilution of the polymer solution in the tracer indeed if polymer solution dilution was important the increase in d d 0 d i d 0 during brine btc would be slower as the effluents would first contain a mixture of brine 20 000 ppm and a less concentrated fluid 2000 to 8000 ppm in contrast the increase in d d 0 d i d 0 during water btc would be faster due to dilution of the more concentrated fluid 2000 to 8000 ppm in water 0 ppm however both curves overlap indicating that the effects of miscibility are not significant furthermore a steady state p was obtained at the end of wf 8 as shown in fig 6 b p should evolve without attaining a steady state if miscibility effects were important contrarily to what was observed also viscosity of the effluents was controlled after wf 8 and the measured value was similar to μ w a key feature of the results is that the lowest values of s or wf8 were obtained for c p 8000 ppm i e for the more concentrated polymer solution it can also be observed that s or wf8 was not always reduced by increasing c p in order to elucidate the reasons for this behaviour the value of r 0 eq 9 should be first determined for the different polymer solutions this can be done through inspection of p between the ends of the sample as measured during pi an example of p evolution for pi and wf 4 to 8 is provided in fig 6 b corresponding to the a10 2 sample the final value of p before pi stops named p c was deduced from these curves p is expressed in absolute value and is listed in table 3 then r 0 was calculated by using eq 9 with p p c l the obtained values were r 0 10 9 μm 26 7 μm and 20 5 μm for the 8000 ppm 4000 ppm and 2000 ppm solutions respectively the yield stress fluid was not expected to flow from one end to the other of the sample through the flow paths having a hydrodynamic radius smaller than r 0 it should be noted that q was controlled 1 2 ml h instead of p during pi the three polymer solutions were injected using the same q therefore p c was higher for the higher c p fluids with higher c p develop higher viscosities this increase in p c when increasing c p can be counterbalanced by the increase in τ 0 when using eq 9 to calculate r 0 consequently even if p c must increase with increasing c p r 0 does not necessarily do the same this explains that the highest value of r 0 was obtained for the intermediate c p it can also be deduced from the psds presented in fig 1 that very few pores present a radius 26 7 μm the preceding observation suggests that the 4000 ppm solution will only flow from one end to the other of the core through a very limited number of flow paths leading to its accumulation within the core this is consistent with the higher values of s ysf obtained for the 4000 ppm solution the lower recovery values obtained for the 4000 ppm solution may therefore be explained by non selective blockage of the high conductance flow paths due to polymer accumulation to facilitate the analysis fig 7 shows the values of r 0 s ysf and s or wf8 for the different values of c p the three quantities have a similar dependence on c p reaching a maximum for 4000 ppm the values of k w measured after wf 8 named k wf8 are also consistent with the preceding observations as can be observed in fig 7 d higher k wf8 values correspond to the cases in which s ysf is lower it should also be outlined that the value of ca was altered after polymer blockage for water injection under the same q as deduced from table 3 and highlighted in the appendix fig a3 4 devised remediation strategy capillary pressure p c can be defined as the pressure difference p 1 p 2 existing between two neighbouring points located on either side of the interface between a non wetting fluid 1 and a wetting fluid 2 under equilibrium conditions young laplace equation expresses the relationship between p c σ and the principal radii of curvature in the case of a cylindrical duct of radius r e g an idealized pore this relationship can be written as 15 p c 2 σcosθ rt with θ being the contact angle and t being the tortuosity factor stegemeier 1974 the variables in eq 15 are displayed in a schematic plot presented in fig s4 of the supplementary material the displacement of a non wetting contaminant by a wetting remediation agent through a medium with pores of different sizes will now be considered in particular the case of a non aqueous phase liquid napl spill will be used to illustrate the devised remediation strategy given that capillarity and wettability play a central role in trapping mechanisms at the microscale the use of simple model pore networks such as pore doublet models pdm can be revealing they may be formed by an arrangement of a large capillary tube branched off with a narrower one chatzis and dullien 1983 sorbie et al 1995 to consider the capillary overflow between both scales more complex pdm considering continuous connected pore doublets were proposed in a previous theoretical study wielhorski et al 2013 in our study and for the sake of understanding it will be assumed that the porous medium can be represented by a bundle of parallel unconnected pore doublets with different pore sizes and hydraulic conductances as schematized in fig 8 a in this model each pore doublet represents a flow path with a given hydraulic conductance the hydraulic conductance of a flow path i i 1 2 3 8 in fig 8 a can be defined as 16 g i 1 8 μ π r i 4 l i with r i being the radius of a straight cylindrical pore of constant cross sectional area which produces the same pressure drop as the pore doublet under a given flow rate hydrodynamic radius chauveteau et al 1996 and l i being the length of the flow path in the main flow direction given that μ is fluid dependent the quantity g i is sometimes used to analyze the effects of microscopic geometry on the hydraulic conductance of the considered duct rodríguez de castro and goyeau 2021 17 g i 1 8 π r i 4 l i g i μ after a napl spill the pollutant is drained through the soil displacing the air of the unsaturated zone of the aquifer and eventually attaining the water table or a low permeability layer the subsequent movement of the water table may result in slow i e capillary driven imbibition of water through the zone occupied by the napl when the water napl displacement front encounters a pore doublet the pollutant is expected to get trapped in the pore of largest cross sectional area due to spontaneous imbibition through the small pores and insufficient viscous pressure drop between the ends of the blob to cause mobilization in the considered bundle of parallel unconnected pore doublets model the resulting phase distribution after slow imbibition can be assimilated to the one presented in fig 8 b to displace the trapped non wetting phase from a pore the viscous pressure drop across the non wetting ganglion must exceed p c stegemeier 1974 given by eq 15 it is worth highlighting that the configuration schematized in fig 8 b i e the situation after slow imbibition was considered to be the starting point of the treatments presented in the current experiments traditional wf consists in injecting water through the polluted soil at increasing values of ca in order to achieve either mobilization or fragmentation and posterior mobilization of the trapped hydrocarbon ganglia however the efficiency of traditional wf is impaired by the generation of viscous fingering through the high conductance flow paths of the porous medium due to the unfavourable viscosity ratio this leads to oil only being removed from the high conductance flow paths as illustrated in fig 8 c it will therefore be useful to block such high conductance flow paths so that water flow can concentrate on the rest of the pore space the distribution of the liquid phases after the injection of the yield stress fluid is schematized in fig 8 d with the yield stress fluid occupying the high conductance flow paths to illustrate this point fig 9 shows the velocity maps computed in a previous work rodríguez de castro et al 2020 for the single phase flow of a yield stress through a 2d sand pack once the high conductance flow paths have been blocked subsequent wf is expected to be diverted to the flow paths in which most residual pollutant remains trapped after the initial wf fig 8 e it should be noted that in the pi stage of the devised strategy other fluid phases occupy the pores during the injection of the yield stress fluid multiphase flow therefore under flow rate controlled conditions p is expected to evolve until no further change of phases distribution occurs for this reason eq 9 can be used to determine the value of r 0 only once the steady state has been attained in the pi stage however such steady state condition requires the injection of a large volume of yield stress fluid in practice costly soil remediation operations are usually discarded the injection of yield stress fluids such as concentrated polymer solutions is often expensive as compared to water injection because of the cost of the chemicals and the high pressures involved the interested reader can consult the review of muggeridge et al 2014 for budgeting of a field polymer injection operation with the objective of developing a cost effective strategy the injected volume of yield stress fluid has been limited to 0 7 vp with vp being the total volume of the pores this means that polymer injection was manually stopped after the injection of 0 7 vp in our experiments 0 7 vp was also very close to the volume of water saturating the cores before polymer injection r 0 was calculated with eq 9 by using the final value of p before pi stops named p c however the value of r 0 thus obtained can only be regarded as a rough estimate 5 conclusions and prospects core flooding experiments were conducted in this work on a set of sintered porous samples presenting a well characterized microstructure and exhibiting a range of different pore dimensions after initial pollutant drainage slow water imbibition and waterflooding a yield stress fluid was used to block the high hydraulic conductance flow paths with the aim of diverting the flow of subsequently injected water and improving pollutant recovery water and aqueous polymer solutions with concentrations ranging from 2000 to 8000 ppm were used the range of injection flow rates went from 1 2 to 500 ml h and the capillary numbers during waterflooding ranged from 4 88 10 7 to 1 16 10 5 the present results show that the injection of a xanthan gum solution acting as a yield stress fluid can considerably improve the amount of pollutant being recovered in the considered configuration the main conclusions are summarized below the devised strategy allows for a significant reduction in residual pollutant saturation for the three investigated yield stress fluids the most concentrated polymer solution provides the highest pollutant recovery a method to measure the volume of blocked pores using the results of tracer tests performed at the initial and final stages of the procedure has been presented flow rate controlled experiments do not guarantee a decrease in the size of the blocked flow paths by increasing polymer concentration local capillary number is affected by the modification of the effective cross sectional area available for fluid flow this effective area is reduced by the presence of the blocking agent and increased by progressive pollutant removal selective pore blocking with yield stress fluids constitutes a promising novel method for soil remediation as it provides a means to decide on the characteristic dimension of the flow paths being invaded by a remediation agent water was used in this work but other agents can be explored the size of the blocked pores can be deliberately selected by controlling the maximum value of p allowed during polymer injection therefore injecting alternating slugs of polymer and water under increasing pressures may be an interesting strategy allowing for the progressive removal of pollutant in the flow paths available for water flow these results must now be extended to other types of consolidated media presenting different degrees of wettability microstructural heterogeneity and different pore sizes furthermore the blocking effect which has been characterized at the core scale must be further investigated by means of specific pore scale experiments in this sense microfluidic devices and pore scale numerical simulations could serve in future works to shed more light on the dynamics of

image a 2 comparison of ca obtained by wf before and after polymer blockage two wf stages under the same q wf 4 and wf 8 led to different values of ca due to polymer blockage for example an increase of 31 in the value of ca was observed between wf 4 and wf 8 for 4000 ppm however such an increase was not observed for 8000 ppm and 2000 ppm because the pi induced decrease in flow conductible cross sectional area was counterbalanced by pollutant mobilization smaller values of s or wf4 and s or wf8 fig a3 ca obtained during wf 4 black symbols and wf 8 red symbols for the different samples a10 1

example an increase of 31 in the value of ca was observed between wf 4 and wf 8 for 4000 ppm however such an increase was not observed for 8000 ppm and 2000 ppm because the reduction of available cross sectional area for fluid flow resulting from polymer blockage was counterbalanced by pollutant mobilization unlabelled image 
1206,this study presents the use of organic gel forming material for the construction of hydraulic barriers in aquifer which can be easily removed after use experiments on the performance of the temporary hydraulic barrier during napl removal aquifer flushing were also conducted an aqueous solution of sodium alginate was injected into the horizontally oriented 2 dimensional flow chamber packed with sand followed by gelation using a calcium solution the alginate gel formed in the porous media produced a circular shape barrier 24 cm diameter 1 3 cm thickness that was successfully removed using sodium bicarbonate solution 1 0 m in 72 h whereas the gel was stable for 7 days during simulated groundwater flushing at the same flow rate as the sodium bicarbonate solution when circular hydraulic barriers 12 cm diameter each 14 cm apart were set on either side of the napl n hexane and pce mixture contaminated zone the increased water flux during water flushing resulted in significantly increased pce removal by almost 108 when a surfactant solution sodium dodecyl sulfate 0 037 was applied the influenced groundwater flow controlled by hydraulic barriers on the napl

marshall et al 2020a 2020b although biopolymers including sodium alginate have been investigated for their potential to contain contaminants or to keep contaminants from escaping the source zone in an aquifer little information is available on the effect of the biopolymer based hydraulic barriers on the groundwater flux and flux distribution in porous media some of the previous studies conducted experiments using 1 dimensional columns to measure the permeability of fluids through the sand packed columns e g marshall et al 2020a 2020b lamont et al 2020a 2020b no observations on the interaction between the barriers and groundwater flow domain have been reported while most previous studies focused on the formation of biopolymer based gel barriers the de gelation process to recover the hydrologic characteristics of the aquifers has received little attention the purpose of this study was to assess the potential of sodium alginate gel formed in the aquifer as a temporary hydraulic barrier to control the flow characteristics of the groundwater in the aquifer additionally the removal of the alginate gel barriers formed in the porous media to restore the original hydraulic properties of the media was investigated to generate an alginate gel barrier a consecutive injection of alginate and cacl2 aqueous solutions into the 2 dimensioinal 2 d was conducted the removal of alginate gel from the media was conducted using an aqueous solution of nahco3 an environmentally acceptable material the performance of an alginate gel barrier was investigated by measuring the changes in water flux due to the barrier and the effect of barrier set in the flowing domain on the remedial performance of the groundwater flushing processes using water and a surfactant solution

napl during water flushing effect of gel barriers mixture of n hexane 43 w w and pce 57 w w was used as the napl the ratio of napl ingredients was selected for the napl to be neutrally buoyant which was necessary to keep the napl in position in the porous media ahn et al 2017 simulating napl in aquifer that is stabilized and no longer migrates the napl was introduced to the chamber through the injection port p 2 using a syringe pump model 200 kd scientific co the 1 g of napl and 1 ml of di water were injected alternatively up to 9 82 g of napl containing 5 59 g of pce injection to disperse the napl allowing water flow through the napl an oil soluble fluorescence dye dfsb k43 was dissolved in the napl 20 mg l the photos of the chamber were taken under the uv lamps to estimate the extent and location of the napl the napl contaminated chamber was flushed with di water and a set of pfm experiments conc of n hexanol shown in table 1 was conducted for 5 h to measure the water flux distribution at the end of the chamber exp 3 1 table 1 the pfm experimental procedure was identical to that described in the previous section in addition to the flux tracer n hexanol the extracts were analyzed for pce as well to measure the mass of pce dissolved from the source during the flushing time upon completion of the water flushing experiments an aqueous solution of sodium alginate 1 5 w v was injected into the chamber through the injection ports p 1 and p 3 for exp 3 2 the volumes of alginate solution injected through ports p 1 and p 3 were 57 ml and 62 ml respectively the same gelation process using cacl2 solution was used as described in section 2 3 1 another set of water flushing experiments was conducted with two alginate gel regions formed on both sides of the napl source zone and the water flux and pce mass removed from the napl source were measured using the pfms as described in the previous section replicate experiments for exp 3 1 and exp 3 2 were conducted to confirm the pce mass recoveries during flushing 2 3 4 experiment 4 napl removal during sds solution flushing effect of gel barriers napl removal experiments using the surfactant sds solution 0 37 w v were also conducted using the same experimental procedure described in the previous section with the exception of the flushing solution the total mass of the napl was 9 75 g containing 5 56 g of pce the pce removal were measured using the pfms with no alginate injection into the chamber first exp 4 1 table 1 the pfm experiment was repeated with the alginate gel regions formed at the same locations and with the same size as described in the previous section exp 4 2 table 1 the replicate experiment of exp 4 2 was conducted to confirm the pce mass recovery during sds solution flushing with the alginate gel formed regions set in the chamber 2 3 5 batch experiments for gelation kinetics in porous media batch experiments for gelation kinetics were conducted using a 1 l beaker a glass beaker 100 ml 4 7 cm id 6 0 cm depth was packed with the sand used for the flow experiments and was saturated with sodium alginate solution 1 5 w v the sand packed beaker was then placed at the bottom of the 1 l beaker with sand surface covered with a sheet of filter paper whatman 2 cytiva co an aqueous solution of cacl2 2 0 w v was gently poured into the 1 l beaker up to 600 ml a magnetic stirrer was used at 600 rpm for even distribution of calcium ion concentration in the bulk water the filter paper was removed as soon as the gelation reaction occurred at the sand surface e g 1 min after a predetermined reaction time the sand was retrieved and gently shaken in di water to remove sand with no gel the photos of sand clot containing alginate gel were taken and the thicknesses of the gel formed media at the thinnest and the thickest points of the cylindrical sand clot was measured using a caliper schematics of the experimental procedure are shown in fig s1 in the supplementary information si the thicknesses of alginate gel formed sand were also measured for different cacl2 concentrations at a fixed sodium alginate conc of 1 5 w v reaction time 24 h the cacl2 concentration covered a range up to 3 0 w v and those for different sodium alginate concentrations were measured at fixed cacl2 concentration 2 0 w v reaction time 24 h the alginate concentration covered up to 2 0 w v the experimental procedure was identical to that described above for time dependent thickness of alginate gel formed sand the dissolution rate of the calcium alginate gel in aqueous solutions of nahco3 was also measured using a batch set up fig s2 in the si an alginate gel circular disk 3 4 g 4 07 cm id 0 32 cm thickness was immersed in the 1 l nahco3 solution 8 0 w v and the mass of alginate gel disk was measured over time until it completely disappeared the effect of different nahco3 concentration was also investigated alginate gel disks were immersed in 1 l aqueous solutions of nahco3 at different concentrations 0 5 10 w v the masses of the disks were measured twice at 70 min and 140 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 experiment 1 exp 1 alginate gel formation and flux measurements fig 3 shows the photos of the fluorescence emitted from the chamber during the fss solution flushing alginate gel was successfully formed by reaction with calcium ion at the center of the model exp 1 1 as shown in the dark circular region where no fluorescence emission was detected the diameter of the gel formed region shown in fig 3a was approximately 24 cm the expected diameter of the gel formed circle at the center of the model was 22 cm although a complete displacement of the resident water by the alginate solution considering its viscosity 33 6 0 8 cp specific gravity 0 998 and hydrophilic nature was expected local anomalies in the flowing domain might induce different displacement rates in the pores of the porous media possibly resulting in trapped resident water in the alginate solution fig 3 shows a two dimensional gel formed region in the flow chamber however it should be interpreted as a cylindrical column in three dimensional space such as for injection in an aquifer a single soil column or an array of soil columns with alginate gel formed inside can be used as barriers for controlling or blocking the groundwater flow because the water must flow around the soil column or array of columns since the background water did not flow during the injection of the alginate solution the injected solution formed a complete circle based on the red color of amaranth added to sodium alginate solution as shown in fig 3a when the injection was completed the shape of the alginate solution was distorted slightly during cacl2 flushing with a tail down gradient fig 3a the movement of the alginate solution during cacl2 flushing was minimal because the gelation reaction takes place instantaneously the viscous nature of the alginate solution 33 6 0 8 cp specific gravity 0 998 is also expected to influence the movement of the plume fig 3b shows the water flow pattern for the model fairly well with a circular alginate gel formed in the middle no water flow was observed through the region where alginate gel was expected to be formed this implies that the alginate gel completely blocked the water flow through the gel formed region it has been known based on batch experiments that gels in porous media premixed gel precursor e g alginate in the porous media suppressed the hydraulic conductivity bouazza et al 2009 in this study with the water head difference 23cmh2o applied for the water flow through the sand packed model no water flow through the gel formed region was observed for up to 7 d the water flux and water flux distribution were measured using pfms using the mass m hex kg captured by the gac packed in the cartridges the water flux j w m h was calculated as 1 j w m hex a c o t where a m2 is the cross sectional area of the cartridge c o kg m3 is the concentration of tracer and t h is the time duration of pfm deployed ahn et al 2017 fig 4a shows the water flux for the control experiment using the sand packed chamber with no alginate gel applied the water flux distribution skewed slightly toward one side fluxmeters of higher numbered which reflects the hydraulic characteristic of the packed chamber overall the water flux was measured fairly evenly at the water outlet side of the chamber the water flow pattern was visualized using the fss solution for the control experiment fig s3 in the si the mass recovery rate of n hexanol for the pfm experiment for the control experiment was estimated to be 96 estimated based on the total mass of the tracer captured by the pfms the volume of tracer solution introduced into the model and the influent concentration of the tracer note that the overall mass recovery of the pfm tracer n hexanol for all the pfm experiments conducted in this study was 93 8 6 1 n 9 as expected from fig 3b water flux at the center streamline of the chamber was depressed due to the hydraulic barrier alginate gel formed in the middle of the chamber fig 4b compared to that of control fig 4a with no alginate gel applied the water flux estimated from the pfms deployed in the middle pfm number 10 12 for exp 1 1 was 0 108 cm min which is 18 lower than the measured flux average whereas higher water flux was observed at both sides of the chamber i e pfm nos 3 and 19 the size and shape of the gel formed in the chamber were affected by the volume of the alginate solution and the background water flow when the back groundwater was flowing during the alginate solution injection the alginate solution plume stretched toward down gradient and the width of the alginate solution was also increased as the alginate solution was continuously injected up to 450 ml exp 1 2 which is approximately 2 3 times that used for exp 1 1 the water flux was further affected by the hydraulic barrier because it was formed near the pfms with wider range compared to fig 4b the water flux distribution fig 5b for exp 1 2 is significantly different from the control fig 5a the lowest water flux measured at pfm in the middle pfm number 11 was only 54 of the mean flux measured 0 151 cm min thus the alginate gel formed in the chamber worked as an effective hydraulic barrier that blocks water flow in the porous media note that this study was conducted using a 2 d physical model construction of biopolymer based barriers in the aquifer requires careful engineering considerations to achieve the goal and avoid unwanted contaminant flow which spreads contaminants 3 2 experiment 2 exp 2 removal of alginate gel and the stability one of the advantages of using biopolymers including alginate gel is the possibility of reversing the reaction to dissolve the gel in most cases physical hydraulic barriers set in a subsurface environment are left at the site with no further removal process or an excavation process is employed for removal since most material i e bentonite for the hydraulic barriers is known to be benign excavation may not be necessary however restoration of the subsurface environment to the original condition may be required depending on the circumstances the gelation reaction for alginate can be reversed using sodium bicarbonate using an excess amount of sodium ion decouples the cross linkage of alginate by calcium ion binder resulting in re dissolution of the alginate gel fig 1 fig 6a shows the changes in the size of the alginate gel formed area while flushing the chamber using 1 0 m nahco3 aqueous solution exp 2 1 the size of the gel formed area region with no fluorescence emission in fig 6a continuously shrank over time fig 6c less than 2 of the initial gel formed area remained after 72 h of nahco3 solution flushing this observation proved that the alginate gel formed in the porous media as demonstrated in the previous section exp 1 1 can be successfully removed from the media using a sodium rich water soluble compound i e nahco3 the recovery of the hydrologic properties of the porous media after the alginate gel was removed was also evaluated when the black area disappeared completely after 88 h of nahco3 solution flushing the pfm experiment was conducted fig 7 shows that the water flux and its distribution measured at the end of the chamber which is close to that measured before the introduction of alginate solution fig 4a the overall pattern of water flux distribution higher water fluxes at pfms higher numbered shown in fig 7 is similar to that of exp 1 1 fig 4a however the cause for the fluctuating data fig 7 needs further investigation to confirm if it was from the left over alginate in the media or simple experimental artifacts after the pfm experiments were completed the chamber with the gel removed was un packed and the media from the former gel formed region and the surrounding area was examined and no observable physical structure e g clot or aggregation was found in the media from the de gelation region the two media from the de gelation region and the surrounding area were essentially identical thus the entire process including alginate solution injection gelation and de gelation reactions and flushing of the disintegrated products of de gelation reaction from the porous media had limited influence on the intrinsic hydraulic properties of the porous media however the excess quantity of salt nahco3 remaining after the de gelation process is completed may have to be removed by flushing the media using groundwater natural or artificial to restore the chemical balance of the aquifer to evaluate the chemical physical stability of the alginate gel formed in the porous media a flushing experiment exp 2 2 was conducted instead of nahco3 solution used for the previous gel removal experiment exp 2 1 an artificial groundwater ionic strength 2 02 mm was used for the flushing at the flow rate of 4 50 ml min 1 15 10 5 m s darcy flux 2 56 m d pore water velocity fig 6b showed the gel formed area photographs taken right after the gelation reaction 0 d and that after 7 d there was no observable change in the size or the shape of the gel formed region in the chamber fig 6c a higher flow rate 10 ml min pore water velocity 5 7 m d was applied during the pfm experiments and no changes in the location of the gel formed region was observed following the experiment this observation proved that the alginate gel formed in the media under the gelation condition used in this study was stable for at least 7 d in general the seepage flowrate of groundwater l m d or less in the aquifers is an order of magnitude lower than that used in this study so that the alginate gel formed in the actual aquifer media using the same method used in this study may be stable for a longer time period the reynolds number re for exp 2 2 was 5 10 3 which is orders magnitude lower than the low limit for darcy flow re 1 confirming that the water flowed under the laminar flow conditions note that without the gelation reaction the sodium alginate solution plume would not stay stagnant but would be flushed or mixed with surrounding water by diffusion out of the initial location losing its property as the hydraulic barrier a simple additional experiment showed that the alginate solution plume lost the integrity in a day fig s4 in the si under the background water flow condition 3 3 experiment 3 exp 3 napl removal during water flushing a stable gel formed region may be used for a funnel and gate system for the remediation of a napl contaminated aquifer the napl used in this study was a mixture of pce and n hexane selected to be neutrally buoyant only pce was monitored using the pfms during the flushing experiment since the water solubility of n hexane was negligible fig 8a shows the extent of the napl injected to the chamber identified by the fluorescence emission from the dye additive dfsb k43 during the napl injection with no advective water flow the napl displaced resident water formed an irregular shape and occupied a larger space than expected based on a porosity and saturation assumption thus indicating fingering displacement between the immiscible fluids the width of the napl plume perpendicular to the water flow direction was approximately 12 cm as a result of reduced water saturation in the napl injected region the hydraulic conductivity was suppressed this spatial variation of hydraulic conductivity resulted in decreased water flow through the napl source zone with increased bypassing of water around the napl as reflected in the water flux distribution measured by pfms fig 8b exp 3 1 the water flux in the middle was depressed whereas those measured at the downstream corresponding to the edges of the napl plume i e fluxmeter nos 7 and 17 were significantly higher than the mean water flux the alginate gel was formed at two locations so that the water flow converged toward the napl plume exp 3 2 the size of the gel formed region was approximately 12 cm each a complete circular plume of alginate solution was observed immediately after injection while the shape of gel formed region was slightly distorted fig s5 in the si note that no contact between napl and the gel formed region was observed alginate gel is known to be very hydrophilic generating a non wetting surface with respect to most hydrophobic organic liquids fig s6 in the si shows the contact of pce at the alginate gel surface in water with a very large contact angle the gel formed region is a typical funnel and gate structure where the gel formed regions correspond to the funnel part the pfm data fig 8c show a clear contrast to that without alginate gel fig 8b with the gel formed regions set in the flow chamber the water flux was depressed based on the pfms at the downstream of the gel formed regions i e fluxmeter nos 5 and 15 whereas significantly increased water flux was measured for the pfms set between gel formed regions where napl was injected with faster water flow through the napl contaminated zone due to the funnel structure gel formed region the dissolution rate of pce from the source was expected to be enhanced injecting the aqueous solution of sodium alginate into the actual field site aquifer could be an engineering challenge because of the high viscosity higher pressure will be required for injection of the solution into the aquifer construction of a cylindrically shaped gel structure may be feasible however it would be difficult to create a wall shape gel barrier in an aquifer due to the flow characteristics of the aqueous solution with sodium alginate a further study on the viscosity control of the alginate solution may be needed for the five hours flushing period with no gel applied exp 3 1 the total mass of pce captured by the pfm was 0 053 g which is 0 94 of the initial mass of pce introduced into the chamber with alginate gel applied so that the water flux through the napl contaminated zone was increased the mass of pce recovered during the same time period was 0 11 g which corresponds to 2 1 of the initial mass applied the recovery of pce by dissolution during water flushing was increased significantly by a factor of 2 2 due to the water flux change caused by the barriers the pce mass captured by the pfm is shown in fig 9 the mass distribution for exp 3 1 no gel applied was skewed to the high numbered pfm side which is likely due to the irregular distribution of napl in the chamber on the other hand the pce mass captured by pfm for exp 3 2 shows typical gaussian distribution the enhanced mass recovery was greatest at the center of the chamber whereas the increase in the pce mass removal was insignificant at the pfm deployed at the sides of the chamber this implies that the water flow was focused between the alginate gel formed regions inducing faster dissolution of pce from the napl 3 4 experiment 4 exp 4 napl removal during surfactant flushing flushing the napl contaminated aquifer using water soluble surfactant e g sds is a remedial process e g tick et al 2015 the total pce mass recovery during the flushing with an sds solution 0 37 w v for 5 h with no alginate gel applied exp 4 1 was 0 17 g which was 2 97 of the initial mass introduced into the chamber when the alginate gel was applied as in exp 4 2 significantly more pce 0 41 g was removed from the source and captured by the pfm this mass corresponds to 7 95 of the total pce mass introduced into the chamber the recovery ratio increased by a factor of 2 7 when the gel was applied compared to the control exp 4 1 fig 10 shows the distribution of pce mass captured by the pfm the overall pattern of mass distribution is similar to that of the water flushing case exp 3 whereas more mass was removed using the sds solution a dramatic increase in the pce mass captured in the middle of the chamber was observed although analyzing the mechanisms i e solubilization or mobilization of the napl removal during exp 4 2 was not within the scope of this study increased solution flux thus faster flow velocity is considered to promote both napl mobilization and solubilization during pfm and napl removal experiments the water samples were taken at the outlet of the system and analyzed for the tracer and pce tracer was not detected under detection limit of the analytical procedure in the effluent solution nor was pce this implies that the pfm worked properly as intended to capture dissolved contaminant as well as the tracer n hexanol the pce removal experiments exp 3 and exp 4 were duplicated and the duplicate results were fairly consistent with those described for exp 3 and exp 4 table s1 in the si 3 5 batch experiments for gelation and de gelation kinetics in porous media although fairly high concentrations of calcium and alginate were used for the model experiments it is important to investigate the thickness of alginate gel formed media under different conditions the gel formed sand region which is a stiff monolith of sand fig s7 in the si and alginate gel increased over time fig 11a the reaction of alginate and the divalent ion forming alginate gel is known to be instantaneous and the growth of gel depends on the relative diffusion rates of calcium ions and alginate molecules to the gelation zone bergstrom et al 1990 blandino et al 1999 skjåk bræk et al 1989 thus the time dependent behavior of alginate gel formed media fig 11a clearly reflects the diffusion limited reaction as the gel formed region grew inside the alginate solution the diffusive travel distance for the calcium ions increased which resulted in slowing down the increasing rate of the thickness of the gel formed region note that the thickness of the gel formed region is proportional to the square root of time time0 53 fig 11a which is a known functional relationship between diffusion distance and time schwarzenbach et al 1993 the fit shown in fig 10a also confirms that the growing rate of gel formed thickness t cm in the media is inversely proportional to the t eq 2 2 dt dt k t 0 89 where k is the rate constant m1 89 h and t is time h the k value was estimated to be 2 87 10 5 m1 89 h but it applies only for the specific concentrations of calcium ion and alginate used in this study the calcium concentration at fixed alginate concentration 1 5 w v was found to affect the gelation reaction in the porous media the thickness of the gel formed media increased rapidly as the cacl2 concentration increased fig 11b it is recommended to consider using cacl2 solution of 2 w v for the gelation test in porous media because only a slight enhancement of gel formed thickness was observed at cacl2 concentration higher than 2 w v with fixed cacl2 concentration at 2 0 w v the thickness of alginate gel formed region increased as the aqueous concentration of sodium alginate increased fig 11c the gel formed thickness became consistent at around 1 w v of sodium alginate concentration however the stiffness of the gel formed region might be affected by the concentration of alginate concentration the physical strength of gel formed porous media as the function of alginate concentration needs more investigation due to the difficulties associated detecting de gelation of alginate gel from the porous media sheets of alginate gel were used instead the manufacturing procedure of the alginate gel using the materials used for the model experiment is shown in fig s2 in the si the normalized mass mf mass left initial mass of alginate gel decreased over time in an 8 0 w v nahco3 solution fig 12a the disk initial mass of 3 4 g was dissolved completely at 93 min the de gelation rate was relatively slow at the beginning but it became faster as it lost mass this change in the mass loss rate is considered to be related to the physical stiffness of the alginate gel as the gel dissolved the structure of the gel became loose making the ion exchange reaction faster a more detailed study of the changes in the gel structure or stiffness during the dissolution process by ion exchange is required in the future to better understand the kinetics of de gelation the normalized gel mass removed mr mass removed initial mass is shown for different reaction times 70 min 140 min in fig 12b since the dissolution rate accelerates over time a small increase in reaction time results in a larger fraction of gel dissolved the concentration of nahco3 and the reaction time should be carefully determined depending on the thickness of the alginate gel formed in the porous media natural degradation of gel formed in aquifers may occur due to microbial activities of indigenous microbes premature barrier destruction before its designed operation duration can be prevented using additives e g formaldehyde or sodium azide that suppress the microbial growth such additives may be included in the precursor sodium alginate solution before it is introduced into the aquifer 4 conclusions injection of a sodium alginate solution into a porous media sand followed by the gelation reaction using a cacl2 solution successfully set a zone of alginate gel in the porous media which was confirmed for the physical chemical stability as a hydraulic barrier hydraulic barriers using alginate gel set in the aquifer can be disintegrated using a simple chemical injection restoring the subsurface environment to the original condition using the sodium ion rich aqueous solution e g nahco3 used in this study the gel was effectively removed by dissolution and the water flow pattern was restored based on experimental flux measurements the gel formed region in the aquifer created a funnel and gate type system at lab scale which controlled the water flow through the napl source zone facilitating the dissolution process this work presents a feasible process for the construction of temporary hydraulic barriers in the aquifer which may provide a useful alternative for the physical barriers requiring ground excavation for installation and in particular for those need to be removed after use for remediation note that the data presented in this study are limited to lab scale 2 d models packed with homogeneous sand hence studies on the formation and destruction of the alginate gel barriers

1206,this study presents the use of organic gel forming material for the construction of hydraulic barriers in aquifer which can be easily removed after use experiments on the performance of the temporary hydraulic barrier during napl removal aquifer flushing were also conducted an aqueous solution of sodium alginate was injected into the horizontally oriented 2 dimensional flow chamber packed with sand followed by gelation using a calcium solution the alginate gel formed in the porous media produced a circular shape barrier 24 cm diameter 1 3 cm thickness that was successfully removed using sodium bicarbonate solution 1 0 m in 72 h whereas the gel was stable for 7 days during simulated groundwater flushing at the same flow rate as the sodium bicarbonate solution when circular hydraulic barriers 12 cm diameter each 14 cm apart were set on either side of the napl n hexane and pce mixture contaminated zone the increased water flux during water flushing resulted in significantly increased pce removal by almost 108 when a surfactant solution sodium dodecyl sulfate 0 037 was applied the influenced groundwater flow controlled by hydraulic barriers on the napl

artificial hydraulic barriers have been used for various purposes in the field of hydrogeo engineering they have been installed at land disposal sites for waste to keep toxic leachates from escaping the boundaries e g chakradhar and katoch 2016 ojoawo and adegbola 2012 scalia iv et al 2014 cut off walls with very low hydraulic conductivities are commonly used for the control of groundwater flow often combined with a pump and treat system bayer and finkel 2006 beretta 2015 pedretti et al 2012 low hydraulic conductivity cutoff walls have also been used as an essential component for the funnel and gate systems which captures a groundwater contaminant plume guiding it through the treatment zones e g blowes et al 1995 cantrell et al 1995 gillham and o hannesin 1994 starr and cherry 1994 porous materials mixed with binding agents have been used as the packing for the walls a typical example of the packing in the impermeable walls is soil bentonite slurry which is poured into the trenches constructed by excavation e g ect team purdue 2007 czurda and haus 2002 khoury et al 1992 koch 2002 wang et al 2016 the performance of the bentonite slurry wall may be enhanced using additives including cement opdyke and evans 2005 the funnel structure often consists of materials other than bentonite including polymeric membranes e g guerin et al 2002 silica gel based colloidal solutions have also been good candidates for hydraulic barrier construction durmusoglu and corapcioglu 2000 kim and corapcioglu 2003 krishnan and shukla 2021 since the colloidal solution of silica gel may be injected through injection wells into the aquifer little disturbance in the soil profile is necessary silica is also a benign material and easy to control above ground before injection the concentration of silica in the colloidal solution ranges from 5 to 30 with decreasing effectiveness of gelation at lower silica concentration e g persoff et al 1997 organic compounds have been used as additives to the base material to enhance the performance of the hydraulic barriers water soluble polymers have been mixed with bentonite and were found to be effective at reducing the permeability of the barrier or to enhance the swelling property of bentonite keerthana and arnepalli 2022 razakamanantsoa et al 2012 scalia iv et al 2014 organic carbonates e g glycerol carbonate have also been used as the additives to a bentonite slurry to decrease the hydraulic conductivity of the barriers fehervari et al 2016 details of the organo clays referred to as clay based materials containing organic compounds include surfactants alcohols and aldehydes and biomolecules which are used for hydraulic barrier application can be found in the literature e g zhao et al 2017 biopolymers including sodium alginate and guar gum and xanthan gum have also been investigated for their potential to reduce the hydraulic conductivity of soils bouazza et al 2009 subsurface hydraulic barriers can be constructed by injecting viscous colloids including polybutenes and polysilotanes and subsequently crosslinking agents in the subsurface apps et al 1998 sodium alginate was also used as an additive to enhance the performance of bentonite based hydraulic barriers khan et al 2022 double emulsions w o w of oil cacl2 aqueous solution alginate solution were found to form the alginate gel upon contacted with napl lamont et al 2020b or anionic surfactant i e sodium dodecyl sulfate sds lamont et al 2020a the precursor emulsion may be injected to the contaminant source zone and forms alginate gel encapsulating the napl resulting in immobilized napl lamont et al 2020b or forms a hydraulic barrier by subsequent injection of a surfactant solution in an effort to confine the contaminant source zone during surfactant flushing lamont et al 2020a corn protein zein used for emulsifying and removal of napl from the subsurface was found to be a potential candidate to form a gel barrier encompassing the treatment zone and limiting the migration of contaminant across the barrier marshall et al 2020b xanthan gum based gel was also used to contain the contaminated soil or contaminated groundwater or soil water gioia and urciuolo 2004 successful gel formation was observed when a xanthan gum solution was mixed with al3 at low ph which was proposed to solidify a contaminated source zone in situ biopolymer i e chitosan and hydroxyethylcellulose coating on the soil particles was suggested as the hydrophilic filter in situ that effectively blocks the movement of hydrophobic contaminants marshall et al 2020a 2020b although biopolymers including sodium alginate have been investigated for their potential to contain contaminants or to keep contaminants from escaping the source zone in an aquifer little information is available on the effect of the biopolymer based hydraulic barriers on the groundwater flux and flux distribution in porous media some of the previous studies conducted experiments using 1 dimensional columns to measure the permeability of fluids through the sand packed columns e g marshall et al 2020a 2020b lamont et al 2020a 2020b no observations on the interaction between the barriers and groundwater flow domain have been reported while most previous studies focused on the formation of biopolymer based gel barriers the de gelation process to recover the hydrologic characteristics of the aquifers has received little attention the purpose of this study was to assess the potential of sodium alginate gel formed in the aquifer as a temporary hydraulic barrier to control the flow characteristics of the groundwater in the aquifer additionally the removal of the alginate gel barriers formed in the porous media to restore the original hydraulic properties of the media was investigated to generate an alginate gel barrier a consecutive injection of alginate and cacl2 aqueous solutions into the 2 dimensioinal 2 d was conducted the removal of alginate gel from the media was conducted using an aqueous solution of nahco3 an environmentally acceptable material the performance of an alginate gel barrier was investigated by measuring the changes in water flux due to the barrier and the effect of barrier set in the flowing domain on the remedial performance of the groundwater flushing processes using water and a surfactant solution kinetic studies for the gelation and de gelation reactions with respect to time and the concentration of reactants were also conducted to support the observations from the model experiments 2

distilled di water was used throughout the entire experiments all experiments were conducted at 25 1 c sodium alginate was chosen as the precursor of the gel in this study because it is inexpensive and reacts instantaneously with a calcium ion forming gel the term alginate refers to a group of polysaccharides produced mostly from seaweeds the alginate monomer typically a block copolymer of β d

water flux distribution for the sand packed flow chamber was conducted the water flow pattern during water flushing was measured using the passive flux meter pfm technique ahn et al 2017 annable et al

14 4 l of cacl2 solution were introduced into the chamber an ubbelohde viscometer cannon instrument co model c532 was used to measure the viscosity of the aqueous solution of sodium alginate 1 5 w v used in this study the specific gravity of the alginate solution was measured using a pycnometer after the flushing with cacl2 solution was completed fss solution 100 mg l was introduced into the chamber through the inlets at 10 ml min rate 2 7 10 5 m s darcy flux to confirm the gelation reaction at the desired location photos were taken with the uv lamps on to identify the location and extent of the region where alginate gel was formed a set of pfm experiments conc of n hexanol shown in table 1 was conducted to investigate the changes in the water flux distribution due to the gel formed region an additional experiment exp 1 2 table 1 was conducted using the newly packed model to investigate the size and shape of the gel formed region and its effect on the water flux distribution under the same experimental setting the alginate solution was injected at the same rate as exp 1 1 while the background water flow was controlled at the rate of 20 ml min 5 4 10 5 m s darcy flux note that there was no water flow during the alginate solution injection in exp 1 1 the sodium alginate solution 1 5 w v volume injected was 450 ml the gelation reaction process using cacl2 solution was the same as exp 1 1 a pfm experiment conc of n hexanol shown in table 1 was conducted for the water flux distribution affected by the gel formed in the model and was compared with that from the control experiment photos of the fluorescence emission from the model were taken with the model flooded with fss 100 mg l solution to track the boundary of the gel formed area 2 3 2 experiment 2 stability of the alginate gel and removal from the porous media after the pfm experiment exp 1 1 table 1 for the flow chamber with alginate gel formed in the media the aqueous solution of nahco3 8 4 w v 1 0 m was introduced to the chamber to disintegrate and flush the gel out of the chamber the flow rate of nahco3 solution was set to 10 ml min 2 6 10 5 m s darcy flux and the flushing continued for 88 h 52 8 l equivalent to 32 pv during the flushing fss 100 mg l was added to the solution and the water flow pattern was monitored using the uv lamp the pfm experiments conc of n hexanol shown in table 1 were conducted after the nahco3 flushing 96 h to investigate any changes due to gel forming and gel destruction processes for the stability test the chamber was repacked using the same sand and the alginate gel was formed as described in the previous section when the alginate gel was confirmed by the fss flushing experiment the artificially manufactured groundwater 0 075 mm cacl2 0 082 mm mgcl2 0 051 mm kcl 1 5 mm nahco3 was introduced to the chamber the flushing continued for 7 d at the flow rate of 4 5 ml min 1 2 10 5 m s darcy flux and the total volume of the artificial groundwater of 45 4 l 27 5 pvs was used while the flushing fss 100 mg l was added to the artificial groundwater and the water flow pattern was monitored using the uv lamp 2 3 3 experiment 3 removal of napl during water flushing effect of gel barriers mixture of n hexane 43 w w and pce 57 w w was used as the napl the ratio of napl ingredients was selected for the napl to be neutrally buoyant which was necessary to keep the napl in position in the porous media ahn et al 2017 simulating napl in aquifer that is stabilized and no longer migrates the napl was introduced to the chamber through the injection port p 2 using a syringe pump model 200 kd scientific co the 1 g of napl and 1 ml of di water were injected alternatively up to 9 82 g of napl containing 5 59 g of pce injection to disperse the napl allowing water flow through the napl an oil soluble fluorescence dye dfsb k43 was dissolved in the napl 20 mg l the photos of the chamber were taken under the uv lamps to estimate the extent and location of the napl the napl contaminated chamber was flushed with di water and a set of pfm experiments conc of n hexanol shown in table 1 was conducted for 5 h to measure the water flux distribution at the end of the chamber exp 3 1 table 1 the pfm experimental procedure was identical to that described in the previous section in addition to the flux tracer n hexanol the extracts were analyzed for pce as well to measure the mass of pce dissolved from the source during the flushing time upon completion of the water flushing experiments an aqueous solution of sodium alginate 1 5 w v was injected into the chamber through the injection ports p 1 and p 3 for exp 3 2 the volumes of alginate solution injected through ports p 1 and p 3 were 57 ml and 62 ml respectively the same gelation process using cacl2 solution was used as described in section 2 3 1 another set of water flushing experiments was conducted with two alginate gel regions formed on both sides of the napl source zone and the water flux and pce mass removed from the napl source were measured using the pfms as described in the previous section replicate experiments for exp 3 1 and exp 3 2 were conducted to confirm the pce mass recoveries during flushing 2 3 4 experiment 4 napl removal during sds solution flushing effect of gel barriers napl removal experiments using the surfactant sds solution 0 37 w v were also conducted using the same experimental procedure described in the previous section with the exception of the flushing solution the total mass of the napl was 9 75 g containing 5 56 g of pce the pce removal were measured using the pfms with no alginate injection into the chamber first exp 4 1 table 1 the pfm experiment was repeated with the alginate gel regions formed at the same locations and with the same size as described in the previous section exp 4 2 table 1 the replicate experiment of exp 4 2 was conducted to confirm the pce mass recovery during sds solution flushing with the alginate gel formed regions set in the chamber 2 3 5 batch experiments for gelation kinetics in porous media batch experiments for gelation kinetics were conducted using a 1 l beaker a glass beaker 100 ml 4 7 cm id 6 0 cm depth was packed with the sand used for the flow experiments and was saturated with sodium alginate solution 1 5 w v the sand packed beaker was then placed at the bottom of the 1 l beaker with sand surface covered with a sheet of filter paper whatman 2 cytiva co an aqueous solution of cacl2 2 0 w v was gently poured into the 1 l beaker up to 600 ml a magnetic stirrer was used at 600 rpm for even distribution of calcium ion concentration in the bulk water the filter paper was removed as soon as the gelation reaction occurred at the sand surface e g 1 min after a predetermined reaction time the sand was retrieved and gently shaken in di water to remove sand with no gel the photos of sand clot containing alginate gel were taken and the thicknesses of the gel formed media at the thinnest and the thickest points of the cylindrical sand clot was measured using a caliper schematics of the experimental procedure are shown in fig s1 in the supplementary information si the thicknesses of alginate gel formed sand were also measured for different cacl2 concentrations at a fixed sodium alginate conc of 1 5 w v reaction time 24 h the cacl2 concentration covered a range up to 3 0 w v and those for different sodium alginate concentrations were measured at fixed cacl2 concentration 2 0 w v reaction time 24 h the alginate concentration covered up to 2 0 w v the experimental procedure was identical to that described above for time dependent thickness of alginate gel formed sand the dissolution rate of the calcium alginate gel in aqueous solutions of nahco3 was also measured using a batch set up fig s2 in the si an alginate gel circular disk 3 4 g 4 07 cm id 0 32 cm thickness was immersed in the 1 l nahco3 solution 8 0 w v and the mass of alginate gel disk was measured over time until it completely disappeared the effect of different nahco3 concentration was also investigated alginate gel disks were immersed in 1 l aqueous solutions of nahco3 at different concentrations 0 5 10 w v the masses of the disks were measured twice at 70 min and 140 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 experiment 1 exp 1 alginate gel formation and flux measurements fig 3 shows the photos of the fluorescence emitted from the chamber during the fss solution flushing alginate gel was successfully formed by reaction with calcium ion at the center of the model exp 1 1 as shown in the dark circular region where no fluorescence emission was detected the diameter of the gel formed region shown in fig 3a was approximately 24 cm the expected diameter of the gel formed circle at the center of the model was 22 cm although a complete displacement of the resident water by the alginate solution considering its viscosity 33 6 0 8 cp specific gravity 0 998 and hydrophilic nature was expected local anomalies in the flowing domain might induce different displacement rates in the pores of the porous media possibly resulting in trapped resident water in the alginate solution fig 3 shows a two dimensional gel formed region in the flow chamber however it should be interpreted as a cylindrical column in three dimensional space such as for injection in an aquifer a single soil column or an array of soil columns with alginate gel formed inside can be used as barriers for controlling or blocking the groundwater flow because the water must flow around the soil column or array of columns since the background water did not flow during the injection of the alginate solution the injected solution formed a complete circle based on the red color of amaranth added to sodium alginate solution as shown in fig 3a when the injection was completed the shape of the alginate solution was distorted slightly during cacl2 flushing with a tail down gradient fig 3a the movement of the alginate solution during cacl2 flushing was minimal because the gelation reaction takes place instantaneously the viscous nature of the alginate solution 33 6 0 8 cp specific gravity 0 998 is also expected to influence the movement of the plume fig 3b shows the water flow pattern for the model fairly well with a circular alginate gel formed in the middle no water flow was observed through the region where alginate gel was expected to be formed this implies that the alginate gel completely blocked the water flow through the gel formed region it has been known based on batch experiments that gels in porous media premixed gel precursor e g alginate in the porous media suppressed the hydraulic conductivity bouazza et al 2009 in this study with the water head difference 23cmh2o applied for the water flow through the sand packed model no water flow through the gel formed region was observed for up to 7 d the water flux and water flux distribution were measured using pfms using the mass m hex kg captured by the gac packed in the cartridges the water flux j w m h was calculated as 1 j w m hex a c o t where a m2 is the cross sectional area of the cartridge c o kg m3 is the concentration of tracer and t h is the time duration of pfm deployed ahn et al 2017 fig 4a shows the water flux for the control experiment using the sand packed chamber with no alginate gel applied the water flux distribution skewed slightly toward one side fluxmeters of higher numbered which reflects the hydraulic characteristic of the packed chamber overall the water flux was measured fairly evenly at the water outlet side of the chamber the water flow pattern was visualized using the fss solution for the control experiment fig s3 in the si the mass recovery rate of n hexanol for the pfm experiment for the control experiment was estimated to be 96 estimated based on the total mass of the tracer captured by the pfms the volume of tracer solution introduced into the model and the influent concentration of the tracer note that the overall mass recovery of the pfm tracer n hexanol for all the pfm experiments conducted in this study was 93 8 6 1 n 9 as expected from fig 3b water flux at the center streamline of the chamber was depressed due to the hydraulic barrier alginate gel formed in the middle of the chamber fig 4b compared to that of control fig 4a with no alginate gel applied the water flux estimated from the pfms deployed in the middle pfm number 10 12 for exp 1 1 was 0 108 cm min which is 18 lower than the measured flux average whereas higher water flux was observed at both sides of the chamber i e pfm nos 3 and 19 the size and shape of the gel formed in the chamber were affected by the volume of the alginate solution and the background water flow when the back groundwater was flowing during the alginate solution injection the alginate solution plume stretched toward down gradient and the width of the alginate solution was also increased as the alginate solution was continuously injected up to 450 ml exp 1 2 which is approximately 2 3 times that used for exp 1 1 the water flux was further affected by the hydraulic barrier because it was formed near the pfms with wider range compared to fig 4b the water flux distribution fig 5b for exp 1 2 is significantly different from the control fig 5a the lowest water flux measured at pfm in the middle pfm number 11 was only 54 of the mean flux measured 0 151 cm min thus the alginate gel formed in the chamber worked as an effective hydraulic barrier that blocks water flow in the porous media note that this study was conducted using a 2 d physical model construction of biopolymer based barriers in the aquifer requires careful engineering considerations to achieve the goal and avoid unwanted contaminant flow which spreads contaminants 3 2 experiment 2 exp 2 removal of alginate gel and the stability one of the advantages of using biopolymers including alginate gel is the possibility of reversing the reaction to dissolve the gel in most cases physical hydraulic barriers set in a subsurface environment are left at the site with no further removal process or an excavation process is employed for removal since most material i e bentonite for the hydraulic barriers is known to be benign excavation may not be necessary however restoration of the subsurface environment to the original condition may be required depending on the circumstances the gelation reaction for alginate can be reversed using sodium bicarbonate using an excess amount of sodium ion decouples the cross linkage of alginate by calcium ion binder resulting in re dissolution of the alginate gel fig 1 fig 6a shows the changes in the size of the alginate gel formed area while flushing the chamber using 1 0 m nahco3 aqueous solution exp 2 1 the size of the gel formed area region with no fluorescence emission in fig 6a continuously shrank over time fig 6c less than 2 of the initial gel formed area remained after 72 h of nahco3 solution flushing this observation proved that the alginate gel formed in the porous media as demonstrated in the previous section exp 1 1 can be successfully removed from the media using a sodium rich water soluble compound i e nahco3 the recovery of the hydrologic properties of the porous media after the alginate gel was removed was also evaluated when the black area disappeared completely after 88 h of nahco3 solution flushing the pfm experiment was conducted fig 7 shows that the water flux and its distribution measured at the end of the chamber which is close to that measured before the introduction of alginate solution fig 4a the overall pattern of water flux distribution higher water fluxes at pfms higher numbered shown in fig 7 is similar to that of exp 1 1 fig 4a however the cause for the fluctuating data fig 7 needs further investigation to confirm if it was from the left over alginate in the media or simple experimental artifacts after the pfm experiments were completed the chamber with the gel removed was un packed and the media from the former gel formed region and the surrounding area was examined and no observable physical structure e g clot or aggregation was found in the media from the de gelation region the two media from the de gelation region and the surrounding area were essentially identical thus the entire process including alginate solution injection gelation and de gelation reactions and flushing of the disintegrated products of de gelation reaction from the porous media had limited influence on the intrinsic hydraulic properties of the porous media however the excess quantity of salt nahco3 remaining after the de gelation process is completed may have to be removed by flushing the media using groundwater natural or artificial to restore the chemical balance of the aquifer to evaluate the chemical physical stability of the alginate gel formed in the porous media a flushing experiment exp 2 2 was conducted instead of nahco3 solution used for the previous gel removal experiment exp 2 1 an artificial groundwater ionic strength 2 02 mm was used for the flushing at the flow rate of 4 50 ml min 1 15 10 5 m s darcy flux 2 56 m d pore water velocity fig 6b showed the gel formed area photographs taken right after the gelation reaction 0 d and that after 7 d there was no observable change in the size or the shape of the gel formed region in the chamber fig 6c a higher flow rate 10 ml min pore water velocity 5 7 m d was applied during the pfm experiments and no changes in the location of the gel formed region was observed following the experiment this observation proved that the alginate gel formed in the media under the gelation condition used in this study was stable for at least 7 d in general the seepage flowrate of groundwater l m d or less in the aquifers is an order of magnitude lower than that used in this study so that the alginate gel formed in the actual aquifer media using the same method used in this study may be stable for a longer time period the reynolds number re for exp 2 2 was 5 10 3 which is orders magnitude lower than the low limit for darcy flow re 1 confirming that the water flowed under the laminar flow conditions note that without the gelation reaction the sodium alginate solution plume would not stay stagnant but would be flushed or mixed with surrounding water by diffusion out of the initial location losing its property as the hydraulic barrier a simple additional experiment showed that the alginate solution plume lost the integrity in a day fig s4 in the si under the background water flow condition 3 3 experiment 3 exp 3 napl removal during water flushing a stable gel formed region may be used for a funnel and gate system for the remediation of a napl contaminated aquifer the napl used in this study was a mixture of pce and n hexane selected to be neutrally buoyant only pce was monitored using the pfms during the flushing experiment since the water solubility of n hexane was negligible fig 8a shows the extent of the napl injected to the chamber identified by the fluorescence emission from the dye additive dfsb k43 during the napl injection with no advective water flow the napl displaced resident water formed an irregular shape and occupied a larger space than expected based on a porosity and saturation assumption thus indicating fingering displacement between the immiscible fluids the width of the napl plume perpendicular to the water flow direction was approximately 12 cm as a result of reduced water saturation in the napl injected region the hydraulic conductivity was suppressed this spatial variation of hydraulic conductivity resulted in decreased water flow through the napl source zone with increased bypassing of water around the napl as reflected in the water flux distribution measured by pfms fig 8b exp 3 1 the water flux in the middle was depressed whereas those measured at the downstream corresponding to the edges of the napl plume i e fluxmeter nos 7 and 17 were significantly higher than the mean water flux the alginate gel was formed at two locations so that the water flow converged toward the napl plume exp 3 2 the size of the gel formed region was approximately 12 cm each a complete circular plume of alginate solution was observed immediately after injection while the shape of gel formed region was slightly distorted fig s5 in the si note that no contact between napl and the gel formed region was observed alginate gel is known to be very hydrophilic generating a non wetting surface with respect to most hydrophobic organic liquids fig s6 in the si shows the contact of pce at the alginate gel surface in water with a very large contact angle the gel formed region is a typical funnel and gate structure where the gel formed regions correspond to the funnel part the pfm data fig 8c show a clear contrast to that without alginate gel fig 8b with the gel formed regions set in the flow chamber the water flux was depressed based on the pfms at the downstream of the gel formed regions i e fluxmeter nos 5 and 15 whereas significantly increased water flux was measured for the pfms set between gel formed regions where napl was injected with faster water flow through the napl contaminated zone due to the funnel structure gel formed region the dissolution rate of pce from the source was expected to be enhanced injecting the aqueous solution of sodium alginate into the actual field site aquifer could be an engineering challenge because of the high viscosity higher pressure will be required for injection of the solution into the aquifer construction of a cylindrically shaped gel structure may be feasible however it would be difficult to create a wall shape gel barrier in an aquifer due to the flow characteristics of the aqueous solution with sodium alginate a further study on the viscosity control of the alginate solution may be needed for the five hours flushing period with no gel applied exp 3 1 the total mass of pce captured by the pfm was 0 053 g which is 0 94 of the initial mass of pce introduced into the chamber with alginate gel applied so that the water flux through the napl contaminated zone was increased the mass of pce recovered during the same time period was 0 11 g which corresponds to 2 1 of the initial mass applied the recovery of pce by dissolution during water flushing was increased significantly by a factor of 2 2 due to the water flux change caused by the barriers the pce mass captured by the pfm is shown in fig 9 the mass distribution for exp 3 1 no gel applied was skewed to the high numbered pfm side which is likely due to the irregular distribution of napl in the chamber on the other hand the pce mass captured by pfm for exp 3 2 shows typical gaussian distribution the enhanced mass recovery was greatest at the center of the chamber whereas the increase in the pce mass removal was insignificant at the pfm deployed at the sides of the chamber this implies that the water flow was focused between the alginate gel formed regions inducing faster dissolution of pce from the napl 3 4 experiment 4 exp 4 napl removal during surfactant flushing flushing the napl contaminated aquifer using water soluble surfactant e g sds is a remedial process e g tick et al 2015 the total pce mass recovery during the flushing with an sds solution 0 37 w v for 5 h with no alginate gel applied exp 4 1 was 0 17 g which was 2 97 of the initial mass introduced into the chamber when the alginate gel was applied as in exp 4 2 significantly more pce 0 41 g was removed from the source and captured by the pfm this mass corresponds to 7 95 of the total pce mass introduced into the chamber the recovery ratio increased by a factor of 2 7 when the gel was applied compared to the control exp 4 1 fig 10 shows the distribution of pce mass captured by the pfm the overall pattern of mass distribution is similar to that of the water flushing case exp 3 whereas more mass was removed using the sds solution a dramatic increase in the pce mass captured in the middle of the chamber was observed although analyzing the mechanisms i e solubilization or mobilization of the napl removal during exp 4 2 was not within the scope of this study increased solution flux thus faster flow velocity is considered to promote both napl mobilization and solubilization during pfm and napl removal experiments the water samples were taken at the outlet of the system and analyzed for the tracer and pce tracer was not detected under detection limit of the analytical procedure in the effluent solution nor was pce this implies that the pfm worked properly as intended to capture dissolved contaminant as well as the tracer n hexanol the pce removal experiments exp 3 and exp 4 were duplicated and the duplicate results were fairly consistent with those described for exp 3 and exp 4 table s1 in the si 3 5 batch experiments for gelation and de gelation kinetics in porous media although fairly high concentrations of calcium and alginate were used for the model experiments it is important to investigate the thickness of alginate gel formed media under different conditions the gel formed sand region which is a stiff monolith of sand fig s7 in the si and alginate gel increased over time fig 11a the reaction of alginate and the divalent ion forming alginate gel is known to be instantaneous and the growth of gel depends on the relative diffusion rates of calcium ions and alginate molecules to the gelation zone bergstrom et al 1990 blandino et al 1999 skjåk bræk et al 1989 thus the time dependent behavior of alginate gel formed media fig 11a clearly reflects the diffusion limited reaction as the gel formed region grew inside the alginate solution the diffusive travel distance for the calcium ions increased which resulted in slowing down the increasing rate of the thickness of the gel formed region note that the thickness of the gel formed region is proportional to the square root of time time0 53 fig 11a which is a known functional relationship between diffusion distance and time schwarzenbach et al 1993 the fit shown in fig 10a also confirms that the growing rate of gel formed thickness t cm in the media is inversely proportional to the t eq 2 2 dt dt k t 0 89 where k is the rate constant m1 89 h and t is time h the k value was estimated to be 2 87 10 5 m1 89 h but it applies only for the specific concentrations of calcium ion and alginate used in this study the calcium concentration at fixed alginate concentration 1 5 w v was found to affect the gelation reaction in the porous media the thickness of the gel formed media increased rapidly as the cacl2 concentration increased fig 11b it is recommended to consider using cacl2 solution of 2 w v for the gelation test in porous media because only a slight enhancement of gel formed thickness was observed at cacl2 concentration higher than 2 w v with fixed cacl2 concentration at 2 0 w v the thickness of alginate gel formed region increased as the aqueous concentration of sodium alginate increased fig 11c the gel formed thickness became consistent at around 1 w v of sodium alginate concentration however the stiffness of the gel formed region might be affected by the concentration of alginate concentration the physical strength of gel formed porous media as the function of alginate concentration needs more investigation due to the difficulties associated detecting de gelation of alginate gel from the porous media sheets of alginate gel were used instead the manufacturing procedure of the alginate gel using the materials used for the model experiment is shown in fig s2 in the si the normalized mass mf mass left initial mass of alginate gel decreased over time in an 8 0 w v nahco3 solution fig 12a the disk initial mass of 3 4 g was dissolved completely at 93 min the de gelation rate was relatively slow at the beginning but it became faster as it lost mass this change in the mass loss rate is considered to be related to the physical stiffness of the alginate gel as the gel dissolved the structure of the gel became loose making the ion exchange reaction faster a more detailed study of the changes in the gel structure or stiffness during the dissolution process by ion exchange is required in the future to better understand the kinetics of de gelation the normalized gel mass removed mr mass removed initial mass is shown for different reaction times 70 min 140 min in fig 12b since the dissolution rate accelerates over time a small increase in reaction time results in a larger fraction of gel dissolved the concentration of nahco3 and the reaction time should be carefully determined depending on the thickness of the alginate gel formed in the porous media natural degradation of gel formed in aquifers may occur due to microbial activities of indigenous microbes premature barrier destruction before its designed operation duration can be prevented using additives e g formaldehyde or sodium azide that suppress the microbial growth such additives may be included in the precursor sodium alginate solution before it is introduced into the aquifer 4 conclusions injection of a sodium alginate solution into a porous media sand followed by the gelation reaction using a cacl2 solution successfully set a zone of alginate gel in the porous media which was confirmed for the physical chemical stability as a hydraulic barrier hydraulic barriers using alginate gel set in the aquifer can be disintegrated using a simple chemical injection restoring the subsurface environment to the original condition using the sodium ion rich aqueous solution e g nahco3 used in this study the gel was effectively removed by dissolution and the water flow pattern was restored based on experimental flux measurements the gel formed region in the aquifer created a funnel and gate type system at lab scale which controlled the water flow through the napl source zone facilitating the dissolution process this work presents a feasible process for the construction of temporary hydraulic barriers in the aquifer which may provide a useful alternative for the physical barriers requiring ground excavation for installation and in particular for those need to be removed after use for remediation note that the data presented in this study are limited to lab scale 2 d models packed with homogeneous sand hence studies on the formation and destruction of the alginate gel barriers in more complex hydrogeological settings and for extended dimensions should be conducted in future studies credit authorship contribution statement min su oh data curation validation resources michael

1207,surfactants can aid subsurface remediation through three primary mechanisms solubilization mobilization and or emulsification among these mechanisms emulsification in porous media is generally not well studied or well understood particularly in the context of treating sources containing multicomponent napl the objective of this research was to elucidate the processes responsible for recovery of a multicomponent hydrocarbon napl when surfactant solutions are introduced within a porous medium to promote the formation of kinetically stable oil in water emulsions emulsifier formulations considered here were selected to offer similar performance characteristics while relying on different families of non ionic surfactants nonylphenol ethoxylates or alcohol ethoxylates for emulsification the families of surfactants have particular environment relevance as alcohol ethoxylates are often used where replacement of nonylphenol content is necessary results from batch and column studies suggest performance of the two formulations was similar with both a synergistic combination of emulsification and mobilization led to recovery of a synthetic gasoline napl the relative contribution of solubilization to the recovery was found to be minor moreover the physical processes associated with emulsification and mobilization acted to limit the amount of preferential recovery

prior to being water saturated with a background solution 500 mg l cacl2 sgm napl was introduced to the column using a 50 ml gas tight hamilton syringe and a harvard apparatus syringe infusion pump at the flow rate of approximately 1 ml min residual saturations of sgm napl were established by flushing several pore volumes of the background solution at flow rates ranging from 0 3 to 5 0 ml min until sgm napl droplets were no longer observed leaving the column nonreactive conservative tracer tests were conducted before the introduction and after then entrapment of the sgm napl bromide was used as the tracer at a concentration of 0 01 m and quantified using a cole parmer electrode bromide probe column experiments commenced with the introduction of 1 pore volume of background solution 500 mg l

interpret the sgm napl recovery from columns containing medium to fine grain ottawa sand as the porous medium data from these column experiments were used to assess the mechanisms controlling the recovery of multicomponent napl 3 1 dissolution solubilization capacities results from batch experiments table 3 conducted in the absence of surfactant suggest that raoult s law analogy e g ramsburg et al 2010 banerjee 1984 provides reasonable predictions of the effective aqueous solubility for the hydrocarbon mixture components eberhardt and grathwohl 2002 mccray et al 2001 lekmine et al 2014 it is noted however that the accuracy of the raoult s law analogy can depend on mixture composition and weathering effects e g vasudevan et al 2016 to understand the potential role of solubilization sgm component concentrations were quantified in the continuous phase i e aqueous phase of emulsions formed when napl was contacted with various dilutions of the surfactant concentrates results suggest that solutions of these surfactants increase apparent concentrations of the sgm components through limited amounts of solubilization table 3 fig 1 at 5 v v the npe and ae formulations solubilize 1 2 g l of each component table 3 which is considerably less than other surfactant formulations employed for napl solubilization e g pennell et al 1997 zhou and dean rhue 2000 jayanti et al 2002 zhong et al 2003 cuoto et al 2009 hou et al 2020 the limited solubilization reflects the hlb for each formulation suggesting that these surfactants have greater affinity for emulsification i e increase of the oil water interfacial area than solubilization i e self aggregation within the continuous phase of the emulsion 3 2 mobilization potential measured properties of 5 solutions of the npe and ae formulations table 4 were used to produce a mobilization potential diagram long and ramsburg 2011 based on the total trapping number nt concept pennell et al 1996 flow configurations aligned against gravity i e up flow maximizes the potential for any sgm napl mobilization as buoyancy and viscous forces act together to mobilize and displace napl flow configurations aligned with gravity i e down flow should provide for more stable displacement of mobilized napl as the mobilized napl should remain near flow front horizontal flow may best approximate flow in field conditions in brief the mobilization potential diagram shows the influence of viscosity in the vertical as the relative height of each region is dictated by solution viscosity and interfacial tension in the horizontal as the relative length of each region is dictated by the interfacial tension these diagrams illustrate the zones of little partial and complete mobilization for multiple orders of magnitude of intrinsic permeability and darcy velocity in this way the diagrams may be useful when considering application of a given solution as they delineate the maximum in the case of solubilization or emulsification dominated recovery nt 1 10 5 and minimum in terms of mobilization dominated recovery nt 1 10 4 rates of flushing rate for a given permeability results shown in fig 2 suggest that for the ottawa federal fine sand used herein the 5 solution of the ae formulation is more likely to partially mobilize the sgm napl than is a 5 solution of the npe formulation 3 3 napl recovery napl recovery using each formulation was assessed through a series of column experiments relevant properties of each column experiment including capillary bond and total trapping numbers are shown in table 5 each formulation was tested at 5 v v with flow aligned both with downflow and against upflow gravity breakthrough curves for experiments a e are shown in fig 3 results from experiments a and b suggest a pseudo steady recovery of 10 14 g l tph for the first five pore volumes of flushing with the 5 solution of the npe formulation irrespective of flow orientation with or against gravity after these first five pore volumes the breakthrough curves exhibit the transient behavior typically observed as the napl mass remaining becomes limiting concentrations of the sgm components decrease appreciably after the background solution introduced after surfactant pulse breaks through in the effluent around pore volume nine the breakthrough curves also reveal that each of the sgm components exhibit similar temporal evolutions in the effluent this suggests that the recovery of the napl is a physical process as the chemical processes of dissolution and solubilization were found to be limited and preferential in the batch experiments partial mobilization also a physical recovery process of the sgm napl was observed within the columns during experiments a and b however all mobilized sgm napl was emulsified by the flow field prior to effluent sampling emulsion was visible in all effluent samples collected after the first pore volume of surfactant flushing together these data and observations suggest that the sgm napl is primarily recovered via emulsification by the npe formulation moreover the lack of a strong chemical process signature suggests that the emulsification occurring within these columns experiments a and b is controlled by a physical process i e mass transfer through the aqueous phase such as ostwald ripening has limited influence on contaminant recovery effluent data from the experiments conducted with the ae formulation experiment c e have a different character data from experiment c down flow are characterized by a relatively pseudo steady concentration approximately 10 g l tph with each of the sgm components again exhibiting similar temporal evolutions in the effluent however the effluent data of experiment c are punctuated with two substantial increases in concentration around 2 5 and 5 pore volumes see inset in fig 3 visual observations of experiment c note substantial mobilization that led to the formation of a bank of sgm napl this is interesting because the interfacial tension 9 05 0 09 mn m 1 and total trapping number 1 6 10 5 are not indicative of the extent of mobilization that was observed moreover the mobilized bank of sgm napl migrated slowly through the column reaching the effluent around 5 pore volumes indicating that emulsion was flowing through the bank mobilized napl more typically forms a bank when displaced at ultra low interfacial tension when flow acts to oppose the buoyancy of the napl the bank is stabilized against the aqueous phase flow front by gravity pennell et al 1996 sabatini et al 2000 li et al 2007 and produced in the effluent at the surfactant flow front the delayed production of the free product likely means that some of the mobilized sgm napl was ultimately emulsified in situ as the aqueous phase flowed through and around the mobilized sgm napl we hypothesize that the delayed production of sgm napl in experiment c resulted from one or more of the following effects i flow instabilities e g ramsburg and pennell 2002 ii emulsion based mobilization e g guillen et al 2012 javanbakht et al 2017 wang et al 2022 and iii wettability alterations powers and tamblin 1995 dwarakanath et al 2002 drake et al 2013 puentes and van geel 2013 robert et al 2017 further study of these processes and the role they may have in the production of the mobilized sgm napl was beyond the scope of this study but could be addressed in future experiments using alternative column procedures and sampling routines here we focus on assessing the relative role of mobilization when using the ae formulation in an upflow configuration a flow direction in which the mobilized bank of lnapl can migrate ahead of the aqueous phase flow front due to its buoyancy experiments d and e were replicate columns conducted with flow against gravity upflow effluent concentration data shown in fig 3 illustrate the combined effects of emulsification and partial mobilization leading to considerable quantities of hydrocarbons in the effluent maxima around 46 and 58 g l respectively the breakthrough curves from these experiments are also characterized by later time concentrations of around 10 g l tph which is consistent with the amount of emulsification observed in experiment c mobilization was observed in experiments d and e with free product present in the effluent samples cumulative tph recovery curves produced from the breakthrough curve data fig 3 are shown in fig 4 for experiments a e the pseudo steady recovery of sgm components observed with the npe formulation is reflected in the near constant rates of recovery during the surfactant pulses for experiments a and b the production of mobilized sgm napl as a distinct bank is apparent in sharp increase in the recovery curve for experiment c while mobilization was also observed in experiments d and e the recovery curves for these experiments are smoother i e less abrupt increases in mass recovered than in experiment c recovery curves for experiments d and e are smoother due to the synergistic action of emulsification and mobilization in these experiments to better elucidate the contributions of emulsification and mobilization the sample processing protocol was adjusted for experiment e to enable separation and quantification of the free product when the mobilized fraction 50 of the recovered mass is removed from the recovery curve for experiment e the rate of recovery appears more constant and better aligned with the emulsification observed with the npe formulation recall that these formulations were designed to have similar emulsification performance to further explore the physical versus chemical nature of the recovery using both the npe and ae formulations we calculated the mass fraction of the five sgm components present in each effluent sample i e mass component per mass tph in each sample results of this analysis are shown in fig 5 for experiments a d these plots focus on the time when emulsification is occurring in each experiment note that the pulse durations vary between experiments each is labeled in the figure and values are provided in table 5 the horizontal lines in each plot represent the mass fraction of each component in the sgm napl variation of the sgm napl composition resulted from making the sgm prior to each experiment a physical recovery process such a mobilization would be reflected by data very near these horizontal lines chemical processes leading to preferential recovery would be reflected by component data that are not associated with the corresponding component mass fraction in the sgm napl as can be seen in fig 5 effluent mass fractions of tph approach those of the sgm napl the most apparent deviation from this general trend occurs as the surfactant pulse arrives in the effluent around one pore volume we hypothesize that this deviation is related to the transition from a dissolution signature through a solubilization signature to an emulsification signature wang et al 2022 4 implications results suggest that the npe formulation recovers the sgm napl mass primarily via emulsification whereas the ae formulation both mobilization and emulsification the mechanism of mobilization in the experiments conducted here is not readily apparent as the viscosity and reduction of ift are modest at 5 ae emulsions have been shown to trigger mobilization most notably in studies focusing on hydrocarbon recovery from oil reservoirs e g khambhratana et al 1998 guillen et al 2012 qin et al 2020 while the mechanisms of emulsion based mobilization are not well understood guillen et al 2012 and wang et al 2022 highlight the importance of flow dynamics i e physical processes a greater mechanistic understanding may eventually help explain the differences observed between the different flow directions explored herein for now the differences in the rates of recovery appear related to how the emulsion interacts with the mobilized napl when there is unrestricted flow of napl mobilization and emulsification act synergistically to permit substantial recovery in the first few pore volumes of surfactant flushing rapid mass recovery of source mass may facilitate a site reaching the point where follow on treatments such as natural source zone depilation become relevant sookhak lari et al 2019 restrictions to napl flow e g counter current flow heterogeneity however may slow recovery of mobilized fraction and thus these influences on recovery should be investigated in follow on studies irrespective in situ emulsification was responsible for substantial amounts recovery 10 g l tph through physical recovery mechanisms the lack of appreciable fractionation in the napl coupled with the fact that the emulsion droplets are readily transported through the medium sand suggests emulsification may offer an alternative to surfactant treatments specifically designed to promote solubilization or mobilization use of surfactants to promote mobilization can be a particularly efficient approach but careful hydraulic control is necessary to ensure effective treatment more study is required to understand the extent to which emulsification may lessen this burden by suspending portions of the mobilized mass as droplets within the aqueous phase credit authorship contribution

1207,surfactants can aid subsurface remediation through three primary mechanisms solubilization mobilization and or emulsification among these mechanisms emulsification in porous media is generally not well studied or well understood particularly in the context of treating sources containing multicomponent napl the objective of this research was to elucidate the processes responsible for recovery of a multicomponent hydrocarbon napl when surfactant solutions are introduced within a porous medium to promote the formation of kinetically stable oil in water emulsions emulsifier formulations considered here were selected to offer similar performance characteristics while relying on different families of non ionic surfactants nonylphenol ethoxylates or alcohol ethoxylates for emulsification the families of surfactants have particular environment relevance as alcohol ethoxylates are often used where replacement of nonylphenol content is necessary results from batch and column studies suggest performance of the two formulations was similar with both a synergistic combination of emulsification and mobilization led to recovery of a synthetic gasoline napl the relative contribution of solubilization to the recovery was found to be minor moreover the physical processes associated with emulsification and mobilization acted to limit the amount of preferential recovery

10 4 m for purposes of visualization use of oil red o at this concentration has negligible influence on napl water interfacial tension particularly in the presence of surfactants taylor et al 2001 tuck et al 2003 2 3 batch experiments batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the dissolution and solubilization capacity as well as physical properties of equilibrated solutions aqueous solutions containing 0 0 5 1 5 2 5 4 5 and 8 vol surfactant concentrate were contacted with sgm using triplicate 35 ml glass centrifuge vials and sealed with teflon lined caps the vials were mixed on a labquake shaker tray and the resulting emulsions sampled for chemical analysis subsequent to sampling the emulsion tubes were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 30 min beckman coulter avanti centrifuge j 25 to break the emulsion and the resulting aqueous phase was sampled 2 4 column methods column experiments were performed following previously established methods e g ervin et al 2011 berge and ramsburg 2009 in brief a borosilicate glass column apparatus 4 8 cm i d kontes was dry packed under vibration using ottawa federal fine sand d50 320 μm ki 4 7 10 7 cm2 u s silica to a length of 10 cm federal fine is a medium to fine grain sand used to mimic the particle size distribution at the bachman road site e g ramsburg and pennell 2001 columns were flushed with co2 for approximately 20 min prior to being water saturated with a background solution 500 mg l cacl2 sgm napl was introduced to the column using a 50 ml gas tight hamilton syringe and a harvard apparatus syringe infusion pump at the flow rate of approximately 1 ml min residual saturations of sgm napl were established by flushing several pore volumes of the background solution at flow rates ranging from 0 3 to 5 0 ml min until sgm napl droplets were no longer observed leaving the column nonreactive conservative tracer tests were conducted before the introduction and after then entrapment of the sgm napl bromide was used as the tracer at a concentration of 0 01 m and quantified using a cole parmer electrode bromide probe column experiments commenced with the introduction of 1 pore volume of background solution 500 mg l cacl2 followed by approximately 8 pore volumes of 5 surfactant solution and then approximately 4 pore volumes of background solution the flow rate for all experiments was 1 ml min effluent samples were collected in 20 ml glass vials using an isco retriever ii fraction collector vials were immediately capped teflon lined caps weighed and processed for chemical analysis 2 5 analytical methods densities were quantified using 2 ml borosilicate glass pycnometers each pycnometer was calibrated using milliq water and isopropanol acros prior to each day of use dynamic viscosities were quantified using a rheometer ta instruments ar g2 equipped with a din rotor concentric cylinder at a shear rate 20 s 1 surface and interfacial tensions were measured using a drop shape analyzer i t concept tracker sgm components were quantified via gc fid hewlett packard model 6890 equipped with a flame ionization detector 3 results and discussion batch experiments were used to quantify the potential for preferential dissolution and or solubilization of the sgm components as well as mobilization of the sgm napl for each of the surfactant solutions this batch derived information was then used to interpret the sgm napl recovery from columns containing medium to fine grain ottawa sand as the porous medium data from these column experiments were used to assess the mechanisms controlling the recovery of multicomponent napl 3 1 dissolution solubilization capacities results from batch experiments table 3 conducted in the absence of surfactant suggest that raoult s law analogy e g ramsburg et al 2010 banerjee 1984 provides reasonable predictions of the effective aqueous solubility for the hydrocarbon mixture components eberhardt and grathwohl 2002 mccray et al 2001 lekmine et al 2014 it is noted however that the accuracy of the raoult s law analogy can depend on mixture composition and weathering effects e g vasudevan et al 2016 to understand the potential role of solubilization sgm component concentrations were quantified in the continuous phase i e aqueous phase of emulsions formed when napl was contacted with various dilutions of the surfactant concentrates results suggest that solutions of these surfactants increase apparent concentrations of the sgm components through limited amounts of solubilization table 3 fig 1 at 5 v v the npe and ae formulations solubilize 1 2 g l of each component table 3 which is considerably less than other surfactant formulations employed for napl solubilization e g pennell et al 1997 zhou and dean rhue 2000 jayanti et al 2002 zhong et al 2003 cuoto et al 2009 hou et al 2020 the limited solubilization reflects the hlb for each formulation suggesting that these surfactants have greater affinity for emulsification i e increase of the oil water interfacial area than solubilization i e self aggregation within the continuous phase of the emulsion 3 2 mobilization potential measured properties of 5 solutions of the npe and ae formulations table 4 were used to produce a mobilization potential diagram long and ramsburg 2011 based on the total trapping number nt concept pennell et al 1996 flow configurations aligned against gravity i e up flow maximizes the potential for any sgm napl mobilization as buoyancy and viscous forces act together to mobilize and displace napl flow configurations aligned with gravity i e down flow should provide for more stable displacement of mobilized napl as the mobilized napl should remain near flow front horizontal flow may best approximate flow in field conditions in brief the mobilization potential diagram shows the influence of viscosity in the vertical as the relative height of each region is dictated by solution viscosity and interfacial tension in the horizontal as the relative length of each region is dictated by the interfacial tension these diagrams illustrate the zones of little partial and complete mobilization for multiple orders of magnitude of intrinsic permeability and darcy velocity in this way the diagrams may be useful when considering application of a given solution as they delineate the maximum in the case of solubilization or emulsification dominated recovery nt 1 10 5 and minimum in terms of mobilization dominated recovery nt 1 10 4 rates of flushing rate for a given permeability results shown in fig 2 suggest that for the ottawa federal fine sand used herein the 5 solution of the ae formulation is more likely to partially mobilize the sgm napl than is a 5 solution of the npe formulation 3 3 napl recovery napl recovery using each formulation was assessed through a series of column experiments relevant properties of each column experiment including capillary bond and total trapping numbers are shown in table 5 each formulation was tested at 5 v v with flow aligned both with downflow and against upflow gravity breakthrough curves for experiments a e are shown in fig 3 results from experiments a and b suggest a pseudo steady recovery of 10 14 g l tph for the first five pore volumes of flushing with the 5 solution of the npe formulation irrespective of flow orientation with or against gravity after these first five pore volumes the breakthrough curves exhibit the transient behavior typically observed as the napl mass remaining becomes limiting concentrations of the sgm components decrease appreciably after the background solution introduced after surfactant pulse breaks through in the effluent around pore volume nine the breakthrough curves also reveal that each of the sgm components exhibit similar temporal evolutions in the effluent this suggests that the recovery of the napl is a physical process as the chemical processes of dissolution and solubilization were found to be limited and preferential in the batch experiments partial mobilization also a physical recovery process of the sgm napl was observed within the columns during experiments a and b however all mobilized sgm napl was emulsified by the flow field prior to effluent sampling emulsion was visible in all effluent samples collected after the first pore volume of surfactant flushing together these data and observations suggest that the sgm napl is primarily recovered via emulsification by the npe formulation moreover the lack of a strong chemical process signature suggests that the emulsification occurring within these columns experiments a and b is controlled by a physical process i e mass transfer through the aqueous phase such as ostwald ripening has limited influence on contaminant recovery effluent data from the experiments conducted with the ae formulation experiment c e have a different character data from experiment c down flow are characterized by a relatively pseudo steady concentration approximately 10 g l tph with each of the sgm components again exhibiting similar temporal evolutions in the effluent however the effluent data of experiment c are punctuated with two substantial increases in concentration around 2 5 and 5 pore volumes see inset in fig 3 visual observations of experiment c note substantial mobilization that led to the formation of a bank of sgm napl this is interesting because the interfacial tension 9 05 0 09 mn m 1 and total trapping number 1 6 10 5 are not indicative of the extent of mobilization that was observed moreover the mobilized bank of sgm napl migrated slowly through the column reaching the effluent around 5 pore volumes indicating that emulsion was flowing through the bank mobilized napl more typically forms a bank when displaced at ultra low interfacial tension when flow acts to oppose the buoyancy of the napl the bank is stabilized against the aqueous phase flow front by gravity pennell et al 1996 sabatini et al 2000 li et al 2007 and produced in the effluent at the surfactant flow front the delayed production of the free product likely means that some of the mobilized sgm napl was ultimately emulsified in situ as the aqueous phase flowed through and around the mobilized sgm napl we hypothesize that the delayed production of sgm napl in experiment c resulted from one or more of the following effects i flow instabilities e g ramsburg and pennell 2002 ii emulsion based mobilization e g guillen et al 2012 javanbakht et al 2017 wang et al 2022 and iii wettability alterations powers and tamblin 1995 dwarakanath et al 2002 drake et al 2013 puentes and van geel 2013 robert et al 2017 further study of these processes and the role they may have in the production of the mobilized sgm napl was beyond the scope of this study but could be addressed in future experiments using alternative column procedures and sampling routines here we focus on assessing the relative role of mobilization when using the ae formulation in an upflow configuration a flow direction in which the mobilized bank of lnapl can migrate ahead of the aqueous phase flow front due to its buoyancy experiments d and e were replicate columns conducted with flow against gravity upflow effluent concentration data shown in fig 3 illustrate the combined effects of emulsification and partial mobilization leading to considerable quantities of hydrocarbons in the effluent maxima around 46 and 58 g l respectively the breakthrough curves from these experiments are also characterized by later time concentrations of around 10 g l tph which is consistent with the amount of emulsification observed in experiment c mobilization was observed in experiments d and e with free product present in the effluent samples cumulative tph recovery curves produced from the breakthrough curve data fig 3 are shown in fig 4 for experiments a e the pseudo steady recovery of sgm components observed with the npe formulation is reflected in the near constant rates of recovery during the surfactant pulses for experiments a and b the production of mobilized sgm napl as a distinct bank is apparent in sharp increase in the recovery curve for experiment c while mobilization was also observed in experiments d and e the recovery curves for these experiments are smoother i e less abrupt increases in mass recovered than in experiment c recovery curves for experiments d and e are smoother due to the synergistic action of emulsification and mobilization in these experiments to better elucidate the contributions of emulsification and mobilization the sample processing protocol was adjusted for experiment e to enable separation and quantification of the free product when the mobilized fraction 50 of the recovered mass is removed from the recovery curve for experiment e the rate of recovery appears more constant and better aligned with the emulsification observed with the npe formulation recall that these formulations were designed to have similar emulsification performance to further explore the physical versus chemical nature of the recovery using both the npe and ae formulations we calculated the mass fraction of the five sgm components present in each effluent sample i e mass component per mass tph in each sample results of this analysis are shown in fig 5 for experiments a d these plots focus on the time when emulsification is occurring in each experiment note that the pulse durations vary between experiments each is labeled in the figure and values are provided in table 5 the horizontal lines in each plot represent the mass fraction of each component in the sgm napl variation of the sgm napl composition resulted from making the sgm prior to each experiment a physical recovery process such a mobilization would be reflected by data very near these horizontal lines chemical processes leading to preferential recovery would be reflected by component data that are not associated with the corresponding component mass fraction in the sgm napl as can be seen in fig 5 effluent mass fractions of tph approach those of the sgm napl the most apparent deviation from this general trend occurs as the surfactant pulse arrives in the effluent around one pore volume we hypothesize that this deviation is related to the transition from a dissolution signature through a solubilization signature to an emulsification signature wang et al 2022 4 implications results suggest that the npe formulation recovers the sgm napl mass primarily via emulsification whereas the ae formulation both mobilization and emulsification the mechanism of mobilization in the experiments conducted here is not readily apparent as the viscosity and reduction of ift are modest at 5 ae emulsions have been shown to trigger mobilization most notably in studies focusing on hydrocarbon recovery from oil reservoirs e g khambhratana et al 1998 guillen et al 2012 qin et al 2020 while the mechanisms of emulsion based mobilization are not well understood guillen et al 2012 and wang et al 2022 highlight the importance of flow dynamics i e physical processes a greater mechanistic understanding may eventually help explain the differences observed between the different flow directions explored herein for now the differences in the rates of recovery appear related to how the emulsion interacts with the mobilized napl when there is unrestricted flow of napl mobilization and emulsification act synergistically to permit substantial recovery in the first few pore volumes of surfactant flushing rapid mass recovery of source mass may facilitate a site reaching the point where follow on treatments such as natural source zone depilation become relevant sookhak lari et al 2019 restrictions to napl flow e g counter current flow heterogeneity however may slow recovery of mobilized fraction and thus these influences on recovery should be investigated in follow on studies irrespective in situ emulsification was responsible for substantial amounts recovery 10 g l tph through physical recovery mechanisms the lack of appreciable fractionation in the napl coupled with the fact that the emulsion droplets are readily transported through the medium sand suggests emulsification may offer an alternative to surfactant treatments specifically designed to promote solubilization or mobilization use of surfactants to promote mobilization can be a particularly efficient approach but careful hydraulic control is necessary to ensure effective treatment more study is required to understand the extent to which emulsification may lessen this burden by suspending portions of the mobilized mass as droplets within the aqueous phase credit authorship contribution

1208,equifinality and premature convergence can result in considerable errors when simultaneously characterizing groundwater contamination sources and estimating contaminant transport parameters to resolve this problem we design a sensitivity dependent progressive optimization system embedding ensemble learning technique to avoid repetitive cpu demanding model evaluations in sobol global sensitivity analysis and swarm intelligence optimization inverse modeling kriging support vector regression svr kernel extreme learning machine kelm and deep convolutional neural network dcnn are compared and ensembled to build an accurate surrogate of the numerical model in addition the sensitivities of different source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters are set as important indicators to adjust the displacement vectors of the swarm in each iteration during the optimization process to achieve a balanced identification of sensitivity varied elements moreover a homotopy based progressive searching mechanism approach to the global optimum in large areas is developed with the aim of preventing premature convergence for multimodal search problems the results indicate that the ensemble learning model efficiently captures the complex input output relationship of the numerical model with an increased determination coefficient r 2 0 9988 while the mean relative error is limited to 0 9314 although the contribution of source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters to the spatial temporal distribution of contaminants vary dramatically the combined application of sensitivity analysis homotopy theory and swarm intelligence optimization provides a more stable and accurate estimation of all the elements the mean relative error of the identification results significantly reduced from 7 2184 to 3 2718 whereas the maximum relative error is limited to 9 9501 keywords dnapls groundwater contamination source inversion machine learning sensitivity analysis progressive searching mechanism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the discharge and accidental leakage of dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls have caused serious and prolonged contamination issues worldwide lapworth et al 2012 xie et al 2018 however once dnapls are transported into the groundwater system contamination remediation suffers from many difficulties remediation projects generally incur high costs in terms of labor and material resources and contaminant removal rates are not ideal therefore it is critical to formulate a reasonable remediation strategy based on the precise identification of the dnapl s source characteristics furthermore timely control of contamination sources and reliable contamination risk assessments also rely on accurate dnapl source information amirabdollahian and datta 2013 chaubey and kashyap 2017 yan et al 2019 it has been stated that groundwater dnapl source identification is the solution to an inverse problem that is usually nonlinear and ill posed sun 2009 ayvaz 2016 zhang et al 2016 lu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 to enrich the method and improve inversion efficiency an optimization system embedding ensemble learning technique was proposed and the groundwater flow and contaminant transport parameters e g permeability porosity and dispersivity were simultaneously estimated however the equifinality effect is inevitable in such complex multimodal optimization problems implying low reliability of the simultaneous identification values of unknown variables including source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters moreover the generally applied heuristic algorithms are not sufficiently powerful geng et al 2007 gurarslan and karahan 2015 guneshwor et al 2018 reynolds et al 2018 liu et al 2021a heuristic algorithms depend heavily on the quality of prior information and initial values and the searching process can easily fall into premature convergence in large searching areas resulting in misleading solutions in practice yin et al 2020 zeinali et al 2020 de santiago et al 2020 hu et al 2021 liu et al 2022 consequently a progressive searching mechanism with a stable approach to global optimums that ignored the initial value selection was developed by reconstructing the swarm intelligent optimization model through homotopy theory the contribution of different source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters to the inversion objective function value varies dramatically and should be calculated using the contaminant distribution in the aquifer hou et al 2016 li et al 2018 chen et al 2018 in the optimization process the values of decision variables should be simultaneously adjusted in each iteration to approach global optimums although unfavorable adjustments of high sensitivity variables can mask any improvements in the favorable adjustment of other variables kaveh and mahdavi 2016 zou et al 2021 liu et al 2021b given that it is difficult to search for the global optimums of low sensitivity variables in limited iterations the sensitivities of different variables can be set as important indicators to adjust the displacement vectors for particle swarm optimization pso in each iteration as the optimization process proceeds the adjustment coefficients of the decision variables decrease gradually in different proportions accordingly the focus is on searching for the optimums of high sensitivity variables in the early stage while searching for the optimums of low sensitivity variables is the focus in the later stage for global sensitivity analyses and homotopy based optimization processes the dnapl contaminant transport numerical model is invoked thousands of times resulting in a huge computational burden therefore applying artificial intelligence methods to learn the input output relationship of a numerical model and conduct repetitive evaluations as an intelligent surrogate model is crucial as it achieves several orders of magnitude higher computational efficiency razavi et al 2012 song et al 2019 luo et al 2020 li et al 2020a chen et al 2022a 2022b the most widely applied surrogate modeling techniques for groundwater contamination modeling can be summarized in three categories progression analysis he et al 2008 zhou et al 2018 xiao et al 2020 machine learning srivastava and singh 2015 xiang et al 2017 hou and lu 2018a li et al 2020b jiang et al 2021 and deep learning methods shen 2018 hong and rioflorido 2019 mo et al 2019 chen et al 2021 however there is significant variance in the applicability and robustness of these methods when dealing with different types of nonlinear fitting problems and they can be trapped in instability and overfitting problems hence it is necessary to conduct a convictive selection of the surrogate modeling technique in the dnapl source inversion framework this is because the performance of a surrogate model has a significant impact on inversion reliability and the special characteristics of contaminants render the input output relationship of the numerical model difficult to approximate to improve the performance of surrogate models different progression analyses machine learning and deep learning methods for surrogate modeling are exhibited and compared herein the comparison study incorporated kriging support vector regression svr kernel extreme learning machine kelm deep convolutional neural network dcnn and ensemble learning surrogate els this allowed the selection of the most suitable surrogate model to depict the complex nonlinear relationship between the dnapl source characteristics contaminant transport parameters and spatial temporal distribution of the contaminants the main contribution of this study is to develop a more reliable and efficient approach for groundwater contamination inverse modeling the novel aspects are summarized as follows 1 different progression analyses machine learning and deep learning methods were compared and ensembled to accurately capture the nonlinear relationship between the inputs source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters and corresponding outputs contaminant distribution of the numerical model 2 a sensitivity dependent dynamic swarm intelligence optimization sd sio algorithm was designed for the balanced identification of sensitivity varied elements thereby realizing precise inversion of all the unknown variables 3 a homotopy based progressive optimization mechanism was constructed to enable a stable search for the global optimum in wide areas with a much lower probability of becoming trapped by premature convergence compared to heuristic algorithms 2 methodology 2 1 framework of sensitivity dependent intelligent optimization system the main framework of the proposed sensitivity dependent intelligent inversion system fig 1 consists of groundwater dnapl contamination numerical simulation training and testing the surrogate models sensitivity analysis progressive searching mechanism construction with homotopy theory and source inversion using the sensitivity dependent swarm intelligence algorithm a more detailed description is presented as follows step 1 build the groundwater dnapl contamination numerical simulation model then prepare the training sample and testing sample datasets based on the latin hypercube sampling lhs method to reflect the relationship between the numerical model inputs dnapl source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters and corresponding outputs contaminant distribution step 2 build the kriging svr kelm dcnn and els models to approximate the input output relationship of the numerical model and analyze the performance of the different models the optimal surrogate model was embedded in the subsequent sensitivity analysis and inverse iterations to achieve higher computational efficiency step 3 conduct a sobol global sensitivity analysis for different decision variables on the spatial temporal distribution of contaminants step 4 according to the sensitivity analysis results the adjustment coefficients of the displacement vectors for decision variables in the swarm intelligence optimization algorithm are set to vary along with the increase in iterations facilitating development of the sd sio algorithm step 5 based on homotopy theory construct a series of optimization models that are continuously dependent on the homotopy parameter and the solution of optimization model series approached to the real dnapl source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters gradually step 6 apply the sd sio algorithm to search for the optimal solution of the homotopy model series successively and a progressive mechanism is formed in which the previous optimum provides the initial population generating basis for the following optimization the solution of the last model is the final source inversion results 2

realizes precise inversion of all the variables with a dramatically varied contribution to the dnapl source inversion objective function the basic operational process of the sd sio algorithm can be

for different decision variables are basically equivalent however with increasing iterations the adjustment coefficients of the high sensitivity variables decrease much faster than those of low sensitivity variables this means that in the later stages of the optimization process the high sensitivity variables are adjusted far less than the low sensitivity variables therefore the improved algorithm mainly searches for the optimums of the high sensitivity variables in the early stages and searches for the optimums of the low sensitivity variables in the later stages 4 re evaluate the fitness of particles then update pbest gbest and t t 1 repeat step 3 until t reaches the maximum number of iterations then make gbest the optimal solution 2 4 homotopy based progressive optimization mechanism for simultaneously identifying the contamination source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters linear homotopy is initially employed to formulate the homotopy functions h s p λ the solution of h s p λ 0 is associated with an assumed source as λ 0 and the solution of h s p λ 0 is associated with the real source as λ 1 lin et al 1996 jia et al 2017 20 h s p λ λ f s p c obs 1 λ f s p c 0 here s represents the source characteristics p represents the contaminant transport parameters f represents the numerical model which can transform the s and p to contaminant concentration prediction c c obs is the observed concentration vector of the contaminants and c 0 represents the concentration vector of the contaminants obtained by the numerical model with assumed initial source characteristics the homotopy functions h continuously depend on the homotopy parameter λ the series of homotopy equations can be obtained by dividing the range interval of λ λ 0 0 λ 1 λ n 1 as follows chen et al 2017 chi et al 2017 21 h s p λ i f s p λ i c obs 1 λ i c 0 0 i 1 2 n based on this homotopy concept the optimization model series corresponding to the homotopy equations for the inversion problem can be obtained as follows 22 min h s p λ i i 1 2 n s t g j s p 0 j 1 2 p h k s p 0 k 1 2 q where g j s p j 1 2 p is the inequality constraint and h k s p k 1 2 q is the equality constraint the sd sio algorithm is applied to solve these optimization models successively through a path tracking process elsisi 2020 yan et al 2022 sun and zhou 2022 thereby forming a progressive optimization mechanism tracking the change of homotopy parameter the progressive optimization mechanism started from the assumed initial contamination source λ 0 0 and the real information of contamination source λ n 1 will be approached stepwise 23 initial population po p i ini sd sio optimum s i 1 opt p i 1 opt min h s p λ i min h s p λ i 1 s t g j s p 0 j 1 2 p h k s p 0 k 1 2 q s t g j s p 0 j 1 2 p h k s

vectors related to the source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters in sd sio respectively as this process gradually evolves the solutions of the two adjacent optimization problems should be acceptably close hou et al 2021 using the optimal solution of one model to generate the initial population of the next model is critical for high quality optimization 3 case study 3 1 test case overview to analyze the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodologies we designed a three dimensional numerical hypothetical case of a heterogeneous phreatic aquifer contaminated by chlorobenzene the contamination of dnapls in the site would probably have been caused by the leakage of a sewage pipe the contaminants would have entered the aquifer continuously and were then subject to a period of natural dissolution and diffusion the variables to be identified were determined as follows 1 longitudinal and transverse coordinates of the leakage point source location 2 contaminant release strength 3 oil phase volume fraction in the sewage i e the volume fraction of the contaminants undissolved in the sewage 4 contaminant leakage duration simulation period 5 aquifer parameters including the porosity and permeability of the gravel and medium fine sand and longitudinal and transverse aqueous dispersivity and 6 hydraulic gradient the testing case is a virtual case that designed according to a real site that located in a piedmont plain area with uncomplicated geologic structure for assessing the accuracy of the source inversion results and verify the significance of the applied methodologies the designed virtual case was basically similar with the real case for the convenience of application migration while the contamination source information and contaminant transport parameters values were given prior to the identification in table 1 the accuracy analysis could be conducted by compare the inversion outputs with the given values the calculated target phreatic layer was 10 m thick medium fine sand and gravel the northeast and southwest boundaries were designated as first type boundaries with a specified head and pressure the southeast and northwest boundaries parallel to the flow direction of the groundwater were composed of flow surfaces and could be designated as zero flux boundaries the underlying bedrock formed a natural water barrier boundary and was also designated as a zero flux boundary while the upward phreatic surface was considered the water exchange boundary fig 3 according to the hydrogeologic conceptual model of the contaminated site the multi phase flow mathematical model of groundwater contamination was established by coupling the following partial differential equation and appropriate initial and boundary conditions 25 ϕ c i ρ i t j 1 2 ρ i c ij d ij v j ϕ s j c ij r i x y z ω t 0 d ij b tj ϕ s j v j δ pq b lj b tj ϕ s j v jp v jq v j x y z ω t 0 where i was the component index j was the phase index

δ ij was the kronecker function b lj b tj were the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity of phase j m v jp v jq was the seepage velocity component in p and q directions of phase j m s 1 the dynamic observations of contaminant concentrations were achieved by sampling from the bottom of the eight wells as dnapls have a strong tendency to sink below the water the simulation domain covered 650 350 10 m3 which was discretized into 10 10 2 m3 grids fig 3 the groundwater dnapl contamination numerical simulation model was solved using the university of texas chemical flooding simulator utchem software 3 2 surrogate models in total 12 variables needed to be identified which were treated as controllable input variables to build the surrogate models the surrogate model outputs were the predicted concentrations of contaminants in the bottom of the eight observation wells at the end of the simulation period the lhs method was used to obtain 200 training input vectors and 20 testing input vectors according to the distribution characteristics of the 12 unknown variables table 1 and the corresponding output vectors were obtained for the numerical model runs the kriging svr kelm dcnn and els models were established with the training sample dataset on a matlab platform while the performances of the different models were analyzed by comparing the model predictions and target outputs corresponding to the testing samples the key parameters of kriging svr and kelm and the ensemble weights for els were optimized using pso this method was presented in detail by hou et al 2015 the optimized parameters of kriging svr and kelm models were shown in table 2 the dcnn consisted of two sets of convolution pooling structures and one full connection layer the convolution layer mapped the inputs of the training sample dataset to the high dimensional space to learn and train the feature information via the sigmoid activation function and the dcnn model was established after the procedures of forward conduction and backpropagation the hyper parameters of dcnn were shown in table 3 four indices were applied to evaluate the performance of surrogate models 1 deterministic

homotopy based searching system a dnapl contamination numerical simulation model was built with the given source characteristics and the contaminant transport parameters for forward prediction the predicted contaminant concentrations in the eight wells at the end of the simulation period were treated as actual observations for inverse modeling subsequently an inversion optimization model was established to minimize deviations between the actual observations and model predictions in addition the variables corresponding to the source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters were set as the decision variables the els model was embedded in the optimization model to replace the numerical model to obtain predictions of contaminant concentration 30 min k 1 8 c k c k 2 s t c f s p

k th well with the initial estimated source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters 3 4 sensitivity dependent dynamic swarm intelligence optimization the sobol global sensitivity analysis method with the embedded els model was adopted to assess the contribution of the 12 variables to the spatial temporal distribution of contaminants the sum of first order primary sensitivity and second order interaction sensitivity corresponding to a specific variable was considered the sensitivity indicator absolute value in eq 19 for calculating the dynamic adjustment coefficient the method present by hou et al 2016 could be referenced to calculate the order primary sensitivity and second order interaction sensitivity the sd sio algorithm was employed to solve the homotopy models in eq 31 successively and the solutions of the model with a homotopy parameter of λ 1 were the inversion outputs the sd sio population size was set to 60 the algorithm was terminated in 80 iterations for each homotopy optimization and the last homotopy optimization was terminated at 150 iterations in addition pso and sd sio were applied to solve the optimization model in eq 30 directly for another set of source inversion values while the parameter options for pso and sd sio were shown in table 4 here the optimization with each algorithm was carried out three times for the stability analysis and these sets of inversion values were compared with the hypothetical true values to verify the searching capability of the different searching algorithms 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance evaluation of surrogate models in total 20 test samples comprising 160 concentration outputs were used to analyze the generalization ability of the surrogate models with one input vector connected to the eight output values contaminant concentrations the els and individual models provided good predictions of the contaminant concentrations achieving close to a 1 1 relationship with the numerical simulations as shown in fig 4 this meant that all five models were capable of learning and reconstructing the input output mapping relationship of the numerical model although the points of the kriging and els models approximated the 1 1 line more accurately fig 5 a displays the boxplots which was generated by the origin software for the surrogate model testing relative errors where the disparity of performance can be clearly distinguished the performance of the kriging model was outstanding among four single surrogate models with the smallest mean median upper edge and upper quartile when testing the relative errors in addition the indicators of approximation accuracy corresponding to the svr and kelm models were clearly superior to the dcnn model this result suggested that the regression analysis and machine learning methods were more powerful than the deep learning method for solving the nonlinear relationship approximation problem of vectors corresponding to the inputs and outputs of the groundwater dnapl contamination numerical simulation the optimal ensemble weights for the kriging svr kelm and dcnn models were 0 8048 0 0000 0 1952 and 0 0000 respectively meaning that only the accuracy of the kriging and kelm models were acceptable figs 5 b and c display the distribution of relative errors for the surrogate model outputs the els model achieved the lowest relative error cumulative curve and most of the errors were concentrated between 0 and 3 the same conclusions were achieved by using the four performance evaluation indicators presented in table 5 the els model was the most reliable intelligence surrogate achieving the highest determination coefficient 0 9988 lowest maximum relative error 4 8312 and lowest mean relative error 0 9314 running the dnapl contamination numerical model on a common pc platform took nearly 600 s while each run of the els model was just 1 2 s accordingly utilizing the els model to replace the numerical model in the inversion iterations is critical for improving the computational efficiency by several orders of magnitude while maintaining high reliability although the performance of the dcnn model was unacceptable in the present study it still achieved a mean relative error 3 3137 and maximum relative error 13 3904 deep learning is more powerful in the field of image recognition and it has large application potential for recognizing the structure and parameter distribution of heterogeneous aquifers therefore further study is required to analyze the performance of machine learning and deep learning methods when identifying contamination sources in complex heterogeneous aquifers 4 2 sensitivity dependent optimization analysis the sobol global sensitivity analysis results indicated the first order primary sensitivity and second order interaction sensitivity corresponding to the different variables table 6 when the variables were changed in the feasible region a larger absolute value of sensitivity indicated a higher contribution to the model outputs and a negative value of sensitivity indicated a negative correlation between the specific variable and the model outputs the transverse coordinate of the contamination source porosity of the gravel permeability of the sand longitudinal aqueous dispersivity transverse aqueous dispersivity and hydraulic gradient were clearly more sensitive than the other variables according to the sensitivity analysis results the sd sio algorithm was constructed then pso sd sio and homotopy based sd sio h sd sio were applied to solve the inversion optimization model in eq 30 fig 6 displays the convergence curves for different variables of 3 pso identification and 3 sd sio identification the traditional heuristic algorithm pso achieved convergence very quickly approximately 40 iterations although the identified optimums were unstable because the initial values should have been randomized the simultaneous inversion model of dnapl source and contamination transport parameters was highly nonlinear and multimodal resulting in the searching process being easily trapped in a local optimum moreover the identification outputs varied distinctively for each optimization especially the insensitive variables such as contaminant release strength oil phase volume fraction in the sewage and porosity of the sand the sd sio conducted more effective searching and achieved convergence in approximately 80 iterations furthermore the identification outputs of sd sio were more stable and concentrated around the true values identification stability and the accuracy of insensitive variables mentioned previously significantly improved which could also improve the identification of other variables the improvement made by sd sio was showed more clearly by plotting the convergence curves of the best rounds of solutions among 3 times pso identification and 3 times sd sio identification pso 1 and sd sio 1 in fig 7 among the 12 variables only the identification values of longitudinal coordinate m oil phase volume fraction in sewage and permeability of sand obtain by pso were slightly better than those of sd sio tables 7 and 8 display comparisons of identification accuracy when using pso and sd sio the identification results for pso exhibited obvious equifinality as the maximum relative errors of 3 identification were 18 5115 35 0095 and 47 3733 while those of sd sio were limited to 17 6878 20 1979 and 21 8395 furthermore the mean relative errors reduced from 7 2184 8 5317 and 9 4430 to 5 7410 5 4773 and 6 4652 respectively compared with the pso the sd sio algorithm was effective in reducing the holistic error level of the inversion outputs while also improving the fitting degree of the objective function by several orders of magnitude pso 2 47 10 6 2 77 10 4 and 1 41 10 6 sd sio 9 85 10 11 4 72 10 11 and 8 07 10 10 4 3 homotopy based optimization analysis the progressive searching capability of the homotopy based sd sio h sd sio algorithm was demonstrated by the inversion convergence curves of the source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters fig 8 tracking the change of the homotopy parameter the identified values in the inversion iterations segmentally approached the true values especially the transverse coordinate of the contamination source the contaminant leakage duration and the longitudinal dispersivity moreover the excessively large area searching problem was transformed into several stages of local searching reducing and dividing the premature convergence risk if there were unexpected stages that deviated far from the global optimum the subsequent stages in the progressive solving mechanism would bring the trend back an accuracy analysis of the inversion outputs obtained with the h sd sio algorithm is depicted in table 9 compared with sd sio the identification accuracy was further improved with the mean relative errors of 3 inversion reducing from 5 7410 5 4773 and 6 4652 to 3 2718 3 6893 and 4 2785 respectively moreover for the h sd sio identification results the maximum relative error was 9 9501 which was significantly lower than the 17 6878 of the sd sio identification results these results demonstrated that the homotopy based progressive searching mechanism was effective in limiting the equifinality effect the searching capability of the swarm intelligence optimization algorithm was fully exploited and the inversion accuracy was sufficiently improved the numerical models were established to calculate the final distribution of contaminants according to the inversion source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters in addition the identified plumes were compared with the true plume of the hypothetical case fig 9 the red dotted and green dotted marked the edge of 0 1 μg l and 30 000 μg l contours respectively which could make it easier to distinguish the difference between different plumes the contours of the identified plumes of sd sio and h sd sio were clearly closer to those of the true plume compared to pso and the shapes of the contamination plumes were very similar the numerical model corrected with the h sd sio inversion values was able to accurately forecast the distribution of contaminants providing a reliable basis for contamination risk assessments and remediation strategy programming 5 conclusion a sensitivity dependent intelligent inversion system of groundwater dnapl source was designed to resolve the equifinality and premature convergence problems resulting from multimodal searches and multi variable simultaneous identification an ensemble learning surrogate model the els model and a homotopy based progressive searching mechanism were proposed and embedded into the inversion system the following conclusions can be drawn from this research 1 the provided regression analysis kriging and machine learning kelm models approximated the multiphase flow simulation model more effectively than the deep learning dcnn model moreover els further improved the approximation accuracy accompanied by a mean relative error of 0 9314 in addition els reduced the computational cost of inversion iterations incurred from the repetitive simulation model calculations saving cpu time by a factor of more than 400 2 the sensitivities of different decision variables were used as important indicators to adjust the displacement vectors of pso in each iteration this was critical for realizing precise identification of all the dnapl source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters with dramatically varying contributions to the inversion objective function compared with the pso algorithm sd sio provided a more accurate estimation of the elements and limited the maximum identification relative error from 35 0095 to 21 8395 3 the homotopy based progressive searching mechanism was a significant improvement over the heuristic optimization approaches moreover the homotopy based sd sio algorithm performed more stably when approaching the global optimum in wider areas the mean relative error between the identification results and corresponding given values was limited to 3 2718

1208,equifinality and premature convergence can result in considerable errors when simultaneously characterizing groundwater contamination sources and estimating contaminant transport parameters to resolve this problem we design a sensitivity dependent progressive optimization system embedding ensemble learning technique to avoid repetitive cpu demanding model evaluations in sobol global sensitivity analysis and swarm intelligence optimization inverse modeling kriging support vector regression svr kernel extreme learning machine kelm and deep convolutional neural network dcnn are compared and ensembled to build an accurate surrogate of the numerical model in addition the sensitivities of different source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters are set as important indicators to adjust the displacement vectors of the swarm in each iteration during the optimization process to achieve a balanced identification of sensitivity varied elements moreover a homotopy based progressive searching mechanism approach to the global optimum in large areas is developed with the aim of preventing premature convergence for multimodal search problems the results indicate that the ensemble learning model efficiently captures the complex input output relationship of the numerical model with an increased determination coefficient r 2 0 9988 while the mean relative error is limited to 0 9314 although the contribution of source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters to the spatial temporal distribution of contaminants vary dramatically the combined application of sensitivity analysis homotopy theory and swarm intelligence optimization provides a more stable and accurate estimation of all the elements the mean relative error of the identification results significantly reduced from 7 2184 to 3 2718 whereas the maximum relative error is limited to 9 9501 keywords dnapls groundwater contamination source inversion machine learning sensitivity analysis progressive searching mechanism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the discharge and accidental leakage of dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls have caused serious and prolonged contamination issues worldwide lapworth et al 2012 xie et al 2018 however once dnapls are transported into the groundwater system contamination remediation suffers from many difficulties remediation projects generally incur high costs in terms of labor and material resources and contaminant removal rates are not ideal therefore it is critical to formulate a reasonable remediation strategy based on the precise identification of the dnapl s source characteristics furthermore timely control of contamination sources and reliable contamination risk assessments also rely on accurate dnapl source information amirabdollahian and datta 2013 chaubey and kashyap 2017 yan et al 2019 it has been stated that groundwater dnapl source identification is the solution to an inverse problem that is usually nonlinear and ill posed sun 2009 ayvaz 2016 zhang et al 2016 lu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 to enrich the method and improve inversion efficiency an optimization system embedding ensemble learning technique was proposed and the groundwater flow and contaminant transport parameters e g permeability porosity and dispersivity were simultaneously estimated however the equifinality effect is inevitable in such complex multimodal optimization problems implying low reliability of the simultaneous identification values of unknown variables including source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters moreover the generally applied heuristic algorithms are not sufficiently powerful geng et al 2007 gurarslan and karahan 2015 guneshwor et al 2018 reynolds et al 2018 liu et al 2021a heuristic algorithms depend heavily on the quality of prior information and initial values and the searching process can easily fall into premature convergence in large searching areas resulting in misleading solutions in practice yin et al 2020 zeinali et al 2020 de santiago et al 2020 hu et al 2021 liu et al 2022 consequently a progressive searching mechanism with a stable approach to global optimums that ignored the initial value selection was developed by reconstructing the swarm intelligent optimization model through homotopy theory the contribution of different source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters to the inversion objective function value varies dramatically and should be calculated using the contaminant distribution in the aquifer hou et al 2016 li et al 2018 chen et al 2018 in the optimization process the values of decision variables should be simultaneously adjusted in each iteration to approach global optimums although unfavorable adjustments of high sensitivity variables can mask any improvements in the favorable adjustment of other variables kaveh and mahdavi 2016 zou et al 2021 liu et al 2021b given that it is difficult to search for the global optimums of low sensitivity variables in limited iterations the sensitivities of different variables can be set as important indicators to adjust the displacement vectors for particle swarm optimization pso in each iteration as the optimization process proceeds the adjustment coefficients of the decision variables decrease gradually in different proportions accordingly the focus is on searching for the optimums of high sensitivity variables in the early stage while searching for the optimums of low sensitivity variables is the focus in the later stage for global sensitivity analyses and homotopy based optimization processes the dnapl contaminant transport numerical model is invoked thousands of times resulting in a huge computational burden therefore applying artificial intelligence methods to learn the input output relationship of a numerical model and conduct repetitive evaluations as an intelligent surrogate model is crucial as it achieves several orders of magnitude higher computational efficiency razavi et al 2012 song et al 2019 luo et al 2020 li et al 2020a chen et al 2022a 2022b the most widely applied surrogate modeling techniques for groundwater contamination modeling can be summarized in three categories progression analysis he et al 2008 zhou et al 2018 xiao et al 2020 machine learning srivastava and singh 2015 xiang et al 2017 hou and lu 2018a li et al 2020b jiang et al 2021 and deep learning methods shen 2018 hong and rioflorido 2019 mo et al 2019 chen et al 2021 however there is significant variance in the applicability and robustness of these methods when dealing with different types of nonlinear fitting problems and they can be trapped in instability and overfitting problems hence it is necessary to conduct a convictive selection of the surrogate modeling technique in the dnapl source inversion framework this is because the performance of a surrogate model has a significant impact on inversion reliability and the special characteristics of contaminants render the input output relationship of the numerical model difficult to approximate to improve the performance of surrogate models different progression analyses machine learning and deep learning methods for surrogate modeling are exhibited and compared herein the comparison study incorporated kriging support vector regression svr kernel extreme learning machine kelm deep convolutional neural network dcnn and ensemble learning surrogate els this allowed the selection of the most suitable surrogate model to depict the complex nonlinear relationship between the dnapl source characteristics contaminant transport parameters and spatial temporal distribution of the contaminants the main contribution of this study is to develop a more reliable and efficient approach for groundwater contamination inverse modeling the novel aspects are summarized as follows 1 different progression

parameters and corresponding outputs contaminant distribution of the numerical model 2 a sensitivity dependent dynamic swarm intelligence optimization sd sio algorithm was designed for the balanced identification of sensitivity varied elements thereby realizing precise inversion of all the unknown variables 3 a homotopy based progressive optimization mechanism was constructed to enable a stable search for the global optimum in wide areas with a much lower probability of becoming trapped by premature convergence compared to heuristic algorithms 2 methodology 2 1 framework of sensitivity

based on the latin hypercube sampling lhs method to reflect the relationship between the numerical model inputs dnapl source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters and corresponding outputs contaminant distribution step 2 build the kriging svr kelm dcnn and els models to approximate the input output relationship of the numerical model and analyze the performance of the different models the optimal surrogate model was embedded in the subsequent sensitivity analysis and inverse iterations to achieve higher computational efficiency step 3 conduct a sobol global sensitivity analysis for different decision variables on the spatial temporal distribution of contaminants step 4 according to the sensitivity analysis results the adjustment coefficients of the displacement vectors for decision variables in the swarm intelligence optimization algorithm are set to vary along with the increase in iterations facilitating development of the sd sio algorithm step 5 based on homotopy theory construct a series of optimization models that are continuously dependent on the homotopy parameter and the solution of optimization model series approached to the real dnapl source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters gradually step 6 apply the sd sio algorithm to search for the optimal solution of the homotopy model series successively and a progressive mechanism is formed in which the previous optimum provides the initial population generating basis for the following optimization the solution of the last model is the final source inversion results 2

intelligence searching algorithms wang and huang 2013 zhao et al 2020 to improve the performance of pso and render it more applicable to the target issue an sd sio algorithm was designed which realizes precise inversion of all the variables with a dramatically varied contribution to the dnapl source inversion objective function the basic operational process of the sd sio algorithm can be summarized as follows 1 initialize the positions and speeds of particles randomly as x i x i 1 x i 2 x i d and v i v i 1 v i 2 v i d in d dimensional search space here d is the total number of variables to be optimized i e the source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters the position is a related eigenvector and the speed is a displacement vector for searching for a better position 2 evaluate the fitness of particles by inputting the positions to the objective function store the positions into pbest p i p i 1 p i 2 p i d and store the optimal position as gbest p g p g 1 p g 2 p g d here pbest and gbest denote the best positions each particle and the group have ever occupied respectively 3 update the speeds and positions of particles 19 v i j t 1 w i v i j t c 1 r 1 p

between 0 and 1 s max is the maximum total sensitivity of the variables to be optimized s j is the sensitivity indicator of the j th variable calculated by sobol global sensitivity analysis hou and lu 2018b t is the number of the present iteration and t max is the maximum number of iterations at the beginning of the optimization iterations the adjustment coefficients s j of the displacement vectors for different decision variables are basically equivalent however with increasing iterations the adjustment coefficients of the high sensitivity variables decrease much faster than those of low sensitivity variables this means that in the later stages of the optimization process the high sensitivity variables are adjusted far less than the low sensitivity variables therefore the improved algorithm mainly searches for the optimums of the high sensitivity variables in the early stages and searches for the optimums of the low sensitivity variables in the later stages 4 re evaluate the fitness of particles then update pbest gbest and t t 1 repeat step 3 until t reaches the maximum number of iterations then make gbest the optimal solution 2 4 homotopy based progressive optimization mechanism for simultaneously identifying the contamination source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters linear homotopy is initially employed to formulate the homotopy functions h s p λ the solution of h s p λ 0 is associated with an assumed source as λ 0 and the solution of h s p λ 0 is associated with the real source as λ 1 lin et al 1996 jia et al 2017 20 h s p λ λ f s p c obs 1 λ f s p c 0 here s represents the source characteristics p represents the contaminant transport parameters f represents the numerical model which can transform the s and p to contaminant concentration prediction c c obs is the observed concentration vector of the contaminants and c 0 represents the concentration vector of the contaminants obtained by the numerical model with assumed initial source characteristics the homotopy functions h continuously depend on the homotopy parameter λ the series of homotopy equations can be obtained by dividing the range interval of λ λ 0 0 λ 1 λ n 1 as follows chen et al 2017 chi et al 2017 21 h s p λ i f s p λ i c obs 1 λ i c 0 0 i 1 2 n based on this homotopy concept the optimization model series corresponding to the homotopy equations for the inversion problem can be obtained as follows 22 min h s p λ i i 1 2 n s t g j s p 0 j 1 2 p h k s p 0 k 1 2 q where g j s p j 1 2 p is the inequality constraint and h k s p k 1 2 q is the equality constraint the sd sio algorithm is applied to solve these optimization models successively through a path tracking process elsisi 2020 yan et al 2022 sun and zhou 2022 thereby forming a progressive optimization mechanism tracking the change of homotopy parameter the progressive optimization mechanism started from the assumed initial contamination source λ 0 0 and the real information of contamination source λ n 1 will be approached stepwise 23 initial population po p i ini sd sio optimum s i 1 opt p i 1 opt min h s p λ i min h s p λ i 1 s t g j s p 0 j 1 2 p h k s p 0 k 1 2 q s t g j s p 0 j 1 2 p h k s

should be acceptably close hou et al 2021 using the optimal solution of one model to generate the initial population of the next model is critical for high quality optimization 3 case study 3 1 test case overview to analyze the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodologies we designed a three dimensional numerical hypothetical case of a heterogeneous phreatic aquifer contaminated by chlorobenzene the contamination of dnapls in the site would probably have been caused by the leakage of a sewage pipe the contaminants would have entered the aquifer continuously and were then subject to a period of natural dissolution and diffusion the variables to be identified were determined as follows 1 longitudinal and transverse coordinates of the leakage point source location 2 contaminant release strength 3 oil phase volume fraction in the sewage i e the volume fraction of the contaminants undissolved in the sewage 4 contaminant leakage duration simulation period 5 aquifer parameters including the porosity and permeability of the gravel and medium fine sand and longitudinal and transverse aqueous dispersivity and 6 hydraulic gradient the testing case is a virtual case that designed according to a real site that located in a piedmont plain area with uncomplicated geologic structure for assessing the accuracy of the source inversion results and verify the significance of the applied methodologies the designed virtual case was basically similar with the real case for the convenience of application migration while the contamination source information and contaminant transport parameters values were given prior to the identification in table 1 the accuracy analysis could be conducted by compare the inversion outputs with the given values the calculated target phreatic layer was 10 m thick medium fine sand and gravel the northeast and southwest boundaries were designated as first type boundaries with a specified head and pressure the southeast and northwest boundaries parallel to the flow direction of the groundwater were composed of flow surfaces and could be designated as zero flux boundaries the underlying bedrock formed a natural water barrier boundary and was also designated as a zero flux boundary while the upward phreatic surface was considered the water exchange boundary fig 3 according to the hydrogeologic conceptual model of the contaminated site the multi phase flow mathematical model of groundwater contamination was established by coupling the following partial differential equation and appropriate initial and boundary conditions 25 ϕ c i ρ i t j 1 2 ρ i c ij d ij v j ϕ s j c ij r i x y z ω t 0 d ij b tj ϕ s j v j δ pq b lj b tj ϕ s j v jp v jq v j x y z ω t 0 where i was the component index j was the phase index

δ ij was the kronecker function b lj b tj were the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity of phase j m v jp v jq was the seepage velocity component in p and q directions of phase j m s 1 the dynamic observations of contaminant concentrations were achieved by sampling from the bottom of the eight wells as dnapls have a strong tendency to sink below the water the simulation domain covered 650 350 10 m3 which was discretized into 10 10 2 m3 grids fig 3 the groundwater dnapl contamination numerical simulation model was solved using the university of texas chemical flooding simulator utchem software 3 2 surrogate models in total 12 variables needed to be identified which were treated as controllable input variables to build the surrogate models the surrogate model outputs were the predicted concentrations of contaminants in the bottom of the eight observation wells at the end of the simulation period the lhs method was used to obtain 200 training input vectors and 20 testing input vectors according to the distribution characteristics of the 12 unknown variables table 1 and the corresponding output vectors were obtained for the numerical model runs the kriging svr kelm dcnn and els models were established with the training sample dataset on a matlab platform while the performances of the different models were analyzed by comparing the model predictions and target outputs corresponding to the testing samples the key parameters of kriging svr and kelm and the ensemble weights for els were optimized using pso this method was presented in detail by hou et al 2015 the optimized parameters of kriging svr and kelm models were shown in table 2 the dcnn consisted of two sets of convolution pooling structures and one full connection layer the convolution layer mapped the inputs of the training sample dataset to the high dimensional space to learn and train the feature information via the sigmoid activation function and the dcnn model was established after the procedures of forward conduction and backpropagation the hyper parameters of dcnn were shown in table 3 four indices were applied to evaluate the performance of surrogate models 1 deterministic

homotopy based searching system a dnapl contamination numerical simulation model was built with the given source characteristics and the contaminant transport parameters for forward prediction the predicted contaminant concentrations in the eight wells at the end of the simulation period were treated as actual observations for inverse modeling subsequently an inversion optimization model was established to minimize deviations between the actual observations and model predictions in addition the variables corresponding to the source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters were set as the decision variables the els model was embedded in the optimization model to replace the numerical model to obtain predictions of contaminant concentration 30 min k 1 8 c k c k 2 s t c f s p

k th well with the initial estimated source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters 3 4 sensitivity dependent dynamic swarm intelligence optimization the sobol global sensitivity analysis method with the embedded els model was adopted to assess the contribution of the 12 variables to the spatial temporal distribution of contaminants the sum of first order primary sensitivity and second order interaction sensitivity corresponding to a specific variable was considered the sensitivity indicator absolute value in eq 19 for calculating the dynamic adjustment coefficient the method present by hou et al 2016 could be referenced to calculate the order primary sensitivity and second order interaction sensitivity the sd sio algorithm was employed to solve the homotopy models in eq 31 successively and the solutions of the model with a homotopy parameter of λ 1 were the inversion outputs the sd sio population size was set to 60 the algorithm was terminated in 80 iterations for each homotopy optimization and the last homotopy optimization was terminated at 150 iterations in addition pso and sd sio were applied to solve the optimization model in eq 30 directly for another set of source inversion values while the parameter options for pso and sd sio were shown in table 4 here the optimization with each algorithm was carried out three times for the stability analysis and these sets of inversion values were compared with the hypothetical true values to verify the searching capability of the different searching algorithms 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance evaluation of surrogate models in total 20 test samples comprising 160 concentration outputs were used to analyze the generalization ability of the surrogate models with one input vector connected to the eight output values contaminant concentrations the els and individual models provided good predictions of the contaminant concentrations achieving close to a 1 1 relationship with the numerical simulations as shown in fig 4 this meant that all five models were capable of learning and reconstructing the input output mapping relationship of the numerical model although the points of the kriging and els models approximated the 1 1 line more accurately fig 5 a displays the boxplots which was generated by the origin software for the surrogate model testing relative errors where the disparity of performance can be clearly distinguished the performance of the kriging model was outstanding among four single surrogate models with the smallest mean median upper edge and upper quartile when testing the relative errors in addition the indicators of approximation accuracy corresponding to the svr and kelm models were clearly superior to the dcnn model this result suggested that the regression analysis and machine learning methods were more powerful than the deep learning method for solving the nonlinear relationship approximation problem of vectors corresponding to the inputs and outputs of the groundwater dnapl contamination numerical simulation the optimal ensemble weights for the kriging svr kelm and dcnn models were 0 8048 0 0000 0 1952 and 0 0000 respectively meaning that only the accuracy of the kriging and kelm models were acceptable figs 5 b and c display the distribution of relative errors for the surrogate model outputs the els model achieved the lowest relative error cumulative curve and most of the errors were concentrated between 0 and 3 the same conclusions were achieved by using the four performance evaluation indicators presented in table 5 the els model was the most reliable intelligence surrogate achieving the highest determination coefficient 0 9988 lowest maximum relative error 4 8312 and lowest mean relative error 0 9314 running the dnapl contamination numerical model on a common pc platform took nearly 600 s while each run of the els model was just 1 2 s accordingly utilizing the els model to replace the numerical model in the inversion iterations is critical for improving the computational efficiency by several orders of magnitude while maintaining high reliability although the performance of the dcnn model was unacceptable in the present study it still achieved a mean relative error 3 3137 and maximum relative error 13 3904 deep learning is more powerful in the field of image recognition and it has large application potential for recognizing the structure and parameter distribution of heterogeneous aquifers therefore further study is required to analyze the performance of machine learning and deep learning methods when identifying contamination sources in complex heterogeneous aquifers 4 2 sensitivity dependent optimization analysis the sobol global sensitivity analysis results indicated the first order primary sensitivity and second order interaction sensitivity corresponding to the different variables table 6 when the variables were changed in the feasible region a larger absolute value of sensitivity indicated a higher contribution to the model outputs and a negative value of sensitivity indicated a negative correlation between the specific variable and the model outputs the transverse coordinate of the contamination source porosity of the gravel permeability of the sand longitudinal aqueous dispersivity transverse aqueous dispersivity and hydraulic gradient were clearly more sensitive than the other variables according to the sensitivity analysis results the sd sio algorithm was constructed then pso sd sio and homotopy based sd sio h sd sio were applied to solve the inversion optimization model in eq 30 fig 6 displays the convergence curves for different variables of 3 pso identification and 3 sd sio identification the traditional heuristic algorithm pso achieved convergence very quickly approximately 40 iterations although the identified optimums were unstable because the initial values should have been randomized the simultaneous inversion model of dnapl source and contamination transport parameters was highly nonlinear and multimodal resulting in the searching process being easily trapped in a local optimum moreover the identification outputs varied distinctively for each optimization especially the insensitive variables such as contaminant release strength oil phase volume fraction in the sewage and porosity of the sand the sd sio conducted more effective searching and achieved convergence in approximately 80 iterations furthermore the identification outputs of sd sio were more stable and concentrated around the true values identification stability and the accuracy of insensitive variables mentioned previously significantly improved which could also improve the identification of other variables the improvement made by sd sio was showed more clearly by plotting the convergence curves of the best rounds of solutions among 3 times pso identification and 3 times sd sio identification pso 1 and sd sio 1 in fig 7 among the 12 variables only the identification values of longitudinal coordinate m oil phase volume fraction in sewage and permeability of sand obtain by pso were slightly better than those of sd sio tables 7 and 8 display comparisons of identification accuracy when using pso and sd sio the identification results for pso exhibited obvious equifinality as the maximum relative errors of 3 identification were 18 5115 35 0095 and 47 3733 while those of sd sio were limited to 17 6878 20 1979 and 21 8395 furthermore the mean relative errors reduced from 7 2184 8 5317 and 9 4430 to 5 7410 5 4773 and 6 4652 respectively compared with the pso the sd sio algorithm was effective in reducing the holistic error level of the inversion outputs while also improving the fitting degree of the objective function by several orders of magnitude pso 2 47 10 6 2 77 10 4 and 1 41 10 6 sd sio 9 85 10 11 4 72 10 11 and 8 07 10 10 4 3 homotopy based optimization analysis the progressive searching capability of the homotopy based sd sio h sd sio algorithm was demonstrated by the inversion convergence curves of the source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters fig 8 tracking the change of the homotopy parameter the identified values in the inversion iterations segmentally approached the true values especially the transverse coordinate of the contamination source the contaminant leakage duration and the longitudinal dispersivity moreover the excessively large area searching problem was transformed into several stages of local searching reducing and dividing the premature convergence risk if there were unexpected stages that deviated far from the global optimum the subsequent stages in the progressive solving mechanism would bring the trend back an accuracy analysis of the inversion outputs obtained with the h sd sio algorithm is depicted in table 9 compared with sd sio the identification accuracy was further improved with the mean relative errors of 3 inversion reducing from 5 7410 5 4773 and 6 4652 to 3 2718 3 6893 and 4 2785 respectively moreover for the h sd sio identification results the maximum relative error was 9 9501 which was significantly lower than the 17 6878 of the sd sio identification results these results demonstrated that the homotopy based progressive searching mechanism was effective in limiting the equifinality effect the searching capability of the swarm intelligence optimization algorithm was fully exploited and the inversion accuracy was sufficiently improved the numerical models were established to calculate the final distribution of contaminants according to the inversion source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters in addition the identified plumes were compared with the true plume of the hypothetical case fig 9 the red dotted and green dotted marked the edge of 0 1 μg l and 30 000 μg l contours respectively which could make it easier to distinguish the difference between different plumes the contours of the identified plumes of sd sio and h sd sio were clearly closer to those of the true plume compared to pso and the shapes of the contamination plumes were very similar the numerical model corrected with the h sd sio inversion values was able to accurately forecast the distribution of contaminants providing a reliable basis for contamination risk assessments and remediation strategy programming 5 conclusion a sensitivity dependent intelligent inversion system of groundwater dnapl source was designed to resolve the equifinality and premature convergence problems resulting from multimodal searches and multi variable simultaneous identification an ensemble learning surrogate model the els model and a homotopy based progressive searching mechanism were proposed and embedded into the inversion system the following conclusions can be drawn from this research 1 the provided regression analysis kriging and machine learning kelm models approximated the multiphase flow simulation model more effectively than the deep learning dcnn model moreover els further improved the approximation accuracy accompanied by a mean relative error of 0 9314 in addition els reduced the computational cost of inversion iterations incurred from the repetitive simulation model calculations saving cpu time by a factor of more than 400 2 the sensitivities of different decision variables were used as important indicators to adjust the displacement vectors of pso in each iteration this was critical for realizing precise identification of all the dnapl source characteristics and contaminant transport parameters with dramatically varying contributions to the inversion objective function compared with the pso algorithm sd sio provided a more accurate estimation of the elements and limited the maximum identification relative error from 35 0095 to 21 8395 3 the homotopy based progressive searching mechanism was a significant improvement over the heuristic optimization approaches moreover the homotopy based sd sio algorithm performed more stably when approaching the global optimum in wider areas the mean relative error between the identification results and corresponding given values was limited to 3 2718

1209,air sparging as is a popular technology for the in situ remediation of groundwater contaminated by volatile organic compounds the scope of the zone within which injected air exists i e zone of influence zoi and the airflow characteristics within zoi are of great interest however few studies have shed light on the scope of the zone within which air flows namely the zone of flow zof and its relation with the scope of zoi this study focuses on the zof characteristics and its relation with zoi based on quantitative observations of zof and zoi using a quasi 2d transparent flow chamber the relative transmission intensity obtained by the light transmission method presents a rapid and continuous increasing near the zoi boundary providing a criterion for the quantitative determination of zoi an integral airflow flux approach is proposed to determine the scope of zof based on the airflow flux distributions through aquifers the zof radius decreases with the growth of particle sizes of aquifers while it increases first and then keeps constant with the increase of sparging pressure the zof radius is around 0 55 0 82 times of the zoi radius which depends on air flow patterns related to particle diameters d p that is 0 55 0 62 for channel flow d p 1 2 mm while 0 75 0 82 for bubble flow d p 2 3 mm the experimental results show that the sparged air is entrapped with little flowing inside zoi regions that are outside the zof which should be considered carefully in the design of as graphical abstract relationship between zone of fluence zoi and zone of flow zof unlabelled image keywords groundwater remediation air sparging zone of flow zone of influence airflow flux distribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater contamination is widespread in many areas around the globe for example 84 of the us superfund sites have the problem of groundwater contamination usepa 2020 volatile organic compounds vocs including benzene xylene chlorinated solvents are very common pollutants in groundwater around 86 of groundwater are contaminated by vocs at superfund sites usepa 2020 high concentrations of vocs in groundwater lead to an increase in the cancer risk posing a significant threat to human health bexfield et al 2022 therefore remediation of groundwater particularly contaminated by volatile organic compounds vocs is of great interest in the management of site contamination recently in situ remediation technologies have become popular for the remediation of vocs in groundwater such as in situ chemical oxidation liu et al 2014 in situ nanoremediation chen et al 2019 coo et al 2016 bioaugmentation poi et al 2018 permeable reactive barrier medawela et al 2022 indraratna et al 2020 and air sparging johnson 1998 as an aeration based technology air sparging as appears simple to implement modest in capital costs and environmentally friendly it has been listed as one of the main in situ remediation technologies in the superfund remedy report usepa 2020 during as remediation pressurized air is injected into the contaminated aquifer see fig 1 subsequently sparged air is distributed in the aquifer generating a desaturated zone i e zone of influence zoi that facilitates the removal of vocs mainly by volatilization johnson 1998 baker and benson 2007a chao et al 2018 yao et al 2022 mccray and falta mccray and falta 1997 proposed that the shape of zoi was approximately parabolic while several studies reddy and adams 2001 song et al 2015 farid et al 2019 described the zoi shape as a conical frustum the cone shaped zoi is widely accepted since it largely simplifies the boundary of zoi to a linear form with an acceptable accuracy reddy and adams 2001 song et al 2015 farid et al 2019 the cone shaped zone with sparged air i e the zone of influence zoi and the airflow characteristics within it have gained special interests in previous research the scope of zoi is often represented by the zoi angle defined as the angle between the linear boundary of cone shaped zoi and the vertical direction song et al 2015 the zoi angle decreases with the increase in particle diameters within aquifers while it increases first and then keeps constant with the increase in sparging pressure song et al 2015 wang et al 2021 baker and benson 2007b besides farid et al farid et al 2019 proposed that the initiation sparging pressure has an important effect on zoi radius and angle no change of zoi radius and angle was observed with any further increase in the air pressure after the initial formation of the zoi different air flow patterns which depend on the particle diameters of aquifers have been observed within the zoi song et al 2015 ben noah et al 2022 peterson et al 2001 ji et al 1993 as the effective particle diameter d 10 increases from 0 22 to 0 42 mm the flow patterns change from chamber flow to channel flow while the channel flow is transformed to bubble flow when d 10 ranges from 1 42 to 2 1 mm song et al 2015 in addition an increase in airflow flux will lead to a transition from bubble flow to channel flow pattern ben noah et al 2022 geistlinger et al 2006 recently several researchers have investigated the airflow flux characteristics during air sparging song et al song et al 2015 obtained the distribution of airflow flux using air dividers above the surface of aquifer the airflow flux distribution was found to be extremely nonuniform along the horizontal direction within the zoi it approximately follows a gaussian based form kim et al kim et al 2012 kim et al 2015 proposed to use gaseous passive fluxmeter to measure the airflow flux distribution at the aquifer surface similar gaussian distribution of airflow flux was observed in homogenous aquifers yao et al yao et al 2017 investigated the airflow flux distribution along horizontal lines at different heights above the sparger a trapezoidal distribution was observed at the height of 20 cm while the gaussian based distribution was obtained when the height was larger than 30 cm previous research mainly focused on the distribution form of the airflow flux while the scope of the zone within which sparged air flows i e the zone of flow zof was seldom discussed actually the zof characteristics and its relationship with zoi are critical for a further understanding of air sparging in aquifers a detailed discussion on the influence of particle diameter and sparging pressure on the zof is still needed meanwhile the relationship between the zof and zoi is not yet clear and needed to be thoroughly investigated to clarify the relationship of zoi with zof a quantitative determination of zoi is needed in previous experiments song et al 2015 wang et al 2021 the zoi was mainly obtained using a two dimensional transparent flow chamber packed with transparent fused silica sands it was identified as the shadow zone caused by the presence of sparged air within aquifers the zoi boundary was usually determined by observing the shadow zone with naked eyes and then used to calculate the zoi angle hu et al 2010 peterson and murray 2003 the naked eyes based observation of zoi boundary is simple while it may lead to arbitrariness in finding the zoi boundary in fact zoi is the shadow zone with certain air saturation previous researchers have developed a light transmission method ltm to quantitatively relate the air saturation to the light transmittance within transparent porous media hoa 1981 tidwell and glass 1994 niemet and selker 2011 the ltm enables the calculation of spatial variation of air saturation within transparent sand packings van de ven and mumford 2020 this may be further used to determine the zoi boundary while a detailed investigation on the relation between zoi boundary and air saturation variation is still needed for a quantitative determination of zoi boundary in summary there is still a lack of methodologies for quantitative determinations of the scope of zof and zoi during air sparging meanwhile the relationship between zof and zoi during air sparging is underdetermined in this paper an ltm based approach was developed to quantitatively determine the boundary and angle of zoi meanwhile the scope of zof was identified according to the distribution of airflow flux through aquifers observed using an improved two dimensional transparent flow chamber with airflow dividers inside song et al 2015 in particular the quantitative determination of zof boundary was thoroughly discussed finally the relationship between zof and zoi was elaborated in aquifers with different particle sizes and at various sparging pressures 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials transparent fused silica sands gravels were used to facilitate the visualization of airflow in laboratory tests song et al 2015 they were packed in a custom made flow chamber and then saturated with deaerated water to mimic aquifers the method for the packing of sands gravels will be elaborated in section 2 3 four typical aquifers were tested as shown in table 1 the particle sizes of aquifers were selected to cover two typical flow patterns i e the channel and bubble flow patterns song et al 2015 geistlinger et al 2006 peterson et al 1999 2 2 experimental setup a schematic of the testing system is shown in fig 2 a pressurized air was generated by an air compressor 0 700 kpa the air pressure was then regulated using a pressure regulator within the range 0 100 kpa ir2000 02 smc japan the regulated pressure was measured with a pressure gauge 0 100 kpa mik y290 asmilk group china subsequently the pressurized air was injected into the flow chamber packed with transparent sands gravels the transparent flow chamber was specially designed to facilitate the airflow visualization and the measurement of the airflow flux distribution through the aquifer as shown in fig 2 the flow chamber consisted of a lower box for the packing of transparent sands gravels i e the sample box and an upper box for the measurement of the airflow flux distribution namely the measurement box the measurement box was designed to be separated from the sample box to facilitate the sample preparation meanwhile the connection of the sample and measurement boxes was realized through bolts and rubber pads to avoid a possible leakage of water details of the sample and measurement boxes are described as follows the sample box was made of perspex for the visualization of airflow it had internal dimensions of 150 cm length 60 cm height 5 cm thickness the minimum size ratio of the sample box to the mean particle size is 15 6 the wall effect is considered to be negligible since the size ratio is larger than 10 song et al 2015 hu et al 2015 as shown in fig 2 b a cuboid sparger made of acrylic plates was installed at the central bottom of the box for the injection of the pressurized air into the aquifer the dimensions of the sparger were 5 5 5 cm3 a circular hole that had a diameter of 1 cm was opened at the bottom of the sparger for the entrance of the pressurized air into the sparger the air within the sparger was sparged into the aquifer through a narrow slit 0 3 cm 4 cm on the top of the sparger see fig 2 b meanwhile the slit was covered with a wire mesh 325 mesh to prevent the entrance of aquifer particles into the sparger besides to avoid a possible generation of jet flow into the aquifer from the bottom hole an acrylic plate with a width of 3 cm was glued to internal walls of the sparger at a position of 2 cm above the bottom see fig 2 b for the sake of the sample saturation two water tanks 25 cm length 60 cm height 5 cm thickness with multiple ports were set within the sample box an led backlight panel served as light source was placed at the back side of the sample box to facilitate the visualization of the aquifer it has a dimension of 106 cm width 56 cm height which is a bit larger than the lateral surface of the aquifer the measurement box was made of acrylic plates its internal length and thickness were the same as those of the sample box respectively while its internal height was 20 cm see fig 2 a similar to that in song et al song et al 2015 acrylic plates with a thickness of 3 mm termed air dividers were glued to the lateral and top faces of the measurement box see fig 2 b it divided the interior of the box into independent cells the air dividers and independent cells were designed for the measurement of the airflow flux distributions through the surface of the aquifer a total of 28 air dividers were arranged with a separation distance of 5 cm as a result 29 independent cells were generated within the measurement box note that the bottom edges of the air dividers were around 3 cm below the water table so that the cells were able to collect the air emitted from the surface of the aquifer for the measurement of the airflow flux through each cell triple valves were installed on the top of the independent cells as shown in fig 2 b the left outlet of each triple valve was connected to a long pipe that had a discharge outlet for the air while the right outlet was connected to a gas flowmeter 0 1 50 l min mf4008 siargo ltd usa the airflow flux through each cell gives a description on the airflow flux distribution through the surface of aquifer it can be easily measured through reasonable operations of triple valves which will be elaborated in section 2 3 2 3 experimental process a wet procedure broadly used in previous as tests song et al 2015 ji et al 1993 van de ven and mumford 2020 for the sample preparation was adopted to ensure the saturation of the porous media in this approach the transparent sands gravels were saturated before packing and then deposited into the sample box in 9 layers uniformly for each layer the height was controlled to be 5 cm meanwhile the water level was always maintained to be 2 3 cm above the top of the layer to ensure saturation the final height of the aquifer was 45 cm above the sparger as shown in fig 2 b to prevent a possible fluidization of the aquifer i e the upward movement of aquifer grains induced by the upward air flow the top of the aquifer was covered by a filter layer that consisted of glass beads with certain sizes determining the correct size of glass beads is vital because the diameters of glass beads should be large enough to ensure sufficient resistance to fluidization itself and to guarantee easy transportation of air bubbles through the pores of the filter note that a larger glass bead is more stable and therefore is less prone to be fluidized under the action of the upward flow on the other hand the diameters of glass beads should be small enough to prevent aquifer particles from migrating upward through the pores of the filter in the present experiments the filters usually consist of two or more sublayers to meet the above requirements the diameters of glass beads increased gradually from the bottom to top for the sublayer adjacent to the aquifer i e the bottom most sublayer the glass bead diameter was 1 5 2 0 times the aquifer particle size the particle diameter of uppermost sublayer was 7 8 mm which was large enough to prevent the fluidization of the filter meanwhile the particle size ratios between adjacent sublayers were 1 5 2 0 to prevent the intrusion of the lower sublayer particles into the upper sublayer details of the filters used in this study are presented in table 2 note that a filter with only one sublayer was used in test 4 since the particle size of the aquifer was relatively large i e 3 5 mm it was sufficient to use a one sublayer filter consisting of 7 8 mm glass beads to meet all the requirements stated above after packing the filter layers the measurement box was then installed through bolt connections the final water table was around 3 cm above the filter which was the height of the overflow port see fig 2 b it should be noted that the filter above the aquifer may lead to a deviation between the airflow flux distribution through the aquifer surface and that observed using the measurement box it is assumed that the deviation is negligible since the permeability of the filter is much larger 5 10 times or more than that of the aquifer in present experiments it is relatively easy for air bubbles to pass through the interface from the aquifer to filters that have much higher permeability yao et al 2020 preliminary tests confirmed that air bubbles passed through the after filter interface with little horizontal expansion see fig 3 indicating little influence by the filter on airflow flux distributions the experiments began with a gradual increase of the sparging pressure until air appeared in the aquifer when the applied pressure was greater than the summation of the hydrostatic and capillary pressure the air would enter into the aquifer hu et al 2010 the pressure at which the air entered into the aquifer was recorded as the minimum sparging pressure see table 1 note that the initiation pressure has an impact on the zoi as pointed out by farid et al farid et al 2019 in the current study the effect of initiation pressure was not considered therefore the initiation pressures were controlled to be minimum sparging pressures at which the air breaks through the aquifer in all the tests then the sparging pressure was increased gradually to specified values in a step wise manner as shown in fig 4 at each pressure a sufficient settling time was allowed to ensure that no further changes were observed in zoi and airflow flux generally the settling time is around 10 min the sparging pressure and the total airflow flux were then recorded the images of the aquifer were captured by a camera in front of the flow chamber these images were used to determine the zoi boundary and zoi angle with the aid of the light transmission method ltm details of the ltm are elaborated in section 2 4 the airflow flux in each independent cell of the measurement box was recorded by the air flowmeter that connected to the right outlets of triple valves see fig 2 b this was realized through an appropriate operation of the triple valves the left outlets of all triple valves were open while the right outlets were closed at the beginning at this stage the airflow in all cells passed through the left outlets and then was directly discharged when the airflow flux in a certain cell was needed to be measured the right outlet of the triple valve of this cell was opened and the left outlet was closed at this stage the airflow within the present cell passed through the right outlet and was then measured by the air flowmeter while the airflow within other cells was discharged directly through the left outlets thus the value recorded by the air flowmeter was the airflow flux through the present cell note that a small increase in air pressure 0 5 kpa was observed within the present cell due to a pressure drop at the air flowmeter correspondingly a decline in water table by a water head equivalent to the increased air pressure occurred within the present cell as illustrated in fig 5 as a result the total pressure at the bottom of the present cell remained constant which avoided a possible influence of the pressure drop at the air flowmeter on the air sparging after completing the measurement of the airflow flux within the present cell the triple valve outlets of the present cell were re switched to the original state i e the left outlet was open while the right outlet was closed similarly the airflow flux within other cells can be obtained by repeating the above procedure 2 4 light transmission method and definition of relative transmission intensity light transmission method ltm provides a tool to obtain the gas saturation within transparent porous media based on image processing techniques tidwell and glass 1994 niemet and selker 2011 van de ven and mumford 2020 once the spatial variations of gas saturation within porous media are observed by ltm the boundary points of zoi can be determined as the position at which the gas saturation has a sudden and continuous increase from near zero subsequently the angle of zoi can be determined quantitatively based on the linear fitting of the obtained zoi boundary points this is the basic idea for quantitative determination of the scope of zoi using ltm in the present study in the ltm a transmission intensity is defined as the light intensity transmitted through the quasi 2 d transparent porous media as shown in fig 6 it is related to gas saturation through the following mathematical model niemet and selker 2011 van de ven et al 2020 1 s g 1 s r β r ln i ln i s ln i r ln i s in which s g represents the gas saturation during air sparging s r is the residual water saturation i e the water saturation of the unsaturated porous media within which the pore water has been discharged under gravity note that the water is discharged after completing the as tests i represents the transmission intensity during air sparging i s and i r respectively denote the saturation transmission intensity that is the transmission intensity measured in the saturated porous media before air sparging and the residual transmission intensity obtained in the porous medium with residual water saturation β r is an empirical fitting coefficient van de ven et al 2020 mumford et al 2015 note that the values of both s r and β r are constants in the entire sample rather than a local value inside a homogeneous porous media mumford et al 2015 therefore the spatial variation of the gas saturation s g is consistent with that of the following defined variable i rel 2 i rel ln i ln i s ln i r ln i s in which i rel is named as the relative transmission intensity for simplicity the spatial variation of i rel instead of s g is calculated eq 2 and then adopted to determine the boundary and angle of zoi 3 results and discussion 3 1 ltm based determination of zoi boundary and angle the boundary and angle of zoi are usually used to define the scope of zoi in this section they were obtained quantitatively by an ltm based approach and then compared with previous results 3 1 1 determination of zoi boundary and angle the transmission intensity i i s and i r are the three key parameters that used to calculate the variation of i rel eq 2 they were obtained through processing the images of aquifers using imagej 1 53 as shown in fig 7 a the picture is the raw image captured during air sparging at a pressure of 12 kpa in test 1 the raw image was converted to a grey image using imagej as presented in fig 7 b then the distributions of the transmission intensity i along horizontal lines were extracted with the aid of imagej for this purpose interlinked blocks with a size of 34 34 pixels 2 2 cm2 were selected along horizontal lines see fig 7 b the averaged transmission intensity within each block was calculated and further used to derive the distribution of i along the horizontal line the distributions of i s and i r along the horizontal line were obtained in a similar way subsequently the variation of i rel along the horizontal line was calculated according to eq 2 fig 7 c presents variations of i rel along horizontal lines at h 1 15 cm and h 2 35 mm note that although the values of gas saturation s g eq 1 should not be larger than 1 the relative transmission intensity i rel eq 2 may exceed 1 since the transmission intensity i during air sparging may be larger or smaller than the residual transmission intensity i r the values of i rel fluctuate near zero within regions adjacent to the left and right boundaries of the aquifer it indicates that the sparged air is unlikely to reach these regions slight deviations from zero should be attributed to inevitable noises of the light source therefore the regions with near zero i rel are considered to be outside the zoi meanwhile we have noted that relatively large values of i rel appeared within the interval 39 cm 43 cm at h 2 35 cm see fig 7 c further examinations of the raw image showed that accumulations of leaked air along a randomly generated flow channel i e leakage channel from the zoi occurred within the interval 39 cm 43 cm as approaching the central position the values of i rel present a sudden and continuous increase and then fluctuate within a relatively wide interval in proximity to the central position note that fluctuations should be due to random entrapments of air bubbles in certain regions the points x 1l 32 cm and x 1r 28 cm fig 7 c at which i rel increases continually and rapidly are considered respectively as the left and right boundary points of the zoi at the specified height of 15 cm similarly the left and right boundary points of zoi at h 35 cm are determined respectively as x 2l 38 cm and x 2r 44 cm fig 7 c repeating the above procedure the boundary points of zoi at 6 heights were obtained and plotted in fig 8 the left right zoi boundaries were derived by fitting the left right boundary points with a linear form song et al 2015 the left right zoi angles were then calculated as the angles between the left right zoi boundaries and the vertical direction the averaged value of the left and right zoi angles was used as the zoi angle it can be seen that the derived zoi boundary using ltm approximately separates the zones with and without sparged air observed by naked eyes moreover the ltm based method provides a unified manner for determining zoi boundary and zoi angle with little arbitrariness 3 1 2 validation the zoi angles in tests 1 4 were derived using the ltm based approach and then compared with those obtained in previous studies for validation the results are presented in fig 9 the zoi angle decreases with the increment of effective particle diameter d 10 and then becomes constant as d 10 exceeds 2 3 mm the zoi angles obtained in previous studies reddy and adams 2001 song et al 2015 peterson and murray 2003 were plotted as well in fig 9 for comparison in the selected researches the particle diameters range within the interval 0 4 6 0 mm which is consistent with that adopted in the present study the zoi boundary and zoi angle were obtained primarily by naked eyes the naked eyes based observation of zoi angles presents certain arbitrariness while their variations with particle diameter are similar i e decreasing zoi angle with increasing particle diameter the variation of zoi angle in this study is similar to those in previous studies in particular the zoi angles obtained in this study are close to those in song et al song et al 2015 meanwhile the results presented in this study deviates from those obtained by peterson and murry peterson and murray 2003 this should be due to the layered aquifer coarsening upward sequence used in peterson and murry peterson and murray 2003 refraction occurred at interfaces between layers with different permeabilities attributed to different particle sizes li 2016 which may increase the arbitrariness of the observation of zoi angles nevertheless the ltm based approach is confirmed to be reliable in the determination of zoi boundary and zoi angle 3 2 determination of zof based on airflow flux distribution the distribution of airflow flux through the top surface of the aquifer is described by airflow flux in independent cells of the measurement box see fig 2 b in each independent cell the airflow flux q c in cm3 cm2 s is defined as the gas volume through unit cross section of the cell in unit time 3 q c v c t s c in which v c in cm3 is the air volume through the cell in a period of t in second s c in cm2 denotes the cross section area of the cell in the present study the airflow flux q c through each cell was obtained using the experimental procedure in section 2 3 the distribution of q c represents the airflow flux distribution fig 10 presents the airflow flux distributions obtained in tests 1 4 non uniform distributions of airflow flux were observed along the horizontal direction the maximum airflow fluxes occur at positions approximately right above the sparger in all the tests as the increasing of the lateral distance to the sparger the airflow fluxes decrease gradually to zero this is consistent with the observations in song et al song et al 2015 meanwhile we have noted that there exist some fluctuations at certain positions especially near the central position when the particle size of aquifer is relatively small d 10 1 1 mm this should be due to the channel flow pattern always encountered in aquifers that have relatively small particle sizes geistlinger et al 2006 peterson et al 1999 the flow channels are randomly distributed within the aquifer there may exist some cells of measurement box within which relatively larger or smaller number of flow channels are concentrated resulting in a sudden increase or decrease in airflow flux as presented in fig 10 a and b once the airflow flux distributions are obtained a realistic way to find zof is to determine the boundary points at which the airflow flux decreases to zero however because the independent cells have a finite width i e 5 cm it is impossible to determine the boundary points exactly a possible compromise is to find the boundary cells within which the airflow fluxes decrease to zero the centers of the boundary cells are assumed as the boundary points whereas the determination of the boundary cells is still ambiguous in the experiments this is because the airflow fluxes decrease to pretty small values within certain cells that are far away from the central position in these cells although a few air bubbles are emitted intermittently the airflow fluxes are too small to be captured accurately whether these cells or their adjacent cells should be considered as the boundary cells remains ambiguous and subjective to address this problem an approach based on the gaussian based fitting curve was developed for the determination of the zof boundary points song et al song et al 2015 and yao et al yao et al 2017 proposed that the airflow flux distributions follow a gaussian based form along horizontal lines that are more than 30 cm above the sparger in this study the height of aquifers above the sparger is 45 cm which is much larger than 30 cm the airflow flux distributions in fig 10 were fitted using the following gaussian based function 4 q x c a exp x x c 2 2 ω 2 in which x is the horizontal coordinate x c and ω represent the mean and variance of the gaussian based function c denotes the horizontal asymptote of the gaussian based function while a c is the peak of the gaussian based function note that the area s g bounded by the gaussian based fitting curve and the horizontal axis represents the total airflow flux in cm3 s through the aquifer it can be calculated through the integral of the fitted gaussian based function eq 4 over a certain interval that depends on the position of the horizontal asymptote c schematics for the calculation of s g are shown in fig 11 in fact s g is meaningful just when c has a negative or zero value when c is greater than zero s g is unphysical since it has an infinite value therefore if the fitted parameter c is positive the curve will be re fitted on the premise that c is forced to be zero details of the fitting parameters are listed in table 3 the coefficients of determination are higher than or approaching 0 9 in most of the tests meanwhile we have noted that the coefficients of determination are relatively low around 0 9 in certain tests with particle sizes smaller than 1 2 mm this could be due to the fluctuations in airflow flux that attributed to the channel flow pattern as discussed above nevertheless it is confirmed that the gaussian based function is capable of describing the airflow flux distributions in the present study based on the gaussian based fitting curve an integral airflow flux approach was proposed for the determination of boundary points of zof as follows a fit the airflow flux with the gaussian based function eq 4 as discussed above if the fitted parameter c is positive it will be re fitted on the premise that c is forced to be zero the fitted parameters in tests 1 4 are presented in table 3 b calculate the area s g bounded by the gaussian based fitting curve and the horizontal axis s g is calculated through the integral of the fitted gaussian based function q x eq 4 if the fitted parameter c is equal to zero the integral is performed over the interval see fig 11 b it has a theoretical solution i e 2 π aω when c is smaller than zero the gaussian based fitting curve has two intersection points with the horizontal axis i e x sl and x sr in fig 11 c the integral is performed over the interval x sl x sr although this integral has no theoretical solutions it is very easy to numerically calculate the integral in excel the calculated s g in tests 1 4 are summarized in table 4 as stated above s g represents the total airflow flux in cm3 s through the surface of the aquifer for comparison the total airflow flux s exp in cm3 s measured directly in the experiments is also presented in table 4 it can be seen that s g is very close to s exp the deviations in most of the tests are no more than 1 confirming the reliability of the calculation of s g based on the gaussian based fitting curve c find the interval x c l b x c l b over which the integral of the fitted gaussian based function q x is 99 of s g see fig 12 in which l b is the distance of the left right boundary point to the central axis of the gaussian based fitting curve subsequently the left and right boundary points of the airflow flux distribution are determined as x c l b and x c l b respectively although the gaussian based function presents a good fitting for the airflow flux distributions it leads to an over diffusion of the airflow for example the airflow is diffused to infinity when c is equal to zero see fig 11 b therefore we select an interval x c l b x c l b within which the integral airflow flux is 99 of s g fig 12 indicating that almost all the airflow flux is included in this interval note that the percentage 99 is determined by tri and error which will be validated in the following table 5 presents the boundary points x c l b and x c l b calculated using the proposed method a validation of the calculated boundary points is shown in fig 13 the boundary points locate around positions that separate cells with and without airflows which confirms that the selection of 99 is reasonable for the determination of boundary points indeed it is impossible to accurately determine the boundary points since the precision of the airflow flux measurement box is the width of the independent cell i e 5 cm in the present study meanwhile a further decrease in the cell width is unfeasible since it may significantly increase the randomness in the airflow flux measurement the proposed integral airflow flux approach provides a unified determination of the boundary points with acceptable accuracy this approach essentially determines the most likely location of the boundary points by considering the airflow fluxes in all the cells recalling that the airflow fluxes in all the cells are considered during gaussian fitting it eliminates the arbitrariness in determining the boundary points of the airflow flux distribution once the boundary points of the airflow flux distribution are determined the scope of zof can be characterized by the range of the boundary points x c l b x c l b 3 3 zof characteristics and its relationship with zoi for a quantitative description of zof a radius r f of zof is defined as half of the distance between the left and right boundary points i e r f l b see fig 12 correspondingly the zoi radius r i is introduced for comparison r i was calculated with the aid of the zoi boundaries obtained in section 3 1 that is the left and right zoi boundaries are extended and intersected with the top surface of the aquifer at points x il and x ir as shown in fig 13 r i is calculated as half of the distance l i between x il and x ir i e r i x ir x il 2 note that the zof radius r f is defined at the surface of the aquifer the airflow flux distribution and the r f within the interior of the aquifer were not able to be obtained in the present study nevertheless the variations of r f with particle diameter and sparging pressure will provide a certain understanding of the airflow characteristics and its relationship with zoi the values of r f and r i are presented in table 5 r f is always smaller than r i it indicates that the flowing of the sparged air mainly occurs within the zof that is not consistent with the zoi and always smaller than zoi for a quantitative comparison of zof to zoi a coefficient α f is defined as the ratio of zof radius r f to zoi radius r i 5 α f r f r i previous studies have shown that the sparging pressure has an important effect on the zoi radius song et al 2015 hu et al 2010 the influence of sparging pressure on the zoi radius r i the zof radius r f and the zof coefficient α f was investigated in this study as shown in fig 14 the zoi radius r i increases and then tends to be constant with the increase in sparging pressure this is consistent with the previous observations song et al 2015 hu et al 2010 on the other hand farid et al farid et al 2019 found that no r i change was observed with any further increase in the air pressure after the initial formation of the zoi this should be due to the relatively large initiation sparging pressure larger than 14 kpa adopted by farid et al farid et al 2019 similarly the zof radius r f increases first and then remains constant with the increment of sparging pressure meanwhile the zof radius r f is always smaller than the zoi radius r i the zof coefficient α f eq 5 is smaller than unity the variations of α f with sparging pressure depend on the air flow patterns that are related to particle sizes of aquifers when the particle sizes are larger than 2 3 mm i e in test 3 and test 4 bubble flow patterns are observed in the tests see fig 15 a α f presents a decreasing trend with the increase of the sparging pressure as the sparging pressure exceeds 12 kpa the values of α f tend to be constants that are around 0 55 0 62 however when the particle sizes are smaller than 1 2 mm i e in test 1 and test 2 channel flow patterns see fig 15 b are observed in the tests the values of α f increase first and then present certain fluctuations around values of 0 75 0 82 the fluctuations could be attributed to random generations of flow channels with the increment of sparging pressure the results show that the zof is not consistent with the zoi and always smaller than zoi stable values of r i r f and α f are obtained at sufficiently large pressures as shown in fig 14 their variations with the effective particle diameter d 10 are illustrated in fig 16 the stable r i and r f both decrease gradually with the increase of effective particle diameter d 10 the stable zof coefficient α f ranges from 0 75to 0 82 when d 10 is smaller than 2 1 mm while it decreases to 0 55 0 62 when d 10 is larger than 2 1 mm this should be attributed to the transition of a channel flow pattern for d 10 1 1 mm to a bubble flow pattern for d 10 2 1 mm as the increase of particle size when d 10 is larger than 2 1 mm individual air bubbles move through the voids of aquifer with a bubble flow pattern in the regions adjacent to the zoi boundaries the sparged air always exists in closed bubbles it is difficult for invidual bubbles to transfer sparging pressure consequently the pressure gradients within regions adjacent to the zoi boundaries are relatively small therefore it is difficult to generate continuous airflows in these regions as a result the zof radius is much smaller than the zoi radius indicating a relatively small zof coefficient α f 0 55 0 62 whereas for d 10 smaller than 1 1 mm flow channels are generated near the zoi boundaries continuous airflows are likely to be generated in certain flow channels near the zoi boundaries therefore the zof radius is relatively close to the zoi radius indicating a relatively large value of α f 0 75 0 82 4 conclusions the air distributions and flow characteristics during air sparging were investigated for different aquifers with different particle sizes the quantitative determination of the boundary and angle of zone of influence zoi within which sparged air exists was discussed based on the light transmission method ltm meanwhile the zone of flow zof was identified using the airflow flux distribution through the aquifer particularly focusing on the quantitative determination of zof boundary a zof radius was defined and compared with the zoi radius at various sparging pressures and in aquifers with different particle sizes the key contributions of this study are listed as follows 1 an ltm based approach was developed for the quantitative determination of zoi boundary and zoi angle a relative transmission intensity that was linearly related with the gas saturation was defined based on the saturated and residual transmission intensity directly measured using ltm the relative transmission intensity presents a rapid and continuous increasing near the zoi boundary providing a criterion for the quantitative determination of zoi boundary and zoi angle 2 an integral airflow flux approach for determining the scope of zof was proposed based on the fitted gaussian based function of the airflow flux distribution the scope of zof can be determined as the interval over which the integral of the fitted gaussian based function is 99 of the total air flow flux through the aquifer 3 the zof is not consistent with zoi and always smaller than zoi the zof radius r f increases first and then keeps constant with the increment of sparging pressure while it decreases with the growth of particle sizes of aquifers the zof radius is around 0 55 0 82 times of the zoi radius which depends on the air flow patterns that are related to the particle diameter d p of aquifer as the transition of channel flow d p 1 2 mm to bubble flow patterns d p 2 3 mm the ratio of zof to zoi radius decrease from 0 75 to 0 82 to 0 55 0 62 it indicates that sparged air is entrapped with little flowing inside zoi regions that are outside the zof which should be considered carefully in the design of as since the airflow induced volatilization is weakened largely by the entrapment of sparged air the as efficiency may be reduced in these regions this should be considered carefully in the design of as the present research mainly focused on the zof characteristics and its relationship with the zoi while the as efficiency within and outside the zof will be considered in the future studies homogeneous aquifers were tested in the present experiments while the aquifers sometimes present obvious heterogeneity in nature e g aquifers with low permeability or high permeability lenses a study on the influence of heterogeneity on the zof characteristics is still needed it will be considered in the future credit authorship contribution statement kuang cheng conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft project administration funding

1209,air sparging as is a popular technology for the in situ remediation of groundwater contaminated by volatile organic compounds the scope of the zone within which injected air exists i e zone of influence zoi and the airflow characteristics within zoi are of great interest however few studies have shed light on the scope of the zone within which air flows namely the zone of flow zof and its relation with the scope of zoi this study focuses on the zof characteristics and its relation with zoi based on quantitative observations of zof and zoi using a quasi 2d transparent flow chamber the relative transmission intensity obtained by the light transmission method presents a rapid and continuous increasing near the zoi boundary providing a criterion for the quantitative determination of zoi an integral airflow flux approach is proposed to determine the scope of zof based on the airflow flux distributions through aquifers the zof radius decreases with the growth of particle sizes of aquifers while it increases first and then keeps constant with the increase of sparging pressure the zof radius is around 0 55 0 82 times of the zoi radius which depends on air flow patterns related to particle diameters d p that is 0 55 0 62 for channel flow d p 1 2 mm while 0 75 0 82 for bubble flow d p 2 3 mm the experimental results show that the sparged air is entrapped with little flowing inside zoi regions that are outside the zof which should be considered carefully in the design of as graphical abstract relationship between zone of fluence zoi and zone of flow zof unlabelled image keywords groundwater remediation air sparging zone of flow zone of influence airflow flux distribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater contamination is widespread in many areas around the globe for example 84 of the us superfund sites have the problem of groundwater contamination usepa 2020 volatile organic compounds vocs including benzene xylene chlorinated solvents are very common pollutants in groundwater around 86 of groundwater are contaminated by vocs at superfund sites usepa 2020 high concentrations of vocs in groundwater lead to an increase in the cancer risk posing a significant threat to human health bexfield et al 2022 therefore remediation of groundwater particularly contaminated by volatile organic compounds vocs is of great interest in the management of site contamination recently in situ remediation technologies have become popular for the remediation of vocs in groundwater such as in situ chemical oxidation liu et al 2014 in situ nanoremediation chen et al 2019 coo et al 2016 bioaugmentation poi et al 2018 permeable reactive barrier medawela et al 2022 indraratna et al 2020 and air sparging johnson 1998 as an aeration based technology air sparging as appears simple to implement modest in capital costs and environmentally friendly it has been listed as one of the main in situ remediation technologies in the superfund remedy report usepa 2020 during as remediation pressurized air is injected into the contaminated aquifer see fig 1 subsequently sparged air is distributed in the aquifer generating a desaturated zone i e zone of influence zoi that facilitates the removal of vocs mainly by volatilization johnson 1998 baker and benson 2007a chao et al 2018 yao et al 2022 mccray and falta mccray and falta 1997 proposed that the shape of zoi was approximately parabolic while several studies reddy and adams 2001 song et al 2015 farid et al 2019 described the zoi shape as a conical frustum the cone shaped zoi is widely accepted since it largely simplifies the boundary of zoi to a linear form with an acceptable accuracy reddy and adams 2001 song et al 2015 farid et al 2019 the cone shaped zone with sparged air i e the zone of influence zoi and the airflow characteristics within it have gained special interests in previous research the scope of zoi is often represented by the zoi angle defined as the angle between the linear boundary of cone shaped zoi and the vertical direction song et al 2015 the zoi angle decreases with the increase in particle diameters within aquifers while it increases first and then keeps constant with the increase in sparging pressure song et al 2015 wang et al 2021 baker and benson 2007b besides farid et al farid et al 2019 proposed that the initiation sparging pressure has an important effect on zoi radius and angle no change of zoi radius and angle was observed with any further increase in the air pressure after the initial formation of the zoi different air flow patterns which depend on the particle diameters of aquifers have been observed within the zoi song et al 2015 ben noah et al 2022 peterson et al 2001 ji et al 1993 as the effective particle diameter d 10 increases from 0 22 to 0 42 mm the flow patterns change from chamber flow to channel flow while the channel flow is transformed to bubble flow when d 10 ranges from 1 42 to 2 1 mm song et al 2015 in addition an increase in airflow flux will lead to a transition from bubble flow to channel flow pattern ben noah et al 2022 geistlinger et al 2006 recently several researchers have investigated the airflow flux characteristics during air sparging song et al song et al 2015 obtained the distribution of airflow flux using air dividers above the surface of aquifer the airflow flux distribution was found to be extremely nonuniform along the horizontal direction within the zoi it approximately follows a gaussian based form kim et al kim et al 2012 kim et al 2015 proposed to use gaseous passive fluxmeter to measure the airflow flux distribution at the aquifer surface similar gaussian distribution of airflow flux was observed in homogenous aquifers yao et al yao et al 2017 investigated the airflow flux distribution along horizontal lines at different heights above the sparger a trapezoidal distribution was observed at the height of 20 cm while the gaussian based distribution was obtained when the height was larger than 30 cm previous research mainly focused on the distribution form of the airflow flux while the scope of the zone within which sparged air flows i e the zone of flow zof was seldom discussed actually the zof characteristics and its relationship with zoi are critical for a further understanding of air sparging in aquifers a detailed discussion on the influence of particle diameter and sparging pressure on the zof is still needed meanwhile the relationship between the zof and zoi is not yet clear and needed to be thoroughly investigated to clarify the relationship of zoi with zof a quantitative determination of zoi is needed in previous experiments song et al 2015 wang et al 2021 the zoi was mainly obtained using a two dimensional transparent flow chamber packed with transparent fused silica sands it was identified as the shadow zone caused by the presence of sparged air within aquifers the zoi boundary was usually determined by observing the shadow zone with naked eyes and then used to calculate the zoi angle hu et al 2010 peterson and murray 2003 the naked eyes based observation of zoi boundary is simple while it may lead to arbitrariness in finding the zoi boundary in fact zoi is the shadow zone with certain air saturation previous researchers have developed a light transmission method ltm to quantitatively relate the air saturation to the light transmittance within transparent porous media hoa 1981 tidwell and glass 1994 niemet and selker 2011 the ltm enables the calculation of spatial variation of air saturation within transparent sand packings van de ven and mumford 2020 this may be further used to determine the zoi boundary while a detailed investigation on the relation between zoi boundary and air saturation variation is still needed for a quantitative determination of zoi boundary in summary there is still a lack of methodologies for quantitative determinations of the scope of zof and zoi during air sparging meanwhile the relationship between zof and zoi during air sparging is underdetermined in this paper an ltm based approach was developed to quantitatively determine the boundary and angle of zoi meanwhile the scope of zof was identified according to the distribution of airflow flux through aquifers observed using an improved two dimensional transparent flow chamber with airflow dividers inside song et al 2015 in particular the quantitative determination of zof boundary was thoroughly discussed finally the relationship between zof and zoi was elaborated in aquifers with different particle sizes and at various sparging pressures 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials transparent fused silica sands gravels were used to facilitate the visualization of airflow in laboratory tests song et al 2015 they were packed in a custom made flow chamber and then saturated with deaerated water to mimic aquifers the method for the packing of sands gravels will be elaborated in section 2 3 four typical aquifers were tested as shown in table 1 the particle sizes of aquifers were selected to cover two typical flow patterns i e the channel and bubble flow patterns song et al 2015 geistlinger et al 2006 peterson et al 1999 2 2 experimental setup a schematic of the testing system is shown in fig 2 a pressurized air was generated by an air compressor 0 700 kpa the air pressure was then regulated using a pressure regulator within the range 0 100 kpa ir2000 02 smc japan the regulated pressure was measured with a pressure gauge 0 100 kpa mik y290 asmilk group china subsequently the pressurized air was injected into the flow chamber packed with transparent sands gravels the transparent flow chamber was specially designed to facilitate the airflow visualization and the measurement of the airflow flux distribution through the aquifer as shown in fig 2 the flow chamber consisted of a lower box for the packing of transparent sands gravels i e the sample box and an upper box for the measurement of the airflow flux distribution namely the measurement box the measurement box was designed to be separated from the sample box to facilitate the sample preparation meanwhile the connection of the sample and measurement boxes was realized through bolts and rubber pads to avoid a possible leakage of water details of the sample and measurement boxes are described as follows the sample box was made of perspex for the visualization of airflow it had internal dimensions of 150 cm length 60 cm height 5 cm thickness the minimum size ratio of the sample box to the mean particle size is 15 6 the wall effect is considered to be negligible since the size ratio is larger than 10 song et al 2015 hu et al 2015 as shown in fig 2 b a cuboid sparger made of acrylic plates was installed at the central bottom of the box for the injection of the pressurized air into the aquifer the dimensions of the sparger were 5 5 5 cm3 a circular hole that had a diameter of 1 cm was opened at the bottom of the sparger for the entrance of the pressurized air into the sparger the air within the sparger was sparged into the aquifer through a narrow slit 0 3 cm 4 cm on the top of the sparger see fig 2 b meanwhile the slit was covered with a wire mesh 325 mesh to prevent the entrance of aquifer particles into the sparger besides to avoid a possible generation of jet flow into the aquifer from the bottom hole an acrylic plate with a width of 3 cm was glued to internal walls of the sparger at a position of 2 cm above the bottom see fig 2 b for the sake of the sample saturation two water tanks 25 cm length 60 cm height 5 cm thickness with multiple ports were set within the sample box an led backlight panel served as light source was placed at the back side of the sample box to facilitate the visualization of the aquifer it has a dimension of 106 cm width 56 cm height which is a bit larger than the lateral surface of the aquifer the measurement box was made of acrylic plates its internal length and thickness were the same as those of the sample box respectively while its internal height was 20 cm see fig 2 a similar to that in song et al song et al 2015 acrylic plates with a thickness of 3 mm termed air dividers were glued to the lateral and top faces of the measurement box see fig 2 b it divided the interior of the box into independent cells the air dividers and independent cells were designed for the measurement of the airflow flux distributions through the surface of the aquifer a total of 28 air dividers were arranged with a separation distance of 5 cm as a result 29 independent cells were generated within the measurement box note that the bottom edges of the air dividers were around 3 cm below the water table so that the cells were able to collect the air emitted from the surface of the aquifer for the measurement of the airflow flux through each cell triple valves were installed on the top of the independent cells as shown in fig 2 b the left outlet of each triple valve was connected to a long pipe that had a discharge outlet for the air while the right outlet was connected to a gas flowmeter 0 1 50 l min mf4008 siargo ltd usa the airflow flux through each cell gives a description on the airflow flux distribution through the surface of aquifer it can be easily measured through reasonable operations of triple valves which will be elaborated in section 2 3 2 3 experimental process a wet procedure broadly used in previous as tests song et al 2015 ji et al 1993 van de ven and mumford 2020 for the sample preparation was adopted to ensure the saturation of the porous media in this approach the transparent sands gravels were saturated before packing and then deposited into the sample box in 9 layers uniformly for each layer the height was controlled to be 5 cm meanwhile the water level was always maintained to be 2 3 cm above the top of the layer to ensure saturation the final height of the aquifer was 45 cm above the sparger as shown in fig 2 b to prevent a possible fluidization of the aquifer i e the upward movement of aquifer grains induced by the upward air flow the top of the aquifer was covered by a filter layer that consisted of glass beads with certain sizes determining the correct size of glass beads is vital because the diameters of glass beads should be large enough to ensure sufficient resistance to fluidization itself and to guarantee easy transportation of air bubbles through the pores of the filter note that a larger glass bead is more stable and therefore is less prone to be fluidized under the action of the upward flow on the other hand the diameters of glass beads should be small enough to prevent aquifer particles from migrating upward through the pores of the filter in the present experiments the filters usually consist of two or more sublayers to meet the above requirements the diameters of glass beads increased gradually from the bottom to top for the sublayer adjacent to the aquifer i e the bottom most sublayer the glass bead diameter was 1 5 2 0 times the aquifer particle size the particle diameter of uppermost sublayer was 7 8 mm which was large enough to prevent the fluidization of the filter meanwhile the particle size ratios between adjacent sublayers were 1 5 2 0 to prevent the intrusion of the lower sublayer particles into the upper sublayer details of the filters used in this study are presented in table 2 note that a filter with only one sublayer was used in test 4 since the particle size of the aquifer was relatively large i e 3 5 mm it was sufficient to use a one sublayer filter consisting of 7 8 mm glass beads to meet all the requirements stated above after packing the filter layers the measurement box was then installed through bolt connections the final water table was around 3 cm above the filter which was the height of the overflow port see fig 2 b it should be noted that the filter above the aquifer may lead to a deviation between the airflow flux distribution through the aquifer surface and that observed using the measurement box it is assumed that the deviation is negligible since the permeability of the filter is much larger 5 10 times or more than that of the aquifer in present experiments it is relatively easy for air bubbles to pass through the interface from the aquifer to filters that have much higher permeability yao et al 2020 preliminary tests confirmed that air bubbles passed through the after filter interface with little horizontal expansion see fig 3 indicating little influence by the filter on airflow flux distributions the experiments began with a gradual increase of the sparging pressure until air appeared in the aquifer when the applied pressure was greater than the summation of the hydrostatic and capillary pressure the air would enter into the aquifer hu et al 2010 the pressure at which the air entered into the aquifer was recorded as the minimum sparging pressure see table 1 note that the initiation pressure has an impact on the zoi as pointed out by farid et al farid et al 2019 in the current study the effect of initiation pressure was not considered therefore the initiation pressures were controlled to be minimum sparging pressures at which the air breaks through the aquifer in all the tests then the sparging pressure was increased gradually to specified values in a step wise manner as shown in fig 4 at each pressure a sufficient settling time was allowed to ensure that no further changes were observed in zoi and airflow flux generally the settling time is around 10 min the sparging pressure and the total airflow flux were then recorded the images of the aquifer were captured by a camera in front of the flow chamber these images were used to determine the zoi boundary and zoi angle with the aid of the light transmission method ltm details of the ltm are elaborated in section 2 4 the airflow flux in each independent cell of the measurement box was recorded by the air flowmeter that connected to the right outlets of triple valves see fig 2 b this was realized through an appropriate operation of the triple valves the left outlets of all triple valves were open while the right outlets were closed at the beginning at this stage the airflow in all cells passed through the left outlets and then was directly discharged when the airflow flux in a certain cell was needed to be measured the right outlet of the triple valve of this cell was opened and the left outlet was closed at this stage the airflow within the present cell passed through the right outlet and was then measured by the air flowmeter while the airflow within other cells was discharged directly through the left outlets thus the value recorded by the air flowmeter was the airflow flux through the present cell note that a small increase in air pressure 0 5 kpa was observed within the present cell due to a pressure drop at the air flowmeter correspondingly a decline in water table by a water head equivalent to the increased air pressure occurred within the present cell as illustrated in fig 5 as a result the total pressure at the bottom of the present cell remained constant which avoided a possible influence of the pressure drop at the air flowmeter on the air sparging after completing the measurement of the airflow flux within the present cell the triple valve outlets of the present cell were re switched to the original state i e the left outlet was open while the right outlet was closed similarly the airflow flux within other cells can be obtained by repeating the above procedure 2 4 light transmission method and definition of relative transmission intensity light transmission method ltm provides a tool to obtain the gas saturation within transparent porous media based on image processing techniques tidwell and glass 1994 niemet and selker 2011 van de ven and mumford 2020 once the spatial variations of gas saturation within porous media are observed by ltm the boundary points of zoi can be determined as the position at which the gas saturation has a sudden and continuous increase from near zero subsequently the angle of zoi can be determined quantitatively based on the linear fitting of the obtained zoi boundary points this is the basic idea for quantitative determination of the scope of zoi using ltm in the present study in the ltm a transmission intensity is defined as the light intensity transmitted through the quasi 2 d transparent porous media as shown in fig 6 it is related to gas saturation through the following mathematical model niemet and selker 2011 van de ven et al 2020 1 s g 1 s r β r ln i ln i s ln i r ln i s in which s g represents the gas saturation during air sparging s r is the residual water saturation i e the water saturation of the unsaturated porous media within which the pore water has been discharged under gravity note that the water is discharged after completing the as tests i represents the transmission intensity during air sparging i s and i r respectively denote the saturation transmission intensity that is the transmission intensity measured in the saturated porous media before air sparging and the residual transmission intensity obtained in the porous medium with residual water saturation β r is an empirical fitting coefficient van de ven et al 2020 mumford et al 2015 note that the values of both s r and β r are constants in the entire sample rather than a local value inside a homogeneous porous media mumford et al 2015 therefore the spatial variation of the gas saturation s g is consistent with that of the following defined variable i rel 2 i rel ln i ln i s ln i r ln i s in which i rel is named as the relative transmission intensity for simplicity the spatial variation of i rel instead of s g is calculated eq 2 and then adopted to determine the boundary and angle of zoi 3 results and discussion 3 1 ltm based determination of zoi boundary and angle the boundary and angle of zoi are usually used to define the scope of zoi in this section they were obtained quantitatively by an ltm based approach and then compared with previous results 3 1 1 determination of zoi boundary and angle the transmission intensity i i s and i r are the three key parameters that used to calculate the variation of i rel eq 2 they were obtained through processing the images of aquifers using imagej 1 53 as shown in fig 7 a the picture is the raw image captured during air sparging at a pressure of 12 kpa in test 1 the raw image was converted to a grey image using imagej as presented in fig 7 b then the distributions of the transmission intensity i along horizontal lines were extracted with the aid of imagej for this purpose interlinked blocks with a size of 34 34 pixels 2 2 cm2 were selected along horizontal lines see fig 7 b the averaged transmission intensity within each block was calculated and further used to derive the distribution of i along the horizontal line the distributions of i s and i r along the horizontal line were obtained in a similar way subsequently the variation of i rel along the horizontal line was calculated according to eq 2 fig 7 c presents variations of i rel along horizontal lines at h 1 15 cm and h 2 35 mm note that although the values of gas saturation s g eq 1 should not be larger than 1 the relative transmission intensity i rel eq 2 may exceed 1 since the transmission intensity i during air sparging may be larger or smaller than the residual transmission intensity i r the values of i rel fluctuate near zero within regions adjacent to the left and right boundaries of the aquifer it indicates that the sparged air is unlikely to reach these regions slight deviations from zero should be attributed to inevitable noises of the light source therefore the regions with near zero i rel are considered to be outside the zoi meanwhile we have noted that relatively large values of i rel appeared within the interval 39 cm 43 cm at h 2 35 cm see fig 7 c further examinations of the raw image showed that accumulations of leaked air along a randomly generated flow channel i e leakage channel from the zoi occurred within the interval 39 cm 43 cm as approaching the central position the values of i rel present a sudden and continuous increase and then fluctuate within a relatively wide interval in proximity to the central position note that fluctuations should be due to random entrapments of air bubbles in certain regions the points x 1l 32 cm and x 1r 28 cm fig 7 c at which i rel increases continually and rapidly are considered respectively as the left and right boundary points of the zoi at the specified height of 15 cm similarly the left and right boundary points of zoi at h 35 cm are determined respectively as x 2l 38 cm and x 2r 44 cm fig 7 c repeating the above procedure the boundary points of zoi at 6 heights were obtained and plotted in fig 8 the left right zoi boundaries were derived by fitting the left right boundary points with a linear form song et al 2015 the left right zoi angles were then calculated as the angles between the left right zoi boundaries and the vertical direction the averaged value of the left and right zoi angles was used as the zoi angle it can be seen that the derived zoi boundary using ltm approximately separates the zones with and without sparged air observed by naked eyes moreover the ltm based method provides a unified manner for determining zoi boundary and zoi angle with little arbitrariness 3 1 2 validation the zoi angles in tests 1 4 were derived using the ltm based approach and then compared with those obtained in previous studies for validation the results are presented in fig 9 the zoi angle decreases with the increment of effective particle diameter d 10 and then becomes constant as d 10 exceeds 2 3 mm the zoi angles obtained in previous studies reddy and adams 2001 song et al 2015 peterson and murray 2003 were plotted as well in fig 9 for comparison in the selected researches the particle diameters range within the interval 0 4 6 0 mm which is consistent with that adopted in the present study the zoi boundary and zoi angle were obtained primarily by naked eyes the naked eyes based observation of zoi angles presents certain arbitrariness while their variations with particle diameter are similar i e decreasing zoi angle with increasing particle diameter the variation of zoi angle in this study is similar to those in previous studies in particular the zoi angles obtained in this study are close to those in song et al song et al 2015 meanwhile the results presented in this study deviates from those obtained by peterson and murry peterson and murray 2003 this should be due to the layered aquifer coarsening upward sequence used in peterson and murry peterson and murray 2003 refraction occurred at interfaces between layers with different permeabilities attributed to different particle sizes li 2016 which may increase the arbitrariness of the observation of zoi angles nevertheless the ltm based approach is confirmed to be reliable in the determination of zoi boundary and zoi angle 3 2 determination of zof based on airflow flux distribution the distribution of airflow flux through the top surface of the aquifer is described by airflow flux in independent cells of the measurement box see fig 2 b in each independent cell the airflow flux q c in cm3 cm2 s is defined as the gas volume through unit cross section of the cell in unit time 3 q c v c t s c in which v c in cm3 is the air volume through the cell in a period of t in second s c in cm2 denotes the cross section area of the cell in the present study the airflow flux q c through each cell was obtained using the experimental procedure in section 2 3 the distribution of q c represents the airflow flux distribution fig 10 presents the airflow flux distributions obtained in tests 1 4 non uniform distributions of airflow flux were observed along the horizontal direction the maximum airflow fluxes occur at positions approximately right above the sparger in all the tests as the increasing of the lateral distance to the sparger the airflow fluxes decrease gradually to zero this is consistent with the observations in song et al song et al 2015 meanwhile we have noted that there exist some fluctuations at certain positions especially near the central position when the particle size of aquifer is relatively small d 10 1 1 mm this should be due to the channel flow pattern always encountered in aquifers that have relatively small particle sizes geistlinger et al 2006 peterson et al 1999 the flow channels are randomly distributed within the aquifer there may exist some cells of measurement box within which relatively larger or smaller number of flow channels are concentrated resulting in a sudden increase or decrease in airflow flux as presented in fig 10 a and b once the airflow flux distributions are obtained a realistic way to find zof is to determine the boundary points at which the airflow flux decreases to zero however because the independent cells have a finite width i e 5 cm it is impossible to determine the boundary points exactly a possible compromise is to find the boundary cells within which the airflow fluxes decrease to zero the centers of the boundary cells are assumed as the boundary points whereas the determination of the boundary cells is still ambiguous in the experiments this is because the airflow fluxes decrease to pretty small values within certain cells that are far away from the central position in these cells although a few air bubbles are emitted intermittently the airflow fluxes are too small to be captured accurately whether these cells or their adjacent cells should be considered as the boundary cells remains ambiguous and subjective to address this problem an approach based on the gaussian based fitting curve was developed for the determination of the zof boundary points song et al song et al 2015 and yao et al yao et al 2017 proposed that the airflow flux distributions follow a gaussian based form along horizontal lines that are more than 30 cm above the sparger in this study the height of aquifers above the sparger is 45 cm which is much larger than 30 cm the airflow flux distributions in fig 10 were fitted using the following gaussian based function 4 q x c a exp x x c 2 2 ω 2 in which x is the horizontal coordinate x c and ω represent the mean and variance of the gaussian based function c denotes the horizontal asymptote of the gaussian based function while a c is the peak of the gaussian based function note that the area s g bounded by the gaussian based fitting curve and the horizontal axis represents the total airflow flux in cm3 s through the aquifer it can be calculated through the integral of the fitted gaussian based function eq 4 over a certain interval that depends on the position of the horizontal asymptote c schematics for the calculation of s g are shown in fig 11 in fact s g is meaningful just when c has a negative or zero value when c is greater than zero s g is unphysical since it has an infinite value therefore if the fitted parameter c is positive the curve will be re fitted on the premise that c is forced to be zero details of the fitting parameters are listed in table 3 the coefficients of determination are higher than or approaching 0 9 in most of the tests meanwhile we have noted that the coefficients of determination are relatively low around 0 9 in certain tests with particle sizes smaller than 1 2 mm this could be due to the fluctuations in airflow flux that attributed to the channel flow pattern as discussed above nevertheless it is confirmed that the gaussian based function is capable of describing the airflow flux distributions in the present study based on the gaussian based fitting curve an integral airflow flux approach was proposed for the determination of boundary points of zof as follows a fit the airflow flux with the gaussian based function eq 4 as discussed above if the fitted parameter c is positive it will be re fitted on the premise that c is forced to be zero the fitted parameters in tests 1 4 are presented in table 3 b calculate the area s g bounded by the gaussian based fitting curve and the horizontal axis s g is calculated through the integral of the fitted gaussian based function q x eq 4 if the fitted parameter c is equal to zero the integral is performed over the interval see fig 11 b it has a theoretical solution i e 2 π aω when c is smaller than zero the gaussian based fitting curve has two intersection points with the horizontal axis i e x sl and x sr in fig 11 c the integral is performed over the interval x sl x sr although this integral has no theoretical solutions it is very easy to numerically calculate the integral in excel the calculated s g in tests 1 4 are summarized in table 4 as stated above s g represents the total airflow flux in cm3 s through the surface of the aquifer for comparison the total airflow flux s exp in cm3 s measured directly in the experiments is also presented in table 4 it can be seen that s g is very close to s exp the deviations in most of the tests are no more than 1 confirming the reliability of the calculation of s g based on the gaussian based fitting curve c find the interval x c l b x c l b over which the integral of the fitted gaussian based function q x is 99 of s g see fig 12 in which l b is the distance of the left right boundary point to the central axis of the gaussian based fitting curve subsequently the left and right boundary points of the airflow flux distribution are determined as x c l b and x c l b respectively although the gaussian based function presents a good fitting for the airflow flux distributions it leads to an over diffusion of the airflow for example the airflow is diffused to infinity when c is equal to zero see fig 11 b therefore we select an interval x c l b x c l b within which the integral airflow flux is 99 of s g fig 12 indicating that almost all the airflow flux is included in this interval note that the percentage 99 is determined by tri and error which will be validated in the following table 5 presents the boundary points x c l b and x c l b calculated using the proposed method a validation of the calculated boundary points is shown in fig 13 the boundary points locate around positions that separate cells with and without airflows which confirms that the selection of 99 is reasonable for the determination of boundary points indeed it is impossible to accurately determine the boundary points since the precision of the airflow flux measurement box is the width of the independent cell i e 5 cm in the present study meanwhile a further decrease in the cell width is unfeasible since it may significantly increase the randomness in the airflow flux measurement the proposed integral airflow flux approach provides a unified determination of the boundary points with acceptable accuracy this approach essentially determines the most likely location of the boundary points by considering the airflow fluxes in all the cells recalling that the airflow fluxes in all the cells are considered during gaussian fitting it eliminates the arbitrariness in determining the boundary points of the airflow flux distribution once the boundary points of the airflow flux distribution are determined the scope of zof can be characterized by the range of the boundary points x c l b x c l b 3 3 zof characteristics and its relationship with zoi for a quantitative description of zof a radius r f of zof is defined as half of the distance between the left and right boundary points i e r f l b see fig 12 correspondingly the zoi radius r i is introduced for comparison r i was calculated with the aid of the zoi boundaries obtained in section 3 1 that is the left and right zoi boundaries are extended and intersected with the top surface of the aquifer at points x il and x ir as shown in fig 13 r i is calculated as half of the distance l i between x il and x ir i e r i x ir x il 2 note that the zof radius r f is defined at the surface of the aquifer the airflow flux distribution and the r f within the interior of the aquifer were not able to be obtained in the present study nevertheless the variations of r f with particle diameter and sparging pressure will provide a certain understanding of the airflow characteristics and its relationship with zoi the values of r f and r i are presented in table 5 r f is always smaller than r i it indicates that the flowing of the sparged air mainly occurs within the zof that is not consistent with the zoi and always smaller than zoi for a quantitative comparison of zof to zoi a coefficient α f is defined as the ratio of zof radius r f to zoi radius r i 5 α f r f r i previous studies have shown that the sparging pressure has an important effect on the zoi radius song et al 2015 hu et al 2010 the influence of sparging pressure on the zoi radius r i the zof radius r f and the zof coefficient α f was investigated in this study as shown in fig 14 the zoi radius r i increases and then tends to be constant with the increase in sparging pressure this is consistent with the previous observations song et al 2015 hu et al 2010 on the other hand farid et al farid et al 2019 found that no r i change was observed with any further increase in the air pressure after the initial formation of the zoi this should be due to the relatively large initiation sparging pressure larger than 14 kpa adopted by farid et al farid et al 2019 similarly the zof radius r f increases first and then remains constant with the increment of sparging pressure meanwhile the zof radius r f is always smaller than the zoi radius r i the zof coefficient α f eq 5 is smaller than unity the variations of α f with sparging pressure depend on the air flow patterns that are related to particle sizes of aquifers when the particle sizes are larger than 2 3 mm i e in test 3 and test 4 bubble flow patterns are observed in the tests see fig 15 a α f presents a decreasing trend with the increase of the sparging pressure as the sparging pressure exceeds 12 kpa the values of α f tend to be constants that are around 0 55 0 62 however when the particle sizes are smaller than 1 2 mm i e in test 1 and test 2 channel flow patterns see fig 15 b are observed in the tests the values of α f increase first and then present certain fluctuations around values of 0 75 0 82 the fluctuations could be attributed to random generations of flow channels with the increment of sparging pressure the results show that the zof is not consistent with the zoi and always smaller than zoi stable values of r i r f and α f are obtained at sufficiently large pressures as shown in fig 14 their variations with the effective particle diameter d 10 are illustrated in fig 16 the stable r i and r f both decrease gradually with the increase of effective particle diameter d 10 the stable zof coefficient α f ranges from 0 75to 0 82 when d 10 is smaller than 2 1 mm while it decreases to 0 55 0 62 when d 10 is larger than 2 1 mm this should be attributed to the transition of a channel flow pattern for d 10 1 1 mm to a bubble flow pattern for d 10 2 1 mm as the increase of particle size when d 10 is larger than 2 1 mm individual air bubbles move through the voids of aquifer with a bubble flow pattern in the regions adjacent to the zoi boundaries the sparged air always exists in closed bubbles it is difficult for invidual bubbles to transfer sparging pressure consequently the pressure gradients within regions adjacent to the zoi boundaries are relatively small therefore it is difficult to generate continuous airflows in these regions as a result the zof radius is much smaller than the zoi radius indicating a relatively small zof coefficient α f 0 55 0 62 whereas for d 10 smaller than 1 1 mm flow channels are generated near the zoi boundaries continuous airflows are likely to be generated in certain flow channels near the zoi boundaries therefore the zof radius is relatively close to the zoi radius indicating a relatively large value of α f 0 75 0 82 4 conclusions the air distributions and flow characteristics during air sparging were investigated for different aquifers with different particle sizes the quantitative determination of the boundary and angle of zone of influence zoi within which sparged air exists was discussed based on the light transmission method ltm meanwhile the zone of flow zof was identified using the airflow flux distribution through the aquifer particularly focusing on the quantitative determination of zof boundary a zof radius was defined and compared with the zoi radius at various sparging pressures and in aquifers with different particle sizes the key contributions of this study are listed as follows 1 an ltm based approach was developed for the quantitative determination of zoi boundary and zoi angle a relative transmission intensity that was linearly related with the gas saturation was defined based on the saturated and residual transmission intensity directly measured using ltm the relative transmission intensity presents a rapid and continuous increasing near the zoi boundary providing a criterion for the quantitative determination of zoi boundary and zoi angle 2 an integral airflow flux approach for determining the scope of zof was proposed based on the fitted gaussian based function of the airflow flux distribution the scope of zof can be determined as the interval over which the integral of the fitted gaussian based function is 99 of the total air flow flux through the aquifer 3 the zof is not consistent with zoi and always smaller than zoi the zof radius r f increases first and then keeps constant with the increment of sparging pressure while it decreases with the growth of particle sizes of aquifers the zof radius is around 0 55 0 82 times of the zoi radius which depends on the air flow patterns that are related to the particle diameter d p of aquifer as the transition of channel flow d p 1 2 mm to bubble flow patterns d p 2 3 mm the ratio of zof to zoi radius decrease from 0 75 to 0 82 to 0 55 0 62 it indicates that sparged air is entrapped with little flowing inside zoi regions that are outside the zof which should be considered carefully in the design of as since the airflow induced volatilization is weakened largely by the entrapment of sparged air the as efficiency may be reduced in these regions this should be considered carefully in the design of as the present research mainly focused on the zof characteristics and its relationship with the zoi while the as efficiency within and outside the zof will be considered in the future studies homogeneous aquifers were tested in the present experiments while the aquifers sometimes present obvious heterogeneity in nature e g aquifers with low permeability or high permeability lenses a study on the influence of heterogeneity on the zof characteristics is still needed it will be considered in the future credit authorship contribution statement kuang cheng conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft project administration funding
