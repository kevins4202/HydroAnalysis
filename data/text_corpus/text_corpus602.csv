3010,arsenic as mobilization in groundwater is linked to the dissimilatory reductive dissolution of as v coated fe iii oxy hydroxides from the aquifer sediment coupled with the degradation of available dissolved organic carbon doc due to the presence of anaerobic microbes under anoxic conditions understanding the seasonal pattern of as mobilization in the shallow groundwater of the bengal basin remains a challenging task due to the heterogeneous character of the shallow aquifers and the involvement of multiple factors to resolve this issue in the present study we showcased a comprehensive effort to advance understanding of the seasonal as mobilization process in the shallow groundwater utilizing multiple geochemical tracers i e the abundance of dissolved total as fe mn no3 so4 2 doc cl and δ18o δ2h δ13c doc isotopic tracers between post monsoon and pre monsoon periods over multiple years from nadia district west bengal india we quantified and explained the seasonal variation of dissolved total as concentrations in the groundwaters with the nature of the aquifer lithology i e grey sand aquifer or gsa and brown sand aquifer or bsa the present study reported elevated dissolved total as concentrations in the shallow groundwater samples during dry pre monsoon prm periods compared to post monsoon pom time however the magnitude of such seasonal changes in groundwater as concentrations denoted as δas as prm as pom varied between years depending on the extent of rainfall surface water infiltration mixing and groundwater withdrawal our current findings are different from the past studies that reported elevated as concentrations in the shallow groundwater during the monsoon and post monsoon periods compared to the dry pre monsoon periods however the limitations of the past findings are that most of the previous studies were carried out between seasonal intervals over a single annual cycle without reinvestigating the seasonal trends over different years under variable hydrological conditions we proposed that the excess groundwater withdrawal during the dry pre monsoon period drive draw down and therefore trigger infiltration of surface derived deep pond water into the shallow aquifer such surface water infiltration introduces fresh labile organic matter into the shallow aquifer promoting high as mobilization during the dry pre monsoon period a viable alternative approach of squeezing of aquifer intercalated clay peat sedimentary lenses and mixing of organic rich pore water in the adjoining groundwater can also enhance high as mobilization during the dry time as examined in this study this process is triggered by the excessive groundwater withdrawal practices and drawdown encountered during dry time driving the aquifer intercalated clay pockets compaction keywords arsenic seasonal deep pond water groundwater dissolved organic carbon redox state 1 introduction high as concentrations 10 µg l permissible guideline value recommended by who are documented in the groundwater of the shallow grey sand aquifers gsa at depths 70 m bgl of the bengal basin dowling et al 2002 harvey et al 2002 fendorf et al 2010 biswas et al 2012 chatterjee et al 2013 biswas et al 2014 frequent patterns of seasonal variations in as concentrations are documented mainly in the shallow gsa groundwaters of the bengal basin cheng et al 2005 savarimuthu et al 2006 planer friedrich et al 2012 biswas et al 2014 majumder et al 2016 2017 in contrast the brown sand aquifers bsa at depths 35 70 m bgl provide nearly as free groundwater 10 µg l as mcarthur et al 2008 ghosal et al 2015 arsenic is commonly found in as v sorbed on the surfaces of fe iii oxy hydroxide phases in the fine sand grains and silty clay rich sediments of the bengal basin which is characterized by the high organic contents bhattacharya et al 1997 nickson et al 1998 mcarthur et al 2001 dowling et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 these sediments were part of palaeo ganges river flood delta plain sedimentation events and were strongly influenced by sea level fluctuations during the quaternary periods acharyya et al 2000 the principle mechanisms involved in as mobilization from these sediments include dissimilatory reductive dissolution of as v coated fe iii oxy hydroxides liberating as iii and fe ii in the presence of microbes that facilitate consumption of bioavailable dissolved organic carbon doc in the groundwater for growth and metabolism doc in groundwater actively participates during as mobilization process as energy source for microbes and can originate from multiple sources such as aquifer intercalated organic rich clay peat lenses mcarthur et al 2001 2004 sengupta et al 2008 datta et al 2011 and the natural surface water bodies ponds rivers lakes that are rich in fresh labile organic matter harvey et al 2002 neumann et al 2010 lawson et al 2013 seasonal variation in as concentrations in the shallow groundwater of the bengal basin is documented highly heterogeneous due to the involvement of multiple factors including variable rainfall surface water recharge mixing groundwater withdrawal aquifer redox state and local lithology cheng et al 2005 savarimuthu et al 2006 planer friedrich et al 2012 biswas et al 2014 majumder et al 2016 2017 however the subject remains poorly addressed due to the lack of comprehensive knowledge on the interconnected roles of multiple factors driving as distribution over time in the shallow groundwaters of the bengal basin therefore an advanced understanding of this topic is needed to identify the potential causes of excessive as in the shallow groundwater and its seasonal fluctuations to better manage the groundwater resources the south west monsoon swm rainfall june through september which accounts for 82 of the annual rainfall over india significantly recharges the shallow aquifers of the bengal basin mukherjee et al 2007b the time interval between october and may is designated as the dry period when the freshwater abundance due to the interplay of the meteorological parameters is less prominent and the demand is high for the groundwater the dry period is further divided into three periods post monsoon october december winter january february and pre monsoon march may after the swm the groundwater level remains high in the post monsoon period due to the monsoon recharge effect however during the pre monsoon period the groundwater level recedes maximum due to excessive abstraction practices for irrigation and drinking purposes pre monsoon showers norwester or locally known as kalbaisakhi and rainfall due to cyclonic activities account for 18 of the annual precipitation over india mukherjee et al 2007a b such rain provides occasional hydrological input to the shallow aquifers during dry periods by percolation through unsaturated soil and sedimentary desiccation features like mud cracks in dry periods groundwater provides the only potential water resource 50 60 from shallow aquifers essentially meeting the agricultural demand sikdar et al 2018 excessive groundwater abstraction during dry periods causes a sharp drop in the local groundwater level of the shallow aquifers harvey et al 2002 neumann et al 2010 lawson et al 2013 biswas et al 2014 mukherjee et al 2018 which generates local depression zones in the groundwater levels sikdar et al 2018 the drawdown in the groundwater level of the shallow aquifer is often compensated by the a infiltration of organic rich surface water from the base of ponds lakes and rivers harvey et al 2002 neumann et al 2010 lawson et al 2013 mukherjee et al 2018 or b mixing of organic rich pore water from the adjoining intercalated clay pockets mixing of such organic rich water into the shallow aquifer is likely to trigger anoxic conditions and higher as mobilization by driving the anaerobic microbial activity there has been evidence of land subsidence in the adjoining areas of the bengal basin due to the compaction of sub surface fine grained sedimentary strata by excessive pumping sahu and sikdar 2011 planer friedrich et al 2012 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 pathak et al 2022a seasonal changes in the storage volume of the shallow aquifers occur due to the cycles of monsoonal recharge and dry time groundwater abstraction planer friedrich et al 2012 the process generates an expansion and squeezing effect in the aquifer intercalated clay peat layers which may perturb the sub surface aqueous chemistry by expulsion and mixing of the organic rich pore water approximately 20 mixing of organic rich pore water derived from the squeezing of aquifer intercalated clay pockets caused high as release via excess supply of doc to the adjoining groundwater mihajlov et al 2020 a variable temporal pattern of dissolved total as concentration in the shallow groundwater has been explained based on the seasonal recharge cycles multiple studies registered higher dissolved total as concentrations in shallow groundwater during the wet periods compared to the dry periods in an annual cycle cheng et al 2005 savarimuthu et al 2006 planer friedrich et al 2012 biswas et al 2014 majumder et al 2016 2017 such an observation is commonly attributed to the monsoonal recharge bringing anoxia either through the inflow of doc or saturation of sediment pore spaces conducive for high as release in contrast government agencies like central ground water board cgwb and other studies cheng et al 2005 biswas et al 2014 reported elevated dissolved total as concentrations in the shallow groundwater during dry periods compared to the wet period the possible dilution effect in the shallow groundwater during the wet time due to the mixing of rainwater and surface runoff as input can explain such temporal distribution of dissolved total as concentrations in addition the introduction of organic rich anoxic water from the bottom of the natural surface water bodies into the shallow aquifer during the dry period facilitated by excess groundwater withdrawal can lead to high as mobilization the majority of the past studies reporting heterogeneous as distribution in the shallow groundwater over time were conducted between seasonal time intervals over only an annual cycle therefore repeated seasonal observations on the same set of bore wells over multiple years are required to understand better the seasonal as mobilization process in the shallow groundwater under variable hydrological conditions in yearly cycles a comprehensive effort to monitor the seasonal as trends in the shallow groundwater mid screen depth 70 m bgl over multiple years 2016 2019 was carried out in this study to address the interconnected roles of multiple factors responsible for as release in this study the groundwater sampling was done from one of the as hot spot regions of the bengal basin situated in the nadia district west bengal india we focused our observations between the post monsoon and pre monsoon periods coinciding with the period of maximum abstraction of shallow groundwater our current objectivity focused on a quantitative understanding of the source of recharge water contributing to labile organic matter and responsible for high as mobilization in the shallow groundwater at the seasonal time intervals by inducing anaerobic microbial activity for this purpose we measured the abundance of conservative solute dissolved cl and stable isotopic ratios δ18o δ2h in the seasonal shallow groundwater samples along with δ13c doc signatures in the groundwater for a better understanding of the active redox biogeochemical processes responsible for the seasonal release of as in the shallow aquifer we simultaneously measured multiple

area the field area 48 km2 in haringhata and chakdaha blocks nadia district west bengal fig 1 a selected in the present study has received significant attention due to excess as concentrations in the shallow groundwaters inspected for over 30 years it falls under the gangetic alluvial plain and belongs to the sonar bangla aquifer mukherjee et al 2007a elevation 0 20 m above msl in proximity to the hooghly river also known as hugli river groundwater modeling over the study region showed a topographic control on the groundwater flow suggesting flow direction from the north west to the south east mukherjee et al 2007a sikdar et al 2018 as seen before the onset of excessive irrigation pumping for the green revolution of the 1970s due to excessive pumping practices the regional groundwater flow system has been replaced by several local to intermediate scale flow systems with a tendency to generate seasonal troughs or cones of depression around the pumping centers desbarats et al 2014 this has caused a drop in the local groundwater levels during dry periods with a maximum drop detected at the end of the dry pre monsoon period mainly in april figure s1 the draw down in the groundwater level of the shallow aquifers triggers localized surface water infiltration from the base of natural surface water bodies such as ponds lakes and rivers harvey et al 2002 mukherjee et al 2007a lawson et al 2008 neumann et al 2010 lawson et al 2013 biswas et al 2014 kulkarni et al 2018 the study region recorded anisotropy in aquifer hydraulic conductivities which is featured with high horizontal hydraulic conductivity 20 m day compared to low vertical hydraulic conductivity 0 0016 m day in certain areas mukherjee 2006 sikdar et al 2018 this suggests the possibility of predominant lateral transport along the regional groundwater flow path even at the seasonal timescale the shallow aquifer in the study region is frequently capped by a 3 m thick weathered silt clay layer termed surface soil sporadic sand silt pockets in the surface soil layer in the region métral et al 2008 allow enhanced localized vertical infiltration into the shallow aquifer the primary shallow aquifer types of the study area comprise buried palaeo channel sedimentary sequences of mostly holocene age the shallow aquifer includes reduced grey fine to medium grained sand with silt clay intercalations up to 70

lgm palaeosol layer mcarthur et al 2008 ghosal et al 2015 frequent thin films of clay and randomly oriented peat layers rich in organics are inter bedded in the shallow grey sand aquifers biswas 2003 charlet et al 2007 métral et al 2008 ghosal et al 2015 fig 1b such intercalated clay peat lenses prohibit inter aquifer mixing along the groundwater flow paths however where such low permeable lenses are absent or thinned down mixing is promoted in the aquifer mukherjee and fryar 2008 mcarthur et al 2016 3 materials and methods here we monitored bore well waters tapping the shallow gsa mid screen depths 70 m bgl and bsa mid screen depths 35 70 m bgl the groundwater sampling from shallow gsa included n 11 bore wells each during nov 16 apr 17 feb 18 and may 18 n 35 bore wells each during dec 18 and apr 19 time periods however the groundwater sampling from bsa included n 6 bore wells each during nov 16 and apr 17 n 1 bore well each during dec 18 and apr 19 period fig 1a we provided a comparative overview of seasonal observations on groundwater chemical composition during post monsoon periods pom i e nov 16 as pom 1 dec 18 as pom 2 and pre monsoon periods prm i e apr 17 as prm 1 apr 19 as prm 2 for multiple years 2016 2019 during this period we resampled several bore wells which were earlier studied for understanding the sub surface lithological profiling and spatial distribution of dissolved total as concentrations mukherjee et al 2007a mukherjee and fryar 2008 hoque et al 2012 ghosal et al 2015 mcarthur et al 2016 this provided an opportunity to compare observations from the previous studies and present a map of temporal data with higher confidence the lithological profiles near our current sampling sites fig 1b provided a comprehensive idea of the sub surface lithology of the study area availability of doc in the aquifer is one of the key component for as mobilization responsible for generating the required anoxic conditions by triggering anaerobic microbial activity in the as containing groundwater the potential source of doc and its contribution can be traced and estimated using a mass balance approach including the stable δ13c doc isotopic signature zhou et al 2018 stopelli et al 2021 pathak et al 2022a to address this we analyzed the sedimentary and dissolved organic carbon isotopic signatures δ13c oc in the possible in situ i e shallow aquifer sediment and ex situ i e river water deep pond water pond bottom sediment near surface sediment organic contributing sources along with the shallow gsa groundwater samples we sampled shallow bore well waters n 28 70 m bgl bore well adjacent surface soil layers within 15 cm bgl n 28 few pond bottom sediments n 9 deep pond waters n 5 and hugli river waters n 11 once during the pre monsoon time over the monitoring period apr 19 fig 1a deep pond water samples were collected manually from different locations by lowering the sampler to the deepest part of the pond just above the sediment water interface similarly pond bottom sediments were collected from the bases of the ponds hugli river water samples were collected similarly by lowering the sampler to the deeper part of the river from the kanchrapara site north 24 parganas west bengal the carbon isotopic composition of shallow aquifer sedimentary organic matter is adopted from the literature data of the adjacent region of north 24 parganas west bengal mcarthur et al 2004 for our purpose to understand the source of recharge water contributing to doc in the shallow aquifer at seasonal time intervals we measured simultaneously the abundance of conservative solute dissolved cl and stable isotopic signatures δ18o and δ2h in the seasonal shallow gsa groundwater samples further to capture the active redox biogeochemical processes in the shallow aquifer driven by the organic rich water infiltration mixing responsible for seasonal as release we studied the abundance of multiple redox sensitive solutes and redox parameter dissolved total as fe mn so4 2 no3 doc concentration orp value in the seasonal shallow gsa groundwater samples our approach of investigation matches well with the past studies with similar research goals cheng et al 2005 savarimuthu et al 2006 planer friedrich et al 2012 biswas et al 2014 majumder et al 2016 2017 zhou et al 2018 stopelli et al 2021 pathak et al 2022a however the lack of a comprehensive effort to study multiple factors driving seasonal as mobilization in the shallow groundwater by monitoring over multiple years for an advanced understanding of the interconnected roles motivated the present study the detailed methodologies including sampling protocol analytical technique and analytical uncertainty of the measurement are provided in supplementary information we introduced a new index big delta δ to estimate the seasonal deviation in groundwater composition collected during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons we compared here the groundwater composition of apr 17 prm 1 with nov 16 pom 1 period and apr 19 prm 2 with dec 18 pom 2 period seasonal changes in the composition of the depth bound groundwater samples were estimated using the formula δe eprm epom where e dissolved total as fe mn so4 2 no3 doc cl concentration δ18o δ2h isotopic ratio and orp value a paired sample t test at 95 confidence interval for the difference between seasonal means was carried out to evaluate the statistical significance of the observed seasonal patterns in the shallow groundwater composition the observed orp values in the shallow gsa groundwater samples during the field were later corrected with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode for eh pe pe 16 9 eh at 25 values were calculated from the eh values of the groundwater samples saturation index si is defined as si log iap kt 1 where iap is the ion activity product and kt is the equilibrium solubility constant of a phase at ambient temperature in the present study using phreeqc interactive 3 3 7 11094 software parkhurst and appelo 2013 with thermodynamic values of phases from the databases of wateq4f we calculated the saturation indices si of the possible mineral phases in the shallow gsa groundwater samples n 11 70 m bgl here we used the groundwater samples collected during the prm 1 apr 17 period when the maximum dissolved total as concentrations were documented over the monitoring intervals for si calculation the input dataset included temperature ph and concentrations of cations and anions in the groundwater samples bore well water samples retrieved from the bsa

shallow groundwater samples during the present study are provided in the supporting data table 1 to table 6 in supplementary information 4 results 4 1 vertical distribution pattern of as and as mobilizing solutes in groundwater the vertical distribution pattern of dissolved total as concentrations in the integrated seasonal groundwater samples mid screen depths 4 70 m bgl over multiple years was compared with the adjoining lithological characteristics of the aquifers the groundwater samples in the present study from mid screen depths 70 m bgl mainly originated from the shallow gsa and a few groundwater samples from mid screen depths of 39 6 51 8 m bgl represented bsa dissolved total as concentrations in the shallow gsa groundwater samples showed a pattern featuring an overall increase with depths the peak as concentrations were noticed at 19 to 22 m bgl depth intervals during multiple years of seasonal observations fig 3 at 19 5 m bgl depth maximum as concentrations documented were 72 µg l in pom 1 november 16 and 140 µg l in prm 1 april 17 at 21 3 m bgl depth maximum as concentrations were 94 µg l in pom 2 december 18 and 66 µg l in prm 2 april 19 periods at specific locations similar high as concentrations 58 µg l in pom 1 and 130 µg l in prm 1 were recorded at 35 m bgl depth groundwater samples n 7 of the bsa showed an overall low dissolved total as concentrations 10 µg l who during both post and pre monsoon seasons due to low as concentrations in the bsa groundwater these samples were excluded for subsequent analysis on the redox sensitive as mobilizing solutes however there were two bsa groundwater samples i e gw17 and gw18 where excess as concentrations during prm time were detected 12 µg l and 25 µg l respectively fig 3 integrated seasonal groundwater samples of multiple years in the shallow gsa showed a large distribution in dissolved total as 1 to 140 µg l fe 0 4 to 22 8 mg l mn 25 5 to 908 µg l and so4 2 0 001 to 55 6 mg l concentrations under variable ranges of oxidation reduction potential values from oxic at 70 mv to reducing at 136 mv fig 4 low no3 concentrations i e 0 001 to 3 mg l were detected in most shallow gsa groundwater samples however with few samples recorded excessive no3 occurrences i e 5 to 20 9 mg l dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations in a few shallow gsa groundwater samples n 7 were measured twice dec 18 and apr 19 over the monitoring period and the values ranged between 3 7 and 7 7 mg l fig 4 there was no apparent correlation documented between doc and dissolved total as concentrations in the shallow groundwater samples except gw20 registering both higher as and doc concentrations in the present study a positive correlation r 0 6 to 0 7 was documented between dissolved total as and fe concentrations in the shallow gsa groundwater samples during the pom 1 nov 16 and prm 1 apr 17 periods figure s2 the samples showed a negative correlation between dissolved total as and so4 2 concentrations r 0 7 and a weaker negative correlation between as and mn concentrations r 0 4 over the same time intervals however such correlations were absent in the shallow gsa groundwater samples during pom 2 dec 18 and prm 2 apr 19 periods additionally the seasonal groundwater samples in shallow gsa showing maximum as concentrations during nov 16 and apr 17 periods defined as peak as 1 correlated with maximum fe concentrations 11 2 mg l and 10 2 mg l respectively and below detection level so4 2 concentrations 0 001 mg l fig 4 however the shallow gsa groundwater samples for the dec 18 and apr 19 periods registering the highest as concentrations defined as peak as 2 were found to correlate with low fe concentrations 0 7 mg l and 1 1 mg l respectively medium so4 2 concentrations 9 4 mg l and 4 6 mg l respectively and higher orp values 3 mv and 6 mv respectively the conservative tracers i e cl concentrations 2 mg l to 152 5 mg l and δ18o 1 6 to 7 0 δ2h 15 7 to 48 1 isotope values in the seasonal shallow gsa groundwater samples also showed wide distributions fig 7a the shallow gsa groundwater samples showed si 0 values with respect to dissolved oxygen mn oxy hydroxides and mg bearing mineral phases the samples showed si 0 and si 0 values with respect to fe iii oxy hydroxide and carbonate mineral phases respectively magnesite and rhodochrosite mineral phases in the samples showed mean si values 0 07 and 0 03 respectively supporting data table 6 in supplementary information listed the calculated si values for some of the essential mineral phases that are thought to affect the shallow groundwater ionic chemistry in the study area 4 2 seasonal trends in as and as mobilizing solutes in groundwater a statistically significant p 0 05 increment in dissolved total as concentrations n 8 out of 9 with δas 4 to 72 µg l was documented in shallow gsa groundwater samples from nov 16 pom 1 to apr 17 prm 1 period figs 5 and 6 these set of seasonal samples showed significantly decreasing dissolved mn concentrations n 5 out of 8 with δmn 29 2 to 143 8 µg l from pom 1 to prm 1 period in contrast a complex and mixed inter seasonal pattern was documented in dissolved total fe n 6 with δfe 0 6 to 2 5 mg l and n 2 with δfe 0 9 mg l and so4 2 concentrations n 3 with so4 2 concentrations at 0 001 mg l n 2 with δso4 2 0 7 to 9 6 mg l and n 4 with δso4 2 0 4 to 7 6 mg l in the same groundwater samples from pom 1 to prm 1 period fig 6 the majority of the observations from other years comprising two seasons i e from dec 18 pom 2 to apr 19 prm 2 period captured an increasing dissolved total fe n 20 out of 34 with δfe 0 5 to 12 4 mg l and mn concentrations n 26 out of 34 with δmn 4 to 540 µg l with decreasing so4 2 n 21 out of 30 with δso4 2 3 1 to 37 1 mg l n 3 with so4 2 remaining at 0 001 mg l and no3 concentrations n 26 with δno3 2 2 to 17 7 mg l having statistically significant p 0 05 dependency the samples showed tentative p

samples showed a complex mixed inter seasonal pattern in dissolved total as concentrations n 16 with δas 2 31 µg l n 9 with δas 2 28 µg l and n 9 with inter seasonal shift within the analytical uncertainty of as measurement from pom 2 to prm 2 period figs 5 and 6 the majority of groundwater samples from bsa n 7 showed insignificant inter seasonal changes in the dissolved total as concentrations except two samples gw17 and gw18 registering an increment in as concentrations δas 8 and 16 µg l during prm 1 period compared to pom 1 period fig 5 we observed no clear inter seasonal pattern in dissolved cl concentrations from the pom 1 to prm 1 period however a statistically significant p 0 05 increasing cl concentrations n 20 out of 31 with δcl 0 4 to 50 8 mg l was evident from pom 2 to prm 2 period in the shallow gsa groundwater samples fig 7b enrichment in the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope values was recorded in the shallow groundwater samples n 6 out of 9 with δδ 18 o 0 1 to 0 2 and δδ 2 h 1 2 to 11 3 from pom 1 to prm 1 period fig 7b however from pom 2 to prm 2 period the majority of the samples showed a trend denoting lighter isotopic composition n 23 out of 33 with δδ 18 o 0 1 to 2 and δδ 2 h 0 7 to 11 3 coupled to only a few samples showing heavier isotopic trends n 8 out of 33 with δδ 18 o 0 1 to 1 and δδ 2 h 0 5 to 2 5 5 discussion 5 1 identification of the possible mineral phases in the shallow gsa groundwater from the calculated saturation indices values in the geochemical modeling the saturation index value or si 0 implies a supersaturation condition which indicates precipitation of mineral phases from the solution is thermodynamically favorable however precipitation of mineral phases can be inhibited by slow rates of reactions whereas si 0 indicates an undersaturation condition which suggests dissolution of mineral phases into the solution without further precipitation drever 1997 the calculated si values of the shallow groundwater samples in the present study might vary at different seasonal intervals over multiple years making the limitations of the current calculations anoxic conditions in the shallow gsa groundwater samples were detected due to their high undersaturation si 0 with respect to dissolved oxygen among the probable mineral phases the groundwater samples were found moderate to highly undersaturated si 0 with respect to mn oxy oxyhydroxide phases i e birnessite bixbyite manganite pyrochroite nsutite hausmannite pyrolusite and mg bearing phases i e huntite hydromgnesite nesquehonite epsomite artinite brucite the observations may indicate dissolution of those mineral phases in the water however fe ii rich mineral phases i e siderite and melanterite in the groundwater samples showed slightly supersaturation and undersaturation states respectively on the other hand the moderate to high supersaturation si 0 states of the fe iii oxyhydr oxide phases i e magnetite hematite goethite maghemite ferrihydrite and slightly supersaturation states si 0 of the carbonate mineral phases i e aragonite calcite siderite dolomite in the samples indicated their probable precipitation from the aqueous solution is thermodynamically favorable based on the calculated si values magnesite and rhodochrosite mineral phases in the samples showed near equilibrium states our observations matched well with the mineralogical evidence reported in the shallow aquifers across the western bengal basin nath et al 2005 seddique et al 2008 mukherjee et al 2009 biswas et al 2012 5 2 possible factors driving vertical distribution of as concentrations in the groundwater gsa bsa at shallow gsa 70 m bgl we frequently encountered groundwater zones with low dissolved total as concentrations 10 µg l who overlapping with the patchy zones containing high as concentrations 10 µg l fig 3 similar patchy occurrences of as hotspots with surrounding low as zones in the shallow groundwaters were reported in previous studies nath et al 2005 charlet et al 2007 from the adjoining area of chakdaha nadia west bengal the peak as containing groundwater samples at 19 22 m bgl of the present study was found at shallower depths compared to the depth of 30 m bgl documented in earlier reports on other areas like chakdaha north 24 parganas in west bengal and the neighboring country of bangladesh harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 fendorf et al 2010 neumann et al 2010 biswas et al 2014 fig 3 our observation indicated heterogeneity of the aquifer system in the study area in terms of sub surface sedimentary layers with variable lithology affecting the water rock interaction process under differential groundwater flow paths multiple factors were attributed to the vertical distribution of as in the groundwater as suggested in the literature harvey et al 2002 zheng et al 2004 harvey et al 2005 mukherjee and fryar 2008 van geen et al 2008 biswas et al 2014 the possible factors included a lithology and redox state of the aquifer b seasonally variable localized flow of groundwater c withdrawal practices and fluctuation in the groundwater level d source of recharge e differential flushing history of the aquifer f presence of aquifer intercalated low permeable clay peat lenses and g the extent of overlapping redox zonations however identifying the key hydrological process responsible for the vertical distribution of as in the groundwater is somewhat complex and beyond the scope of the present study further our observation of the multiple redox sensitive elemental abundances in the seasonal shallow gsa groundwater samples can provide a comprehensive insight into the mechanism of as mobilization groundwater samples from bsa with low dissolved total as concentrations 10 μg l made them a safe target for potable water the less reducing conditions in the bsa and protection of bsa by paleosol cap from the downward migration of the shallow as contaminated and doc rich water mcarthur et al 2008 biswas et al 2012 ghosal et al 2015 possibly caused the bsa groundwater samples to contain such low as concentrations the few exceptional bsa groundwater samples showed excessive as concentrations as 10 μg l those samples indicated that under specific scenarios i e mixing of organic rich pore water from adjoining clay layer lateral mixing of shallow contaminated water along the aquifer margin bsa could sustain high as mobilization ghosal et al 2015 5 3 effect of overlapping redox zonation in the shallow gsa groundwater as cycle low orp values i e negative in the shallow groundwater samples indicated prominent anoxic conditions in the aquifer low no3 availability in the shallow gsa groundwater samples further supported anoxia with minimal mixing effects from surface derived no3 sources the few shallow gsa groundwater samples recorded high no3 occurrences which suggested probable mixing of wastewater from nearby pit latrine mcarthur et al 2012 2016 or agricultural return fertilizer rich flow fig 4 humic like doc acts as an energy source for microbial reductive dissolution responsible for high as mobilization in the groundwater kulkarni et al 2018 however the correlation between dissolved total as and doc concentration in the shallow groundwater samples was missing in the present study fig 4 it showed that besides other factors dilution and mixing the net dissolved total as concentration in the shallow gsa groundwater might have undergone multiple redox controlled adsorption desorption reaction pathways after being primarily released by the microbial reduction of as v adsorbed on fe iii ooh phases in the sediments coupled to bio available doc degradation our observations of the co existence of multiple redox sensitive solutes and their wide ranges in the integrated seasonal shallow groundwaters fig 4 indicated the potential partial redox equilibrium and the occurrences of overlapping redox zones i e metal reducing sulfidic methanogenic in the shallow gsa zheng et al 2004 mukherjee and fryar 2008 mukherjee et al 2008 the eh values in the seasonal shallow gsa groundwater samples ranged between 69 and 321 mv consistent with the previous datasets reported from the study area i e 91 8 to 358 mv biswas et al 2012 based on the eh values observed in the groundwater samples the shallow grey sand aquifers were classified as post oxic berner 1981 past reports in the study area showed a prevalence of fe ii as iii species over fe iii as v species in dissolved total fe and as concentrations in the shallow gsa bhattacharya et al 1997 mcarthur et al 2001 2004 mukherjee and fryar 2008 mukherjee et al 2008 biswas et al 2014 bhowmick et al 2018 the observed pe values in the shallow gsa groundwater samples ranged between 1 2 and 5 4 which fall within the upper and lower limits of the theoretical pe values of the fe iii fe ii redox couple biswas et al 2012 mukherjee et al 2008 our observations on the pe and eh values in the shallow gsa groundwaters indicated that despite the presence of multiple competitive redox sensitive couples reduction of fe iii to fe ii might be the prominent redox driver promoting as mobilization by microbial reduction of as v coated fe iii ooh in the sediments the present observation is consistent with the interpretations of the redox state of the shallow aquifer as seen in the previous studies across the western bengal basin biswas et al 2012 mcarthur et al 2004 mukherjee and fryar 2008 mukherjee et al 2008 majority of the past studies documented correlation patterns between dissolved total as and as mobilizing solutes i e fe so4 2 mn without considering their observations repeatedly at seasonal time intervals over multiple years the observed positive correlation between the dissolved total as and fe concentration and the negative correlation between as and so4 2 concentration in the shallow gsa groundwater samples during pom 1 and prm 1 periods figure s2 further suggested the possibility of as mobilization by microbial reduction of as v coated fe iii ooh with low initial so4 2 availability in the water lacking initial so4 2 concentration limits bacterial sulfate reduction bsr and restricts the effective precipitation pathways for as removal as authigenic as fe sulfides pathak et al 2022b present observation is consistent with the past laboratory and field based reports one time monitoring in the study area and neighboring bangladesh region horneman et al 2004 mcarthur et al 2004 mukherjee and fryar 2008 however some of the shallow gsa groundwater samples registered both high mn and as concentrations figure s2 indicating the process of desorption of a part of as onto the oxidized mn phase this may occur before the step of dissolution of fe iii oxy hydroxides since mn is reduced at eh values higher than that required for fe stüben et al 2003 mukherjee and fryar 2008 however the missing correlation recorded between as fe and so4 2 concentrations in the shallow gsa groundwater samples during pom 2 and prm 2 periods figure s2 is probably due to the overlapping redox biogeochemical cycles driven by the differential seasonal hydrological conditions section 5 4 and heterogeneity of the aquifer systems the probable redox bio geochemical processes involved are a re precipitation of fe into secondary mineral phases fe ii rich following the dissimilatory reduction of as v coated fe iii oxy hydroxides while liberated as remains in the solution horneman et al 2004 our calculated si 0 values or supersaturation state for fe ii rich siderite mineral phase in the shallow gsa groundwater supported the fact b additional input of fe in the solution from the weathering of biotite mineral dowling et al 2002 and acid volatile fes phases without contributing a significant as concentration c reduction of as v coated fe iii oxy hydroxides may not be the sole host of as mobilization into the groundwater stüben et al 2003 mukherjee and fryar 2008 and d mixing of in situ doc and as rich pore water from the aquifer intercalated clay peat lenses dowling et al 2002 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 5 4 seasonal hydrological conditions during the monitoring intervals depth to groundwater levels in the shallow aquifers of the study area monitored by the central ground water board cgwb india over the 2016 2019 period was adopted here the dataset showed minimum depths or in other words maximum groundwater levels during august which coincided with the terminal phase of the southwest monsoon the water level steadily receded reaching minima at the end of the dry pre monsoon period april related to the excessive groundwater abstraction practice figure s1 previous studies from the bengal basin west bengal bangladesh reported fluctuations at depth to the groundwater levels of the shallow aquifer by up to 5 m from post monsoon to pre monsoon period harvey et al 2005 mcarthur et al 2008 to understand the impact of variable rainfall and groundwater withdrawal on the groundwater level in shallow aquifers over time we compared the available seasonal dataset pom 1 nov 16 vs prm 1 apr 17 and pom 2 dec 18 vs prm 2 apr 19 of rainfall reported by imd and depths to groundwater levels reported by cgwb in the shallow aquifers of the study area the overall groundwater levels for nov 18 and dec 18 were treated similarly in the present study as exclusive data for dec 18 was unavailable in the cgwb resources we observed that the groundwater level in the shallow aquifer of the study area was lower by 1 5 m during nov 18 compared to nov 16 probably due to poor swm rainfall during 2018 compared to 2016 fig 2a b recharge by heavy precipitation during the swm period increases the groundwater levels in the shallow aquifers during dry episodes the drawdown in the groundwater level of the shallow aquifers varies over multiple years depending on the water demand and supply from surface water reservoirs linked to rainfall the groundwater level of the study area found dropped by 2 32 1 28 m during the dry apr 17 period compared to nov 16 fig 2b however the groundwater level dropped only by 0 65 0 71 m during the apr 19 compared to nov 18 this is probably due to the less water demand during apr 19 matched with its unusual occurrences of excessive pre monsoon showers events like cyclone phethai and multiple hailstorms documented in several regional newspapers and imd regional annual reports were essential factors driving excessive pre monsoon showers and increment in the groundwater levels of the shallow aquifers to understand the effect of yearly variable seasonal hydrological conditions i e rainfall amount withdrawal on the as distribution in shallow groundwater we further monitored the seasonal trends of dissolved total as and as mobilizing redox sensitive solutes in the shallow groundwater samples collected over multiple years 5 5 seasonal pattern in dissolved as and redox sensitive solutes in shallow gsa groundwater the positive and negative δe values symbolize the increasing and decreasing seasonal trends of the element concentrations respectively from post monsoon to pre monsoon periods the present study captured the minimal seasonal variation in dissolved total as concentrations in the shallowest depth of gsa groundwater samples up to 15 m bgl fig 6 however a greater extent of seasonal deviation in groundwater as concentrations with prominent increasing and decreasing seasonal trends from post monsoon to pre monsoon period was documented at depths 15 m bgl significant δas or increasing as concentrations in the groundwater samples during the pre monsoon period were prominent in the chakdaha area where frequent occurrences of organic rich clay peat layers intercalated to the shallow aquifer sediment were traced biswas 2003 charlet et al 2007 mukherjee et al 2007a biswas et al 2012 fig 1b the observed statistically significant p 0 05 increment in dissolved total as concentrations with decreasing dissolved mn concentrations in shallow gsa groundwater samples from pom 1 to prm 1 period figs 5 and 6 indicated that reduction of mn ooh might not be primarily responsible for as mobilization contrastingly an inconclusive inter seasonal pattern was documented in fe and so4 2 concentration between the pom 1 and prm 1 period fig 6 such trends indicated their involvement in multiple redox adsorption desorption reaction pathways for as mobilization under changing redox states in the shallow aquifer however the seasonal observations documented on the redox sensitive elemental abundance between dec 18 pom 2 and apr 19 prm 2 period indicated an increasing metal reducing condition prominent during the prm 2 period compared to pom 2 period this was consistent with the observed decreasing orp values and increasing doc concentrations recorded in prm 2 period groundwater samples compared to pom 2 which further suggested increasing anoxia during prm 2 fig 6 such increasing anoxia developed in the shallow groundwater during the prm 2 period may develop overlapping redox bio geochemical reaction pathways and lead to a complex mixed inter seasonal pattern in dissolved total as concentrations as shown in the present study figs 5 and 6 it is essential to mention that decreasing so4 2 and no3 concentrations in the shallow groundwater from pom to prm period does not always imply a bacterial reduction process but may also indicate the absence of such contributing sources in a dry time the redox condition in shallow aquifers is perturbed by the variable recharge and mixing contributing to doc and groundwater withdrawal process occurring at seasonal time intervals over multiple years cheng et al 2005 van geen et al 2008 biswas et al 2014 therefore it is essential to trace the seasonal recharge pattern and investigate the sources of doc in the shallow aquifer to understand the seasonal as mobilization process 5 6 identification of the seasonal recharge sources in shallow gsa groundwater the recharge sources in shallow groundwater and its mixing over time can be traced using conservative geochemical tracers such geochemical tracers included an abundance of dissolved chloride cl and stable isotopic signature δ18o δ2h in the groundwater the observed high cl values in the shallow gsa groundwaters fig 7a indicated the possible mixing influences of recycled water from multiple sources i e sewage waste water surface derived evaporative water irrigation return water deep pond recharge leachate from surface soil aquifer intercalated clay peat lenses trapped pore water mcarthur et al 2012 2016 majumder et al 2016 2017 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 however the abundance of rainwater without any cl enrich mixing influences is likely to show low cl concentrations in the shallow groundwater since the cl concentration in rainwater is minimal 2 mg l sengupta et al 2008 mcarthur et al 2012 mixing of the recycled waters mentioned above is the potential source that can explain the observed incremental cl concentrations in the shallow groundwater samples during the pre monsoon period fig 7b such mixing processes are triggered during dry time with excessive withdrawal leading to groundwater level drawdown however unusual heavy pre monsoon shower events drive additional vertical infiltration and mixing in the shallow aquifer the cl rich recycled waters carry overlapping cl signatures in the shallow groundwater therefore it is difficult to distinguish them solely based on the cl tracer and requires simultaneous monitoring of the stable isotope ratios in the seasonal groundwater samples isotopic enrichment in the shallow gsa groundwater samples documented during the pre monsoon periods fig 7b probably captured the signature of evaporative transformation during infiltration or mixing of evaporative surface water mainly from the bottom of the natural surface water body i e pond lake either way unusual pre monsoon shower events like the phethai cyclone hailstorms and depressions were documented in the study area before the prm 2 period apr 19 fig 2b cyclonic hailstorm event driven rainfall may preferentially introduce direct rainwater or rain fed surface water with a typical lighter isotopic composition into the shallow aquifer as evident in this study fig 7b such lighter isotope values were seen in a few cyclonic rainwater samples collected during an extended work of the present study where the δ18o values ranged between 4 3 and 14 2 pathak et al 2022a however other short term surface derived or in situ recharge mixing influences can also contribute to and allow explanation of such seasonal trends in the shallow aquifers further detailed study at higher resolution observations will be required to resolve the puzzle 5 7 δ13c oc as an indicator of organic source in shallow gsa groundwater in shallow groundwater dissolved organic carbon doc is commonly sourced by in situ aquifer sediment and is often surface derived the surface derived organic sources include pond bottom humic like sedimentary organic matter som near surface som rich in plant debris dissolved organics from pond base infiltration deep pond water and river water representing riverbank infiltration the present study identified the possible surface derived organic sources in the shallow aquifer by studying their δ13c oc signatures and quantifying their contributions the shallow aquifer 70 m bgl sedimentary organic carbon dataset δ13c soc from the adjoining region was adopted from the literature mcarthur et al 2004 and compared with the present shallow gsa groundwater δ13c doc composition we observed comparatively heavier organic carbon isotopic composition in the aquifer sediment 22 8 1 7 mcarthur et al 2004 near surface sediment 23 6 1 8 and hugli river water 22 5 1 4 fig 8 however lighter organic carbon isotopic composition was documented in pond bottom sediments 27 2 1 4 and deep pond water 26 4 1 1 the δ13c doc composition of the shallow gsa groundwater samples varied widely between 19 1 and 26 with an average of 24 3 2 0 that can be explained by the process of mixing of both heavier aquifer som near surface som and river water doc and lighter organic contributions deep pond water derived labile doc based on the observation of δ13c oc signatures in the probable organic sources and shallow gsa groundwater samples and applying the mass conservative approach a binary end member mixing model was performed to estimate the contributions we documented a total of 38 contribution of deep pond water derived fresh labile organic carbon into the shallow gsa groundwater with an uncertainty calculated of 0 8 following the standard error propagation method fig 8 the present observation supports the presence of fresh labile organic matter traces in the shallow groundwater of the study region as reported previously lawson et al 2013 infiltration of evaporative and labile organic rich deep pond water into the shallow aquifer can be a crucial factor responsible for high as mobilization 10 μg l by promoting anoxia and anaerobic microbial activities the limitation of the present mixing calculation was that it was based on the dataset comprising only one seasonal time interval apr 19 which might vary when different seasonal observations over multiple years would be considered restriction in the number of samples monitored in this study for assigning the average end member isotopic composition could be another limitation of this mixing model 5 8 probable role of mixing of clay pocket trapped pore water driving seasonal distribution of as in the groundwater an increment in dissolved total as concentrations in a few groundwater samples extracted from less reducing bsa during the prm period could be due to the lateral mixing of doc and as rich water from the overlying shallow aquifer along the aquifer margin mcarthur et al 2008 ghosal et al 2015 alternatively incorporating organic rich pore water from the aquifer proximal thick clay peat layer may supply excess doc for high as mobilization in the groundwater erban et al 2013 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 we compared the site specific sub surface lithological profiles containing gw17 and gw18 samples vs other bsa groundwater samples to address the responsible factor it was apparent that bsa for gw17 and gw18 samples litholog marked as d in fig 1b was overlain by a 26 m thick grey sticky clay layer referred to as grey plastic clay in fig 1b and followed by a 4 5 m thick brown clay or paleosol layer however in other samples bsa lithologs marked as b and c in fig 1b were overlain by a much thinner 3 m thickness grey bluish sticky clay layer followed by a 3 m thick paleosol layer such sedimentary clay deposits were the product of transgression during the geological evolution of the bengal basin and were documented as organic rich in the literature mcarthur et al 2004 from the current observations we suggested that the thicker organic rich clay layer adjacent to bsa may contribute excess doc by advective diffusive mixing of clay pore water responsible for high as release in the groundwater such pore water mixing would be prominent during dry periods due to excessive irrigation pumping practices and the tendency of compaction in the aquifer intercalated clay pockets another groundwater sample gw5 from shallow gsa 47 5 m bgl registered an excess so4 2 25 9 52 9 mg l and cl concentrations 52 5 109 5 mg l with high as concentrations 10 37 μg l and overall reducing nature orp values 67 to 97 mv which was rather unlikely at such depths fig 4 the same groundwater sample showed consistent incremental as concentrations and enrichment in stable isotope values during pre monsoon periods than post monsoon periods over the monitoring intervals this was difficult to explain without invoking the possible in situ mixing of heavier water rich in doc so4 2 and cl from the pore spaces of the aquifer intercalated clay peat lenses a 1 5 m thick peat layer refer to litholog marked as a in fig 1b overlying the gsa containing gw5 water supported our interpretation either way a preferential heavier groundwater flow containing wastewater signature can also generate a similar composition 5 9 possible redox driver for seasonal as mobilization in the shallow gsa groundwater to capture the possible redox driver causing seasonal variability in dissolved total as concentrations in the shallow groundwater we applied a comprehensive multi proxy approach by investigating the recharge pattern source of doc and redox conditions in the groundwater samples collected at seasonal time intervals over multiple years our present observations showed that the redox state in shallow aquifers varies from pom to prm period over different years depending on the variable seasonal rainfall and groundwater withdrawal practice that drives surface derived recharge carrying doc for as mobilization in a year with negligible pre monsoon rainfall referred to as prm 1 our observation recorded a higher drop in the groundwater level of the shallow aquifer probably due to excess water withdrawal the process promoted organic rich evaporative surface water infiltration from the base of nearby natural water bodies pond lake river into the shallow aquifer such evaporative water infiltration was evident by the water isotope enrichment in the shallow groundwaters measured for prm 1 collection mixing of deep pondwater introduces fresh labile organic matter that may trigger high as mobilization in the shallow aquifer during prm 1 a significant increasing trend in dissolved total as concentrations in the shallow gsa groundwater samples during the prm 1 period than pom 1 period supported our hypothesis the study area hosts abandoned palaeo channels natural water bodies and oxbow lakes which are important recharge sources to the shallow aquifers during dry periods a previous study from the adjacent chakdaha gotera village area showed high as concentrations in shallow groundwater promoted by the pond water recharge found in an abandoned river channel desbarats et al 2014 consistent with the present study on the other hand a statistically significant p 0 05 increasing reducing condition or anoxia was prominently detected in the shallow aquifer during prm 2 period compared to the pom 2 period the inducing anoxic condition may drive multiple overlapping metal reducing bio geochemical processes that can perturb the as cycle and result in complex inter seasonal patterns in dissolved total as concentrations in the shallow groundwater recharge by the unusual heavy pre monsoon shower events documented before the prm 2 period were held responsible behind this the minimal draw down in the groundwater levels and signature of lighter isotopes in the shallow groundwater samples during the prm 2 apr 19 period supported our hypothesis lighter rain fed surface water recharge containing labile organic matter into the shallow aquifer may develop anoxia however the redox state in the shallow aquifers is dynamic therefore it may have complex simultaneous influences acting as potential redox drivers for seasonal as mobilization an alternative in situ process that can explain the variation in groundwater composition at seasonal time intervals irrespective of the depth variable is the incorporation of organic rich pore water derived from the aquifer intercalated clay peat sedimentary lenses layers such clay peat lenses trapped in pore water in the bengal basin have been documented to be rich with organics cl so4 2 and heavier in isotopic composition sikdar et al 2001 mukherjee and fryar 2008 planer friedrich et al 2012 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 however the isotopic composition of clay pore water dataset adopted from the literature of the bangladesh region was documented to be much lighter than expected having a marine origin 0 pathak et al 2022a the δ13c doc composition of the clay pore water in the shallow aquifers closely resembled the present deep pond water δ13c doc composition fig 8 suggesting a probable similar origin for both pathak et al 2022a massive groundwater extraction during dry periods causes a change in the storage volume of the aquifer planer friedrich et al 2012 the process drives compaction on the aquifer intercalated clay peat lenses and causes the expulsion of pore water rich in organics mixing of organic rich clay peat trapped pore water in the adjoining groundwater may promote anaerobic microbial activities and trigger high as mobilization pathak et al 2022a our present observations on the shallow gsa gw 5 and a few bsa groundwater samples further supported our conjecture our preliminary estimation of the radar los land surface displacement around the study area using the adinsar technique reached up to 10 4 mm during the monitoring period 2017 2020 corresponding to a 12 5 mm land subsidence with a 3 3 mm yr rate pathak et al 2022a our estimation of a probable ongoing regional land subsidence partially supported our clay peat pocket squeezing effect and pore water mixing argument however a further detailed investigation is required to validate our current conjecture 6 conclusion this study highlights the interconnected roles of multiple factors driving seasonal variation in as release in the shallow aquifer between the post monsoon and pre monsoon periods over 2016 2019 we analyzed groundwater samples from the shallow reducing grey sand aquifers gsa and a few samples from less reducing brown sand aquifers bsa that showed distinct seasonal variation patterns in the dissolved total as concentrations over multiple years unlike previous findings our current observations documented significantly elevated dissolved total as concentrations in the groundwaters originating from shallow gsa during the pre monsoon periods than the post monsoon time however the magnitude of the seasonal changes in the groundwater as concentrations varied over multiple years due mainly to the differential hydrological conditions i e rainfall groundwater withdrawal surface water infiltration mixing in contrast limited groundwater samples from less reducing brown sand aquifer bsa showed an overall low dissolved total as concentrations 10 μg l without noticeable inter seasonal patterns however a few groundwater samples from bsa showed an increment in the dissolved total as concentrations during the pre monsoon period which is probably linked to the interaction of water with the adjoining lithology this study documented contrasting inter seasonal patterns in dissolved redox sensitive solutes and their correlation patterns in the shallow gsa groundwater samples over multiple years due to variable hydrological conditions our observations suggested that the responsible factor is the dynamic redox state in the shallow aquifers subjected to the seasonally erratic rainfall surface derived recharge mixing and excess withdrawal practices excessive pumping during dry time caused a drop in the local groundwater level providing a likely conduit for the infiltration of evaporative anoxic organic rich surface water from the bases of ponds into the shallow aquifer the process triggered high as mobilization in the shallow groundwater by enhancing anaerobic microbial activity such mixing effect in the shallow groundwater was prominent during an entire dry pre monsoon period prm 1 or apr 17 supported by the significant increment in the dissolved total as concentrations during the prm 1 time based on a single pre monsoon time observation apr 19 and δ13c oc tracer we estimated a total 38 2 0 8 contribution of deep pond water derived labile organic matter in the shallow groundwater either way recharge by the unusual heavy pre monsoon shower events during prm 2 or apr 19 may trigger overlapping redox bio geochemical cycles into the shallow aquifer the process might cause the dissolved total as concentrations in the shallow aquifer to undergo several adsorption desorption reaction pathways resulting in a complex mixed inter seasonal pattern as evident in the present study from pom 2 to prm 2 period additionally the in situ mixing influence of aquifer intercalated clay peat lenses trapped pore water organic rich in the adjoining groundwater solute chemistry and as release during the dry pre monsoon period was tentatively detected in this study the probable process involved compaction or squeezing of aquifer intercalated clay peat layers driven by the excessive groundwater withdrawal for irrigation and draw down during dry periods the process may trigger local land subsidence as preliminarily documented in the present study area such clay peat lenses trapped organic rich pore water mixing can be a viable alternative as a redox driver for as mobilization in the groundwater irrespective of the aquifer depths active during the dry pre monsoon period however further investigation is required on the speciation study of redox sensitive elements in the shallow groundwater to improve our understanding of the redox driver responsible for the seasonal as mobilization credit authorship contribution statement pousali pathak conceptualization methodology formal analysis data curation investigation visualization

3010,arsenic as mobilization in groundwater is linked to the dissimilatory reductive dissolution of as v coated fe iii oxy hydroxides from the aquifer sediment coupled with the degradation of available dissolved organic carbon doc due to the presence of anaerobic microbes under anoxic conditions understanding the seasonal pattern of as mobilization in the shallow groundwater of the bengal basin remains a challenging task due to the heterogeneous character of the shallow aquifers and the involvement of multiple factors to resolve this issue in the present study we showcased a comprehensive effort to advance understanding of the seasonal as mobilization process in the shallow groundwater utilizing multiple geochemical tracers i e the abundance of dissolved total as fe mn no3 so4 2 doc cl and δ18o δ2h δ13c doc isotopic tracers between post monsoon and pre monsoon periods over multiple years from nadia district west bengal india we quantified and explained the seasonal variation of dissolved total as concentrations in the groundwaters with the nature of the aquifer lithology i e grey sand aquifer or gsa and brown sand aquifer or bsa the present study reported elevated dissolved total as concentrations in the shallow groundwater samples during dry pre monsoon prm periods compared to post monsoon pom time however the magnitude of such seasonal changes in groundwater as concentrations denoted as δas as prm as pom varied between years depending on the extent of rainfall surface water infiltration mixing and groundwater withdrawal our current findings are different from the past studies that reported elevated as concentrations in the shallow groundwater during the monsoon and post monsoon periods compared to the dry pre monsoon periods however the limitations of the past findings are that most of the previous studies were carried out between seasonal intervals over a single annual cycle without reinvestigating the seasonal trends over different years under variable hydrological conditions we proposed that the excess groundwater withdrawal during the dry pre monsoon period drive draw down and therefore trigger infiltration of surface derived deep pond water into the shallow aquifer such surface water infiltration introduces fresh labile organic matter into the shallow aquifer promoting high as mobilization during the dry pre monsoon period a viable alternative approach of squeezing of aquifer intercalated clay peat sedimentary lenses and mixing of organic rich pore water in the adjoining groundwater can also enhance high as mobilization during the dry time as examined in this study this process is triggered by the excessive groundwater withdrawal practices and drawdown encountered during dry time driving the aquifer intercalated clay pockets compaction keywords arsenic seasonal deep pond water groundwater dissolved organic carbon redox state 1 introduction high as concentrations 10 µg l permissible guideline

et al 2012 chatterjee et al 2013 biswas et al 2014 frequent patterns of seasonal variations in as concentrations are documented mainly in the shallow gsa groundwaters of the bengal basin cheng et al 2005 savarimuthu et al 2006 planer friedrich et al 2012 biswas et al 2014 majumder et al 2016 2017 in contrast the brown sand aquifers bsa at depths 35 70 m bgl provide nearly as free groundwater 10 µg l as mcarthur et al 2008 ghosal et al 2015 arsenic is commonly found in as v sorbed on the surfaces of fe iii oxy hydroxide phases in the fine sand grains and silty clay rich sediments of the bengal basin which is characterized by the high organic contents bhattacharya et al 1997 nickson et al 1998 mcarthur et al 2001 dowling et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 these sediments were part of palaeo ganges river flood delta plain sedimentation events and were strongly influenced by sea level fluctuations during the quaternary periods acharyya et al 2000 the principle mechanisms involved in as mobilization from these sediments include dissimilatory reductive dissolution of as v coated fe iii oxy hydroxides liberating as iii and fe ii in the presence of microbes that facilitate consumption of bioavailable dissolved organic carbon doc in the groundwater for growth and metabolism doc in groundwater actively participates during as mobilization process as energy source for microbes and can originate from multiple sources such as aquifer intercalated organic rich clay peat lenses mcarthur et al 2001 2004 sengupta et al 2008 datta et al 2011 and the natural surface water bodies ponds rivers lakes that are rich in fresh labile organic matter harvey et al 2002 neumann et al 2010 lawson et al 2013 seasonal variation in as concentrations in the shallow groundwater of the bengal basin is documented highly heterogeneous due to the involvement of multiple factors including variable rainfall surface water recharge mixing groundwater withdrawal aquifer redox state and local lithology cheng et al 2005 savarimuthu et al 2006 planer friedrich et al 2012 biswas et al 2014 majumder et al 2016 2017 however the subject remains poorly addressed due to the lack of comprehensive knowledge on the interconnected roles of multiple factors driving as distribution over time in the shallow groundwaters of the bengal basin therefore an advanced understanding of this topic is needed to identify the potential causes of excessive as in the shallow groundwater and its seasonal fluctuations to better manage the groundwater resources the south west monsoon swm rainfall june through september which accounts for 82 of the annual rainfall over india significantly recharges the shallow aquifers of the bengal basin mukherjee et al 2007b the time interval between october and may is designated as the dry period when the freshwater abundance due to the interplay of the meteorological parameters is less prominent and the demand is high for the groundwater the dry period is further divided into three periods post monsoon october december winter january february and pre monsoon march may after the swm the groundwater level remains high in the post monsoon period due to the monsoon recharge effect however during the pre monsoon period the groundwater level recedes maximum due to excessive abstraction practices for irrigation and drinking purposes pre monsoon showers norwester or locally known as kalbaisakhi and rainfall due to cyclonic activities account for 18 of the annual precipitation over india mukherjee et al 2007a b such rain provides occasional hydrological input to the shallow aquifers during dry periods by percolation through unsaturated soil and sedimentary desiccation features like mud cracks in dry periods groundwater provides the only potential water resource 50 60 from shallow aquifers essentially meeting the agricultural demand sikdar et al 2018 excessive groundwater abstraction during dry periods causes a sharp drop in the local groundwater level of the shallow aquifers harvey et al 2002 neumann et al 2010 lawson et al 2013 biswas et al 2014 mukherjee et al 2018 which generates local depression zones in the groundwater levels sikdar et al 2018 the drawdown in the groundwater level of the shallow aquifer is often compensated by the a infiltration of organic rich surface water from the base of ponds lakes and rivers harvey et al 2002 neumann et al 2010 lawson et al 2013 mukherjee et al 2018 or b mixing of organic rich pore water from the adjoining intercalated clay pockets mixing of such organic rich water into the shallow aquifer is likely to trigger anoxic conditions and higher as mobilization by driving the anaerobic microbial activity there has been evidence of land subsidence in the adjoining areas of the bengal basin due to the compaction of sub surface fine grained sedimentary strata by excessive pumping sahu and sikdar 2011 planer friedrich et al 2012 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 pathak et al 2022a seasonal changes in the storage volume of the shallow aquifers occur due to the cycles of monsoonal recharge and dry time groundwater abstraction planer friedrich et al 2012 the process generates an expansion and squeezing effect in the aquifer intercalated clay peat layers which may perturb the sub surface aqueous chemistry by expulsion and mixing of the organic rich pore water approximately 20 mixing of organic rich pore water derived from the squeezing of aquifer intercalated clay pockets caused high as release via excess supply of doc to the adjoining groundwater mihajlov et al 2020 a variable temporal pattern of dissolved total as concentration in the shallow groundwater has been explained based on the seasonal recharge cycles multiple studies registered higher dissolved total as concentrations in shallow groundwater during the wet periods compared to the dry periods in an annual cycle cheng et al 2005 savarimuthu et al 2006 planer friedrich et al 2012 biswas et al 2014 majumder et al 2016 2017 such an observation is commonly attributed to the monsoonal recharge bringing anoxia either through the inflow of doc or saturation of sediment pore spaces conducive for high as release in contrast government agencies like central ground water board cgwb and other studies cheng et al 2005 biswas et al 2014 reported elevated dissolved total as concentrations in the shallow groundwater during dry periods compared to the wet period the possible dilution effect in the shallow groundwater during the wet time due to the mixing of rainwater and surface runoff as input can explain such temporal distribution of dissolved total as concentrations in addition the introduction of organic rich anoxic water from the bottom of the natural surface water bodies into the shallow aquifer during the dry period facilitated by excess groundwater withdrawal can lead to high as mobilization the majority of the past studies reporting heterogeneous as distribution in the shallow groundwater over time were conducted between seasonal time intervals over only an annual cycle therefore repeated seasonal observations on the same set of bore wells over multiple years are required to understand better the seasonal as mobilization process in the shallow groundwater under variable hydrological conditions in yearly cycles a comprehensive effort to monitor the seasonal as trends in the shallow groundwater mid screen depth 70 m bgl over multiple years 2016 2019 was carried out in this study to address the interconnected roles of multiple factors responsible for as release in this study the groundwater sampling was done from one of the as hot spot regions of the bengal basin situated in the nadia district west bengal india we focused our observations between the post monsoon and pre monsoon periods coinciding with the period of maximum abstraction of shallow groundwater our current objectivity focused on a quantitative understanding of the source of recharge water contributing to labile organic matter and responsible for high as mobilization in the shallow groundwater at the seasonal time intervals by inducing anaerobic microbial activity for this purpose we measured the abundance of conservative solute dissolved cl and stable isotopic ratios δ18o δ2h in the seasonal shallow groundwater samples along with δ13c doc signatures in the groundwater for a better understanding of the active redox biogeochemical processes responsible for the seasonal release of as in the shallow aquifer we simultaneously measured multiple dissolved redox sensitive solutes and redox parameter i e dissolved total as fe mn so4 2 no3 doc concentration oxidation reduction potential orp value with emphasis on their seasonal patterns 2 study area the field area 48 km2 in haringhata and chakdaha blocks nadia district west bengal fig 1 a selected in the present study has received significant attention due to excess as concentrations in the shallow groundwaters inspected for over 30 years it falls under the gangetic alluvial plain and belongs to the sonar bangla aquifer mukherjee et al 2007a elevation 0 20 m above msl in proximity to the hooghly river also known as hugli river groundwater modeling over the study region showed a topographic control on the groundwater flow suggesting flow direction from the north west to the south east mukherjee et al 2007a sikdar et al 2018 as seen before the onset of excessive irrigation pumping for the green revolution of the 1970s due to excessive pumping practices the regional groundwater flow system has been replaced by several local to intermediate scale flow systems with a tendency to generate seasonal troughs or cones of depression around the pumping centers desbarats et al 2014 this has caused a drop in the local groundwater levels during dry periods with a maximum drop detected at the end of the dry pre monsoon period mainly in april figure s1 the draw down in the groundwater level of the shallow aquifers triggers localized surface water infiltration from the base of natural surface water bodies such as ponds lakes and rivers harvey et al 2002 mukherjee et al 2007a lawson et al 2008 neumann et al 2010 lawson et al 2013 biswas et al 2014 kulkarni et al 2018 the study region recorded anisotropy in aquifer hydraulic conductivities which is featured with high horizontal hydraulic conductivity 20 m day compared to low vertical hydraulic conductivity 0 0016 m day in certain areas mukherjee 2006 sikdar et al 2018 this suggests the possibility of predominant lateral transport along the regional groundwater flow path even at the seasonal timescale the shallow aquifer in the study region is frequently capped by a 3 m thick weathered silt clay layer termed surface soil sporadic sand silt pockets in the surface soil layer in the region métral et al 2008 allow enhanced localized vertical infiltration into the shallow aquifer the primary shallow aquifer types of the study area comprise buried palaeo channel sedimentary sequences of mostly holocene age the shallow aquifer includes reduced grey fine to medium grained sand with silt clay intercalations up to 70 m depth ghosal et al 2015 at 35 38 m bgl up to 70 m bgl depths in the study area lie the oxidized palaeo interfluvial sedimentary sequences comprising brown sands of pre lgm age and capped by a thick lgm palaeosol layer mcarthur et al 2008 ghosal et al 2015 frequent thin films of clay and randomly oriented peat layers rich in organics are inter bedded in the shallow grey sand aquifers biswas 2003 charlet et al 2007 métral et al 2008 ghosal et al 2015 fig 1b such intercalated clay peat lenses prohibit inter aquifer mixing along the groundwater flow paths however where such low permeable lenses are absent or thinned down mixing is promoted in the aquifer mukherjee and fryar 2008 mcarthur et al 2016 3 materials and methods here we monitored bore well waters tapping the shallow gsa mid screen depths 70 m bgl and bsa mid screen depths 35 70 m bgl the groundwater sampling from shallow gsa included n 11 bore wells each during nov 16 apr 17 feb 18 and may 18 n 35 bore wells each during dec 18 and apr 19 time periods however the groundwater sampling from bsa included n 6 bore wells each during nov 16 and apr 17 n 1 bore well each during dec 18 and apr 19 period fig 1a we provided a comparative overview of seasonal observations on groundwater chemical composition during post monsoon periods pom i e nov 16 as pom 1 dec 18 as pom 2 and pre monsoon periods prm i e apr 17 as prm 1 apr 19 as prm 2 for multiple years 2016 2019 during this period we resampled several bore wells which were earlier studied for understanding the sub surface lithological profiling and spatial distribution of dissolved total as concentrations mukherjee et al 2007a mukherjee and fryar 2008 hoque et al 2012 ghosal et al 2015 mcarthur et al 2016 this provided an opportunity to compare observations from the previous studies and present a map of temporal data with higher confidence the lithological profiles near our current sampling sites fig 1b provided a comprehensive idea of the sub surface lithology of the study area availability of doc in the aquifer is one of the key component for as mobilization responsible for generating the required anoxic conditions by triggering anaerobic microbial activity in the as containing groundwater the potential source of doc and its contribution can be traced and estimated using a mass balance approach including the stable δ13c doc isotopic signature zhou et al 2018 stopelli et al 2021 pathak et al 2022a to address this we analyzed the sedimentary and dissolved organic carbon isotopic signatures δ13c oc in the possible in situ i e shallow aquifer sediment and ex situ i e river water deep pond water pond bottom sediment near surface sediment organic contributing sources along with the shallow gsa groundwater samples we sampled shallow bore well waters n 28 70 m bgl bore well adjacent surface soil layers within 15 cm bgl n 28 few pond bottom sediments n 9 deep pond waters n 5 and hugli river waters n 11 once during the pre monsoon time over the monitoring period apr 19 fig 1a deep pond water samples were collected manually from different locations by lowering the sampler to the deepest part of the pond just above the sediment water interface similarly pond bottom sediments were collected from the bases of the ponds hugli river water samples were collected similarly by lowering the sampler to the deeper part of the river from the kanchrapara site north 24 parganas west bengal the carbon isotopic composition of shallow aquifer sedimentary organic matter is adopted from the literature data of the adjacent region of north 24 parganas west bengal mcarthur et al 2004 for our purpose to understand the source of recharge water contributing to doc in the shallow aquifer at seasonal time intervals we measured simultaneously the abundance of conservative solute dissolved cl and stable isotopic signatures δ18o and δ2h in the seasonal shallow gsa groundwater samples further to capture the active redox biogeochemical processes in the shallow aquifer driven by the organic rich water infiltration mixing responsible for seasonal as release we studied the abundance of multiple redox sensitive solutes and redox parameter dissolved total as fe mn so4 2 no3 doc concentration orp value in the seasonal shallow gsa groundwater samples our approach of investigation matches well with the past studies with similar research goals cheng et al 2005 savarimuthu et al 2006 planer friedrich et al 2012 biswas et al 2014 majumder et al 2016 2017 zhou et al 2018 stopelli et al 2021 pathak et al 2022a however the lack of a comprehensive effort to study multiple factors driving seasonal as mobilization in the shallow groundwater by monitoring over multiple years for an advanced understanding of the interconnected roles motivated the present study the detailed methodologies including sampling protocol analytical technique and analytical uncertainty of the measurement are provided in supplementary information we introduced a new index big delta δ to estimate the seasonal deviation in groundwater composition collected during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons we compared here the groundwater composition of apr 17 prm 1 with nov 16 pom 1 period and apr 19 prm 2 with dec 18 pom 2 period seasonal changes in the composition of the depth bound groundwater samples were estimated using the formula δe eprm epom where e dissolved total as fe mn so4 2 no3 doc cl concentration δ18o δ2h isotopic ratio and orp value a paired sample t test at 95 confidence interval for the difference between seasonal means was carried out to evaluate the statistical significance of the observed seasonal patterns in the shallow groundwater composition the observed orp values in the shallow gsa groundwater samples during the field were later corrected with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode for eh pe pe 16 9 eh at 25 values were calculated from the eh values of the groundwater samples saturation index si is defined as si log iap kt 1 where iap is the ion activity product and kt is the equilibrium solubility constant of a phase at ambient temperature in the present study using phreeqc interactive 3 3 7 11094 software parkhurst and appelo 2013 with thermodynamic values of phases from the databases of wateq4f we calculated the saturation indices si of the possible mineral phases in the shallow gsa groundwater samples n 11 70 m bgl here we used the groundwater samples collected during the prm 1 apr 17 period when the maximum dissolved total as concentrations were documented over the monitoring intervals for si calculation the input dataset included temperature ph and concentrations of cations and anions in the groundwater samples bore well water samples retrieved from the bsa

shallow groundwater samples during the present study are provided in the supporting data table 1 to table 6 in supplementary information 4 results 4 1 vertical distribution pattern of as and as mobilizing solutes in groundwater the vertical distribution pattern of dissolved total as concentrations in the integrated seasonal groundwater samples mid screen depths 4 70 m bgl over multiple years was compared with the adjoining lithological characteristics of the aquifers the groundwater samples in the present study from mid screen depths 70 m bgl mainly originated from the shallow gsa and a few groundwater samples from mid screen depths of 39 6 51 8 m bgl represented bsa dissolved total as concentrations in the shallow gsa groundwater samples showed a pattern featuring an overall increase with depths the peak as concentrations were noticed at 19 to 22 m bgl depth intervals during multiple years of seasonal observations fig 3 at 19 5 m bgl depth maximum as concentrations documented were 72 µg l in pom 1 november 16 and 140 µg l in prm 1 april 17 at 21 3 m bgl depth maximum as concentrations were 94 µg l in pom 2 december 18 and 66 µg l in prm 2 april 19 periods at specific locations similar high as concentrations 58 µg l in pom 1 and 130 µg l in prm 1 were recorded at 35 m bgl depth groundwater samples n 7 of the bsa showed an overall low dissolved total as concentrations 10 µg l who during both post and pre monsoon seasons due to low as concentrations in the bsa groundwater these samples were excluded for subsequent analysis on the redox sensitive as mobilizing solutes however there were two bsa groundwater samples i e gw17 and gw18 where excess as concentrations during prm time were detected 12 µg l and 25 µg l respectively fig 3 integrated seasonal groundwater samples of multiple years in the shallow gsa showed a large distribution in dissolved total as 1 to 140 µg l fe 0 4 to 22 8 mg l mn 25 5 to 908 µg l and so4 2 0 001 to 55 6 mg l concentrations under variable ranges of oxidation reduction potential values from oxic at 70 mv to reducing at 136 mv fig 4 low no3 concentrations i e 0 001 to 3 mg l were detected in most shallow gsa groundwater samples however with few samples recorded excessive no3 occurrences i e 5 to 20 9 mg l dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations in a few shallow gsa groundwater samples n 7 were measured twice dec 18 and apr 19 over the monitoring period and the values ranged between 3 7 and 7 7 mg l fig 4 there was no apparent correlation documented between doc and dissolved total as concentrations in the shallow groundwater samples except gw20 registering both higher as and doc concentrations in the present study a positive correlation r 0 6 to 0 7 was documented between dissolved total as and fe concentrations in the shallow gsa groundwater samples during the pom 1 nov 16 and prm 1 apr 17 periods figure s2 the samples showed a negative correlation between dissolved total as and so4 2 concentrations r 0 7 and a weaker negative correlation between as and mn concentrations r 0 4 over the same time intervals however such correlations were absent in the shallow gsa groundwater samples during pom 2 dec 18 and prm 2 apr 19 periods additionally the seasonal groundwater samples in shallow gsa showing maximum as concentrations during nov 16 and apr 17 periods defined as peak as 1 correlated with maximum fe concentrations 11 2 mg l and 10 2 mg l respectively and below detection level so4 2 concentrations 0 001 mg l fig 4 however the shallow gsa groundwater samples for the dec 18 and apr 19 periods registering the highest as concentrations defined as peak as 2 were found to correlate with low fe concentrations 0 7 mg l and 1 1 mg l respectively medium so4 2 concentrations 9 4 mg l and 4 6 mg l respectively and higher orp values 3 mv and 6 mv respectively the conservative tracers i e cl concentrations 2 mg l to 152 5 mg l and δ18o 1 6 to 7 0 δ2h 15 7 to 48 1 isotope values in the seasonal shallow gsa groundwater samples also showed wide distributions fig 7a the shallow gsa groundwater samples showed si 0 values with respect to dissolved oxygen mn oxy hydroxides and mg bearing mineral phases the samples showed si 0 and si 0 values with respect to fe iii oxy hydroxide and carbonate mineral phases respectively magnesite and rhodochrosite mineral phases in the samples showed mean si values 0 07 and 0 03 respectively supporting data table 6 in supplementary information listed the calculated si values for some of the essential mineral phases that are thought to affect the shallow groundwater ionic chemistry in the study area 4 2 seasonal trends in as and as mobilizing solutes in groundwater a statistically significant p 0 05 increment in dissolved total as concentrations n 8 out of 9 with δas 4 to 72 µg l was documented in shallow gsa groundwater samples from nov 16 pom 1 to apr 17 prm 1 period figs 5 and 6 these set of seasonal samples showed significantly decreasing dissolved mn concentrations n 5 out of 8 with δmn 29 2 to 143 8 µg l from pom 1 to prm 1 period in contrast a complex and mixed inter seasonal pattern was documented in dissolved total fe n 6 with δfe 0 6 to 2 5 mg l and n 2 with δfe 0 9 mg l and so4 2 concentrations n 3 with so4 2 concentrations at 0 001 mg l n 2 with δso4 2 0 7 to 9 6 mg l and n 4 with δso4 2 0 4 to 7 6 mg l in the same groundwater samples from pom 1 to prm 1 period fig 6 the majority of the observations from other years comprising two seasons i e from dec 18 pom 2 to apr 19 prm 2 period captured an increasing dissolved total fe n 20 out of 34 with δfe 0 5 to 12 4 mg l and mn concentrations n 26 out of 34 with δmn 4 to 540 µg l with decreasing so4 2 n 21 out of 30 with δso4 2 3 1 to 37 1 mg l n 3 with so4 2 remaining at 0 001 mg l and no3 concentrations n 26 with δno3 2 2 to 17 7 mg l having statistically significant p 0 05 dependency the samples showed tentative p 0 05 decreasing orp values n 19 out of 31 with δorp 2 to 67 mv and increasing doc concentrations n 4 out of 7 with δdoc 0 6 to 1 3 mg l in prm 2 period compared to pom 2 period fig 6 however the samples showed a complex mixed inter seasonal pattern in dissolved total as concentrations n 16 with δas 2 31 µg l n 9 with δas 2 28 µg l and n 9 with inter seasonal shift within the analytical uncertainty of as measurement from pom 2 to prm 2 period figs 5 and 6 the majority of groundwater samples from bsa n 7 showed insignificant inter seasonal changes in the dissolved total as concentrations except two samples gw17 and gw18 registering an increment in as concentrations δas 8 and 16 µg l during prm 1 period compared to pom 1 period fig 5 we observed no clear inter seasonal pattern in dissolved cl concentrations from the pom 1 to prm 1 period however a statistically significant p 0 05 increasing cl concentrations n 20 out of 31 with δcl 0 4 to 50 8 mg l was evident from pom 2 to prm 2 period in the shallow gsa groundwater samples fig 7b enrichment in the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope values was recorded in the shallow groundwater samples n 6 out of 9 with δδ 18 o 0 1 to 0 2 and δδ 2 h 1 2 to 11 3 from pom 1 to prm 1 period fig 7b however from pom 2 to prm 2 period the majority of the samples showed a trend denoting lighter isotopic composition n 23 out of 33 with δδ 18 o 0 1 to 2 and δδ 2 h 0 7 to 11 3 coupled to only a few samples showing heavier isotopic trends n 8 out of 33 with δδ 18 o 0 1 to 1 and δδ 2 h 0 5 to 2 5 5 discussion 5 1 identification of the possible mineral phases in the shallow gsa groundwater from the calculated saturation indices values in the geochemical modeling the saturation index value or si 0 implies a supersaturation condition which indicates precipitation of mineral phases from the solution is thermodynamically favorable however precipitation of mineral phases can be inhibited by slow rates of reactions whereas si 0 indicates an undersaturation condition which suggests dissolution of mineral phases into the solution without further precipitation drever 1997 the calculated si values of the shallow groundwater samples in the present study might vary at different seasonal intervals over multiple years making the limitations of the current calculations anoxic conditions in the shallow gsa groundwater samples were detected due to their high undersaturation si 0 with respect to dissolved oxygen among the probable mineral phases the groundwater samples were found moderate to highly undersaturated si 0 with respect to mn oxy oxyhydroxide phases i e birnessite bixbyite manganite pyrochroite nsutite hausmannite pyrolusite and mg bearing phases i e huntite hydromgnesite nesquehonite epsomite artinite brucite the observations may indicate dissolution of those mineral phases in the water however fe ii rich mineral phases i e siderite and melanterite in the groundwater samples showed slightly supersaturation and undersaturation states respectively on the other hand the moderate to high supersaturation si 0 states of the fe iii oxyhydr oxide phases i e magnetite hematite goethite maghemite ferrihydrite and slightly supersaturation states si 0 of the carbonate mineral phases i e aragonite calcite siderite dolomite in the samples indicated their probable precipitation from the aqueous solution is thermodynamically favorable based on the calculated si values magnesite and rhodochrosite mineral phases in the samples showed near equilibrium states our observations matched well with the mineralogical evidence reported in the shallow aquifers across the western bengal basin nath et al 2005 seddique et al 2008 mukherjee et al 2009 biswas et al 2012 5 2 possible factors driving vertical distribution of as concentrations in the groundwater gsa bsa at shallow gsa 70 m bgl we frequently encountered groundwater zones with low dissolved total as concentrations 10 µg l who overlapping with the patchy zones containing high as concentrations 10 µg l fig 3 similar patchy occurrences of as hotspots with surrounding low as zones in the shallow groundwaters were reported in previous studies nath et al 2005 charlet et al 2007 from the adjoining area of chakdaha nadia west bengal the peak as containing groundwater samples at 19 22 m bgl of the present study was found at shallower depths compared to the depth of 30 m bgl documented in earlier reports on other areas like chakdaha north 24 parganas in west bengal and the neighboring country of bangladesh harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 fendorf et al 2010 neumann et al 2010 biswas et al 2014 fig 3 our observation indicated heterogeneity of the aquifer system in the study area in terms of sub surface sedimentary layers with variable lithology affecting the water rock interaction process under differential groundwater flow paths multiple factors were attributed to the vertical distribution of as in the groundwater as suggested in the literature harvey et al 2002 zheng et al 2004 harvey et al 2005 mukherjee and fryar 2008 van geen et al 2008 biswas et al 2014 the possible factors included a lithology and redox state of the aquifer b seasonally variable localized flow of groundwater c withdrawal practices and fluctuation in the groundwater level d source of recharge e differential flushing history of the aquifer f presence of aquifer intercalated low permeable clay peat lenses and g the extent of overlapping redox zonations however identifying the key hydrological process responsible for the vertical distribution of as in the groundwater is somewhat complex and beyond the scope of the present study further our observation of the multiple redox sensitive elemental abundances in the seasonal shallow gsa groundwater samples can provide a comprehensive insight into the mechanism of as mobilization groundwater samples from bsa with low dissolved total as concentrations 10 μg l made them a safe target for potable water the less reducing conditions in the bsa and protection of bsa by paleosol cap from the downward migration of the shallow as contaminated and doc rich water mcarthur et al 2008 biswas et al 2012 ghosal et al 2015 possibly caused the bsa groundwater samples to contain such low as concentrations the few exceptional bsa groundwater samples showed excessive as concentrations as 10 μg l those samples indicated that under specific scenarios i e mixing of organic rich pore water from adjoining clay layer lateral mixing of shallow contaminated water along the aquifer margin bsa could sustain high as mobilization ghosal et al 2015 5 3 effect of overlapping redox zonation in the shallow gsa groundwater as cycle low orp values i e negative in the shallow groundwater samples indicated prominent anoxic conditions in the aquifer low no3 availability in the shallow gsa groundwater samples further supported anoxia with minimal mixing effects from surface derived no3 sources the few shallow gsa groundwater samples recorded high no3 occurrences which suggested probable mixing of wastewater from nearby pit latrine mcarthur et al 2012 2016 or agricultural return fertilizer rich flow fig 4 humic like doc acts as an energy source for microbial reductive dissolution responsible for high as mobilization in the groundwater kulkarni et al 2018 however the correlation between dissolved total as and doc concentration in the shallow groundwater samples was missing in the present study fig 4 it showed that besides other factors dilution and mixing the net dissolved total as concentration in the shallow gsa groundwater might have undergone multiple redox controlled adsorption desorption reaction pathways after being primarily released by the microbial reduction of as v adsorbed on fe iii ooh phases in the sediments coupled to bio available doc degradation our observations of the co existence of multiple redox sensitive solutes and their wide ranges in the integrated seasonal shallow groundwaters fig 4 indicated the potential partial redox equilibrium and the occurrences of overlapping redox zones i e metal reducing sulfidic methanogenic in the shallow gsa zheng et al 2004 mukherjee and fryar 2008 mukherjee et al 2008 the eh values in the seasonal shallow gsa groundwater samples ranged between 69 and 321 mv consistent with the previous datasets reported from the study area i e 91 8 to 358 mv biswas et al 2012 based on the eh values observed in the groundwater samples the shallow grey sand aquifers were classified as post oxic berner 1981 past reports in the study area showed a prevalence of fe ii as iii species over fe iii as v species in dissolved total fe and as concentrations in the shallow gsa bhattacharya et al 1997 mcarthur et al 2001 2004 mukherjee and fryar 2008 mukherjee et al 2008 biswas et al 2014 bhowmick et al 2018 the observed pe values in the shallow gsa groundwater samples ranged between 1 2 and 5 4 which fall within the upper and lower limits of the theoretical pe values of the fe iii fe ii redox couple biswas et al 2012 mukherjee et al 2008 our observations on the pe and eh values in the shallow gsa groundwaters indicated that despite the presence of multiple competitive redox sensitive couples reduction of fe iii to fe ii might be the prominent redox driver promoting as mobilization by microbial reduction of as v coated fe iii ooh in the sediments the present observation is consistent with the interpretations of the redox state of the shallow aquifer as seen in the previous studies across the western bengal basin biswas et al 2012 mcarthur et al 2004 mukherjee and fryar 2008 mukherjee et al 2008 majority of the past studies documented correlation patterns between dissolved total as and as mobilizing solutes i e fe so4 2 mn without considering their observations repeatedly at seasonal time intervals over multiple years the observed positive correlation between the dissolved total as and fe concentration and the negative correlation between as and so4 2 concentration in the shallow gsa groundwater samples during pom 1 and prm 1 periods figure s2 further suggested the possibility of as mobilization by microbial reduction of as v coated fe iii ooh with low initial so4 2 availability in the water lacking initial so4 2 concentration limits bacterial sulfate reduction bsr and restricts the effective precipitation pathways for as removal as authigenic as fe sulfides pathak et al 2022b present observation is consistent with the past laboratory and field based reports one time monitoring in the study area and neighboring bangladesh region horneman et al 2004 mcarthur et al 2004 mukherjee and fryar 2008 however some of the shallow gsa groundwater samples registered both high mn and as concentrations figure s2 indicating the process of desorption of a part of as onto the oxidized mn phase this may occur before the step of dissolution of fe iii oxy hydroxides since mn is reduced at eh values higher than that required for fe stüben et al 2003 mukherjee and fryar 2008 however the missing correlation recorded between as fe and so4 2 concentrations in the shallow gsa groundwater samples during pom 2 and prm 2 periods figure s2 is probably due to the overlapping redox biogeochemical cycles driven by the differential seasonal hydrological conditions section 5 4 and heterogeneity of the aquifer systems the probable redox bio geochemical processes involved are a re precipitation of fe into secondary mineral phases fe ii rich following the dissimilatory reduction of as v coated fe iii oxy hydroxides while liberated as remains in the solution horneman et al 2004 our calculated si 0 values or supersaturation state for fe ii rich siderite mineral phase in the shallow gsa groundwater supported the fact b additional input of fe in the solution from the weathering of biotite mineral dowling et al 2002 and acid volatile fes phases without contributing a significant as concentration c reduction of as v coated fe iii oxy hydroxides may not be the sole host of as mobilization into the groundwater stüben et al 2003 mukherjee and fryar 2008 and d mixing of in situ doc and as rich pore water from the aquifer intercalated clay peat lenses dowling et al 2002 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 5 4 seasonal hydrological conditions during the monitoring intervals depth to groundwater levels in the shallow aquifers of the study area monitored by the central ground water board cgwb india over the 2016 2019 period was adopted here the dataset showed minimum depths or in other words maximum groundwater levels during august which coincided with the terminal phase of the southwest monsoon the water level steadily receded reaching minima at the end of the dry pre monsoon period april related to the excessive groundwater abstraction practice figure s1 previous studies from the bengal basin west bengal bangladesh reported fluctuations at depth to the groundwater levels of the shallow aquifer by up to 5 m from post monsoon to pre monsoon period harvey et al 2005 mcarthur et al 2008 to understand the impact of variable rainfall and groundwater withdrawal on the groundwater level in shallow aquifers over time we compared the available seasonal dataset pom 1 nov 16 vs prm 1 apr 17 and pom 2 dec 18 vs prm 2 apr 19 of rainfall reported by imd and depths to groundwater levels reported by cgwb in the shallow aquifers of the study area the overall groundwater levels for nov 18 and dec 18 were treated similarly in the present study as exclusive data for dec 18 was unavailable in the cgwb resources we observed that the groundwater level in the shallow aquifer of the study area was lower by 1 5 m during nov 18 compared to nov 16 probably due to poor swm rainfall during 2018 compared to 2016 fig 2a b recharge by heavy precipitation during the swm period increases the groundwater levels in the shallow aquifers during dry episodes the drawdown in the groundwater level of the shallow aquifers varies over multiple years depending on the water demand and supply from surface water reservoirs linked to rainfall the groundwater level of the study area found dropped by 2 32 1 28 m during the dry apr 17 period compared to nov 16 fig 2b however the groundwater level dropped only by 0 65 0 71 m during the apr 19 compared to nov 18 this is probably due to the less water demand during apr 19 matched with its unusual occurrences of excessive pre monsoon showers events like cyclone phethai and multiple hailstorms documented in several regional newspapers and imd regional annual reports were essential factors driving excessive pre monsoon showers and increment in the groundwater levels of the shallow aquifers to understand the effect of yearly variable seasonal hydrological conditions i e rainfall amount withdrawal on the as distribution in shallow groundwater we further monitored the seasonal trends of dissolved total as and as mobilizing redox sensitive solutes in the shallow groundwater samples collected over multiple years 5 5 seasonal pattern in dissolved as and redox sensitive solutes in shallow gsa groundwater the positive and negative δe values symbolize the increasing and decreasing seasonal trends of the element concentrations respectively from post monsoon to pre monsoon periods the present study captured the minimal seasonal variation in dissolved total as concentrations in the shallowest depth of gsa groundwater samples up to 15 m bgl fig 6 however a greater extent of seasonal deviation in groundwater as concentrations with prominent increasing and decreasing seasonal trends from post monsoon to pre monsoon period was documented at depths 15 m bgl significant δas or increasing as concentrations in the groundwater samples during the pre monsoon period were prominent in the chakdaha area where frequent occurrences of organic rich clay peat layers intercalated to the shallow aquifer sediment were traced biswas 2003 charlet et al 2007 mukherjee et al 2007a biswas et al 2012 fig 1b the observed statistically significant p 0 05 increment in dissolved total as concentrations with decreasing dissolved mn concentrations in shallow gsa groundwater samples from pom 1 to prm 1 period figs 5 and 6 indicated that reduction of mn ooh might not be primarily responsible for as mobilization contrastingly an inconclusive inter seasonal pattern was documented in fe and so4 2 concentration between the pom 1 and prm 1 period fig 6 such trends indicated their involvement in multiple redox adsorption desorption reaction pathways for as mobilization under changing redox states in the shallow aquifer however the seasonal observations documented on the redox sensitive elemental abundance between dec 18 pom 2 and apr 19 prm 2 period indicated an increasing metal reducing condition prominent during the prm 2 period compared to pom 2 period this was consistent with the observed decreasing orp values and increasing doc concentrations recorded in prm 2 period groundwater samples compared to pom 2 which further suggested increasing anoxia during prm 2 fig 6 such increasing anoxia developed in the shallow groundwater during the prm 2 period may develop overlapping redox bio geochemical reaction pathways and lead to a complex mixed inter seasonal pattern in dissolved total as concentrations as shown in the present study figs 5 and 6 it is essential to mention that decreasing so4 2 and no3 concentrations in the shallow groundwater from pom to prm period does not always imply a bacterial reduction process but may also indicate the absence of such contributing sources in a dry time the redox condition in shallow aquifers is perturbed by the variable recharge and mixing contributing to doc and groundwater withdrawal process occurring at seasonal time intervals over multiple years cheng et al 2005 van geen et al 2008 biswas et al 2014 therefore it is essential to trace the seasonal recharge pattern and investigate the sources of doc in the shallow aquifer to understand the seasonal as mobilization process 5 6 identification of the seasonal recharge sources in shallow gsa groundwater the recharge sources in shallow groundwater and its mixing over time can be traced using conservative geochemical tracers such geochemical tracers included an abundance of dissolved chloride cl and stable isotopic signature δ18o δ2h in the groundwater the observed high cl values in the shallow gsa groundwaters fig 7a indicated the possible mixing influences of recycled water from multiple sources i e sewage waste water surface derived evaporative water irrigation return water deep pond recharge leachate from surface soil aquifer intercalated clay peat lenses trapped pore water mcarthur et al 2012 2016 majumder et al 2016 2017 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 however the abundance of rainwater without any cl enrich mixing influences is likely to show low cl concentrations in the shallow groundwater since the cl concentration in rainwater is minimal 2 mg l sengupta et al 2008 mcarthur et al 2012 mixing of the recycled waters mentioned above is the potential source that can explain the observed incremental cl concentrations in the shallow groundwater samples during the pre monsoon period fig 7b such mixing processes are triggered during dry time with excessive withdrawal leading to groundwater level drawdown however unusual heavy pre monsoon shower events drive additional vertical infiltration and mixing in the shallow aquifer the cl rich recycled waters carry overlapping cl signatures in the shallow groundwater therefore it is difficult to distinguish them solely based on the cl tracer and requires simultaneous monitoring of the stable isotope ratios in the seasonal groundwater samples isotopic enrichment in the shallow gsa groundwater samples documented during the pre monsoon periods fig 7b probably captured the signature of evaporative transformation during infiltration or mixing of evaporative surface water mainly from the bottom of the natural surface water body i e pond lake either way unusual pre monsoon shower events like the phethai cyclone hailstorms and depressions were documented in the study area before the prm 2 period apr 19 fig 2b cyclonic hailstorm event driven rainfall may preferentially introduce direct rainwater or rain fed surface water with a typical lighter isotopic composition into the shallow aquifer as evident in this study fig 7b such lighter isotope values were seen in a few cyclonic rainwater samples collected during an extended work of the present study where the δ18o values ranged between 4 3 and 14 2 pathak et al 2022a however other short term surface derived or in situ recharge mixing influences can also contribute to and allow explanation of such seasonal trends in the shallow aquifers further detailed study at higher resolution observations will be required to resolve the puzzle 5 7 δ13c oc as an indicator of organic source in shallow gsa groundwater in shallow groundwater dissolved organic carbon doc is commonly sourced by in situ aquifer sediment and is often surface derived the surface derived organic sources include pond bottom humic like sedimentary organic matter som near surface som rich in plant debris dissolved organics from pond base infiltration deep pond water and river water representing riverbank infiltration the present study identified the possible surface derived organic sources in the shallow aquifer by studying their δ13c oc signatures and quantifying their contributions the shallow aquifer 70 m bgl sedimentary organic carbon dataset δ13c soc from the adjoining region was adopted from the literature mcarthur et al 2004 and compared with the present shallow gsa groundwater δ13c doc composition we observed comparatively heavier organic carbon isotopic composition in the aquifer sediment 22 8 1 7 mcarthur et al 2004 near surface sediment 23 6 1 8 and hugli river water 22 5 1 4 fig 8 however lighter organic carbon isotopic composition was documented in pond bottom sediments 27 2 1 4 and deep pond water 26 4 1 1 the δ13c doc composition of the shallow gsa groundwater samples varied widely between 19 1 and 26 with an average of 24 3 2 0 that can be explained by the process of mixing of both heavier aquifer som near surface som and river water doc and lighter organic contributions deep pond water derived labile doc based on the observation of δ13c oc signatures in the probable organic sources and shallow gsa groundwater samples and applying the mass conservative approach a binary end member mixing model was performed to estimate the contributions we documented a total of 38 contribution of deep pond water derived fresh labile organic carbon into the shallow gsa groundwater with an uncertainty calculated of 0 8 following the standard error propagation method fig 8 the present observation supports the presence of fresh labile organic matter traces in the shallow groundwater of the study region as reported previously lawson et al 2013 infiltration of evaporative and labile organic rich deep pond water into the shallow aquifer can be a crucial factor responsible for high as mobilization 10 μg l by promoting anoxia and anaerobic microbial activities the limitation of the present mixing calculation was that it was based on the dataset comprising only one seasonal time interval apr 19 which might vary when different seasonal observations over multiple years would be considered restriction in the number of samples monitored in this study for assigning the average end member isotopic composition could be another limitation of this mixing model 5 8 probable role of mixing of clay pocket trapped pore water driving seasonal distribution of as in the groundwater an increment in dissolved total as concentrations in a few groundwater samples extracted from less reducing bsa during the prm period could be due to the lateral mixing of doc and as rich water from the overlying shallow aquifer along the aquifer margin mcarthur et al 2008 ghosal et al 2015 alternatively incorporating organic rich pore water from the aquifer proximal thick clay peat layer may supply excess doc for high as mobilization in the groundwater erban et al 2013 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 we compared the site specific sub surface lithological profiles containing gw17 and gw18 samples vs other bsa groundwater samples to address the responsible factor it was apparent that bsa for gw17 and gw18 samples litholog marked as d in fig 1b was overlain by a 26 m thick grey sticky clay layer referred to as grey plastic clay in fig 1b and followed by a 4 5 m thick brown clay or paleosol layer however in other samples bsa lithologs marked as b and c in fig 1b were overlain by a much thinner 3 m thickness grey bluish sticky clay layer followed by a 3 m thick paleosol layer such sedimentary clay deposits were the product of transgression during the geological evolution of the bengal basin and were documented as organic rich in the literature mcarthur et al 2004 from the current observations we suggested that the thicker organic rich clay layer adjacent to bsa may contribute excess doc by advective diffusive mixing of clay pore water responsible for high as release in the groundwater such pore water mixing would be prominent during dry periods due to excessive irrigation pumping practices and the tendency of compaction in the aquifer intercalated clay pockets another groundwater sample gw5 from shallow gsa 47 5 m bgl registered an excess so4 2 25 9 52 9 mg l and cl concentrations 52 5 109 5 mg l with high as concentrations 10 37 μg l and overall reducing nature orp values 67 to 97 mv which was rather unlikely at such depths fig 4 the same groundwater sample showed consistent incremental as concentrations and enrichment in stable isotope values during pre monsoon periods than post monsoon periods over the monitoring intervals this was difficult to explain without invoking the possible in situ mixing of heavier water rich in doc so4 2 and cl from the pore spaces of the aquifer intercalated clay peat lenses a 1 5 m thick peat layer refer to litholog marked as a in fig 1b overlying the gsa containing gw5 water supported our interpretation either way a preferential heavier groundwater flow containing wastewater signature can also generate a similar composition 5 9 possible redox driver for seasonal as mobilization in the shallow gsa groundwater to capture the possible redox driver causing seasonal variability in dissolved total as concentrations in the shallow groundwater we applied a comprehensive multi proxy approach by investigating the recharge pattern source of doc and redox conditions in the groundwater samples collected at seasonal time intervals over multiple years our present observations showed that the redox state in shallow aquifers varies from pom to prm period over different years depending on the variable seasonal rainfall and groundwater withdrawal practice that drives surface derived recharge carrying doc for as mobilization in a year with negligible pre monsoon rainfall referred to as prm 1 our observation recorded a higher drop in the groundwater level of the shallow aquifer probably due to excess water withdrawal the process promoted organic rich evaporative surface water infiltration from the base of nearby natural water bodies pond lake river into the shallow aquifer such evaporative water infiltration was evident by the water isotope enrichment in the shallow groundwaters measured for prm 1 collection mixing of deep pondwater introduces fresh labile organic matter that may trigger high as mobilization in the shallow aquifer during prm 1 a significant increasing trend in dissolved total as concentrations in the shallow gsa groundwater samples during the prm 1 period than pom 1 period supported our hypothesis the study area hosts abandoned palaeo channels natural water bodies and oxbow lakes which are important recharge sources to the shallow aquifers during dry periods a previous study from the adjacent chakdaha gotera village area showed high as concentrations in shallow groundwater promoted by the pond water recharge found in an abandoned river channel desbarats et al 2014 consistent with the present study on the other hand a statistically significant p 0 05 increasing reducing condition or anoxia was prominently detected in the shallow aquifer during prm 2 period compared to the pom 2 period the inducing anoxic condition may drive multiple overlapping metal reducing bio geochemical processes that can perturb the as cycle and result in complex inter seasonal patterns in dissolved total as concentrations in the shallow groundwater recharge by the unusual heavy pre monsoon shower events documented before the prm 2 period were held responsible behind this the minimal draw down in the groundwater levels and signature of lighter isotopes in the shallow groundwater samples during the prm 2 apr 19 period supported our hypothesis lighter rain fed surface water recharge containing labile organic matter into the shallow aquifer may develop anoxia however the redox state in the shallow aquifers is dynamic therefore it may have complex simultaneous influences acting as potential redox drivers for seasonal as mobilization an alternative in situ process that can explain the variation in groundwater composition at seasonal time intervals irrespective of the depth variable is the incorporation of organic rich pore water derived from the aquifer intercalated clay peat sedimentary lenses layers such clay peat lenses trapped in pore water in the bengal basin have been documented to be rich with organics cl so4 2 and heavier in isotopic composition sikdar et al 2001 mukherjee and fryar 2008 planer friedrich et al 2012 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 however the isotopic composition of clay pore water dataset adopted from the literature of the bangladesh region was documented to be much lighter than expected having a marine origin 0 pathak et al 2022a the δ13c doc composition of the clay pore water in the shallow aquifers closely resembled the present deep pond water δ13c doc composition fig 8 suggesting a probable similar origin for both pathak et al 2022a massive groundwater extraction during dry periods causes a change in the storage volume of the aquifer planer friedrich et al 2012 the process drives compaction on the aquifer intercalated clay peat lenses and causes the expulsion of pore water rich in organics mixing of organic rich clay peat trapped pore water in the adjoining groundwater may promote anaerobic microbial activities and trigger high as mobilization pathak et al 2022a our present observations on the shallow gsa gw 5 and a few bsa groundwater samples further supported our conjecture our preliminary estimation of the radar los land surface displacement around the study area using the adinsar technique reached up to 10 4 mm during the monitoring period 2017 2020 corresponding to a 12 5 mm land subsidence with a 3 3 mm yr rate pathak et al 2022a our estimation of a probable ongoing regional land subsidence partially supported our clay peat pocket squeezing effect and pore water mixing argument however a further detailed investigation is required to validate our current conjecture 6 conclusion this study highlights the interconnected roles of multiple factors driving seasonal variation in as release in the shallow aquifer between the post monsoon and pre monsoon periods over 2016 2019 we analyzed groundwater samples from the shallow reducing grey sand aquifers gsa and a few samples from less reducing brown sand aquifers bsa that showed distinct seasonal variation patterns in the dissolved total as concentrations over multiple years unlike previous findings our current observations documented significantly elevated dissolved total as concentrations in the groundwaters originating from shallow gsa during the pre monsoon periods than the post monsoon time however the magnitude of the seasonal changes in the groundwater as concentrations varied over multiple years due mainly to the differential hydrological conditions i e rainfall groundwater withdrawal surface water infiltration mixing in contrast limited groundwater samples from less reducing brown sand aquifer bsa showed an overall low dissolved total as concentrations 10 μg l without noticeable inter seasonal patterns however a few groundwater samples from bsa showed an increment in the dissolved total as concentrations during the pre monsoon period which is probably linked to the interaction of water with the adjoining lithology this study documented contrasting inter seasonal patterns in dissolved redox sensitive solutes and their correlation patterns in the shallow gsa groundwater samples over multiple years due to variable hydrological conditions our observations suggested that the responsible factor is the dynamic redox state in the shallow aquifers subjected to the seasonally erratic rainfall surface derived recharge mixing and excess withdrawal practices excessive pumping during dry time caused a drop in the local groundwater level providing a likely conduit for the infiltration of evaporative anoxic organic rich surface water from the bases of ponds into the shallow aquifer the process triggered high as mobilization in the shallow groundwater by enhancing anaerobic microbial activity such mixing effect in the shallow groundwater was prominent during an entire dry pre monsoon period prm 1 or apr 17 supported by the significant increment in the dissolved total as concentrations during the prm 1 time based on a single pre monsoon time observation apr 19 and δ13c oc tracer we estimated a total 38 2 0 8 contribution of deep pond water derived labile organic matter in the shallow groundwater either way recharge by the unusual heavy pre monsoon shower events during prm 2 or apr 19 may trigger overlapping redox bio geochemical cycles into the shallow aquifer the process might cause the dissolved total as concentrations in the shallow aquifer to undergo several adsorption desorption reaction pathways resulting in a complex mixed inter seasonal pattern as evident in the present study from pom 2 to prm 2 period additionally the in situ mixing influence of aquifer intercalated clay peat lenses trapped pore water organic rich in the adjoining groundwater solute chemistry and as release during the dry pre monsoon period was tentatively detected in this study the probable process involved compaction or squeezing of aquifer intercalated clay peat layers driven by the excessive groundwater withdrawal for irrigation and draw down during dry periods the process may trigger local land subsidence as preliminarily documented in the present study area such clay peat lenses trapped organic rich pore water mixing can be a viable alternative as a redox driver for as mobilization in the groundwater irrespective of the aquifer depths active during the dry pre monsoon period however further investigation is required on the speciation study of redox sensitive elements in the shallow groundwater to improve our understanding of the redox driver responsible for the seasonal as mobilization credit authorship contribution statement pousali pathak conceptualization methodology formal analysis data curation investigation visualization

3011,aim of this work is the assessment of the individual and combined impacts of land use land cover change lulcc and inter decadal climate variations cv on the water and energy cycles over india given extensive land use land cover change over the last decades in this study we quantify the contributions of lulc and cv on changes in the water and energy cycles over the indian subcontinent through a scenario based approach with community land model version 4 5 clm4 5 model runs from 1981 to 2010 the approach involves four simulation scenarios i the first scenario considers no lulcc or cv lulc is fixed and the atmospheric forcings for 1981 1990 are repeated in the decades afterwards ii the second scenario considers only the impact of cv iii the third scenario considers only the effect of lulcc by updating the lulc every 10 years and iv the fourth scenario considers the combined impact of lulcc and cv lulcc causes an overall decrease in the evapotranspiration et and soil moisture sm by 0 3 and 0 1 respectively comparing 1991 2010 with 1981 1990 while the net radiation changes 1 on the other hand cv caused an increase in the et sm and net radiation by 5 4 1 5 and 1 0 respectively in spite of decrease of precipitation of 6 6 the combined effect of lulcc and cv leads to an increase in the overall et by 3 8 among the lulc transitions deforestation and urbanization are found to be the major causes for hydrological changes over the decades but their impact is much smaller since cv has a greater impact on the hydrological cycles over india than lulc the in depth understanding of the distinct contributions of lulcc and cv on the water and energy cycles in tropical and subtropical regions can be used for framing future water resources planning and management policies keywords inter decadal climate variation landuse landcover change impact assessment clm4 5 india data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrological processes of any region are known to be significantly altered by two dominant drivers land use land cover lulc and climate vörösmarty et al 2000 nijssen et al 2001 oki and kanae 2006 wada et al 2011 sherwood and fu 2014 climate change cc has a direct impact on the regional precipitation temperature and humidity ross et al 2018 mishra et al 2018 which in turn affects components of the water and energy cycles lulc change lulcc indirectly affects these cycles through changes in albedo altering the partitioning of precipitation into components such as evaporation transpiration runoff interception and infiltration which affects soil moisture contents and therefore also the energy cycle sterling et al 2013 it is important to quantify how these two drivers combined and individually affect the terrestrial water and energy cycles in order to ensure proper management of water resources and derive reliable adaptation policies however isolating the individual effects of lulcc and cc is challenging owing to the complex interactions and feedback mechanisms between land surface and atmospheric processes the impacts of lulc and cc on the hydrology can be assessed using the following approaches a experimental approach brown et al 2005 b statistical approach berliner et al 2000 c empirical approach mas et al 2014 and d physically based modelling approach hegerl and zwiers 2011 statistical techniques mostly include methods like mann kendall test and sen slope method while the empirical approach refers to the use of conceptual modelling software such as land change modeller among these methods physically based modelling is considered to be the most appealing and widely used method to assess the impact of lulcc and cc as they take both the physical and meteorological conditions of the study region into consideration while providing detailed representations of the energy and water cycles wang et al 2012 however simulation of these processes is challenging due to the complex interconnections between different sub processes of the energy and water cycles and their corresponding feedback loops fatichi et al 2016 distributed hydrological models dhms which focus mainly on the simulation of the surface and subsurface water fluxes are generally used to simulate the water cycle of a basin or at smaller scales however the representation of the energy fluxes is mostly approximated or even neglected in the dhms which is one of its major drawbacks hingerl et al 2016 on the other hand land surface models lsms provide a detailed understanding of the complex interactions between hydrological biophysical and biogeochemical processes hence lsms have been widely used to study the impact of the changes in land properties and climate on hydrological processes over various regions in the world including the temperate devaraju et al 2015 gates and liess 2001 snyder et al 2004 and tropical regions feddema et al 2005 medvigy et al 2013 snyder 2010 generally the impact of lulc and cc on the water and energy cycles varies greatly for the temperate and tropical regions bala et al 2010 brovkin et al 2013 according to sanderson et al 2012 deforestation causes two opposite effects increased albedo leading to a radiative cooling effect and decreased et leading to a non radiative warming effect previous studies have reported cooling in the mid latitude regions due to historical deforestation which they attributed to the increased surface albedo betts et al 2007 davin and de noblet ducoudré 2010 in the tropical regions deforestation causes a warming effect due to larger decrease in the et owing to changes in the latent and sensible heat fluxes as a result of the reduced leaf area index perugini et al 2017 few studies have attempted to quantify the alterations in the water and energy cycles over the complex indian subcontinent most of the previous studies over india focused on the individual impacts of lulcc mawalagedara and oglesby 2012 paul et al 2016 zope et al 2016 or cc sapkota et al 2013 tsarouchi et al 2014 singh et al 2014a wagner et al 2013 these studies used lsms and focused on selected hydrological fluxes and states like streamflow ali et al 2019 soil moisture mishra et al 2018 or energy fluxes however we would like to emphasize that the primary goal of a land surface model is to accurately reproduce the states of the soil vegetation atmosphere continuum including the water and energy fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere land surface models are not particularly strong in modelling river discharge some studies have attempted to quantify the combined impact of lulcc and cc on the terrestrial water cycle mango et al 2011 cuo et al 2013 chawla and mujumdar 2015 tsarouchi and buytaert 2018 tsarouchi and buytaert 2018 focused on the impact of lulcc and cc on the past and near future 2000 2035 streamflow in the upper ganga basin using the joint uk land environment simulator jules model with coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 outputs from 21 different general circulation models gcms and 15 future lulcc pathway projections they reported that cc plays an important role in increasing high flows in the upper ganga basin while lulcc leads to a decrease in low flows overall it was concluded that cc is the major driver of hydrological change over the upper ganga basin in the near future in short most studies focus on the impact of lulcc and cc on the streamflow as a direct measure of available freshwater for the region milly et al 2005 however lulcc and cc affect not only the streamflow but also alter other components of the water and energy cycles which needs to be studied in depth in order to provide more insights in the regional modification of the water and energy cycles moreover the studies are carried out generally at a basin or local scale sapkota et al 2013 chawla and mujumdar 2015 tsarouchi and buytaert 2018 basin scale studies might not be able to highlight the impact of the regional or global scale circulation processes necessitating the need for a regional scale study döll and vassolo 2004 comprehensive studies at the regional scale are scarce especially over complex regions like india which has experienced large lulcc mainly in the form of deforestation and urbanization and has also undergone major shifts in the precipitation and temperature patterns due to cc in the last half century it is noted that most of the past cc studies focus on changes in the climate variables over a long period of time generally much longer than 30 years for instance over 100 years in case of chawla and mujumdar 2015 and tsarouchi and buytaert 2018 climate change studies generally require data for longer time periods since the changes in climate are difficult to detect without long term data records however in this study we focus on a period of 30 years with the aim of analyzing the impact of inter decadal climate variations cv on the energy and water cycles over india here inter decadal climate variation cv refers to the changes in the components of the energy and water cycle occurring in any decade with reference to the first decade hence instead of focusing on the long term changes we only focus on the changes occurring on a decadal scale the main objectives of this study are a to assess the isolated and combined impacts of lulc and cv on the water and energy cycles over the indian sub continent b to identify the dominant drivers behind these changes their evolution over time and regional hotspots of these changes the structure of the paper is as follows a brief description of the study area is given in section 2 followed by the methodology and data inputs in the section 3 the results are presented in section 4 followed by the discussion in section 5 and conclusions in section 6 2 study area fig 1 a shows the spatial distribution of the elevation pattern over india for this analysis the climate zone classification given by koeppen geiger beck et al 2018 was utilized as shown in fig 1b the koeppen geiger classification categorizes climate into 5 main categories and 30 sub categories based on threshold values of precipitation and air temperature koppen 1936 beck et al 2018 in this study the koeppen geiger climate map from beck et al 2018 is used for further analysis given the higher resolution accuracy and use of multiple climate datasets the zones are defined based on the criteria for basic climate type which are further subdivided based on the temperature or dryness supplementary information table s1 beck et al 2018 the major climate zones over india include tropical savanna climate aw tropical monsoon climate am arid desert hot climate bwh arid desert cold climate bwk arid steppe hot climate bsh temperate dry winter hot summer climate cwa temperate dry winter warm summer climate cwb and cold dry warm summer climate dsb among these aw bsh and cwa cover much of the indian subcontinent the aw climate zone covers most of central and southern india and is characterized by croplands and fallow lands the average daily precipitation over this climate zone is around 2 9 mm day india 3 1 mm day and the average daily temperature 26 4 c india 24 7 c the bsh climate zone covers mostly the drier regions of western and southern india over this climate zone the average daily precipitation and temperature are around 2 1 mm day and 26 9 c respectively the cwa climate zone covers the regions of ne and eastern india including parts of the ganga and brahmaputra basins and includes one of the most extensive agricultural zones of india over this climate zone the average daily precipitation and temperature are around 3 4 mm day and 25 6 c respectively further analysis is restricted to these three major climate zones that cover the majority of india aw bsh and cwa the spatial variation of mean annual precipitation over india is shown in fig 1c for this study three seasons are defined over india i pre monsoon season lasting from february till may ii monsoon season ranging from june till september and iii post monsoon season from october till january precipitation amounts are high during the monsoon season about 6 mm day on average over india and relatively low during the pre and post monsoon seasons around 1 6 mm day spatially the highest precipitation 10 mm day is observed over western ghats wg and north eastern ne india during the monsoon season as a result of the south east monsoon winds the lowest precipitation is observed over the north western nw india throughout the year especially during the pre monsoon season during the post monsoon season the peninsular regions particularly the eastern coastal regions receive higher rainfall 6 mm day as a result of the retreating monsoon winds also known as the ne monsoon during the 1981 2010 we observed a decrease in the mean daily rainfall values over india particularly in the pre monsoon season also the temperature shows a warming trend during this period in the pre monsoon and monsoon season summer monsoon precipitation has been declining since 1950 according to observational records kulkarni 2012 with considerable decrease in regions of the indo gangetic plains and the western ghats roxy et al 2015 krishnan et al 2016 suggest that the observed changes are a result of the radiative effects of increased aerosol emissions and regional scale lulcc which have offset the precipitation enhancing tendency of green house gas warming in the past decades the spatial distribution of the seasonal mean rainfall values over india during 1981 2010 is shown in supplementary fig s1 similarly the spatial distribution of the seasonal mean temperature values over india during 1981 2010 is shown in supplementary fig s2 the years 2002 2004 and 2009 were declared as drought years by the india meteorological department imd india is currently one of the severe water stressed countries and is on the verge of being water scarce in the coming years garg and hassan 2007 ever increasing population and changing climate along with the alterations in the land use over the years have added stress on the available water resources in the past decades india has experienced lulcc mainly in the form of decrease in forest cover and increase in croplands tian et al 2014 roy et al 2015 between 1880 and 2010 an overall decrease in the forest cover by 26 million hectares a decrease in grasslands by 20 million hectares an increase in total croplands by 48 million hectares and a 5 fold increase in the urban areas from 0 46 to 2 04 million hectares were observed tian et al 2014 according to roy et al 2015 between 1985 and 2005 the lulc in india underwent significant modifications between 1985 and 2005 the total area that changed was 0 10 percent of the country s entire geographic area 340 932 km2 land cover in the form of forests has been steadily decreasing while crops and built up area have increased agriculture 47 5 to 49 and built up areas 1 to 1 5 experienced large increases between 1985 and 2005 whereas forests 23 to 22 2 and wastelands 2 6 to 2 3 experienced significant decreases mixed forest savannah woodlands scattered trees and mangroves all experienced minor increases within distinct forest types all of the other forest classes either stayed the same or decreased slightly barren land 2 to 2 1 plantations 2 4 to 2 38 and shrub land 5 56 to 5 65 all saw minor changes in their areas and grassland remained steady along with the lulcc india has also experienced changes in the precipitation and temperature patterns in the last decades several studies have reported an increasing trend in temperature as a result of the changing climate kothawale et al 2010 ross et al 2018 sinha et al 2018 vinnarasi and dhanya 2019 between 1881 and 1997 an increasing trend in the mean annual temperature at the rate of 0 57 c per 100 years has been observed pant and kumar 1997 similarly subash and sikka 2014 reported a significant increasing trend of 0 78 c per 100 years in the annual maximum temperatures over india between 1904 and 2003 spatially the highest warming over the last 50 years is observed over the arid northwest nw india followed by parts of southern india ross et al 2018 similarly the impact of cc on the precipitation distribution patterns and extreme events over india has been studied by many researchers rajeevan et al 2008 singh et al 2014b vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 precipitation amounts decreased in the past decades taxak et al 2014 duhan and pandey 2013 roxy et al 2015 observed a decrease in the summer rainfall over central eastern india by about 10 20 in the last 100 years fukushima et al 2019 conducted trend analysis of the seasonal precipitation over india for the long term 1901 2013 and middle term period 1958 2013 and concluded that central and eastern india experienced a decreasing trend 1 2 mm year in the long term summer monsoon rainfall while the western coastal regions showed an increasing trend in the monsoon rainfall at the rate of 5 mm year over the period of 1985 2014 radhakrishnan et al 2017 reported a decreasing trend in the annual and summer monsoon rainfall along with an increasing trend in the temperature according to goswami et al 2006 there is a considerable increase in rainfall frequency and intense rain which is compensated by decreasing moderate events and the seasonal rainfall does not show a significant increase according to world bank during 1901 2019 there is no significant change in the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr however a weak decreasing trend has been observed in the ismr between 1980 and 2019 additionally the frequency of dry spells during 1981 2011 is observed to be 27 higher than the previous 30 years 1951 1980 along with more intense wet spells during ismr kulkarni et al 2020 reported a 75 increase in the frequency of daily precipitation extremes with intensity 150 mm day over central india during 1951 2015 and an overall increase in the frequency of localised short duration high intensity rainfall during 1951 2015 as a result of urbanization on the other hand the average annual mean temperature and average annual maximum temperature increased over the period 1901 2015 0 62 c 100 years resp 0 99 c 100 years during 1986 2015 the mean temperature has increased at a rate of 0 15 c per decade with significant increases in the frequency of warm extremes over india particularly in the pre monsoon season sanjay et al 2020 another study by mohammad and goswami 2019 focused on the precipitation and temperature trends over major indian cities located in different climate zones they reported a significant increasing trend in temperature except cities in the bsh and cwa zones while decreasing trends in the annual and seasonal precipitation patterns are seen over cities in the aw bsh and cwa zones 3 methodology 3 1 model description the community land model v4 5 clm4 5 is the land surface model component of the community earth system model cesm developed by the national centre for atmospheric research ncar lawrence et al 2011 oleson et al 2013 the clm4 5 model simulates the exchange of energy and water between the soil vegetation and atmosphere as well as the partitioning of radiation into heat fluxes and partitioning of precipitation between evaporation transpiration runoff and infiltration the sub grid scale heterogeneity in clm4 5 is represented through five different land use types glacier lake wetland urban and vegetated where the lulc is defined as the percentage coverage of each land unit type in a grid cell also sub model schemes are defined for each land unit type to calculate the water and energy fluxes for individual grid cells the movement of water in the soil in clm4 5 is assumed to be one dimensional i e vertically downwards towards the groundwater table without any interaction with the parallel soil columns kim and mohanty 2016 the soil water flow in clm4 5 is calculated using a modified one

represented in the model through 16 different plant functional types pfts and vegetation characteristics such as the leaf area index lai stem area index sai and canopy height which are defined for each pft clm4 5 uses a multi layer canopy model which simulates fluxes using combined information about plant canopy structure leaf physiology and radiative transfer bonan et al 2014 in this model the canopy is divided into multiple leaf layers with sunlit and sunshaded fractions and photosynthesis stomatal conductance leaf temperature and energy balance are coupled at each layer for vegetated surfaces the water vapor flux is partitioned into ground and vegetation fluxes which depends on the ground and vegetation temperatures and specific humidity simulation of the photosynthesis process is based on the farquhar photosynthesis model farquhar et al 1980 while the transpiration is simulated based on the ball berry conductance model ball et al 1987 according the sib2 model by sellers et al 1996 the total evapotranspiration in clm is the sum of the transpiration from the vegetation the evaporation from the ground and the evaporation from the water stored in the canopy the canopy

water fluxes through the alterations in the lai and corresponding changes in the albedo in clm4 5 the solar radiant fluxes transmitted absorbed and reflected by the canopy and the ground surface are

buildings and consists of sunlit and shaded walls roofs and impervious and pervious floors the impervious floor represents surfaces such as roads and parking lots and is hydrologically inactive while the pervious floor represents hydrologically active surfaces such as lawns and parks the vegetation in the urban areas is represented in clm4 5 as a separate vegetation tile in which the vegetation does not interact with the urban canopy detailed description of the various processes in clm 4 5 can be found in oleson et al 2013 3 2 model setup and input data the standalone clm4 5 model is setup at 10 10 km resolution over the domain ranging from 8 n to 38 n and from 68 e to 98 e the model consists of 360 360 grid cells and 15 soil layers the elevation and slope data over this domain are obtained from united states geological survey usgs hydro1k data verdin and greenlee 1996 the elevation over india ranges from 0 to 5000 m above mean sea level amsl with the highest altitudes in the himalayan mountain ranges in the north and ne india where the elevation is generally above 3000 m amsl see fig 1a similarly the slopes are steepest in the himalayan region where they range from 10 to 21 whereas for most of india the slope value is smaller than 4 the leaf area index lai data used in the model is based on the modis 1 km lai data myneni et al 2002 as described in lawrence and chase 2006 while the data for soil properties are obtained from the international geosphere biosphere program global soil data task 2000 the medium resolution decadal land use land cover lulc maps 30 m for india are from the oak ridge national laboratory ornl of the national space administration agency nasa roy et al 2015 these maps are available at 10 years interval for 1985 1995 and 2005 and were developed by using forest cover fsi 2013 vegetation cover joshi et al 2006 biome roy et al 2006 bio diversity maps and land cover information kandrika and roy 2008 incorporating satellite remote sensing data from various sources to analyse the changes in lulc over the decades using visual interpretation techniques in the present study the lulc maps were re gridded to 10 km resolution to be used as input into clm4 5 using the pft mapping scheme by paul et al 2016 supplementary information table s2 in clm4 5 the bare pft class is defined for all non vegetated land covers including the open water bodies and bare lands ke et al 2012 since the lulc data is only available for one year in the middle of a decade the lulc data for the whole decade e g 1981 1990 is assigned from the available year 1985 similarly the lulc data from 1995 and 2005 are assigned for the decades 1991 2000 and 2001 2010 respectively clm4 5 incorporates the lulc change by changing the pft types and the associated vegetation characteristics such as the annual lai cycle and canopy height which are defined for each pft individually hence the values of the lai and other vegetation properties are changed according to the change in pft type distribution at an interval of 10 years reliability of the atmospheric forcing dataset is one of the major factors affecting the model results wang et al 2016 several forcing datasets are available from different global agencies such as the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf and others however these datasets have considerable uncertainties thus necessitating a proper evaluation of the data before application to a particular region yang and kim 2017 several previous studies have focused on the inter comparison and evaluation of the different available atmospheric datasets over india ghodichore et al 2018 misra et al 2012 rana et al 2015 shah and mishra 2014 and have concluded that the era interim reanalysis dataset and merra reanalysis dataset exhibit superior performance in terms of precipitation and temperature characteristics ghodichore et al 2018 in this study the era interim reanalysis dataset dee et al 2011 was used for extracting atmospheric forcing data for clm 4 5 era interim is the global reanalysis dataset released by the ecmwf and has been utilized for various inter comparison and modelling studies over different regions of the world e g lorenz and kunstmann 2012 chen et al 2014 shah and mishra 2014 kishore et al 2016 era interim provides global data for various atmospheric variables such as precipitation temperature and wind speed at a spatial resolution of 80 km t255 from the year 1979 till mid 2019 however the precipitation data from era interim is replaced by the gridded precipitation dataset from the imd pai et al 2014 while the other meteorological forcings are taken from era interim the imd dataset incorporated daily precipitation data from around 6500 stations across india and gridded them to the uniform 0 25 resolution using the interpolation algorithm developed by shepard 1968 the imd dataset has been used as a reference dataset for several inter comparison performance analysis studies e g ghodichore et al 2018 chaudhary et al 2017 and analysis of hydrological extremes vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 over india 3 3 observation dataset 3 3 1 grun dataset grun ghiggi et al 2019 is a machine learning based observationally driven global gridded reconstruction of monthly runoff rates the data is available on a 0 5 x0 5 wgs84 grid and spans the years 1902 to 2014 runoff observations from a global collection of in situ streamflow observations of relatively small catchments 2500 km2 are used to train the machine learning algorithm which uses gridded precipitation and temperature from a century long reanalysis product as predictors in places with limited or no observational coverage grun provides a unique picture of large scale characteristics of runoff variability the grun dataset ghiggi et al 2019 is publicly available in netcdf 4 format and can be downloaded for free at https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 9228176 one of the limitations of the grun dataset is that glacier melting is not explicitly included in the model additionally since the model is purely forced with precipitation and temperature grun is not able to explicitly account for the effects of local human river flow regulation dam operations in particular on the rebuilt hydrological regimes grun also struggles with the accuracy of runoff over the mountainous regions owing to the coarse resolution of the input meteorological forcings over hilly regions 3 3 2 global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam miralles et al 2011 is a global gridded evaporation model that is designed to be driven solely by remote sensing observations mostly based on microwave remotely sensed soil moisture and vegetation optical depth in the past gleam data sets on evaporation and root zone soil moisture have been widely used to examine spatial variability and trends in the water cycle e g miralles et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 gleam v3 includes a redesigned depiction of evaporative stress an optimised water balance module and a new soil moisture data assimilation approach the data set is based on satellite observed soil moisture vegetation optical depth and snow water equivalent reanalysis air temperature and radiation and a multi source precipitation product globally available for the 36 year

by the central water commission cwc and the indian space research organization isro with the objective of providing data and information for assessment monitoring and development of water resources in india all long term information regarding the climatic data surface water groundwater availability water quality and water extraction are available in the public domain at https indiawris gov in wris in this study we used the timeseries of the observed streamflow from the india water resources information system india wris https indiawris gov in wris rivermonitoring for eight stations namely agraharam takli konta koida mandaleshwar hoshangabad sarangkheda and bamnidhi stations falling under five major river basins the details of the stations are given in table 1 3 4 model scenarios in the present study four different scenarios are evaluated in order to isolate the impacts of lulc and cv details of these scenarios are shown in table 2 the first scenario considers pristine conditions without any lulcc or cv no change scenario in this case the lulc is fixed from the situation in 1985 and the atmospheric forcing data for 1981 1990 are repeated for the subsequent decades the second scenario considers only the impact of cv where the lulc map is fixed as of 1985 s and the atmospheric forcings are changed from 1981 to 2010 the third scenario considers the effect of lulcc only by updating the lulc every 10 years while repeating the atmospheric forcings from 1981 to 1990 throughout the model run the fourth scenario considers the combined impact of lulcc and cv where both the lulc and climate data are updated throughout the run 3 5 model simulation and analysis the model results are analysed for highlighting the impact of lulc and or cv on evapotranspiration soil moisture

canopy evaporation e c 14 et e t e s e c the net radiation r net is given by 15 r net s gr s veg r atmosphere r emitted where s gr is the solar radiation absorbed by the ground w m2 s veg is the solar radiation absorbed by the vegetation w m2 r atmosphere is the atmospheric longwave radiation w m2 and r emitted is the emitted longwave radiation w m2 additionally the partitioning of the available energy into the heat fluxes including latent heat flux lh and sensible heat flux h is expressed in form of the bowen ratio br and the evaporative fraction ef 16 br h le 17 ef le le h the variation of these components for the different case scenarios presented in table 1 is investigated for each season and over the three major climate zones over india the hydrological variables and indices are further analysed based on the major lulc transitions that occurred over india during different decades the performance of the model in simulating runoff et and sm is analysed through comparison with observed data from india wris and grun for runoff and gleam for et and sm for this study the streamflow data for eight stations falling under five major river basins in india are obtained from india wris which is then standardized using z score as defined below 18 z x μ σ where z is the z score µ is the mean x is the observed value and σ is the standard deviation of the dataset in order to compare the monthly values of standardized modelled runoff from clm4 5 with the standardized runoff from grun and standardized observed streamflow from india wris the percentage bias pbias and nash sutcliffe efficiency ns are calculated using the following equations 19 p b i a s i 1 n r i s i i 1 n r i 100 20 n s 1 i 1 n r i s i 2 i 1 n r i r 2 where r i is the reference standardized runoff streamflow value s i is the simulated standardized runoff from clm4 5 r is the mean value of the reference standardized runoff streamflow n is the time series at monthly scale 4 results 4 1 evaluation of the real world hydrological scenario over india from 1981 to 2010 the simulated seasonal distribution of et over india shows highest et during the monsoon season around 3 mm day while lower values are found for the pre monsoon around 1 2 mm day and the post monsoon season around 1 4 mm day as shown in fig 2 this coincides with the annual precipitation distribution and points to the fact that et is often moisture limited over india spatially the highest et values are observed over the wg and the ne regions 5 mm day during monsoon while the lowest values are observed over the nw arid regions 0 5 mm day during pre monsoon the pre monsoon season in india is characterized by low rainfall throughout the whole domain combined with high temperatures and low soil moisture during this period most of the rnet is partitioned for the sensible heat flux this is particularly evident over the arid and semi arid regions which mostly constitute the bsh climate zone where h is significantly higher than le fig 3 the mean pre monsoon h value over the bsh zone is around 102 w m2 with soil moisture content around 0 25 m3 m3 fig 4 compared to a h value of 61 w m2 supplementary document fig s3 and sm of 0 3 m3 m3 over the relatively humid cwa climate zone the aw and cwa regions have higher simulated pre monsoon et 1 2 mm day and 1 8 mm day than other climate zones although the aw zone has the highest rnet value the total et over the aw zone is lower than for the cwa zone related to the higher sm content for the cwa climate zone around 0 3 m3 m3 the aw and bsh have relatively large h fluxes for the pre monsoon season but with considerable differences in the br values for these two regions the br for the arid bsh zone around 15 is significantly higher than for the aw zone 5 which can be attributed to the lower sm in the bsh zone than the aw zone indicating the strong influence of the sm over the partitioning of the heat fluxes the cwa zone generally experiences higher rainfall than the other climate zones and exhibits therefore also higher sm this zone has mostly higher latent heat fluxes than sensible heat fluxes resulting in higher ef values and lower br values the monsoon period in india is generally characterized by high rainfall amounts along with higher sm and high available energy as a result the monsoon season is generally more dominated by le as the largest part of the available energy is used for le this is the case for the cwa and aw climate zones where as a result of the high sm br values are low and ef values high over the aw and cwa zone monsoon et values are around 4 mm day and es amounts to 50 aw and 46 5 cwa of the total et for these two zones the bsh zone has lower average sm contents and therefore more of the available energy is used for sensible heat flux 46 and less for latent heat flux 54 compared to other climate zones the monsoon rnet values are around 150 w m2 over india and the majority of the available energy is used for latent heat flux related to the high sm content over india this is also evident from the high ef values all over india during the monsoon season supplementary document fig s4 the decadal distribution of the ef values over india for different seasons are shown in figs s5 to s7 in the supplementary document during the post monsoon season the available sm is also relatively high however the available energy is smaller leading to energy limited et conditions all over india this is for example the case for the cwa climate zone where the average rnet value is around 80 w m 2 in the post monsoon season and et values in the range of 1 5 mm day out of which 58 is contributed by the transpiration component et as a result of the relatively higher sm values in the post monsoon season similarly high et values 2 2 mm day are observed over the peninsular india aw zone with et contributing 67 of the total et the post monsoon rnet values over the aw zone are in the range of 120 w m2 which is partitioned almost equally into le and h with g values being negligible on the other hand for the bsh region 71 of the available energy is used for sensible heat flux the average soil moisture content in the post monsoon season is around 0 25 m3 m3 for the bsh zone with higher values at the leeward side of the wg and lower values in the regions in nw india post monsoon et over the bsh zone 1 mm day is higher than in the pre monsoon 0 5 mm day which can be attributed to the higher sm in this season than the pre monsoon et plays an important role in the post monsoon et with a contribution of around 59 to the total et in order to evaluate the performance of clm4 5 in simulating the hydrological variables over different regions of india we compare the simulated surface runoff from clm4 5 with the grun gridded runoff dataset over different climate zones of india the annual cycle of runoff over the aw region fig 5 a shows that clm4 5 is able to simulate the pre monsoon and post monsoon runoff satisfactorily while underestimating the peak runoff during the monsoon season over the bsh region we note that the observed grun runoff is higher than the simulated runoff for the monsoon and post monsoon seasons however it is possible that the grun algorithm overestimates runoff over the arid regions as it produces higher runoff than the actual natural streamflow ghiggi et al 2019 however on the other hand it can be stated that grun takes the impact of irrigation and other land management practices into account which are neglected in clm siebert et al 2015 also observed overestimated runoff over arid regions with intensive irrigation activities the cwa climate zone also exhibits a similar pattern where grun runoff is higher than clm4 5 over almost the whole year since the cwa climate zone covers most of the ganges basin which is known to be an agriculture intensive area the resulting irrigation can be the reason for the higher runoff values observed in the grun dataset throughout the year overall we found the performance of clm4 5 in simulating the runoff over india to be reasonable fig 6 shows that the spatial distribution of runoff simulated by clm4 5 does not differ much from the grun runoff in the pre monsoon and monsoon periods over most of india with some differences over wg ne and the foothills of the himalayas the bias in monsoon runoff reveals that clm has lower monsoon runoff than grun particularly over high rainfall regions of wg and ne on the other hand clm exhibits higher post monsoon runoff than grun over most of the eastern half of india and parts of central peninsular india fig 5d shows the annual sm cycles from gleam and clm4 5 over the aw climate zone and we observe that clm4 5 has higher sm values than gleam for almost the whole year except for the early monsoon season on the contrary the results for the cwa zone show that the clm4 5 sm is lower than gleam soil moisture throughout the year except for the later part of the monsoon season over the bsh zone we observe quite high sm values in clm4 5 throughout the year probably clm4 5 is not able to reproduce the sm values correctly over the arid semi arid regions of india the spatial distribution of the seasonal sm values over india fig 7 shows that clm has higher monsoon sm over the entire central and ne region compared to gleam on the other hand pre and post monsoon sm are higher in clm than for gleam over the central portion of india we also compared the clm4 5 simulated et values with the gleam data and found that over the bsh zone fig 5h the values of simulated et are very close to the gleam values however the cwa zone exhibits higher gleam et values than clm et values during the pre monsoon season while the monsoon and post monsoon et are in agreement as for the aw zone clm4 5 has lower et than gleam throughout the year particularly over the pre monsoon and monsoon season one of the reasons for the lower et in clm4 5 compared to gleam is the absence of irrigation in the model since gleam uses satellite based observations as input along with data assimilation the impact of irrigation on the et is also included in the observed dataset resulting in higher overall et throughout the year fig 8 shows that clm4 5 simulated et values are smaller than for gleam over entire india particularly clm4 5 has lower post monsoon et over the entire peninsular india fig 8i and lower pre monsoon et over the wg ne and foothills of himalayas fig 8g the monsoon et values appear largely to be in agreement with gleam over india except some parts of wg and ne based on our results it is noted that clm4 5 is able to simulate et values closer to gleam for the arid semi arid regions over india than for the semi humid humid regions it is also important to highlight that the observation datasets used in this study are also affected by biases and random errors the remote sensing observations are affected by systematic biases and the grun and gleam products are also affected by model assumptions it is therefore unclear whether those observation datasets correspond better to reality than our modelled values a comparison of the model results with in situ observations could provide a better insight into the model performance of clm4 5 hence we compared the observed streamflow at eight different stations over five major river basins of india fig 9 shows the comparison of the standardized streamflow for these stations with the standardized runoff from the clm4 5 and grun datasets we observed that clm4 5 results could follow the overall pattern of runoff at most of these stations however there are discrepancies in the magnitude table 3 shows the percentage bias pbias and the nash sutcliffe coefficient for the standardized runoff values of clm4 5 with the standardized runoff from grun as well as the standardized time series of observed streamflow from india wris portal the model results exhibit an overall model underestimation bias as compared to observed india wris data which is evident from the negative pbias values in table 3 especially the peak flows are not well reproduced by clm4 5 which can be seen at the stations over godavari and tapi basins also evident from the negative ns values in comparison the runoff results from clm4 5 are in an overall better agreement with grun runoff as compared to the observed india wris streamflow this can be attributed to the fact that most of the streamflow gauges provide regulated observations although many studies have deployed lsms to simulate runoff these simulations should not resemble the observed streamflow especially in regulated basins in some studies land surface models were used with the sole objective of analyzing and improving the streamflow simulated on a watershed or basin scale lee and choi 2021 miao and wang 2020 zheng et al 2017 however in this study we focus primarily on the exchange of water and energy along the land atmosphere interface using clm4 5 some studies have also attempted to utilize the capabilities of lsms in analyzing the water budget and energy exchange at local or regional scales liu et al 2020 li et al 2019 wang et al 2016 the larger goal in this study is not to improve the simulation of hydrological components but to analyze the impact of changing lulc and cc on those hydrological components a previous study by kushwaha et al 2021 attempted to assess the performance of clm3 0 along with four other hydrological models in simulating the streamflow and other water balance components over 18 major river basins over india and concluded that the performance of clm was found to be acceptable additionally they also reported that the multimodel ensemble mean outperformed the individual hydrological models in simulating the water balance components 4 2 isolated impact of lulcc and cv on hydrological cycle the individual impacts of cv and lulcc on the components of the energy and water cycles can be deduced from the comparison of the cv only scenario case 2 and the lulc only scenario case 3 with the no change scenario case 1 also the decade wise changes in the energy and water cycle are studied by comparing each individual decade with the first decade 1981 1990 the average pre monsoon season values of the components of water and energy cycle over india for different decades are shown in table 4 and table 5 respectively the values of the various components of the water and energy cycles for the monsoon and post monsoon season are shown in the supplementary document in the table s3 to table s6 4 2 1 aw climate zone model results show that cv alone results in an increase in the overall et with an increase in the et and es components and no considerable change in the ec over the aw region we see also considerable inter decadal climate variations with an increase in et during the period 1991 2000 by 0 22 mm day compared to the earlier decade driven by an increase of es by 0 1 mm day and an increase of et by 0 13 mm day the season wise comparison reveals increases of pre monsoon et monsoon et and post monsoon et by 0 35 mm day 0 14 mm day and 0 18 mm day respectively in the pre monsoon the increase of ground evaporation contributes most to the et increase whereas for the monsoon and post monsoon season transpiration increase more during 1991 2000 compared to 1981 1990 the changes in the g flux related to cv are negligible while the sensible heat values decrease by 7 w m2 pre monsoon 2 w m2 monsoon and 2 7 w m2 post monsoon the decade 2001 2010 shows an intermediate et with an average et 0 07 mm day larger than for the reference period 1981 1990 ec is hardly impacted by cv in these simulation scenarios while we observe only slight increases in the et and es components et values do not exhibit any large change 0 05 mm day in the pre monsoon and monsoon season whereas the post monsoon et shows an increase by 0 17 mm day which is due to an increase in the et es and ec by 0 07 0 08 and 0 03 mm day respectively the sensible heat flux h ground heat flux g and net radiation rnet do not show any significant change always compared to the reference period 1981 1990 if only lulcc is considered a slight overall decrease in the et 0 05 mm day is observed for 1991 2000 compared to the reference period 1981 1990 with decreases in the et and ec components by 0 03 and 0 02 mm day respectively also the changes in the other fluxes and for the different seasons are small similarly for the decade 2001 2010 we observe only slight decrease in the et values and its components compared to the decade 1981 1990 we observe lower et values in all seasons with decreases between 0 03 and 0 07 mm day the ground evaporation component shows larger decreases in the pre monsoon by 0 09 mm day and the post monsoon season 0 06 mm day also the other fluxes show only small changes the combined effect of the lulc and cv shows results similar to the cv only case scenario with higher overall seasonal et values for the decade 1991 2000 for the pre monsoon 0 3 mm day monsoon 0 11 mm day and post monsoon 0 17 mm day however the et increases slightly less as compared to the cv only scenario as lulcc has a small et limiting effect 4 2 2 bsh climate zone over the bsh region the et values are generally higher for the cv only scenario than for the no change scenario with increases in the order of 0 14 to 0 24 mm day for the different decades simulated et values are higher for the 1991 2000 period compared to 1981 1990 by 0 2 mm day where an increase in the es and the et contribute to the overall increase in et while the ec component does not exhibit significant change over the whole period the pre monsoon et increases by 0 14 mm day with an increase in the et by 0 1 mm day similar increases in the monsoon 0 11 mm day and post monsoon et 0 13 mm day are simulated over the bsh zone related to cv this is attributed to the increased et and es in the monsoon 0 13 and 0 14 mm day respectively and post monsoon 0 11 and 0 01 mm day respectively season the seasonal h values show a decrease by about 4 9 w m2 in the pre monsoon 4 3 w m2 in the monsoon and 2 3 w m2 in the post monsoon season this illustrates that the incoming energy in the decades 1991 2000 and 2001 2010 is more used for latent heat flux and less for sensible heat flux compared to 1981 1990 the pre monsoon ground heat flux increases by about 2 6 w m2 and by 4 4 w m2 for the monsoon rnet shows an increase by 2 1 1 8 and 0 8 w m2 in the pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon season respectively for the decade 2001 2010 we observe higher overall et by 0 1 mm day with only a slight increase of et and es as compared to the decade 1981 1990 post monsoon et increases by 0 17 mm day and pre monsoon and monsoon et do not change significantly the increase in the post monsoon et is due to the increase in the et and es components by 0 1 mm day and 0 05 mm day respectively the post monsoon sensible heat flux shows a slight decrease by 2 1 w m2 while rnet shows a small increment for the different seasons in the range of 1 3 w m2 the lulcc only scenario is associated with a decrease in the et over the bsh climate zone always compared to 1981 1990 particularly in the monsoon season for 1991 2000 where the et decreases by 0 2 mm day the changes in the pre monsoon and post monsoon et are very small the simulated seasonal changes in the sensible heat flux are also small with increases in the monsoon and post monsoon h values by 2 2 w m2 and 0 7 w m2 the et values in the decade 2001 2010 also show limited changes compared to 1981 1990 with a lower et value in the monsoon season 0 2 mm day the rest of the fluxes and net radiation remain also relatively unchanged during this decade overall it is observed that the effect of lulcc is smaller than inter decadal climate variations over the bsh climate zone the combined impact of the cv and lulcc gives results similar to the cv only scenario as observed for the aw climate zone the magnitude of the et increase is lower than for the cv only scenario 4 2 3 cwa climate zone for the cwa climate zone we observe small changes in the overall et values over the decades for both the cv only and the lulcc only scenario however the individual seasons show larger changes particularly the pre monsoon season during the period 1991 2000 the pre monsoon et increases always compared to 1981 1990 as a result of cv by 0 3 mm day while the monsoon et increases by 0 1 mm day with an increase in the monsoon et by 0 2 mm day and a decrease in the monsoon ec by 0 1 mm day the sensible heat flux h increases in the pre monsoon h by 2 5 w m2 with smaller increases in the monsoon and post monsoon h by 1 1 and 1 3 w m2 similar increases can be observed in the ground heat flux g with higher values in the pre monsoon and monsoon g by 3 7 and 2 w m2 the net radiation shows slight variation 3 w m2 during the pre monsoon and monsoon period a similar pattern is observed for the period 2001 2010 again compared to 1981 1990 for the seasonal et and its components the simulated sensible heat flux increases by 4 4 2 8 and 0 7 w m2 for the pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon season also the pre monsoon and monsoon g increase by 4 and 2 w m2 the combined effect of the lulcc and cv shows similar results as for the cv only scenario with an increase of et for the different seasons over the cwa climate zone both cv and lulcc have a similar effect on the energy and water cycles 4 3 impact of the lulcc transitions 4 3 1 deforestation fig 10 shows the grid cells over india which experienced transformation from forest cover to cropland deforestation and from cropland to urban areas urbanization between 1985 and 2005 overall 1 5 of the total area has undergone transformation from forest to agricultural lands between 1985 and 2005 deforestation results in substantial decreases in both soil evaporation and transpiration thus resulting in an overall et decrease over the affected grid cells the average et values over deforested regions reduced from 2 4 mm day to 1 7 mm day between 1981 and 90 and 2001 10 during this period et decreased from 0 9 mm day to 0 7 mm day while the es decreased from 1 mm day to 0 6 mm day and the ec reduced from 0 48 mm day to 0 33 mm day additionally the sensible heat value increased from 61 w m2 to 63 w m2 and the ground heat flux decreased from 8 9 w m2 to 8 75 w m2 resulting in an overall rnet increase from 134 5 w m2 to 135 8 w m2 between 1981 and 90 and 2001 10 among the affected grid cells around 19 grids belong to the aw climate zone while 16 7 of the grids belong to the bsh climate zone over the aw climate zone deforestation leads to a decrease in the overall et from 2 5 to 2 3 mm day with a decrease in the ground evaporation from 0 98 mm day to 0 74 mm day we observe only slight increase in the sensible heat fluxes with no significant change in the soil moisture the rnet value shows a decrease from 134 7 w m2 to 133 9 w m2 between 1981 and 90 and 2001 10 supplementary document fig s8 deforestation leads to a higher albedo which reduces the absorption of solar radiation by the ground surface davin and de noblet ducoudré 2010 previous studies have also indicated that reduction in forest cover in tropical regions leads to reduced evapotranspiration defries et al 2002 feddema et al 2005 bonan 2008 another aspect of the deforestation is that the rooting depth is higher in case of trees as compared to crops and grasslands hence conversion from forest to croplands implies a decrease in the overall et bala et al 2007 over the bsh climate zone deforestation results in very slight decrease in et with decreases mainly in the ground evaporation additionally we do not observe significant changes in the rnet values and soil moisture over the bsh climate zone results are not very different for the combined impact of lulcc and cv with similar trends but slightly higher values for total et the overall et decreases from 2 5 mm day to 2 mm day with major decreases in the et from 1 1 mm day to 0 95 mm day and ec from 0 5 mm day to 0 3 mm day however we observe an increase in the sensible heat from 60 w m2 to 63 4 w m2 and an increase in the rnet from 134 w m2 to 136 8 w m2 between 1981 and 90 and 2001 10 among the climate zones the aw climate zone shows a larger decrease in the et from 2 9 mm day to 2 4 mm day which is mainly due to the decrease in the es from 1 2 mm day to 0 8 mm day along with slight decreases in the et and ec as well the soil moisture does not show any significant change during this period however the rnet increases from 134 7 w m2 to 135 6 w m2 which can be attributed to the increase in h and g fluxes over this climate zone on the other hand we observe a smaller decrease in the et over the bsh climate zone from 1 7 mm day to 1 6 mm day with decreases in the ec and es components the rnet and sm values do not exhibit large changes during this period 4 3 2 urbanization the other major lulcc was the conversion of cropland to urban area overall 1 04 of the total area has undergone transformation from cropland to urban areas between 1985 and 2005 urbanization leads to a decrease in the overall et from 1 9 mm day to 1 6 mm day between 1981 and 90 and 2001 10 in this case we observe a decrease in the et and an increase in the es component over the decades et decreases from 1 mm day to 0 4 mm day and es increases from 0 6 mm day to 1 mm day also we observe an increase in the total h flux from 63 w m2 to 64 3 w m2 and an increase in the g flux from 7 8 w m2 to 8 w m2 associated with an increase in the total rnet from 132 w m2 to 133 4 w m2 higher evapotranspiration over vegetated areas is associated with smaller sensible heat fluxes and reduced surface warming fall et al 2010 additionally a vegetation cover prevents the absorption of solar radiation by the ground surface thereby reducing sensible heat flux wang et al 2012 around 23 of the affected grid cells belong to the aw climate zone while 30 of the grid cells are part of the bsh climate zone over the aw climate zone the total et decreases from 2 3 mm day to 1 9 mm day between 1981 and 90 and 2001 10 as a result of the decrease in the et from 1 2 mm day to 0 5 mm day we also observe a small increase in the h flux by 1 w m2 however the overall rnet value does not exhibit any significant change and remains around 130 w m2 supplementary document fig s9 similarly we do not observe any change in the soil moisture values over the aw climate zone on the other hand the bsh climate zone shows a significant decrease in the et values from 1 3 mm day to 1 mm day with large decreases in the et from 0 63 mm day to 0 3 mm day we do not observe any large change in the overall rnet and sm values over the bsh climate zone in clm the urban canopy floor consists of impervious and pervious surfaces where the impervious floor represents the roads parking lots and other concrete or asphalt surfaces generally the heat trapping capacity and the heat transfer capacity of these materials is higher as compared to the soil as a result the majority of the solar radiation is directly absorbed by these surfaces leading to higher sensible heat flux a similar result is also reported by yang et al 2011 over beijing where rapid urbanization led to an increase in the temperature by 0 4 c per decade in the past 20 years as a result of the combined impact of lulcc and cv we observe an overall decrease in the et from 1 9 mm day to 1 63 mm day with increase in the es from 0 6 mm day to 0 95 mm day and a decrease in the et from 1 mm day to 0 4 mm day the overall rnet value increases from 132 w m2 to 134 3 w m2 with increases in the h flux from 63 w m2 to 64 w m2 and increase in the g flux from 7 8 w m2 to 8 1 w m2 over the aw climate zone we observe a decrease in the et from 2 35 mm day to 2 mm day with a decrease in the et from 1 2 mm day to 0 5 mm day the rnet values show a slight increase from 130 23 w m2 to 131 8 w m2 on the other hand over the bsh climate zone a decrease in the et from 0 6 mm day to 0 3 mm day leads to an overall decrease in the total et from 1 3 mm day to 1 mm day the rnet values show a slight increase from 130 27 w m2 to 131 7 w m2 5 discussion previous studies have focussed on the impact of climate on the hydrology and water availability over global regional and basin scales her et al 2019 pattnayak et al 2018 shah and mishra 2016 and have concluded that the regional hydrological scenario is affected to a large extent by climate variability shah and mishra 2016 reported a decrease in the water availability over the majority of the large river basins over india between 1948 and 2012 as a result of the changing climate which they attributed to the decline in the monsoon season precipitation on the other hand lulc patterns have also been linked to the decrease in the water availability over india paul et al 2016 garg et al 2019 however combined studies of lulc and climate variability over india have highlighted the fact that the impact of climate on the regional hydrology is much higher than that of lulc chawla and mujumdar 2015 tsarouchi and buytaert 2018 among the lulc patterns deforestation and urbanization are the two major lulc changes over india in the past decades as a result of the deforestation we observe a decrease in the overall et over the affected grids which can be attributed to the increase in albedo and less deep rooting vegetation on the other hand urbanization also leads to a lower et as a result of less vegetation and therefore decreased transpiration the impact of the lulcc on the hydrological processes is quite varied over the arid and humid regions of india the arid regions are generally characterized by lower precipitation higher temperature and lack of vegetation among the arid regions we observe that the arid regions over nw india exhibit lower sm throughout the year as compared to the arid regions on the leeward side of wg on the other hand the humid regions are characterized by moderate to high precipitation with generally higher sm values throughout the year the impact of deforestation in these areas can be seen in the simulated et values over the arid and humid zones we observe larger decrease in the et over the aw climate zone fig s8 in the supplementary document where 2 6 of the total area is affected by deforestation as compared to the arid bsh zone where 3 of the total area has undergone similar lulc change between 1985 and 2005 this can be attributed to the higher soil moisture content in the aw climate zone throughout the year also the et in arid regions is generally moisture limited in case of urbanization around 2 of the total area of the aw zone has experienced transformation from croplands to urban areas whereas around 3 8 of the total area of the arid bsh zone has undergone urbanization as a result of this transformation we observe a large decrease in the transpiration component which ultimately results in lower et over the affected grids see fig s9 in the supplementary document however the magnitude of the decrease is larger over the aw zone than the bsh zone which can again be coupled to the soil moisture availability over the regions croplands over the aw climate zone exhibit higher et during the decade 1981 90 which is later reduced substantially till 2001 10 after urbanization land surface heat fluxes act as a link between the atmosphere and land surface and hence play an important role in the energy and water cycle precipitation is one of the major factors affecting the partitioning of the available energy into le and h the pre monsoon season in india is characterized by low rainfall throughout the whole domain combined with high temperatures and low soil moisture during this period most of the available surface energy is used for sensible heat flux this is particularly evident over the arid and semi arid regions which mostly constitute the bsh climate zone where h is significantly higher as compared to the le as also observed by raja et al 2013 for the other climate zones the sensible latent heat remains higher lower in the pre monsoon season which can be attributed to the lower soil moisture content in the pre monsoon season throughout india the annual cycle for the heat fluxes over different climate zones indicate that while the aw and bsh zones are mostly dominated by h during the pre monsoon season there is a considerable difference in the br values for these two regions the br for the arid bsh zone around 15 is significantly higher than for the aw zone 5 which can be attributed to the lower soil moisture content in the bsh compared to the aw zone indicating the strong influence of soil moisture over the partitioning of the heat fluxes the cwa zone experiences generally higher rainfall than the other climate zones and exhibits higher soil moisture contents as well this zone remains mostly dominated by le resulting in lower br values burman et al 2019 the monsoon period in india is generally characterized by high rainfall along with higher soil moisture contents and higher available energy as a result the monsoon season shows larger latent heat fluxes than sensible heat fluxes morwal et al 2017 reported that the monsoon season br and h values remain low over the northern peninsular india the central indian region exhibits higher le and lower br during the monsoon season including the cwa and aw climate zones during wet conditions et is mostly energy limited rather than moisture limited however over the arid nw region the low soil moisture condition still regulates the total et resulting in higher br values 10 and lower ef values close to zero the post monsoon season over india is generally characterized by higher soil moisture contents than the pre monsoon season while the available energy is considerably lower hence the evapotranspiration is mostly energy limited during the post monsoon season particularly over the cwa zone over the southern peninsular india the available energy is higher than for northern india coupled with higher soil moisture content over peninsular india resulting in higher le over the aw climate zone and higher ef values 0 5 it is to be noted that clm4 5 used in this study is not calibrated as is typical the case for land surface models therefore discrepancies between the simulation results and the reference datasets are expected this is also related to a lack of available precise data for calibration over india the products that we use now in the comparisons are also subject to larger uncertainties related to biases in remote sensing observations and model assumptions it is therefore unclear whether those observation datasets correspond better to reality than our modelled values one of the limitations of this study is the absence of irrigation in the model runs studies have highlighted the role of irrigation in influencing the hydrological cycle and energy balance on the regional as well as the global scale sacks et al 2009 lobell et al 2009 puma and cook 2010 chen and jeong 2018 de vrese et al 2018 about one third of the crop land over india is irrigated irrigation largely affects the simulated et and sensible heat causing evaporative surface cooling another limitation of this study is that the representation of the leaf area index and the pfts for tropical trees in clm4 5 is not realistic as the model is strongly tuned towards temperate regions of the world hence the performance of clm4 5 over the tropical regions need to be further enhanced through the incorporation of pfts representing tropical trees and multiple crop cycles throughout the year boas et al 2021 the model performance could also be improved by the assimilation of observed leaf area index and soil moisture through coupling of clm4 5 with a data assimilation framework strebel et al 2022 assimilation of observed lai and sm into clm4 5 would most probably result in simulated values closer to measurements at least for soil moisture and most probably also for et hence in order to ensure more realistic modelling results it would be necessary to incorporate vegetation dynamics data assimilation and irrigation into the land surface model and study their impact on the water and energy cycles over india which we plan as a part of a future study 6 conclusion the main objective of this study was to quantify the individual and combined impacts of land use land cover change lulcc and inter decadal climate variation cv on the water and energy cycles over india a scenario based approach was designed using the community land model clm version 4 5 to investigate the impact of lulcc and cv on the evapotranspiration soil moisture and radiation components over the period 1981 2010 the input datasets from various sources and agencies were incorporated in this study such as the decadal lulc maps over india from the oak ridge national laboratory ornl nasa and the soil maps from the international geosphere biosphere program igbp the atmospheric forcing dataset was the era interim reanalysis but precipitation data were replaced with the gridded precipitation dataset from the indian meteorological department imd the major findings of this study are india experiences highest et values during the monsoon season followed by the post monsoon season while the lowest values are observed during the pre monsoon season both the ground evaporation and canopy transpiration component contribute largely to the total et during the monsoon season during the pre monsoon season ground evaporation plays a major role while canopy transpiration dominates the total et during the post monsoon season mean values of rnet are highest over india in the monsoon season while values are lowest in the post monsoon season in the monsoon season the largest part of rnet is used for the latent heat flux but sensible heat flux for the non monsoon period the individual impact of the inter decadal climate variation causes a variation in the total et and net radiation by 5 4 and 1 0 respectively while that of the lulcc causes an overall decrease in the et values by 0 3 calculated over the period 1981 2010 comparing the period 1991 2010 with 1981 1990 the major lulcc over india between 1985 and 2005 include the conversion of forest to croplands deforestation and croplands to urban areas urbanization deforestation leads to decrease in the ground evaporation and canopy transpiration component leading to an overall decrease in the total et by 29 over the affected grid cells urbanization causes a decrease in the canopy transpiration component and an increase in the ground evaporation component resulting in an overall decrease in the total et by 16 over the affected grid cells the impact of inter decadal climate variation results in larger variations in the et and its components particularly in the pre monsoon season over the aw and bsh climate zones as compared to the cwa climate zone overall cv has a larger impact on the energy and water cycles over india in the period 1980 2010 and on a larger scale as compared to lulcc for future research it would be important to consider irrigation as well as a considerable part of cropland in india is irrigated in addition the representation of crops and the development of crops during the year should be better represented it can be expected that those model improvements would affect the relative importance of lulcc and cv but it is very unlikely that the main conclusion of this paper cv dominates over lulcc during the last decades would be affected

3011,aim of this work is the assessment of the individual and combined impacts of land use land cover change lulcc and inter decadal climate variations cv on the water and energy cycles over india given extensive land use land cover change over the last decades in this study we quantify the contributions of lulc and cv on changes in the water and energy cycles over the indian subcontinent through a scenario based approach with community land model version 4 5 clm4 5 model runs from 1981 to 2010 the approach involves four simulation scenarios i the first scenario considers no lulcc or cv lulc is fixed and the atmospheric forcings for 1981 1990 are repeated in the decades afterwards ii the second scenario considers only the impact of cv iii the third scenario considers only the effect of lulcc by updating the lulc every 10 years and iv the fourth scenario considers the combined impact of lulcc and cv lulcc causes an overall decrease in the evapotranspiration et and soil moisture sm by 0 3 and 0 1 respectively comparing 1991 2010 with 1981 1990 while the net radiation changes 1 on the other hand cv caused an increase in the et sm and net radiation by 5 4 1 5 and 1 0 respectively in spite of decrease of precipitation of 6 6 the combined effect of lulcc and cv leads to an increase in the overall et by 3 8 among the lulc transitions deforestation and urbanization are found to be the major causes for hydrological changes over the decades but their impact is much smaller since cv has a greater impact on the hydrological cycles over india than lulc the in depth understanding of the distinct contributions of lulcc and cv on the water and energy cycles in tropical and subtropical regions can be used for framing future water resources planning and management policies keywords inter decadal climate variation landuse landcover change impact assessment clm4 5 india data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrological processes of any region are known to be significantly altered by two dominant drivers land use land cover lulc and climate vörösmarty et al 2000 nijssen et al 2001 oki and kanae 2006 wada et al 2011 sherwood and fu 2014 climate change cc has a direct impact on the regional precipitation temperature and humidity ross et al 2018 mishra et al 2018 which in turn affects components of the water and energy cycles lulc change lulcc indirectly affects these cycles through changes in albedo altering the partitioning of precipitation into components such as evaporation transpiration runoff interception and infiltration which affects soil moisture contents and therefore also the energy cycle sterling et al 2013 it is important to quantify how these two drivers combined and individually affect the terrestrial water and energy cycles in order to ensure proper management of water resources and derive reliable adaptation policies however isolating the individual effects of lulcc and cc is challenging owing to the complex interactions and feedback mechanisms between land surface and atmospheric processes the impacts of lulc and cc on the hydrology can be assessed using the following approaches a experimental approach brown et al 2005 b statistical approach berliner et al 2000 c empirical approach mas et al 2014 and d physically based modelling approach hegerl and zwiers 2011 statistical techniques mostly include methods like mann kendall test and sen slope method while the empirical approach refers to the use of conceptual modelling software such as land change modeller among these methods physically based modelling is considered to be the most appealing and widely used method to assess the impact of lulcc and cc as they take both the physical and meteorological conditions of the study region into consideration while providing detailed representations of the energy and water cycles wang et al 2012 however simulation of these processes is challenging due to the complex interconnections between different sub processes of the energy and water cycles and their corresponding feedback loops fatichi et al 2016 distributed hydrological models dhms which focus mainly on the simulation of the surface and subsurface water fluxes are generally used to simulate the water cycle of a basin or at smaller scales however the representation of the energy fluxes is mostly approximated or even neglected in the dhms which is one of its major drawbacks hingerl et al 2016 on the other hand land surface models lsms provide a detailed understanding of the complex interactions between hydrological biophysical and biogeochemical processes hence lsms have been widely used to study the impact of the changes in land properties and climate on hydrological processes over various regions in the world including the temperate devaraju et al 2015 gates and liess 2001 snyder et al 2004 and tropical regions feddema et al 2005 medvigy et al 2013 snyder 2010 generally the impact of lulc and cc on the water and energy cycles varies greatly for the temperate and tropical regions bala et al 2010 brovkin et al 2013 according to sanderson et al 2012 deforestation causes two opposite effects increased albedo leading to a radiative cooling effect and decreased et leading to a non radiative warming effect previous studies have reported cooling in the mid latitude regions due to historical deforestation which they attributed to the increased surface albedo betts et al 2007 davin and de noblet ducoudré 2010 in the tropical regions deforestation causes a warming effect due to larger decrease in the et owing to changes in the latent and sensible heat fluxes as a result of the reduced leaf area index perugini et al 2017 few studies have attempted to quantify the alterations in the water and energy cycles over the complex indian subcontinent most of the previous studies over india focused on the individual impacts of lulcc mawalagedara and oglesby 2012 paul et al 2016 zope et al 2016 or cc sapkota et al 2013 tsarouchi et al 2014 singh et al 2014a wagner et al 2013 these studies used lsms and focused on selected hydrological fluxes and states like streamflow ali et al 2019 soil moisture mishra et al 2018 or energy fluxes however we would like to emphasize that the primary goal of a land surface model is to accurately reproduce the states of the soil vegetation atmosphere continuum including the water and energy fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere land surface models are not particularly strong in modelling river discharge some studies have attempted to quantify the combined impact of lulcc and cc on the terrestrial water cycle mango et al 2011 cuo et al 2013 chawla and mujumdar 2015 tsarouchi and buytaert 2018 tsarouchi and buytaert 2018 focused on the impact of lulcc and cc on the past and near future 2000 2035 streamflow in the upper ganga basin using the joint uk land environment simulator jules model with coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 outputs from 21 different general circulation models gcms and 15 future lulcc pathway projections they reported that cc plays an important role in increasing high flows in the upper ganga basin while lulcc leads to a decrease in low flows overall it was concluded that cc is the major driver of hydrological change over the upper ganga basin in the near future in short most studies focus on the impact of lulcc and cc on the streamflow as a direct measure of available freshwater for the region milly et al 2005 however lulcc and cc affect not only the streamflow but also alter other components of the water and energy cycles which needs to be studied in depth in order to provide more insights in the regional modification of the water and energy cycles moreover the studies are carried out generally at a basin or local scale sapkota et al 2013 chawla and mujumdar 2015 tsarouchi and buytaert 2018 basin scale studies might not be able to highlight the impact of the regional or global scale circulation processes necessitating the need for a regional scale study döll and vassolo 2004 comprehensive studies at the regional scale are scarce especially over complex regions like india which has experienced large lulcc mainly in the form of deforestation and urbanization and has also undergone major shifts in the precipitation and temperature patterns due to cc in the last half century it is noted that most of the past cc studies focus on changes in the climate variables over a long period of time generally much longer than 30 years for instance over 100 years in case of chawla and mujumdar 2015 and tsarouchi and buytaert 2018 climate change studies generally require data for longer time periods since the changes in climate are difficult to detect without long term data records however in this study we focus on a period of 30 years with the aim of analyzing the impact of inter decadal climate variations cv on the energy and water cycles over india here inter decadal climate variation cv refers to the changes in the components of the energy and water cycle occurring in any decade with reference to the first decade hence instead of focusing on the long term changes we only focus on the changes occurring on a decadal scale the main objectives of this study are a to assess the isolated and combined impacts of lulc and cv on the water and energy cycles over the indian sub continent b to identify the dominant drivers behind these changes their evolution over time and regional hotspots of these changes the structure of the paper is as follows a brief description of the study area is given in section 2 followed by the methodology and data inputs in the section 3 the results are presented in section 4 followed by the discussion in section 5 and conclusions in section 6 2 study area fig 1 a shows the spatial distribution of the elevation pattern over india for this analysis the climate zone classification given by koeppen geiger beck et al 2018 was utilized as shown in fig 1b the koeppen geiger classification categorizes climate into 5 main categories and 30 sub categories based on threshold values of precipitation and air temperature koppen 1936 beck et al 2018 in this study the koeppen geiger climate map from beck et al 2018 is used for further analysis given the higher resolution accuracy and use of multiple climate datasets the zones are defined based on the criteria for basic climate type which are further subdivided based on the temperature or dryness supplementary information table s1 beck et al 2018 the major climate zones over india include tropical savanna climate aw tropical monsoon climate am arid desert hot climate bwh arid desert cold climate bwk arid steppe hot climate bsh temperate dry winter hot summer climate cwa temperate dry winter warm summer climate cwb and cold dry warm summer climate dsb among these aw bsh and cwa cover much of the indian subcontinent the aw climate zone covers most of central and southern india and is characterized by croplands and fallow lands the average daily precipitation over this climate zone is around 2 9 mm day india 3 1 mm day and the average daily temperature 26 4 c india 24 7 c the bsh climate zone covers mostly the drier regions of western and southern india over this climate zone the average daily precipitation and temperature are around 2 1 mm day and 26 9 c respectively the cwa climate zone covers the regions of ne and eastern india including parts of the ganga and brahmaputra basins and includes one of the most extensive agricultural zones of india over this climate zone the average daily precipitation and temperature are around 3 4 mm day and 25 6 c respectively further analysis is restricted to these three major climate zones that cover the majority of india aw bsh and cwa the spatial variation of mean annual precipitation over india is shown in fig 1c for this study three seasons are defined over india i pre monsoon season lasting from february till may ii monsoon season ranging from june till september and iii post monsoon season from october till january precipitation amounts are high during the monsoon season about 6 mm day on average over india and relatively low during the pre and post monsoon seasons around 1 6 mm day spatially the highest precipitation 10 mm day is observed over western ghats wg and north eastern ne india during the monsoon season as a result of the south east monsoon winds the lowest precipitation is observed over the north western nw india throughout the year especially during the pre monsoon season during the post monsoon season the peninsular regions particularly the eastern coastal regions receive higher rainfall 6 mm day as a result of the retreating monsoon winds also known as the ne monsoon during the 1981 2010 we observed a decrease in the mean daily rainfall values over india particularly in the pre monsoon season also the temperature shows a warming trend during this period in the pre monsoon and monsoon season summer monsoon precipitation has been declining since 1950 according to observational records kulkarni 2012 with considerable decrease in regions of the indo gangetic plains and the western ghats roxy et al 2015 krishnan et al 2016 suggest that the observed changes are a result of the radiative effects of increased aerosol emissions and regional scale lulcc which have offset the precipitation enhancing tendency of green house gas warming in the past decades the spatial distribution of the seasonal mean rainfall values over india during 1981 2010 is shown in supplementary fig s1 similarly the spatial distribution of the seasonal mean temperature values over india during 1981 2010 is shown in supplementary fig s2 the years 2002 2004 and 2009 were declared as drought years by the india meteorological department imd india is currently one of the severe water stressed countries and is on the verge of being water scarce in the coming years garg and hassan 2007 ever increasing population and changing climate along with the alterations in the land use over the years have added stress on the available water resources in the past decades india has experienced lulcc mainly in the form of decrease in forest cover and increase in croplands tian et al 2014 roy et al 2015 between 1880 and 2010 an overall decrease in the forest cover by 26 million hectares a decrease in grasslands by 20 million hectares an increase in total croplands by 48 million hectares and a 5 fold increase in the urban areas from 0 46 to 2 04 million hectares were observed tian et al 2014 according to roy et al 2015 between 1985 and 2005 the lulc in india underwent significant modifications between 1985 and 2005 the total area that changed was 0 10 percent of the country s entire geographic area 340 932 km2 land cover in the form of forests has been steadily decreasing while crops and built up area have increased agriculture 47 5 to 49 and built up areas 1 to 1 5 experienced large increases between 1985 and 2005 whereas forests 23 to 22 2 and wastelands 2 6 to 2 3 experienced significant decreases mixed forest savannah woodlands scattered trees and mangroves all experienced minor increases within distinct forest types all of the other forest classes either stayed the same or decreased slightly barren land 2 to 2 1 plantations 2 4 to 2 38 and shrub land 5 56 to 5 65 all saw minor changes in their areas and grassland remained steady along with the lulcc india has also experienced changes in the precipitation and temperature patterns in the last decades several studies have reported an increasing trend in temperature as a result of the changing climate kothawale et al 2010 ross et al 2018 sinha et al 2018 vinnarasi and dhanya 2019 between 1881 and 1997 an increasing trend in the mean annual temperature at the rate of 0 57 c per 100 years has been observed pant and kumar 1997 similarly subash and sikka 2014 reported a significant increasing trend of 0 78 c per 100 years in the annual maximum temperatures over india between 1904 and 2003 spatially the highest warming over the last 50 years is observed over the arid northwest nw india followed by parts of southern india ross et al 2018 similarly the impact of cc on the precipitation distribution patterns and extreme events over india has been studied by many researchers rajeevan et al 2008 singh et al 2014b vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 precipitation amounts decreased in the past decades taxak et al 2014 duhan and pandey 2013 roxy et al 2015 observed a decrease in the summer rainfall over central eastern india by about 10 20 in the last 100 years fukushima et al 2019 conducted trend analysis of the seasonal precipitation over india for the long term 1901 2013 and middle term period 1958 2013 and concluded that central and eastern india experienced a decreasing trend 1 2 mm year in the long term summer monsoon rainfall while the western coastal regions showed an increasing trend in the monsoon rainfall at the rate of 5 mm year over the period of 1985 2014 radhakrishnan et al 2017 reported a decreasing trend in the annual and summer monsoon rainfall along with an increasing trend in the temperature according to goswami et al 2006 there is a considerable increase in rainfall frequency and intense rain which is compensated by decreasing moderate events and the seasonal rainfall does not show a significant increase according to world bank during 1901 2019 there is no significant change in the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr however a weak decreasing trend has been observed in the ismr between 1980 and 2019 additionally the frequency of dry spells during 1981 2011 is observed to be 27 higher than the previous 30 years 1951 1980 along with more intense wet spells during ismr kulkarni et al 2020 reported a 75 increase in the frequency of daily precipitation extremes with intensity 150 mm day over central india during 1951 2015 and an overall increase in the frequency of localised short duration high intensity rainfall during 1951 2015 as a result of urbanization on the other hand the average annual mean temperature and average annual maximum temperature increased over the period 1901 2015 0 62 c 100 years resp 0 99 c 100 years during 1986 2015 the mean temperature has increased at a rate of 0 15 c per decade with significant increases in the frequency of warm extremes over india particularly in the pre monsoon season sanjay et al 2020 another study by mohammad and goswami 2019 focused on the precipitation and temperature trends over major indian cities located in different climate zones they reported a significant increasing trend in temperature except cities in the bsh and cwa zones while decreasing trends in the annual and seasonal precipitation patterns are seen over cities in the aw bsh and cwa zones 3 methodology 3 1 model description the community land model v4 5 clm4 5 is the land surface model component of the community earth system model cesm developed by the national centre for atmospheric research ncar lawrence et al 2011 oleson et al 2013 the clm4 5 model simulates the exchange of energy and water between the soil vegetation and atmosphere as well as the partitioning of radiation into heat fluxes and partitioning of precipitation between evaporation transpiration runoff and infiltration the sub grid scale heterogeneity in clm4 5 is represented through five different land use types glacier lake wetland urban and vegetated where the lulc is defined as the percentage coverage of each land unit type in a grid cell also sub model schemes are defined for each land unit type to calculate the water and energy fluxes for individual grid cells the movement of water in the soil in clm4 5 is assumed to be one dimensional i e vertically downwards towards the groundwater table without any interaction with the parallel soil columns kim and mohanty 2016 the soil water flow in clm4 5 is calculated using a modified one

represented in the model through 16 different plant functional types pfts and vegetation characteristics such as the leaf area index lai stem area index sai and canopy height which are defined for each pft clm4 5 uses a multi layer canopy model which simulates fluxes using combined information about plant canopy structure leaf physiology and radiative transfer bonan et al 2014 in this model the canopy is divided into multiple leaf layers with sunlit and sunshaded fractions and photosynthesis stomatal conductance leaf temperature and energy balance are coupled at each layer for vegetated surfaces the water vapor flux is partitioned into ground and vegetation fluxes which depends on the ground and vegetation temperatures and specific humidity simulation of the photosynthesis process is based on the farquhar photosynthesis model farquhar et al 1980 while the transpiration is simulated based on the ball berry conductance model ball et al 1987 according the sib2 model by sellers et al 1996 the total evapotranspiration in clm is the sum of the transpiration from the vegetation the evaporation from the ground and the evaporation from the water stored in the canopy the canopy

water fluxes through the alterations in the lai and corresponding changes in the albedo in clm4 5 the solar radiant fluxes transmitted absorbed and reflected by the canopy and the ground surface are

buildings and consists of sunlit and shaded walls roofs and impervious and pervious floors the impervious floor represents surfaces such as roads and parking lots and is hydrologically inactive while the pervious floor represents hydrologically active surfaces such as lawns and parks the vegetation in the urban areas is represented in clm4 5 as a separate vegetation tile in which the vegetation does not interact with the urban canopy detailed description of the various processes in clm 4 5 can be found in oleson et al 2013 3 2 model setup and input data the standalone clm4 5 model is setup at 10 10 km resolution over the domain ranging from 8 n to 38 n and from 68 e to 98 e the model consists of 360 360 grid cells and 15 soil layers the elevation and slope data over this domain are obtained from united states geological survey usgs hydro1k data verdin and greenlee 1996 the elevation over india ranges from 0 to 5000 m above mean sea level amsl with the highest altitudes in the himalayan mountain ranges in the north and ne india where the elevation is generally above 3000 m amsl see fig 1a similarly the slopes are steepest in the himalayan region where they range from 10 to 21 whereas for most of india the slope value is smaller than 4 the leaf area index lai data used in the model is based on the modis 1 km lai data myneni et al 2002 as described in lawrence and chase 2006 while the data for soil properties are obtained from the international geosphere biosphere program global soil data task 2000 the medium resolution decadal land use land cover lulc maps 30 m for india are from the oak ridge national laboratory ornl of the national space administration agency nasa roy et al 2015 these maps are available at 10 years interval for 1985 1995 and 2005 and were developed by using forest cover fsi 2013 vegetation cover joshi et al 2006 biome roy et al 2006 bio diversity maps and land cover information kandrika and roy 2008 incorporating satellite remote sensing data from various sources to analyse the changes in lulc over the decades using visual interpretation techniques in the present study the lulc maps were re gridded to 10 km resolution to be used as input into clm4 5 using the pft mapping scheme by paul et al 2016 supplementary information table s2 in clm4 5 the bare pft class is defined for all non vegetated land covers including the open water bodies and bare lands ke et al 2012 since the lulc data is only available for one year in the middle of a decade the lulc data for the whole decade e g 1981 1990 is assigned from the available year 1985 similarly the lulc data from 1995 and 2005 are assigned for the decades 1991 2000 and 2001 2010 respectively clm4 5 incorporates the lulc change by changing the pft types and the associated vegetation characteristics such as the annual lai cycle and canopy height which are defined for each pft individually hence the values of the lai and other vegetation properties are changed according to the change in pft type distribution at an interval of 10 years reliability of the atmospheric forcing dataset is one of the major factors affecting the model results wang et al 2016 several forcing datasets are available from different global agencies such as the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf and others however these datasets have considerable uncertainties thus necessitating a proper evaluation of the data before application to a particular region yang and kim 2017 several previous studies have focused on the inter comparison and evaluation of the different available atmospheric datasets over india ghodichore et al 2018 misra et al 2012 rana et al 2015 shah and mishra 2014 and have concluded that the era interim reanalysis dataset and merra reanalysis dataset exhibit superior performance in terms of precipitation and temperature characteristics ghodichore et al 2018 in this study the era interim reanalysis dataset dee et al 2011 was used for extracting atmospheric forcing data for clm 4 5 era interim is the global reanalysis dataset released by the ecmwf and has been utilized for various inter comparison and modelling studies over different regions of the world e g lorenz and kunstmann 2012 chen et al 2014 shah and mishra 2014 kishore et al 2016 era interim provides global data for various atmospheric variables such as precipitation temperature and wind speed at a spatial resolution of 80 km t255 from the year 1979 till mid 2019 however the precipitation data from era interim is replaced by the gridded precipitation dataset from the imd pai et al 2014 while the other meteorological forcings are taken from era interim the imd dataset incorporated daily precipitation data from around 6500 stations across india and gridded them to the uniform 0 25 resolution using the interpolation algorithm developed by shepard 1968 the imd dataset has been used as a reference dataset for several inter comparison performance analysis studies e g ghodichore et al 2018 chaudhary et al 2017 and analysis of hydrological extremes vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 over india 3 3 observation dataset 3 3 1 grun dataset grun ghiggi et al 2019 is a machine learning based observationally driven global gridded reconstruction of monthly runoff rates the data is available on a 0 5 x0 5 wgs84 grid and spans the years 1902 to 2014 runoff observations from a global collection of in situ streamflow observations of relatively small catchments 2500 km2 are used to train the machine learning algorithm which uses gridded precipitation and temperature from a century long reanalysis product as predictors in places with limited or no observational coverage grun provides a unique picture of large scale characteristics of runoff variability the grun dataset ghiggi et al 2019 is publicly available in netcdf 4 format and can be downloaded for free at https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 9228176 one of the limitations of the grun dataset is that glacier melting is not explicitly included in the model additionally since the model is purely forced with precipitation and temperature grun is not able to explicitly account for the effects of local human river flow regulation dam operations in particular on the rebuilt hydrological regimes grun also struggles with the accuracy of runoff over the mountainous regions owing to the coarse resolution of the input meteorological forcings over hilly regions 3 3 2 global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam miralles et al 2011 is a global gridded evaporation model that is designed to be driven solely by remote sensing observations mostly based on microwave remotely sensed soil moisture and vegetation optical depth in the past gleam data sets on evaporation and root zone soil moisture have been widely used to examine spatial variability and trends in the water cycle e g miralles et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 gleam v3 includes a redesigned depiction of evaporative stress an optimised water balance module and a new soil moisture data assimilation approach the data set is based on satellite observed soil moisture vegetation optical depth and snow water equivalent reanalysis air temperature and radiation and a multi source precipitation product globally available for the 36 year period 1980 2015 the gleam dataset is available for download from www gleam eu 3 3 3 india water resources information system india water resources information system india wris is a joint initiative by the central water commission cwc and the indian space research organization isro with the objective of providing data and information for assessment monitoring and development of water resources in india all long term information regarding the climatic data surface water groundwater availability water quality and water extraction are available in the public domain at https indiawris gov in wris in this study we used the timeseries of the observed streamflow from the india water resources information system india wris https indiawris gov in wris rivermonitoring for eight stations namely agraharam takli konta koida mandaleshwar hoshangabad sarangkheda and bamnidhi stations falling under five major river basins the details of the stations are given in table 1 3 4 model scenarios in the present study four different scenarios are evaluated in order to isolate the impacts of lulc and cv details of these scenarios are shown in table 2 the first scenario considers pristine conditions without any lulcc or cv no change scenario in this case the lulc is fixed from the situation in 1985 and the atmospheric forcing data for 1981 1990 are repeated for the subsequent decades the second scenario considers only the impact of cv where the lulc map is fixed as of 1985 s and the atmospheric forcings are changed from 1981 to 2010 the third scenario considers the effect of lulcc only by updating the lulc every 10 years while repeating the atmospheric forcings from 1981 to 1990 throughout the model run the fourth scenario considers the combined impact of lulcc and cv where both the lulc and climate data are updated throughout the run 3 5 model simulation and analysis the model results are analysed for highlighting the impact of lulc and or cv on evapotranspiration soil moisture

energy into the heat fluxes including latent heat flux lh and sensible heat flux h is expressed in form of the bowen ratio br and the evaporative fraction ef 16 br h le 17 ef le le h the variation of these components for the different case scenarios presented in table 1 is investigated for each season and over the three major climate zones over india the hydrological variables and indices are further analysed based on the major lulc transitions that occurred over india during different decades the performance of the model in simulating runoff et and sm is analysed through comparison with observed data from india wris and grun for runoff and gleam for et and sm for this study the streamflow data for eight stations falling under five major river basins in india are obtained from india wris which is then standardized using z score as defined below 18 z x μ σ where z is the z score µ is the mean x is the observed value and σ is the standard deviation of the dataset in order to compare the monthly values of standardized modelled runoff from clm4 5 with the standardized runoff from grun and standardized observed streamflow from india wris the percentage bias pbias and nash sutcliffe efficiency ns are calculated using the following equations 19 p b i a s i 1 n r i s i i 1 n r i 100 20 n s 1 i 1 n r i s i 2 i 1 n r i r 2 where r i is the reference standardized runoff streamflow value s i is the simulated standardized runoff from clm4 5 r is the mean value of the reference standardized runoff streamflow n is the time series at monthly scale 4 results 4 1 evaluation of the real world hydrological scenario over india from 1981 to 2010 the simulated seasonal distribution of et over india shows highest et during the monsoon season around 3 mm day while lower values are found for the pre monsoon around 1 2 mm day and the post monsoon season around 1 4 mm day as shown in fig 2 this coincides with the annual precipitation distribution and points to the fact that et is often moisture limited over india spatially the highest et values are observed over the wg and the ne regions 5 mm day during monsoon while the lowest values are observed over the nw arid regions 0 5 mm day during pre monsoon the pre monsoon season in india is characterized by low rainfall throughout the whole domain combined with high temperatures and low soil moisture during this period most of the rnet is partitioned for the sensible heat flux this is particularly evident over the arid and semi arid regions which mostly constitute the bsh climate zone where h is significantly higher than le fig 3 the mean pre monsoon h value over the bsh zone is around 102 w m2 with soil moisture content around 0 25 m3 m3 fig 4 compared to a h value of 61 w m2 supplementary document fig s3 and sm of 0 3 m3 m3 over the relatively humid cwa climate zone the aw and cwa regions have higher simulated pre monsoon et 1 2 mm day and 1 8 mm day than other climate zones although the aw zone has the highest rnet value the total et over the aw zone is lower than for the cwa zone related to the higher sm content for the cwa climate zone around 0 3 m3 m3 the aw and bsh have relatively large h fluxes for the pre monsoon season but with considerable differences in the br values for these two regions the br for the arid bsh zone around 15 is significantly higher than for the aw zone 5 which can be attributed to the lower sm in the bsh zone than the aw zone indicating the strong influence of the sm over the partitioning of the heat fluxes the cwa zone generally experiences higher rainfall than the other climate zones and exhibits therefore also higher sm this zone has mostly higher latent heat fluxes than sensible heat fluxes resulting in higher ef values and lower br values the monsoon period in india is generally characterized by high rainfall amounts along with higher sm and high available energy as a result the monsoon season is generally more dominated by le as the largest part of the available energy is used for le this is the case for the cwa and aw climate zones where as a result of the high sm br values are low and ef values high over the aw and cwa zone monsoon et values are around 4 mm day and es amounts to 50 aw and 46 5 cwa of the total et for these two zones the bsh zone has lower average sm contents and therefore more of the available energy is used for sensible heat flux 46 and less for latent heat flux 54 compared to other climate zones the monsoon rnet values are around 150 w m2 over india and the majority of the available energy is used for latent heat flux related to the high sm content over india this is also evident from the high ef values all over india during the monsoon season supplementary document fig s4 the decadal distribution of the ef values over india for different seasons are shown in figs s5 to s7 in the supplementary document during the post monsoon season the available sm is also relatively high however the available energy is smaller leading to energy limited et conditions all over india this is for example the case for the cwa climate zone where the average rnet value is around 80 w m 2 in the post monsoon season and et values in the range of 1 5 mm day out of which 58 is contributed by the transpiration component et as a result of the relatively higher sm values in the post monsoon season similarly high et values 2 2 mm day are observed over the peninsular india aw zone with et contributing 67 of the total et the post monsoon rnet values over the aw zone are in the range of 120 w m2 which is partitioned almost equally into le and h with g values being negligible on the other hand for the bsh region 71 of the available energy is used for sensible heat flux the average soil moisture content in the post monsoon season is around 0 25 m3 m3 for the bsh zone with higher values at the leeward side of the wg and lower values in the regions in nw india post monsoon et over the bsh zone 1 mm day is higher than in the pre monsoon 0 5 mm day which can be attributed to the higher sm in this season than the pre monsoon et plays an important role in the post monsoon et with a contribution of around 59 to the total et in order to evaluate the performance of clm4 5 in simulating the hydrological variables over different regions of india we compare the simulated surface runoff from clm4 5 with the grun gridded runoff dataset over different climate zones of india the annual cycle of runoff over the aw region fig 5 a shows that clm4 5 is able to simulate the pre monsoon and post monsoon runoff satisfactorily while underestimating the peak runoff during the monsoon season over the bsh region we note that the observed grun runoff is higher than the simulated runoff for the monsoon and post monsoon seasons however it is possible that the grun algorithm overestimates runoff over the arid regions as it produces higher runoff than the actual natural streamflow ghiggi et al 2019 however on the other hand it can be stated that grun takes the impact of irrigation and other land management practices into account which are neglected in clm siebert et al 2015 also observed overestimated runoff over arid regions with intensive irrigation activities the cwa climate zone also exhibits a similar pattern where grun runoff is higher than clm4 5 over almost the whole year since the cwa climate zone covers most of the ganges basin which is known to be an agriculture intensive area the resulting irrigation can be the reason for the higher runoff values observed in the grun dataset throughout the year overall we found the performance of clm4 5 in simulating the runoff over india to be reasonable fig 6 shows that the spatial distribution of runoff simulated by clm4 5 does not differ much from the grun runoff in the pre monsoon and monsoon periods over most of india with some differences over wg ne and the foothills of the himalayas the bias in monsoon runoff reveals that clm has lower monsoon runoff than grun particularly over high rainfall regions of wg and ne on the other hand clm exhibits higher post monsoon runoff than grun over most of the eastern half of india and parts of central peninsular india fig 5d shows the annual sm cycles from gleam and clm4 5 over the aw climate zone and we observe that clm4 5 has higher sm values than gleam for almost the whole year except for the early monsoon season on the contrary the results for the cwa zone show that the clm4 5 sm is lower than gleam soil moisture throughout the year except for the later part of the monsoon season over the bsh zone we observe quite high sm values in clm4 5 throughout the year probably clm4 5 is not able to reproduce the sm values correctly over the arid semi arid regions of india the spatial distribution of the seasonal sm values over india fig 7 shows that clm has higher monsoon sm over the entire central and ne region compared to gleam on the other hand pre and post monsoon sm are higher in clm than for gleam over the central portion of india we also compared the clm4 5 simulated et values with the gleam data and found that over the bsh zone fig 5h the values of simulated et are very close to the gleam values however the cwa zone exhibits higher gleam et values than clm et values during the pre monsoon season while the monsoon and post monsoon et are in agreement as for the aw zone clm4 5 has lower et than gleam throughout the year particularly over the pre monsoon and monsoon season one of the reasons for the lower et in clm4 5 compared to gleam is the absence of irrigation in the model since gleam uses satellite based observations as input along with data assimilation the impact of irrigation on the et is also included in the observed dataset resulting in higher overall et throughout the year fig 8 shows that clm4 5 simulated et values are smaller than for gleam over entire india particularly clm4 5 has lower post monsoon et over the entire peninsular india fig 8i and lower pre monsoon et over the wg ne and foothills of himalayas fig 8g the monsoon et values appear largely to be in agreement with gleam over india except some parts of wg and ne based on our results it is noted that clm4 5 is able to simulate et values closer to gleam for the arid semi arid regions over india than for the semi humid humid regions it is also important to highlight that the observation datasets used in this study are also affected by biases and random errors the remote sensing observations are affected by systematic biases and the grun and gleam products are also affected by model assumptions it is therefore unclear whether those observation datasets correspond better to reality than our modelled values a comparison of the model results with in situ observations could provide a better insight into the model performance of clm4 5 hence we compared the observed streamflow at eight different stations over five major river basins of india fig 9 shows the comparison of the standardized streamflow for these stations with the standardized runoff from the clm4 5 and grun datasets we observed that clm4 5 results could follow the overall pattern of runoff at most of these stations however there are discrepancies in the magnitude table 3 shows the percentage bias pbias and the nash sutcliffe coefficient for the standardized runoff values of clm4 5 with the standardized runoff from grun as well as the standardized time series of observed streamflow from india wris portal the model results exhibit an overall model underestimation bias as compared to observed india wris data which is evident from the negative pbias values in table 3 especially the peak flows are not well reproduced by clm4 5 which can be seen at the stations over godavari and tapi basins also evident from the negative ns values in comparison the runoff results from clm4 5 are in an overall better agreement with grun runoff as compared to the observed india wris streamflow this can be attributed to the fact that most of the streamflow gauges provide regulated observations although many studies have deployed lsms to simulate runoff these simulations should not resemble the observed streamflow especially in regulated basins in some studies land surface models were used with the sole objective of analyzing and improving the streamflow simulated on a watershed or basin scale lee and choi 2021 miao and wang 2020 zheng et al 2017 however in this study we focus primarily on the exchange of water and energy along the land atmosphere interface using clm4 5 some studies have also attempted to utilize the capabilities of lsms in analyzing the water budget and energy exchange at local or regional scales liu et al 2020 li et al 2019 wang et al 2016 the larger goal in this study is not to improve the simulation of hydrological components but to analyze the impact of changing lulc and cc on those hydrological components a previous study by kushwaha et al 2021 attempted to assess the performance of clm3 0 along with four other hydrological models in simulating the streamflow and other water balance components over 18 major river basins over india and concluded that the performance of clm was found to be acceptable additionally they also reported that the multimodel ensemble mean outperformed the individual hydrological models in simulating the water balance components 4 2 isolated impact of lulcc and cv on hydrological cycle the individual impacts of cv and lulcc on the components of the energy and water cycles can be deduced from the comparison of the cv only scenario case 2 and the lulc only scenario case 3 with the no change scenario case 1 also the decade wise changes in the energy and water cycle are studied by comparing each individual decade with the first decade 1981 1990 the average pre monsoon season values of the components of water and energy cycle over india for different decades are shown in table 4 and table 5 respectively the values of the various components of the water and energy cycles for the monsoon and post monsoon season are shown in the supplementary document in the table s3 to table s6 4 2 1 aw climate zone model results show that cv alone results in an increase in the overall et with an increase in the et and es components and no considerable change in the ec over the aw region we see also considerable inter decadal climate variations with an increase in et during the period 1991 2000 by 0 22 mm day compared to the earlier decade driven by an increase of es by 0 1 mm day and an increase of et by 0 13 mm day the season wise comparison reveals increases of pre monsoon et monsoon et and post monsoon et by 0 35 mm day 0 14 mm day and 0 18 mm day respectively in the pre monsoon the increase of ground evaporation contributes most to the et increase whereas for the monsoon and post monsoon season transpiration increase more during 1991 2000 compared to 1981 1990 the changes in the g flux related to cv are negligible while the sensible heat values decrease by 7 w m2 pre monsoon 2 w m2 monsoon and 2 7 w m2 post monsoon the decade 2001 2010 shows an intermediate et with an average et 0 07 mm day larger than for the reference period 1981 1990 ec is hardly impacted by cv in these simulation scenarios while we observe only slight increases in the et and es components et values do not exhibit any large change 0 05 mm day in the pre monsoon and monsoon season whereas the post monsoon et shows an increase by 0 17 mm day which is due to an increase in the et es and ec by 0 07 0 08 and 0 03 mm day respectively the sensible heat flux h ground heat flux g and net radiation rnet do not show any significant change always compared to the reference period 1981 1990 if only lulcc is considered a slight overall decrease in the et 0 05 mm day is observed for 1991 2000 compared to the reference period 1981 1990 with decreases in the et and ec components by 0 03 and 0 02 mm day respectively also the changes in the other fluxes and for the different seasons are small similarly for the decade 2001 2010 we observe only slight decrease in the et values and its components compared to the decade 1981 1990 we observe lower et values in all seasons with decreases between 0 03 and 0 07 mm day the ground evaporation component shows larger decreases in the pre monsoon by 0 09 mm day and the post monsoon season 0 06 mm day also the other fluxes show only small changes the combined effect of the lulc and cv shows results similar to the cv only case scenario with higher overall seasonal et values for the decade 1991 2000 for the pre monsoon 0 3 mm day monsoon 0 11 mm day and post monsoon 0 17 mm day however the et increases slightly less as compared to the cv only scenario as lulcc has a small et limiting effect 4 2 2 bsh climate zone over the bsh region the et values are generally higher for the cv only scenario than for the no change scenario with increases in the order of 0 14 to 0 24 mm day for the different decades simulated et values are higher for the 1991 2000 period compared to 1981 1990 by 0 2 mm day where an increase in the es and the et contribute to the overall increase in et while the ec component does not exhibit significant change over the whole period the pre monsoon et increases by 0 14 mm day with an increase in the et by 0 1 mm day similar increases in the monsoon 0 11 mm day and post monsoon et 0 13 mm day are simulated over the bsh zone related to cv this is attributed to the increased et and es in the monsoon 0 13 and 0 14 mm day respectively and post monsoon 0 11 and 0 01 mm day respectively season the seasonal h values show a decrease by about 4 9 w m2 in the pre monsoon 4 3 w m2 in the monsoon and 2 3 w m2 in the post monsoon season this illustrates that the incoming energy in the decades 1991 2000 and 2001 2010 is more used for latent heat flux and less for sensible heat flux compared to 1981 1990 the pre monsoon ground heat flux increases by about 2 6 w m2 and by 4 4 w m2 for the monsoon rnet shows an increase by 2 1 1 8 and 0 8 w m2 in the pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon season respectively for the decade 2001 2010 we observe higher overall et by 0 1 mm day with only a slight increase of et and es as compared to the decade 1981 1990 post monsoon et increases by 0 17 mm day and pre monsoon and monsoon et do not change significantly the increase in the post monsoon et is due to the increase in the et and es components by 0 1 mm day and 0 05 mm day respectively the post monsoon sensible heat flux shows a slight decrease by 2 1 w m2 while rnet shows a small increment for the different seasons in the range of 1 3 w m2 the lulcc only scenario is associated with a decrease in the et over the bsh climate zone always compared to 1981 1990 particularly in the monsoon season for 1991 2000 where the et decreases by 0 2 mm day the changes in the pre monsoon and post monsoon et are very small the simulated seasonal changes in the sensible heat flux are also small with increases in the monsoon and post monsoon h values by 2 2 w m2 and 0 7 w m2 the et values in the decade 2001 2010 also show limited changes compared to 1981 1990 with a lower et value in the monsoon season 0 2 mm day the rest of the fluxes and net radiation remain also relatively unchanged during this decade overall it is observed that the effect of lulcc is smaller than inter decadal climate variations over the bsh climate zone the combined impact of the cv and lulcc gives results similar to the cv only scenario as observed for the aw climate zone the magnitude of the et increase is lower than for the cv only scenario 4 2 3 cwa climate zone for the cwa climate zone we observe small changes in the overall et values over the decades for both the cv only and the lulcc only scenario however the individual seasons show larger changes particularly the pre monsoon season during the period 1991 2000 the pre monsoon et increases always compared to 1981 1990 as a result of cv by 0 3 mm day while the monsoon et increases by 0 1 mm day with an increase in the monsoon et by 0 2 mm day and a decrease in the monsoon ec by 0 1 mm day the sensible heat flux h increases in the pre monsoon h by 2 5 w m2 with smaller increases in the monsoon and post monsoon h by 1 1 and 1 3 w m2 similar increases can be observed in the ground heat flux g with higher values in the pre monsoon and monsoon g by 3 7 and 2 w m2 the net radiation shows slight variation 3 w m2 during the pre monsoon and monsoon period a similar pattern is observed for the period 2001 2010 again compared to 1981 1990 for the seasonal et and its components the simulated sensible heat flux increases by 4 4 2 8 and 0 7 w m2 for the pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon season also the pre monsoon and monsoon g increase by 4 and 2 w m2 the combined effect of the lulcc and cv shows similar results as for the cv only scenario with an increase of et for the different seasons over the cwa climate zone both cv and lulcc have a similar effect on the energy and water cycles 4 3 impact of the lulcc transitions 4 3 1 deforestation fig 10 shows the grid cells over india which experienced transformation from forest cover to cropland deforestation and from cropland to urban areas urbanization between 1985 and 2005 overall 1 5 of the total area has undergone transformation from forest to agricultural lands between 1985 and 2005 deforestation results in substantial decreases in both soil evaporation and transpiration thus resulting in an overall et decrease over the affected grid cells the average et values over deforested regions reduced from 2 4 mm day to 1 7 mm day between 1981 and 90 and 2001 10 during this period et decreased from 0 9 mm day to 0 7 mm day while the es decreased from 1 mm day to 0 6 mm day and the ec reduced from 0 48 mm day to 0 33 mm day additionally the sensible heat value increased from 61 w m2 to 63 w m2 and the ground heat flux decreased from 8 9 w m2 to 8 75 w m2 resulting in an overall rnet increase from 134 5 w m2 to 135 8 w m2 between 1981 and 90 and 2001 10 among the affected grid cells around 19 grids belong to the aw climate zone while 16 7 of the grids belong to the bsh climate zone over the aw climate zone deforestation leads to a decrease in the overall et from 2 5 to 2 3 mm day with a decrease in the ground evaporation from 0 98 mm day to 0 74 mm day we observe only slight increase in the sensible heat fluxes with no significant change in the soil moisture the rnet value shows a decrease from 134 7 w m2 to 133 9 w m2 between 1981 and 90 and 2001 10 supplementary document fig s8 deforestation leads to a higher albedo which reduces the absorption of solar radiation by the ground surface davin and de noblet ducoudré 2010 previous studies have also indicated that reduction in forest cover in tropical regions leads to reduced evapotranspiration defries et al 2002 feddema et al 2005 bonan 2008 another aspect of the deforestation is that the rooting depth is higher in case of trees as compared to crops and grasslands hence conversion from forest to croplands implies a decrease in the overall et bala et al 2007 over the bsh climate zone deforestation results in very slight decrease in et with decreases mainly in the ground evaporation additionally we do not observe significant changes in the rnet values and soil moisture over the bsh climate zone results are not very different for the combined impact of lulcc and cv with similar trends but slightly higher values for total et the overall et decreases from 2 5 mm day to 2 mm day with major decreases in the et from 1 1 mm day to 0 95 mm day and ec from 0 5 mm day to 0 3 mm day however we observe an increase in the sensible heat from 60 w m2 to 63 4 w m2 and an increase in the rnet from 134 w m2 to 136 8 w m2 between 1981 and 90 and 2001 10 among the climate zones the aw climate zone shows a larger decrease in the et from 2 9 mm day to 2 4 mm day which is mainly due to the decrease in the es from 1 2 mm day to 0 8 mm day along with slight decreases in the et and ec as well the soil moisture does not show any significant change during this period however the rnet increases from 134 7 w m2 to 135 6 w m2 which can be attributed to the increase in h and g fluxes over this climate zone on the other hand we observe a smaller decrease in the et over the bsh climate zone from 1 7 mm day to 1 6 mm day with decreases in the ec and es components the rnet and sm values do not exhibit large changes during this period 4 3 2 urbanization the other major lulcc was the conversion of cropland to urban area overall 1 04 of the total area has undergone transformation from cropland to urban areas between 1985 and 2005 urbanization leads to a decrease in the overall et from 1 9 mm day to 1 6 mm day between 1981 and 90 and 2001 10 in this case we observe a decrease in the et and an increase in the es component over the decades et decreases from 1 mm day to 0 4 mm day and es increases from 0 6 mm day to 1 mm day also we observe an increase in the total h flux from 63 w m2 to 64 3 w m2 and an increase in the g flux from 7 8 w m2 to 8 w m2 associated with an increase in the total rnet from 132 w m2 to 133 4 w m2 higher evapotranspiration over vegetated areas is associated with smaller sensible heat fluxes and reduced surface warming fall et al 2010 additionally a vegetation cover prevents the absorption of solar radiation by the ground surface thereby reducing sensible heat flux wang et al 2012 around 23 of the affected grid cells belong to the aw climate zone while 30 of the grid cells are part of the bsh climate zone over the aw climate zone the total et decreases from 2 3 mm day to 1 9 mm day between 1981 and 90 and 2001 10 as a result of the decrease in the et from 1 2 mm day to 0 5 mm day we also observe a small increase in the h flux by 1 w m2 however the overall rnet value does not exhibit any significant change and remains around 130 w m2 supplementary document fig s9 similarly we do not observe any change in the soil moisture values over the aw climate zone on the other hand the bsh climate zone shows a significant decrease in the et values from 1 3 mm day to 1 mm day with large decreases in the et from 0 63 mm day to 0 3 mm day we do not observe any large change in the overall rnet and sm values over the bsh climate zone in clm the urban canopy floor consists of impervious and pervious surfaces where the impervious floor represents the roads parking lots and other concrete or asphalt surfaces generally the heat trapping capacity and the heat transfer capacity of these materials is higher as compared to the soil as a result the majority of the solar radiation is directly absorbed by these surfaces leading to higher sensible heat flux a similar result is also reported by yang et al 2011 over beijing where rapid urbanization led to an increase in the temperature by 0 4 c per decade in the past 20 years as a result of the combined impact of lulcc and cv we observe an overall decrease in the et from 1 9 mm day to 1 63 mm day with increase in the es from 0 6 mm day to 0 95 mm day and a decrease in the et from 1 mm day to 0 4 mm day the overall rnet value increases from 132 w m2 to 134 3 w m2 with increases in the h flux from 63 w m2 to 64 w m2 and increase in the g flux from 7 8 w m2 to 8 1 w m2 over the aw climate zone we observe a decrease in the et from 2 35 mm day to 2 mm day with a decrease in the et from 1 2 mm day to 0 5 mm day the rnet values show a slight increase from 130 23 w m2 to 131 8 w m2 on the other hand over the bsh climate zone a decrease in the et from 0 6 mm day to 0 3 mm day leads to an overall decrease in the total et from 1 3 mm day to 1 mm day the rnet values show a slight increase from 130 27 w m2 to 131 7 w m2 5 discussion previous studies have focussed on the impact of climate on the hydrology and water availability over global regional and basin scales her et al 2019 pattnayak et al 2018 shah and mishra 2016 and have concluded that the regional hydrological scenario is affected to a large extent by climate variability shah and mishra 2016 reported a decrease in the water availability over the majority of the large river basins over india between 1948 and 2012 as a result of the changing climate which they attributed to the decline in the monsoon season precipitation on the other hand lulc patterns have also been linked to the decrease in the water availability over india paul et al 2016 garg et al 2019 however combined studies of lulc and climate variability over india have highlighted the fact that the impact of climate on the regional hydrology is much higher than that of lulc chawla and mujumdar 2015 tsarouchi and buytaert 2018 among the lulc patterns deforestation and urbanization are the two major lulc changes over india in the past decades as a result of the deforestation we observe a decrease in the overall et over the affected grids which can be attributed to the increase in albedo and less deep rooting vegetation on the other hand urbanization also leads to a lower et as a result of less vegetation and therefore decreased transpiration the impact of the lulcc on the hydrological processes is quite varied over the arid and humid regions of india the arid regions are generally characterized by lower precipitation higher temperature and lack of vegetation among the arid regions we observe that the arid regions over nw india exhibit lower sm throughout the year as compared to the arid regions on the leeward side of wg on the other hand the humid regions are characterized by moderate to high precipitation with generally higher sm values throughout the year the impact of deforestation in these areas can be seen in the simulated et values over the arid and humid zones we observe larger decrease in the et over the aw climate zone fig s8 in the supplementary document where 2 6 of the total area is affected by deforestation as compared to the arid bsh zone where 3 of the total area has undergone similar lulc change between 1985 and 2005 this can be attributed to the higher soil moisture content in the aw climate zone throughout the year also the et in arid regions is generally moisture limited in case of urbanization around 2 of the total area of the aw zone has experienced transformation from croplands to urban areas whereas around 3 8 of the total area of the arid bsh zone has undergone urbanization as a result of this transformation we observe a large decrease in the transpiration component which ultimately results in lower et over the affected grids see fig s9 in the supplementary document however the magnitude of the decrease is larger over the aw zone than the bsh zone which can again be coupled to the soil moisture availability over the regions croplands over the aw climate zone exhibit higher et during the decade 1981 90 which is later reduced substantially till 2001 10 after urbanization land surface heat fluxes act as a link between the atmosphere and land surface and hence play an important role in the energy and water cycle precipitation is one of the major factors affecting the partitioning of the available energy into le and h the pre monsoon season in india is characterized by low rainfall throughout the whole domain combined with high temperatures and low soil moisture during this period most of the available surface energy is used for sensible heat flux this is particularly evident over the arid and semi arid regions which mostly constitute the bsh climate zone where h is significantly higher as compared to the le as also observed by raja et al 2013 for the other climate zones the sensible latent heat remains higher lower in the pre monsoon season which can be attributed to the lower soil moisture content in the pre monsoon season throughout india the annual cycle for the heat fluxes over different climate zones indicate that while the aw and bsh zones are mostly dominated by h during the pre monsoon season there is a considerable difference in the br values for these two regions the br for the arid bsh zone around 15 is significantly higher than for the aw zone 5 which can be attributed to the lower soil moisture content in the bsh compared to the aw zone indicating the strong influence of soil moisture over the partitioning of the heat fluxes the cwa zone experiences generally higher rainfall than the other climate zones and exhibits higher soil moisture contents as well this zone remains mostly dominated by le resulting in lower br values burman et al 2019 the monsoon period in india is generally characterized by high rainfall along with higher soil moisture contents and higher available energy as a result the monsoon season shows larger latent heat fluxes than sensible heat fluxes morwal et al 2017 reported that the monsoon season br and h values remain low over the northern peninsular india the central indian region exhibits higher le and lower br during the monsoon season including the cwa and aw climate zones during wet conditions et is mostly energy limited rather than moisture limited however over the arid nw region the low soil moisture condition still regulates the total et resulting in higher br values 10 and lower ef values close to zero the post monsoon season over india is generally characterized by higher soil moisture contents than the pre monsoon season while the available energy is considerably lower hence the evapotranspiration is mostly energy limited during the post monsoon season particularly over the cwa zone over the southern peninsular india the available energy is higher than for northern india coupled with higher soil moisture content over peninsular india resulting in higher le over the aw climate zone and higher ef values 0 5 it is to be noted that clm4 5 used in this study is not calibrated as is typical the case for land surface models therefore discrepancies between the simulation results and the reference datasets are expected this is also related to a lack of available precise data for calibration over india the products that we use now in the comparisons are also subject to larger uncertainties related to biases in remote sensing observations and model assumptions it is therefore unclear whether those observation datasets correspond better to reality than our modelled values one of the limitations of this study is the absence of irrigation in the model runs studies have highlighted the role of irrigation in influencing the hydrological cycle and energy balance on the regional as well as the global scale sacks et al 2009 lobell et al 2009 puma and cook 2010 chen and jeong 2018 de vrese et al 2018 about one third of the crop land over india is irrigated irrigation largely affects the simulated et and sensible heat causing evaporative surface cooling another limitation of this study is that the representation of the leaf area index and the pfts for tropical trees in clm4 5 is not realistic as the model is strongly tuned towards temperate regions of the world hence the performance of clm4 5 over the tropical regions need to be further enhanced through the incorporation of pfts representing tropical trees and multiple crop cycles throughout the year boas et al 2021 the model performance could also be improved by the assimilation of observed leaf area index and soil moisture through coupling of clm4 5 with a data assimilation framework strebel et al 2022 assimilation of observed lai and sm into clm4 5 would most probably result in simulated values closer to measurements at least for soil moisture and most probably also for et hence in order to ensure more realistic modelling results it would be necessary to incorporate vegetation dynamics data assimilation and irrigation into the land surface model and study their impact on the water and energy cycles over india which we plan as a part of a future study 6 conclusion the main objective of this study was to quantify the individual and combined impacts of land use land cover change lulcc and inter decadal climate variation cv on the water and energy cycles over india a scenario based approach was designed using the community land model clm version 4 5 to investigate the impact of lulcc and cv on the evapotranspiration soil moisture and radiation components over the period 1981 2010 the input datasets from various sources and agencies were incorporated in this study such as the decadal lulc maps over india from the oak ridge national laboratory ornl nasa and the soil maps from the international geosphere biosphere program igbp the atmospheric forcing dataset was the era interim reanalysis but precipitation data were replaced with the gridded precipitation dataset from the indian meteorological department imd the major findings of this study are india experiences highest et values during the monsoon season followed by the post monsoon season while the lowest values are observed during the pre monsoon season both the ground evaporation and canopy transpiration component contribute largely to the total et during the monsoon season during the pre monsoon season ground evaporation plays a major role while canopy transpiration dominates the total et during the post monsoon season mean values of rnet are highest over india in the monsoon season while values are lowest in the post monsoon season in the monsoon season the largest part of rnet is used for the latent heat flux but sensible heat flux for the non monsoon period the individual impact of the inter decadal climate variation causes a variation in the total et and net radiation by 5 4 and 1 0 respectively while that of the lulcc causes an overall decrease in the et values by 0 3 calculated over the period 1981 2010 comparing the period 1991 2010 with 1981 1990 the major lulcc over india between 1985 and 2005 include the conversion of forest to croplands deforestation and croplands to urban areas urbanization deforestation leads to decrease in the ground evaporation and canopy transpiration component leading to an overall decrease in the total et by 29 over the affected grid cells urbanization causes a decrease in the canopy transpiration component and an increase in the ground evaporation component resulting in an overall decrease in the total et by 16 over the affected grid cells the impact of inter decadal climate variation results in larger variations in the et and its components particularly in the pre monsoon season over the aw and bsh climate zones as compared to the cwa climate zone overall cv has a larger impact on the energy and water cycles over india in the period 1980 2010 and on a larger scale as compared to lulcc for future research it would be important to consider irrigation as well as a considerable part of cropland in india is irrigated in addition the representation of crops and the development of crops during the year should be better represented it can be expected that those model improvements would affect the relative importance of lulcc and cv but it is very unlikely that the main conclusion of this paper cv dominates over lulcc during the last decades would be affected

3012,snow wetness estimates are critical inputs in the understanding of snow hydrological processes with early warming in winters in the himalayas snowpack shows early signs of melting in february with increased snow wetness typically in february the snowpack comprises a mix of dry and wet snow layers in the literature methods for quantitative analysis of snow wetness are mostly based on fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar sar data methods based on the hybrid polarimetric sar polsar data for snow monitoring are virtually inexistent this study proposes a novel methodology for the estimation of snow wetness utilizing the c band hybrid polarimetric risat 1 sar dataset using radar remote sensing to analyze the behavior of such a snowpack requires information on the surface and volume scattering characteristics the modeled generalized surface and volume scattering parameters α and γ based on the x bragg s reflection coefficients and fresnel transmission coefficients are used for the inversion of surface and volume snow permittivities respectively the investigations are carried out for february 2014 for a study area in the manali region in himachal pradesh india the retrieved snow estimates showed a coefficient of determination of 0 86 and a root mean square error of 0 667 with respect to in situ measurements further it was observed that the snow wetness estimates derived from the proposed method using risat 1 dataset outperformed the estimates based on fully polarimetric radarsat 2 dataset using the conventional shi and dozier method keywords synthetic aperture radar hybrid polarimetric sar snow snow wetness snowmelt risat 1 radarsat 2 1 introduction investigations of the global snow cover is critical in understanding the planetary energy budgets and climate feedbacks the timing and the extent of snow melt during the ablation season has a significant impact on the surface albedo and the surface energy budget flanner et al 2011 the planetary albedo is also affected by the snow microstructure which undergoes metamorphism due to various geophysical processes colbeck 1982 one of the key geophysical properties of snow that further influences the metamorphism iteratively is the snow liquid water content or the snow wetness colbeck 1982 the moisture or wetness in snow causes the cohesive forces to overcome leading to potentially increased melt and vulnerability to shear breakdown pomeroy brun 2001 techel pielmeier 2011 subsequently investigations of the snow wetness are critically emphasized in climate and environmental modelling pomeroy brun 2001 the trends of retreating snow cover have been alarming in the eurasian regions covering two major mountainous regimes the alps and the himalayas urraca gobron 2021 for asia understanding the extent and behavior of seasonal himalayan snow is critical from hydrological and climate modelling the seasonal snowmelt in the himalayas is a primary source of fresh water to approximately one sixth of the world s population mithen black 2011 the available water from snowmelt gets added to the discharge of the mountainous rivers bernier et al 2017 contributing to hydropower generation and river canal irrigation systems in the mountainous regions critical geohazards like avalanches and flash floods depend on the terrain conditions and the snow geophysical properties like the snow wetness liquid water content and snow particle size schweizer et al 2003 weingartner et al 2003 wever et al 2018 the presence of liquid water in the snowpack with diurnal temperature gradients renders the formation of weak snow crystals in the intermediate layers that are vulnerable to fracture schweizer jamieson 2001 awasthi varade 2021 the snow wetness is a key input for mapping avalanche hazard zones and predicting wet snow avalanches which have a high risk of affecting roads railway networks and human settlements fischer 2013 hence spatio temporal monitoring of snow wetness is vital in avalanche forecasting and hydrological modelling in mountainous regions high elevated mountainous regions exhibit extended snow cover however field investigation of snowpack is challenging due to the rugged terrain in the himalayas varade et al 2020a awasthi et al 2021 subsequently the field campaigns for in situ measurements of snow physical properties in such areas are constrained by challenging weather conditions lack of proper infrastructure and high manpower requirements contributing to the higher costs for periodical data collection further the complex topography of the himalayas results in the spatial variability of the snowpack geophysical parameters and such information is typically irretrievable from field campaigns satellite remote sensing techniques have shown a significant potential for the continuous monitoring of snowpack dynamics and estimating snow geophysical parameters nagler rott 2000 gupta et al 2005 thakur et al 2016 haq et al 2019 varade dikshit 2020 the limitation of optical remote sensing is associated with the shallow penetration of the incident wave in the snowpack thus any information retrieved on the snow geophysical parameters is for the surface layer only varade dikshit 2018 varade dikshit 2019 in contrast the higher penetrability and the sensitivity of the microwave signal to the snow dielectric properties provide us with capabilities to derive volumetric information on the snow geophysical parameters ulaby et al 2014 moreover microwave remote sensing has the operational advantage even during the cloud cover foggy rainy and even hazy weather conditions in p l c and x frequency bands stiles et al 1981 pottier lee 2009 cloude 2010 awasthi et al 2022 subsequently several studies have demonstrated the capability of synthetic aperture radar sar data to estimate snow geophysical parameters awasthi varade 2021 various studies have explored the development of methods for the estimation of snow wetness using polarimetric sar polsar datasets shi dozier 1995 shi dozier 2000 singh et al 2006 singh 2007 thakur aggarwal garg garg mani pandit et al 2012 bhattacharya et al 2014 surendar et al 2015 thakur et al 2016 however most of these methods utilize fully polarimetric sar data which is typically commercial and expensive in shi dozier 1995 the backscatter response from snow has been studied to model the snow wetness surendar et al 2015 utilized general four component scattering power decomposition with unitary transformation g4u singh et al 2013 to model the effective snow wetness as the weighted sum of the surface and volumetric snow wetness in divyesh et al 2019a the snow wetness was modelled based on the model baghdadi et al 2016 proposed for the estimation of moisture in bare surfaces however in this study it was demonstrated that the wetness estimates have significantly higher uncertainty ma et al 2020 utilized the dense media radiative transfer dmrt model to derive the surface and volume snow wetness which were used in a weighted sum approach to determine the effective snowpack wetness in general polsar techniques apply polarization diversity and utilize multiple channel polarimetric information to estimate target parameters pottier lee 2009 the target information is retrieved based on orientation alignment and shape of the target using fully dual and hybrid polsar datasets pottier lee 2009 cloude 2010 the fully polsar datasets have high pulse repetition frequency prf but a smaller swath coverage area which adversely affects the temporal resolution of the sar sensor also the full polarimetric sar sensor configuration has more complex architecture woodhouse 2005 in contrast the dual polarimetric sensors have half prf as compared to fully polsar resulting in a larger swath coverage area than the fully polsar datasets subsequently the temporal resolution of the sar sensor is improved kumar et al 2017 awasthi et al 2020b in hybrid polarimetry the sensor transmits the polarized electromagnetic wave in the right circular r or the left circular l direction and the backscatter from the target are coherently received by the sar sensor in the orthogonal horizontal h and vertical v linear polarizations raney 2007 similar to dual polarimetry hybrid polarimetry offers half pulse repetition frequency prf compared to full polarimetric sar datasets cloude et al 2012 raney et al 2012 thus providing capabilities for high temporal resolution of the hybrid polsar sensor these hybrid polarimetric sar channels maintain the roll invariant property i e they are not affected by the polarimetric orientation angle shift cloude et al 2012 kumar et al 2016 further the target information retrieved by the hybrid polsar sensors is relatively higher compared to dual polsar sensors raney 2019 kumar et al 2020 in few studies hybrid polarimetric datasets have been emulated using fully polsar datasets to demonstrate potential capabilities of compact polarimetric sar kumar panigrahi 2019 kumar et al 2020 mandal et al 2020 in a study pseudo quad polarimetric simulations using compact hybrid polsar data thakur et al 2016 have been used for estimating snow wetness based on fully polsar methods to the best of our knowledge studies based on hybrid or compact polsar data for estimating snow wetness have been limited or virtually non existent with several spaceborne sar missions alos 3 nisar radarsat constellation mission rcm risat 1a and risat 1b acquiring sar datasets in the hybrid pol mode thompson 2015 rosen et al 2017 tadono et al 2019 there is a need to develop methods that can be implemented to estimate snow wetness using hybrid polsar datasets this study accounts for the previously mentioned research gaps in developing a hybrid polarimetric approach for estimating the snow wetness the objective of this study is developing a novel approach for ascertaining the capability of hybrid polsar data for quantitative snow wetness investigations by integrating hybrid polsar decomposed parameters with stokes parameterization of the hybrid polsar covariance matrix the developed methodology uses the extended x bragg scattering and generalized volume scattering model to estimate snow surface and volume permittivity respectively based on stokes formulation a conventional lookup table based approach is utilized for the determination of the snow surface and volume permittivity from the theoretical permittivity values varade et al 2019 the surface and volume snow wetness is retrieved from the corresponding permittivities using the empirical relation defined by denoth denoth 1994 thakur aggarwal garg garg mani kumar et al 2012 the effective snow wetness is modeled as the weighted sum of the estimated surface and volume snow wetness components where the weights are determined using the surface and volume scattering powers surendar et al 2015 the potential of the proposed approach for the estimation of snow wetness is demonstrated using hybrid polsar risat 1 dataset with corresponding in situ measurements 2 study area and dataset description 2 1 study area the study area is situated in the north western himalayas of india in the snow covered regions of the manali region in himachal pradesh as shown in fig 1 the study area covering approximately 350 km2 lies in the beas river basin and has been used in several snow studies in the literature snehmani et al 2010 thakur et al 2013a singh et al 2017 patil et al 2020 varade manickam et al 2020 awasthi et al 2021 the beas basin upsurges from the rohtang pass at 4350 m above sea level 51 km north of manali thakur et al 2016 the study area is located between latitude 32 16 n to 32 56 n and longitude 76 91 e to 77 39 e the climate of the study area is typically cold and dry with three broad seasons 1 winter season from october to february with temperatures ranging from 11 c to 30 c 2 summer season from march to june with average temperatures between 6 c and 35 c and 3 rainy season from july to september with the temperature ranges between 3 c and 33 c thakur et al 2012 in the indian himalayas snowfall generally occurs from december to march at an average elevation above 2000 m the observed snow wetness during jan march is around 1 8 by volume surendar et al 2015 annually august is the wettest month throughout this region the maximum rainfall is experienced during july august and minimum rainfall occurs in october january the temperatures in the study area range from a mean daily minimum of between 15 c to 0 c in january and rises to a maximum temperature of 20 c to 30 c in june thakur et al 2013b surendar et al 2015 the snowmelt typically starts from february end to mid september tiwari et al 2015 the april june months follow a period of rapid snowmelt leading to increased snowmelt runoff contributing to the beas river discharge negi joshi 2004 the highest river flow is experienced for july to september months and is dominated by monsoons related rainfall singh et al 2020 the maximum snowfall is observed in february in this region in the higher altitudes a maximum of 3 m snow depth is observed during the peak winter season with an observed average snow depth of 2 5 m while the lower altitudes in the region experience a maximum snow depth of 1 m during the peak snowfall period and an average snow depth of 0 75 m during the winter season singh et al 2011 2 2 polarimetric sar datasets the experiments to evaluate the proposed method for estimating snow wetness were conducted primarily using risat 1 datasets risat 1 is the first indigenous polarimetric radar imaging satellite launched by the indian space research organization isro in 2012 misra kirankumar 2014 that acquires data in various multi polarization modes comprising scansar modes in high medium coarse resolutions and fine resolution stripmap frs modes the risat 1 dataset used in this study was acquired under the frs 1 mode additional experiments were carried out using radarsat 2 fully polsar datasets in fine quad pol mode the radarsat 2 also acquires data in several modes from scansar to spotlight modes with different polarization combinations hillman et al 2009 an overview of the specifications of the datasets used in this study is illustrated in table 1 2 3 ground dataset information the proposed method for the estimation of snow wetness was evaluated using the field data collected during late february 2014 the in situ data used in the study was synchronized with the risat 1 satellite pass 6 30 pm indian standard time which were provided by the defence geoinformatics research establishment dgre defence research development organization drdo ministry of defence govt of india the ground data were collected with the snowfork instrument a popular equipment for collecting in situ measurements of snow geophysical characteristics thakur et al 2016 varade dikshit 2018 this snowfork is a compact instrument which measures resonant frequency attenuation and 3 db bandwidth capacity the complex dielectric constant of snow is then calculated using these observations snowfork allows rapid and accurate measurements of snow parameters like snow wetness and snow density from the complex dielectric constant of snow using semi empirical equations that are sometimes not feasible with conventional devices such as snow tubes especially with a smaller manpower surendar et al 2015 this instrument s measurements are dependable because it does not compress the snowpack the measurements are also easily reproducible and the findings can be confirmed using a calibration measurement in the air thakur et al 2016 the depth of each snow pit dug were around 30 40 cm the microwave electromagnetic waves operating in c band wavelength often penetrate the snowpack by 15 20 cm in low to moderate snow wetness conditions surendar et al 2015 varade et al 2020 within each layer the snowfork probe was introduced parallel to the snow surface for five repeated measurements and the in situ measurements were collected from pits dug to the soil layer at intervals of 15 cm 20 cm throughout the snowpack thickness in general five layers of snow were identified in the snowpack with the surface layer amounting to a thickness of 5 10 cm the internal structure of the snowpack varies significantly due to the variations in the diurnal air temperature and the temperature gradients which result in metamorphosis of the snow crystals the snow depth also plays a key role in the metamorphosis where at shallow depth the process of metamorphosis is relatively more accelerated subsequently the snowpack properties vary significantly on a temporal scale awasthi varade 2021 a significant variation in the surface wetness from approximately 1 5 to 5 was observed in the solang and bahang regions of manali during the field campaign in the week around the sensing date of the risat 1 acquisition the minimum and maximum temperature in the study area ranged between 10 c to 15 c and 8 c to 2 c recorded from the aws station located in solang as shown in fig 2 during this period on 22 feb 2014 and 27 feb 2014 the areas at the higher altitude regions in the study area witnessed 12 cm and 7 cm of snowfall respectively the lower altitude regions experienced 9 cm and 7 cm rainfall respectively as observed from the snow gauges the standing snow values recorded at the aws station in the solang region during the observation window 20 28 february 2014 were in the range of 80 cm and 106 cm the recorded value of standing snow depth on 22 feb 2014 morning was 94 cm later due to the snowfall event on 22 feb 2014 the standing snow depth increased to 106 cm in this duration however due to the further gradual increase in the daily maximum temperature in the region shown in fig 2 the standing snow values sharply declined to 76 cm on 27 feb 2014 due to possible snowmelt and or compactness of snowpack layers during the field campaign on 24 feb 2014 snow geophysical observations were recorded from eight snow pits in bahang and solang regions unfortunately due to the shorter duration of the satellite pass single date data it might not have been possible to record more observations synchronized with the satellite pass in fig 3 a and b the ground observations made on 24 feb 2014 has been shown here for the surface layer 5 10 cm it can be observed that the snow density and the snow wetness are very low indicating the presence of recent fresh dry snow as mentioned earlier in bahang in the middle layers the density and the wetness increased significantly indicating the presence of old snow with wetness of about 4 5 vol while in the deeper layers it can be observed that the density reduces significantly as compared to wetness which may be attributed to the metamorphosis of snow crystals in depth hoar observations of snow depth hoar in february have been referred to in the snowpack stratigraphy in these regions in other studies varade et al 2020a in solang the layer below the surface shows very high density possibly attributed to significant wetness in the layer boundaries and the existence of icy layers or wind crust from previous accumulation event 3 methodology and implementation 3 1 background 3 1 1 stokes representation for hybrid polsar in hybrid polarimetry circularly polarized electromagnetic em waves are transmitted and coherent orthogonal linear polarized em waves are received in horizontal h or vertical v directions the transmitted circularly polarized waves are either left circular polarized or right circular polarized resulting in rh rv or lh lv polarization channels the hybrid polarimetric sar is invariant to faraday rotation fr or polarization orientation angle shift errors raney 2007 cloude et al 2012 the transmitted and received em wave in a hybrid polarimetric system can be expressed as follows raney

components shh shv svh and svv are the scattering matrix components in linear polarization the wave coherency matrix j 2 is calculated for defining the second order statistics raney 2007 cloude et al

represents the total power g 1 is the h horizontal or v vertically polarized power g 2 is the 45 1350 inclined em polarization power and g 3 is the circularly polarized power 3 1 2 the hybrid polarimetric m α decomposition in the hybrid polarimetric system the degree of polarization m and the polarimetric scattering angle α are expressed in the form of stokes parameters by cloude et al cloude et al 2012 as given in eqs 4 and 5 respectively degree of polarization m 4 m g 1 2 g 2 2 g 3 2 g 0 polarimetric scattering angle α 5 α 1 2 tan 1 g 1 2 g 2 2 g 3 cloude et al 2012 developed the

ranges of 450 to 450 in hybrid polarimetry by substituting an atan2 function instead of the atan function ponnurangam et al 2016 the m α decomposition technique cloude et al 2012 derives the

backscatter characteristics of snowpack the stratigraphy of the snowpack is defined by the geometric and dielectric properties of snowpack layers shi dozier 1997 kontu et al 2020 awasthi varade 2021 the backscatter from the snowpack is characterized by the sensor sensing geometry wavelength of the incident wave and the radiative and geometrical properties of the snowpack ulaby et al 1984 in general a two layer air and snow boundary model is followed to understand the interactions of the em wave with the snowpack the total backscatter from the snowpack comprises contributions from the air snow interface snowpack volume and the snow ground interface ulaby et al 1986 the double bounce scattering component for snow cover is very small and in general neglected singh et al 2014 in the case of dry snow the backscatter component from the snow ground interface is dominant and the snowpack is apparently transparent to the incident em wave varade et al 2020b however as the liquid water content in the snowpack increases wetness of 1 2 by vol for example in the case of old snow the backscatter from the air snow interface is not negligible varade et al 2020a a further increase in the wetness of the snow surface renders a dominant surface scattering component the varying behavior of the snowpack with respect to wetness is shown in a schematic in fig 4 in general in the melt season the surface scattering component is dominant than the volumetric component and the snow ground interface component is negligible manickam barros 2020 however in the case of an old snowpack such as in february in the himalayas the surface component may remain dry and the radar signal interactions are affected in the snowpack volume due to the presence of liquid water content the magnitude of backscatter in such a case depends on the magnitude of the liquid water content in the snowpack volume to quantify the effective wetness of the snowpack it is essential to consider both the surface and the volumetric scattering components which varies depending upon the wetness of the surface layer and volume respectively subsequently in the literature a weighing scheme is typically adopted based on the surface and volume scattering powers to quantify the effective wetness of the snowpack from the surface and volumetric snow wetness surendar et al 2015 3 2 overview of the proposed approach for snow wetness estimation the proposed method utilizes the stokes representation of the generalized surface and volume parameters for the estimation of snow wetness using hybrid polsar data fig 5 shows the general framework used in the proposed methodology the stokes vector g is derived from the 2 2 jone s wave covariance matrix j2 further these stokes parameters are used to derive 1 generalized theoretical polarimetric surface scattering parameter αt based on the extended bragg x bragg scattering coefficients and 2 generalized theoretical volume scattering parameter γ t based on the fresnel transmission coefficients the x bragg s scattering coefficients and fresnel transmission coefficients functions of incidence angle and the dielectric constants of the snowpack are used to derive the modelled generalized surface scattering parameter αm and generalized volume scattering parameter γ m a lookup table based approach is used for deriving the permittivity by comparing the theoretical values of these coefficients with corresponding to the modelled values ma et al 2020 sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 the model defined by denoth 1994 has been extensively used in the literature and in this study for the retrieval of snow wetness from snow permittivity for both the snowpack surface and the volume we utilize the same weighing scheme as proposed in surendar et al 2015 to determine the effective snow wetness section 3 3 however the surface and volume scattering powers are determined based on the m α decomposition in the hybrid polarimetric system the proposed methodology is further elaborated in the forthcoming sub sections 3 2 1 estimation of surface snow permittivity as the surface scattering mechanism α s contains the information about the dielectric properties of the surface snow surface dielectric constant the potential of the scattering mechanisms from fully polsar data for snow surface dielectric constant estimation using theoretical surface scattering models have already been exploited using c band frequencies manickam et al 2016 the surface scattering parameter α t is retrieved using the hybrid decomposition technique in terms of stokes parameter cloude et al 2012 and the surface scattering parameter α m is estimated using the extended bragg model x bragg proposed in cloude corr 2002 the generalized theoretical polarimetric scattering parameter α t is estimated in terms of the stokes parameters as shown in eq 7 7 α t 1 2 tan 1 g 1 2 g 2 2 g 3 the modeled generalized scattering parameter αm is expressed by employing the extended bragg x bragg surface scattering model for the inversion of snow surface dielectric constant cloude corr 2002 the extended x bragg s surface scattering model exhibits a wider tolerance to the surface roughness variations this model provides a higher limit of ks 1 where k represents the vertical wavenumber and s represents the surface height standard deviation the modeled polarimetric scattering parameter is expressed in terms of x bragg s scattering coefficients b hh and b vv as shown in eq 8 8 α m tan 1 b h h b v v b h h b v v where the horizontal x bragg s scattering coefficient b hh and vertical x bragg s scattering coefficient b vv can be expressed in eq 9 both these horizontal and vertical x bragg s scattering coefficients b hh a n d b vv depends only on the incidence angle θ i and the dielectric constant s respectively whereas the value of cross polarized components b hv b vh 0 9 b h h cos θ i s sin 2 θ i cos θ i s sin 2 θ i b v v s 1 sin 2 θ i s 1 sin 2 θ i s c o

parameter α m 3 2 2 snow volume wetness estimation approach the snow volume is considered a dense medium with uniformly distributed closely packed snow particles as the rayleigh scatterers over all possible angle θ bounded by irregular boundaries colbeck 1987 the snow volume scattering can be modeled as a cloud of randomly distributed small spheroids particles within a sar resolution cell

relationship between the snowpack dielectric constant and the snow wetness denoth 1994 surendar et al 2015 33 w 5 35 1 1 92 ρ the overall effective snowpack wetness w e v o l shown in eq 34 is estimated using the snow surface wetness and the volume wetness utilizing the surface and volume scattering powers ps and pv respectively 34 w e ω s w s ω v w v ω s ω v 1 where fractional surface constant ω s and fractional volume constant ω v are calculated as follows 35 ω s p s p s p v ω v p v p s p v 3 4 inversion of surface and volume permittivity the incidence angle and the permittivity dielectric constant real significantly affect x bragg s reflection coefficients and the fresnel transmission coefficients characterizing the surface and the volume scattering respectively in general the magnitude of both x bragg s reflection coefficients and the fresnel transmission coefficients declines exponentially with respect to an increase in the incidence angle the variation in the horizontal and the vertical x bragg s reflection coefficients and the fresnel transmission coefficients with respect to the incidence angle and dielectric constant is illustrated in figs 6 and 7 respectively the direct inversion of the generalized surface parameter gsp and generalized volume parameter gvp often results in solutions that do not pertain to the expected values of snow the lookup table lut approach is used for estimating snowpack surface dielectric constant s for each image pixel using the modeled polarimetric surface scattering parameter α m and the theoretical generalized polarimetric surface scattering parameter α t and snowpack volume dielectric constant v using the modeled generalized volume parameter γ m and theoretical generalized volume parameter γ t for each pixel surendar et al 2015 the values of s and v are defined with a range 1 3 typical of the expected field conditions during winters for snow for each pixel the modeled surface scattering parameter α t and generalized volume parameter γ t is calculated using eq 7 and eq 28b respectively simultaneously the modeled surface scattering parameter α m and generalized volume parameter γ m are also calculated using the snow surface dielectric constant s and snowpack volume dielectric constant v values from the lut shown in eq 8 and eq 31 respectively the minimization function used for the estimation of s and v are expressed as in eq 36 and eq 37 respectively 36 m i n s α t α m 37 m i n v γ t γ m 4 results and discussion 4 1 scattering characteristics in the study area the rgb color composite of the decomposed scattering powers generated using the m α hybrid polarimetric decomposition of the risat 1 datasets is shown in fig 8 the surface scatterers dihedral scatterers and the random volume scattering targets are visually identified using polarimetric decomposition in fig 8 represented by the hue of the rgb colors in the snowpack the dominating scattering mechanisms are the surface scattering from the snow surface interface and the random scattering from the snowpack volume thakur et al 2016 the backscattering from the snowpack can assist in determining dry wet snow cover and the snow cover properties the contrast enhancement of rgb composite of risat 1 is done as shown in fig 8 a in fig 8 both the risat 1 and radarsat 2 rgb composites show a greenish tone where the green band is the volume scattering indicating a dominant volume scattering the rgb composites confirm the state of the snowpack to exhibit a relatively drier surface layer due to the recent snowfall event happened at that time as discussed in section 2 3 in order to assess the dominance and or the response of the land use land cover lulc in the study area corresponding to the scene of investigation risat 1 24 02 2014 we generated a lulc map as shown in fig 9 a utilizing several spectral indices as in divyesh et al 2019b the supervised classification was implemented using the corresponding landsat 8 30 m satellite imagery for the preparation of lulc which has four classes snow mixed snow forest and bare soil further 9028 random samples were generated for each class to extract the polarimetric parameters for analysis fig 9b shows the distribution of the backscattered powers ps pv and pd and the complex polarization ratio cpr corresponding to the four fundamental classes mentioned earlier in the lulc in the study area irrespective of the lulc the cpr exhibits a similar range of values although there is no distinct variation in the scattering powers per the different classes the volume scattering is generally dominant however changes in the median values red line in the boxes for the scattering powers can be observed according to the different classes the difference between the surface and the volume scattering medians is relatively lesser in the mixed snow and bare soil classes possibly due to higher surface roughness causing a relative increase in the surface scattering the bare soil class in this case also includes the presence of boulders and rocks in the case of mixed snow the relative increase in the surface scattering could possibly be attributed to the interactions of the radar signal with the boreal forest canopy 4 2 snowpack permittivity and wetness as snow is regarded as a mixture of ice air and liquid water the permittivity of snow is directly an indicator of its physical composition tiuri et al 1984 for example fresh snow has negligible liquid water comprising air and ice particles and both ice and air have very low permittivity indicating the overall lower effective permittivity 1 of fresh snow considering any dielectric mixing formula evans 1965 in contrast liquid water has high permittivity of about 80 thus inclusion of liquid water in the snow during melting causes the effective permittivity of snow to increase when compared with fresh snow schwank naderpour 2018 the present study focuses on the snow wetness however other studies have shown direct relationship between snow permittivity and other snow properties such as the snow density awasthi et al 2020a varade et al 2020a and the snow grain size tiuri et al 1984 pirazzini et al 2015 the snowpack surface dielectric constant and the surface snow wetness estimated by the proposed model described in section 3 2 1 using modeled generalized polarimetric surface scattering parameter αm and x bragg s scattering coefficients for the date of 24 feb 2014 are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively most of the estimated surface wetness in the study area ranges from 3 to 7 by volume the forest cover area was masked using the landsat 8 generated ndvi mask keeping the threshold limit of 0 7 the regions affected with layover and shadow effect during the sar data acquisition were also masked using srtm 1 arcsec digital elevation model dem the surface wetness value varied in the study area between 0 4 and 8 09 with the mean values of about 4 although the backscattered power typically decreases with an increase in the permittivity of the snowpack or the wetness the processes are much complex to be modelled simply in a linear relationship as shown in fig 10 c in fig 10 c a general declining trend in the surface scattering power is observed as expected corresponding to an increase in the surface snow wetness generally the spatial distribution of the permittivity and the wetness are expected to be similar considering they are linearly related according to the empirical model by denoth denoth 1994 it is observed that both the permittivity and the wetness exhibit significantly lower values along the mountain ridges possibly due to errors introduced due to the viewing geometry of the sensor across steep slopes and dem errors corresponding to very high local incidence angle nagler et al 2016 it may also be possible that the snow in the higher altitudes may be relatively dry as compared to the mid and low altitudes further some sun facing slopes may exhibit increased melting of the surface leading to higher surface wetness the snowpack volume dielectric constant and the volume snow wetness estimated by the proposed model described in section 3 2 1 applying modeled generalized volume parameter γ m by utilizing fresnel s scattering coefficients for the date of 24 feb 2014 are shown in fig 11 a and b respectively fig 11 c shows the scatterplot of the volume scattering power and the volume wetness corresponding to the samples used to generate the boxplot in fig 9 b from the scatterplot a declining trend indicates the inverse relationship between the volume wetness and the backscattered power which is typically attributed to the absorption of the incident radiation the magnitude of the volume wetness observed ranges from 1 0 to 7 08 by volume where significantly lower wetness is observed along the mountain ridges however in contrast to the surface wetness the valley areas exhibit much higher volume wetness possibly due to the higher diurnal temperature differences in the low elevation areas in the winter season in the himalayas further it is observed that slopes facing the sensor show relatively higher volume wetness it is worth mentioning that the viewing geometry of the slopes significantly affects the polarized backscatter response particularly the polarization scattering angle varade et al 2020c the snow surface can melt many centimeters in the day and while the lower lying volume snow may remain dry therefore for an acquisition in the daytime a higher contribution from the surface snow is expected hence it is observed that the wetness contribution from the surface snow wetness is higher than that of volume snow wetness as observed from fig 8 further the standing snow measurement on 24 feb 2014 was 88 cm which was far lower than the maximum standing snow measurement of 106 cm observed on 22 feb 2014 the effective snow wetness we for the snowpack eq 35 is estimated as the weighted sum of the surface and volumetric snow wetness where the weights are derived corresponding to the scattering powers ps and pv as shown in fig 9 most of the effective snow wetness falls in the study area range from 3 to 7 by volume in general it can be observed that the uncertainties in the snow wetness due to issues associated with the ridgelines and the orientation of slopes with respect to the sensor viewing geometry are transferred to the effective wetness from the surface and volume snow wetness estimates during this process of snow wetness estimation the areas covered with the vegetation cover and the layover and shadow affected areas were excluded from the investigation using vegetation and layover and shadow masks the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi map generated using the landsat 8 datasets was applied to create vegetation masks in the area further the layover and shadow mask was generated using the digital elevation models dem and local incidence angle information 4 3 validation of the newly proposed method and comparative analysis with fully polarimetric sar datasets existing shi dozier method to evaluate the proposed method and the retrieved snow wetness using the risat 1 hybrid polsar data an accuracy assessment with respect to in situ measurements was carried out the geocoded samples of effective snow wetness were evaluated with respect to coincident in situ measurements collected during a field campaign in bahang and solang as discussed in section 2 3 fig 12 a shows the correlation between the observed snow wetness and the snow wetness estimates retrieved from the proposed methodology based on risat 1 data the linear fit between the observed snow wetness and the snow wetness estimates retrieved from the proposed methodology was implemented with 95 confidence bounds yielding a coefficient of determination r square of 0 862 the correlation coefficient r 0 928 and the root mean square error rmse was 0 667 fig 13 further the snow wetness was also estimated based on the shi dozier method shi dozier 2000 using fully polarimetric radarsat 2 datasets the accuracy assessment was done in a similar manner as for the risat 1 snow wetness estimates as shown in fig 12 b the parameters for evaluating the goodness of fit for shi dozier method were estimated coefficient of determination r square equaling to 0 786 and correlation coefficient r 0 886 the root mean square error rmse was observed to be 0 837 the accuracy assessment statistics for both the risat 1 snow wetness based on the proposed methodology and the radarsat 2 estimates based on the shi and dozier method shi dozier 2000 are summarized in table 2 it is evident that the proposed method based on hybrid polarimetric c band data significantly outperformed the shi and dozier method based on fully polarimetric c band data in our investigation the proposed hybrid polarimetric sar based approach provided competitive results with other snow wetness estimation approaches which utilized quad polarimetric sar datasets the decomposition based approach by surendar et al 2015 for snow wetness estimation using radarsat 2 datasets observed an absolute error of 1 3 by volume thakur et al 2016 demonstrated the applicability of risat 1 frs 2 quad pol c band datasets for snow wetness estimation in a previous study with a correlation coefficient r of 0 86 further ma et al 2020 proposed an approach using radarsat 2 and gaofen 3 datasets for snow wetness estimation the retrieved correlation coefficient r with gaofen 3 dataset using the proposed approach was 0 72 with root mean square error rmse of 3 89 the retrieved correlation coefficient r with radarsat 2 dataset applying the proposed approach was 0 62 with root mean square error rmse of 1 66 in general we observed the results from the proposed approach to be competitive with the other methods in the literature it is worth mentioning that the risat 1 satellite passes over the study area in a few minutes providing limited time to collect synchronized measurements due to the lack of any additional datasets the evaluation of the snow wetness estimates was carried out with the data collected on 24 02 21 only although the sample set used in this study for validation is relatively smaller it is well known that field campaigns in the winter season in the himalayas are constrained by numerous factors and collection of a large volume of in situ measurements is typically not possible for smaller working teams with limited finances thakur et al 2016 subsequently several studies have utilized limited in situ measurements for the validation of various methods based on remote sensing data for estimation of snow parameters garg et al 2014 bhattacharya et al 2014 thakur et al 2016 5 conclusion the quantitative estimates of snow geophysical parameters such as snow wetness are used in mapping avalanche zones and hydrological modelling most of the methods for the estimation of snow wetness using sar are only based on fully polarimetric sar datasets however fully polarimetric sar datasets are commercial and expensive further hybrid polarimetric datasets have the advantage of half pulse repetition frequency prf providing capabilities for high temporal resolution and high spatial swath covered the lack of hybrid polarimetry based methods for snow wetness estimation provided the motivation for this study we proposed a novel modeling approach for the estimation of snow wetness using risat 1 hybrid polarimetric datasets the approach is based on the formulation of the surface and volume scattering parameters based on the derived hybrid polarimetric stokes parameters these scattering parameters were then used to retrieve the surface and volume permittivity empirically modelled to corresponding snow wetness the effective snowpack wetness was derived using a conventional weighing scheme based on scattering powers and the surface and volume wetness when evaluated against the in situ measurements the proposed method showed a good correlation with an r square of 0 86 and an rmse of 0 667 vol however some uncertainties were observed in the snow wetness maps due to the complex sensor geometry in the steep slopes and the possible dem errors in such regions compared to the fully polarimetric radarsat 2 based estimates of snow wetness using state of the art shi and dozier method the estimates from the proposed method showed significantly higher correlation and much lower rmse with respect to the in situ measurements the proposed method being the first hybrid polarimetric approach as of we are aware for the estimation of snow wetness derives significance from the upcoming hybrid polarimetric sar mission such as risat 1a and 1b nasa isro sar mission nisar radarsat constellation mission rcm and alos palsar 3 the authors thus propose further experiments to investigate the robustness of the proposed approach utilizing the hybrid polarimetric sar datasets

3012,snow wetness estimates are critical inputs in the understanding of snow hydrological processes with early warming in winters in the himalayas snowpack shows early signs of melting in february with increased snow wetness typically in february the snowpack comprises a mix of dry and wet snow layers in the literature methods for quantitative analysis of snow wetness are mostly based on fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar sar data methods based on the hybrid polarimetric sar polsar data for snow monitoring are virtually inexistent this study proposes a novel methodology for the estimation of snow wetness utilizing the c band hybrid polarimetric risat 1 sar dataset using radar remote sensing to analyze the behavior of such a snowpack requires information on the surface and volume scattering characteristics the modeled generalized surface and volume scattering parameters α and γ based on the x bragg s reflection coefficients and fresnel transmission coefficients are used for the inversion of surface and volume snow permittivities respectively the investigations are carried out for february 2014 for a study area in the manali region in himachal pradesh india the retrieved snow estimates showed a coefficient of determination of 0 86 and a root mean square error of 0 667 with respect to in situ measurements further it was observed that the snow wetness estimates derived from the proposed method using risat 1 dataset outperformed the estimates based on fully polarimetric radarsat 2 dataset using the conventional shi and dozier method keywords synthetic aperture radar hybrid polarimetric sar snow snow wetness snowmelt risat 1 radarsat 2 1 introduction investigations of the global snow cover is critical in understanding the planetary energy budgets and climate feedbacks the timing and the extent of snow melt during the ablation season has a significant impact on the surface albedo and the surface energy budget flanner et al 2011 the planetary albedo is also affected by the snow microstructure which undergoes metamorphism due to various geophysical processes colbeck 1982 one of the key geophysical properties of snow that further influences the metamorphism iteratively is the snow liquid water content or the snow wetness colbeck 1982 the moisture or wetness in snow causes the cohesive forces to overcome leading to potentially increased melt and vulnerability to shear breakdown pomeroy brun 2001 techel pielmeier 2011 subsequently investigations of the snow wetness are critically emphasized in climate and environmental modelling pomeroy brun 2001 the trends of retreating snow cover have been alarming in the eurasian regions covering two major mountainous regimes the alps and the himalayas urraca gobron 2021 for asia understanding the extent and behavior of seasonal himalayan snow is critical from hydrological and climate modelling the seasonal snowmelt in the himalayas is a primary source of fresh water to approximately one sixth of the world s population mithen black 2011 the available water from snowmelt gets added to the discharge of the mountainous rivers bernier et al 2017 contributing to hydropower generation and river canal irrigation systems in the mountainous regions critical geohazards like avalanches and flash floods depend on the terrain conditions and the snow geophysical properties like the snow wetness liquid water content and snow particle size schweizer et al 2003 weingartner et al 2003 wever et al 2018 the presence of liquid water in the snowpack with diurnal temperature gradients renders the formation of weak snow crystals in the intermediate layers that are vulnerable to fracture schweizer jamieson 2001 awasthi varade 2021 the snow wetness is a key input for mapping avalanche hazard zones and predicting wet snow avalanches which have a high risk of affecting roads railway networks and human settlements fischer 2013 hence spatio temporal monitoring of snow wetness is vital in avalanche forecasting and hydrological modelling in mountainous regions high elevated mountainous regions exhibit extended snow cover however field investigation of snowpack is challenging due to the rugged terrain in the himalayas varade et al 2020a awasthi et al 2021 subsequently the field campaigns for in situ measurements of snow physical properties in such areas are constrained by challenging weather conditions lack of proper infrastructure and high manpower requirements contributing to the higher costs for periodical data collection further the complex topography of the himalayas results in the spatial variability of the snowpack geophysical parameters and such information is typically irretrievable from field campaigns satellite remote sensing techniques have shown a significant potential for the continuous monitoring of snowpack dynamics and estimating snow geophysical parameters nagler rott 2000 gupta et al 2005 thakur et al 2016 haq et al 2019 varade dikshit 2020 the limitation of optical remote sensing is associated with the shallow penetration of the incident wave in the snowpack thus any information retrieved on the snow geophysical parameters is for the surface layer only varade dikshit 2018 varade dikshit 2019 in contrast the higher penetrability and the sensitivity of the microwave signal to the snow dielectric properties provide us with capabilities to derive volumetric information on the snow geophysical parameters ulaby et al 2014 moreover microwave remote sensing has the operational advantage even during the cloud cover foggy rainy and even hazy weather conditions in p l c and x frequency bands stiles et al 1981 pottier lee 2009 cloude 2010 awasthi et al 2022 subsequently several studies have demonstrated the capability of synthetic aperture radar sar data to estimate snow geophysical parameters awasthi varade 2021 various studies have explored the development of methods for the estimation of snow wetness using polarimetric sar polsar datasets shi dozier 1995 shi dozier 2000 singh et al 2006 singh 2007 thakur aggarwal garg garg mani pandit et al 2012 bhattacharya et al 2014 surendar et al 2015 thakur et al 2016 however most of these methods utilize fully polarimetric sar data which is typically commercial and expensive in shi dozier 1995 the backscatter response from snow has been studied to model the snow wetness surendar et al 2015 utilized general four component scattering power decomposition with unitary transformation g4u singh et al 2013 to model the effective snow wetness as the weighted sum of the surface and volumetric snow wetness in divyesh et al 2019a the snow wetness was modelled based on the model baghdadi et al 2016 proposed for the estimation of moisture in bare surfaces however in this study it was demonstrated that the wetness estimates have significantly higher uncertainty ma et al 2020 utilized the dense media radiative transfer dmrt model to derive the surface and volume snow wetness which were used in a weighted sum approach to determine the effective snowpack wetness in general polsar techniques apply polarization diversity and utilize multiple channel polarimetric information to estimate target parameters pottier lee 2009 the target information is retrieved based on orientation alignment and shape of the target using fully dual and hybrid polsar datasets pottier lee 2009 cloude 2010 the fully polsar datasets have high pulse repetition frequency prf but a smaller swath coverage area which adversely affects the temporal resolution of the sar sensor also the full polarimetric sar sensor configuration has more complex architecture woodhouse 2005 in contrast the dual polarimetric sensors have half prf as compared to fully polsar resulting in a larger swath coverage area than the fully polsar datasets subsequently the temporal resolution of the sar sensor is improved kumar et al 2017 awasthi et al 2020b in hybrid polarimetry the sensor transmits the polarized electromagnetic wave in the right circular r or the left circular l direction and the backscatter from the target are coherently received by the sar sensor in the orthogonal horizontal h and vertical v linear polarizations raney 2007 similar to dual polarimetry hybrid polarimetry offers half pulse repetition frequency prf compared to full polarimetric sar datasets cloude et al 2012 raney et al 2012 thus providing capabilities for high temporal resolution of the hybrid polsar sensor these hybrid polarimetric sar channels maintain the roll invariant property i e they are not affected by the polarimetric orientation angle shift cloude et al 2012 kumar et al 2016 further the target information retrieved by the hybrid polsar sensors is relatively higher compared to dual polsar sensors raney 2019 kumar et al 2020 in few studies hybrid polarimetric datasets have been emulated using fully polsar datasets to demonstrate potential capabilities of compact polarimetric sar kumar panigrahi 2019 kumar et al 2020 mandal et al 2020 in a study pseudo quad polarimetric simulations using compact hybrid polsar data thakur et al 2016 have been used for estimating snow wetness based on fully polsar methods to the best of our knowledge studies based on hybrid or compact polsar data for estimating snow wetness have been limited or virtually non existent with several spaceborne sar missions alos 3 nisar radarsat constellation mission rcm risat 1a and risat 1b acquiring sar datasets in the hybrid pol mode thompson 2015 rosen et al 2017 tadono et al 2019 there is a need to develop methods that can be implemented to estimate snow wetness using hybrid polsar datasets this study accounts for the previously mentioned research gaps in developing a hybrid polarimetric approach for estimating the snow wetness the objective of this study is developing a novel approach for ascertaining the capability of hybrid polsar data for quantitative snow wetness investigations by integrating hybrid polsar decomposed parameters with stokes parameterization of the hybrid polsar covariance matrix the developed methodology uses the extended x bragg scattering and generalized volume scattering model to estimate snow surface and volume permittivity respectively based on stokes formulation a conventional lookup table based approach is utilized for the determination of the snow surface and volume permittivity from the theoretical permittivity values varade et al 2019 the surface and volume snow wetness is retrieved from the corresponding permittivities using the empirical relation defined by denoth denoth 1994 thakur aggarwal garg garg mani kumar et al 2012 the effective snow wetness is modeled as the weighted sum of the estimated surface and volume snow wetness components where the weights are determined using the surface and volume scattering powers surendar et al 2015 the potential of the proposed approach for the estimation of snow wetness is demonstrated using hybrid polsar risat 1 dataset with corresponding in situ measurements 2 study area and dataset description 2 1 study area the study area is situated in the north western himalayas of india in the snow covered regions of the manali region in himachal pradesh as shown in fig 1 the study area covering approximately 350 km2 lies in the beas river basin and has been used in several snow studies in the literature snehmani et al 2010 thakur et al 2013a singh et al 2017 patil et al 2020 varade manickam et al 2020 awasthi et al 2021 the beas basin upsurges from the rohtang pass at 4350 m above sea level 51 km north of manali thakur et al 2016 the study area is located between latitude 32 16 n to 32 56 n and longitude 76 91 e to 77 39 e the climate of the study area is typically cold and dry with three broad seasons 1 winter season from october to february with temperatures ranging from 11 c to 30 c 2 summer season from march to june with average temperatures between 6 c and 35 c and 3 rainy season from july to september with the temperature ranges between 3 c and 33 c thakur et al 2012 in the indian himalayas snowfall generally occurs from december to march at an average elevation above 2000 m the observed snow wetness during jan march is around 1 8 by volume surendar et al 2015 annually august is the wettest month throughout this region the maximum rainfall is experienced during july august and minimum rainfall occurs in october january the temperatures in the study area range from a mean daily minimum of between 15 c to 0 c in january and rises to a maximum temperature of 20 c to 30 c in june thakur et al 2013b surendar et al 2015 the snowmelt typically starts from february end to mid september tiwari et al 2015 the april june months follow a period of rapid snowmelt leading to increased snowmelt runoff contributing to the beas river discharge negi joshi 2004 the highest river flow is experienced for july to september months and is dominated by monsoons related rainfall singh et al 2020 the maximum snowfall is observed in february in this region in the higher altitudes a maximum of 3 m snow depth is observed during the peak winter season with an observed average snow depth of 2 5 m while the lower altitudes in the region experience a maximum snow depth of 1 m during the peak snowfall period and an average snow depth of 0 75 m during the winter season singh et al 2011 2 2 polarimetric sar datasets the experiments to evaluate the proposed method for estimating snow wetness were conducted primarily using risat 1 datasets risat 1 is the first indigenous polarimetric radar imaging satellite launched by the indian space research organization isro in 2012 misra kirankumar 2014 that acquires data in various multi polarization modes comprising scansar modes in high medium coarse resolutions and fine resolution stripmap frs modes the risat 1 dataset used in this study was acquired under the frs 1 mode additional experiments were carried out using radarsat 2 fully polsar datasets in fine quad pol mode the radarsat 2 also acquires data in several modes from scansar to spotlight modes with different polarization combinations hillman et al 2009 an overview of the specifications of the datasets used in this study is illustrated in table 1 2 3 ground dataset information the proposed method for the estimation of snow wetness was evaluated using the field data collected during late february 2014 the in situ data used in the study was synchronized with the risat 1 satellite pass 6 30 pm indian standard time which were provided by the defence geoinformatics research establishment dgre defence research development organization drdo ministry of defence govt of india the ground data were collected with the snowfork instrument a popular equipment for collecting in situ measurements of snow geophysical characteristics thakur et al 2016 varade dikshit 2018 this snowfork is a compact instrument which measures resonant frequency attenuation and 3 db bandwidth capacity the complex dielectric constant of snow is then calculated using these observations snowfork allows rapid and accurate measurements of snow parameters like snow wetness and snow density from the complex dielectric constant of snow using semi empirical equations that are sometimes not feasible with conventional devices such as snow tubes especially with a smaller manpower surendar et al 2015 this instrument s measurements are dependable because it does not compress the snowpack the measurements are also easily reproducible and the findings can be confirmed using a calibration measurement in the air thakur et al 2016 the depth of each snow pit dug were around 30 40 cm the microwave electromagnetic waves operating in c band wavelength often penetrate the snowpack by 15 20 cm in low to moderate snow wetness conditions surendar et al 2015 varade et al 2020 within each layer the snowfork probe was introduced parallel to the snow surface for five repeated measurements and the in situ measurements were collected from pits dug to the soil layer at intervals of 15 cm 20 cm throughout the snowpack thickness in general five layers of snow were identified in the snowpack with the surface layer amounting to a thickness of 5 10 cm the internal structure of the snowpack varies significantly due to the variations in the diurnal air temperature and the temperature gradients which result in metamorphosis of the snow crystals the snow depth also plays a key role in the metamorphosis where at shallow depth the process of metamorphosis is relatively more accelerated subsequently the snowpack properties vary significantly on a temporal scale awasthi varade 2021 a significant variation in the surface wetness from approximately 1 5 to 5 was observed in the solang and bahang regions of manali during the field campaign in the week around the sensing date of the risat 1 acquisition the minimum and maximum temperature in the study area ranged between 10 c to 15 c and 8 c to 2 c recorded from the aws station located in solang as shown in fig 2 during this period on 22 feb 2014 and 27 feb 2014 the areas at the higher altitude regions in the study area witnessed 12 cm and 7 cm of snowfall respectively the lower altitude regions experienced 9 cm and 7 cm rainfall respectively as observed from the snow gauges the standing snow values recorded at the aws station in the solang region during the observation window 20 28 february 2014 were in the range of 80 cm and 106 cm the recorded value of standing snow depth on 22 feb 2014 morning was 94 cm later due to the snowfall event on 22 feb 2014 the standing snow depth increased to 106 cm in this duration however due to the further gradual increase in the daily maximum temperature in the region shown in fig 2 the standing snow values sharply declined to 76 cm on 27 feb 2014 due to possible snowmelt and or compactness of snowpack layers during the field campaign on 24 feb 2014 snow geophysical observations were recorded from eight snow pits in bahang and solang regions unfortunately due to the shorter duration of the satellite pass single date data it might not have been possible to record more observations synchronized with the satellite pass in fig 3 a and b the ground observations made on 24 feb 2014 has been shown here for the surface layer 5 10 cm it can be observed that the snow density and the snow wetness are very low indicating the presence of recent fresh dry snow as mentioned earlier in bahang in the middle layers the density and the wetness increased significantly indicating the presence of old snow with wetness of about 4 5 vol while in the deeper layers it can be observed that the density reduces significantly as compared to wetness which may be attributed to the metamorphosis of snow crystals in depth hoar observations of snow depth hoar in february have been referred to in the snowpack stratigraphy in these regions in other studies varade et al 2020a in solang the layer below the surface shows very high density possibly attributed to significant wetness in the layer boundaries and the existence of icy layers or wind crust from previous accumulation event 3 methodology and implementation 3 1 background 3 1 1 stokes representation for hybrid polsar in hybrid polarimetry circularly polarized electromagnetic em waves are transmitted and coherent orthogonal linear polarized em waves are received in horizontal h or vertical v directions the transmitted circularly polarized waves are either left circular polarized or right circular polarized resulting in rh rv or lh lv polarization channels the hybrid polarimetric sar is invariant to faraday rotation fr or polarization orientation angle shift errors raney 2007 cloude et al 2012 the transmitted and received em wave in a hybrid polarimetric system can be expressed as follows raney

polarimetric m α decomposition in the hybrid polarimetric system the degree of polarization m and the polarimetric scattering angle α are expressed in the form of stokes parameters by cloude et al

ranges of 450 to 450 in hybrid polarimetry by substituting an atan2 function instead of the atan function ponnurangam et al 2016 the m α decomposition technique cloude et al 2012 derives the

backscatter characteristics of snowpack the stratigraphy of the snowpack is defined by the geometric and dielectric properties of snowpack layers shi dozier 1997 kontu et al 2020 awasthi varade 2021 the backscatter from the snowpack is characterized by the sensor sensing geometry wavelength of the incident wave and the radiative and geometrical properties of the snowpack ulaby et al 1984 in general a two layer air and snow boundary model is followed to understand the interactions of the em wave with the snowpack the total backscatter from the snowpack comprises contributions from the air snow interface snowpack volume and the snow ground interface ulaby et al 1986 the double bounce scattering component for snow cover is very small and in general neglected singh et al 2014 in the case of dry snow the backscatter component from the snow ground interface is dominant and the snowpack is apparently transparent to the incident em wave varade et al 2020b however as the liquid water content in the snowpack increases wetness of 1 2 by vol for example in the case of old snow the backscatter from the air snow interface is not negligible varade et al 2020a a further increase in the wetness of the snow surface renders a dominant surface scattering component the varying behavior of the snowpack with respect to wetness is shown in a schematic in fig 4 in general in the melt season the surface scattering component is dominant than the volumetric component and the snow ground interface component is negligible manickam barros 2020 however in the case of an old snowpack such as in february in the himalayas the surface component may remain dry and the radar signal interactions are affected in the snowpack volume due to the presence of liquid water content the magnitude of backscatter in such a case depends on the magnitude of the liquid water content in the snowpack volume to quantify the effective wetness of the snowpack it is essential to consider both the surface and the volumetric scattering components which varies depending upon the wetness of the surface layer and volume respectively subsequently in the literature a weighing scheme is typically adopted based on the surface and volume scattering powers to quantify the effective wetness of the snowpack from the surface and volumetric snow wetness surendar et al 2015 3 2 overview of the proposed approach for snow wetness estimation the proposed method utilizes the stokes representation of the generalized surface and volume parameters for the estimation of snow wetness using hybrid polsar data fig 5 shows the general framework used in the proposed methodology the stokes vector g is derived from the 2 2 jone s wave covariance matrix j2 further these stokes parameters are used to derive 1 generalized theoretical polarimetric surface scattering parameter αt based on the extended bragg x bragg scattering coefficients and 2 generalized theoretical volume scattering parameter γ t based on the fresnel transmission coefficients the x bragg s scattering coefficients and fresnel transmission coefficients functions of incidence angle and the dielectric constants of the snowpack are used to derive the modelled generalized surface scattering parameter αm and generalized volume scattering parameter γ m a lookup table based approach is used for deriving the permittivity by comparing the theoretical values of these coefficients with corresponding to the modelled values ma et al 2020 sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 the model defined by denoth 1994 has been extensively used in the literature and in this study for the retrieval of snow wetness from snow permittivity for both the snowpack surface and the volume we utilize the same weighing scheme as proposed in surendar et al 2015 to determine the effective snow wetness section 3 3 however the surface and volume scattering powers are determined based on the m α decomposition in the hybrid polarimetric system the proposed methodology is further elaborated in the forthcoming sub sections 3 2 1 estimation of surface snow permittivity as the surface scattering mechanism α s contains the information about the dielectric properties of the surface snow surface dielectric constant the potential of the scattering mechanisms from fully polsar data for snow surface dielectric constant estimation using theoretical surface scattering models have already been exploited using c band frequencies manickam et al 2016 the surface scattering parameter α t is retrieved using the hybrid decomposition technique in terms of stokes parameter cloude et al 2012 and the surface scattering parameter α m is estimated using the extended bragg model x bragg proposed in cloude corr 2002 the generalized theoretical polarimetric scattering parameter α t is estimated in terms of the stokes parameters as shown in eq 7 7 α t 1 2 tan 1 g 1 2 g 2 2 g 3 the modeled generalized scattering parameter αm is expressed by employing the extended bragg x bragg surface scattering model for the inversion of snow surface dielectric constant cloude corr 2002 the extended x bragg s surface scattering model exhibits a wider tolerance to the surface roughness variations this model provides a higher limit of ks 1 where k represents the vertical wavenumber and s represents the surface height standard deviation the modeled polarimetric scattering parameter is expressed in terms of x bragg s scattering coefficients b hh and b vv as shown in eq 8 8 α m tan 1 b h h b v v b h h b v v where the horizontal x bragg s scattering coefficient

relationship between the snowpack dielectric constant and the snow wetness denoth 1994 surendar et al 2015 33 w 5 35 1 1 92 ρ the overall effective snowpack wetness w e v o l shown in eq 34 is estimated using the snow surface wetness and the volume wetness utilizing the surface and volume scattering powers ps and pv respectively 34 w e ω s w s ω v w v ω s ω v 1 where fractional surface constant ω s and fractional volume constant ω v are calculated as follows 35 ω s p s p s p v ω v p v p s p v 3 4 inversion of surface and volume permittivity the incidence angle and the permittivity dielectric constant real significantly affect x bragg s reflection coefficients and the fresnel transmission coefficients characterizing the surface and the volume scattering respectively in general the magnitude of both x bragg s reflection coefficients and the fresnel transmission coefficients declines exponentially with respect to an increase in the incidence angle the variation in the horizontal and the vertical x bragg s reflection coefficients and the fresnel transmission coefficients with respect to the incidence angle and dielectric constant is illustrated in figs 6 and 7 respectively the direct inversion of the generalized surface parameter gsp and generalized volume parameter gvp often results in solutions that do not pertain to the expected values of snow the lookup table lut approach is used for estimating snowpack surface dielectric constant s for each image pixel using the modeled polarimetric surface scattering parameter α m and the theoretical generalized polarimetric surface scattering parameter α t and snowpack volume dielectric constant v using the modeled generalized volume parameter γ m and theoretical generalized volume parameter γ t for each pixel surendar et al 2015 the values of s and v are defined with a range 1 3 typical of the expected field conditions during winters for snow for each pixel the modeled surface scattering parameter α t and generalized volume parameter γ t is calculated using eq 7 and eq 28b respectively simultaneously the modeled surface scattering parameter α m and generalized volume parameter γ m are also calculated using the snow surface dielectric constant s and snowpack volume dielectric constant v values from the lut shown in eq 8 and eq 31 respectively the minimization function used for the estimation of s and v are expressed as in eq 36 and eq 37 respectively 36 m i n s α t α m 37 m i n v γ t γ m 4 results and discussion 4 1 scattering characteristics in the study area the rgb color composite of the decomposed scattering powers generated using the m α hybrid polarimetric decomposition of the risat 1 datasets is shown in fig 8 the surface scatterers dihedral scatterers and the random volume scattering targets are visually identified using polarimetric decomposition in fig 8 represented by the hue of the rgb colors in the snowpack the dominating scattering mechanisms are the surface scattering from the snow surface interface and the random scattering from the snowpack volume thakur et al 2016 the backscattering from the snowpack can assist in determining dry wet snow cover and the snow cover properties the contrast enhancement of rgb composite of risat 1 is done as shown in fig 8 a in fig 8 both the risat 1 and radarsat 2 rgb composites show a greenish tone where the green band is the volume scattering indicating a dominant volume scattering the rgb composites confirm the state of the snowpack to exhibit a relatively drier surface layer due to the recent snowfall event happened at that time as discussed in section 2 3 in order to assess the dominance and or the response of the land use land cover lulc in the study area corresponding to the scene of investigation risat 1 24 02 2014 we generated a lulc map as shown in fig 9 a utilizing several spectral indices as in divyesh et al 2019b the supervised classification was implemented using the corresponding landsat 8 30 m satellite imagery for the preparation of lulc which has four classes snow mixed snow forest and bare soil further 9028 random samples were generated for each class to extract the polarimetric parameters for analysis fig 9b shows the distribution of the backscattered powers ps pv and pd and the complex polarization ratio cpr corresponding to the four fundamental classes mentioned earlier in the lulc in the study area irrespective of the lulc the cpr exhibits a similar range of values although there is no distinct variation in the scattering powers per the different classes the volume scattering is generally dominant however changes in the median values red line in the boxes for the scattering powers can be observed according to the different classes the difference between the surface and the volume scattering medians is relatively lesser in the mixed snow and bare soil classes possibly due to higher surface roughness causing a relative increase in the surface scattering the bare soil class in this case also includes the presence of boulders and rocks in the case of mixed snow the relative increase in the surface scattering could possibly be attributed to the interactions of the radar signal with the boreal forest canopy 4 2 snowpack permittivity and wetness as snow is regarded as a mixture of ice air and liquid water the permittivity of snow is directly an indicator of its physical composition tiuri et al 1984 for example fresh snow has negligible liquid water comprising air and ice particles and both ice and air have very low permittivity indicating the overall lower effective permittivity 1 of fresh snow considering any dielectric mixing formula evans 1965 in contrast liquid water has high permittivity of about 80 thus inclusion of liquid water in the snow during melting causes the effective permittivity of snow to increase when compared with fresh snow schwank naderpour 2018 the present study focuses on the snow wetness however other studies have shown direct relationship between snow permittivity and other snow properties such as the snow density awasthi et al 2020a varade et al 2020a and the snow grain size tiuri et al 1984 pirazzini et al 2015 the snowpack surface dielectric constant and the surface snow wetness estimated by the proposed model described in section 3 2 1 using modeled generalized polarimetric surface scattering parameter αm and x bragg s scattering coefficients for the date of 24 feb 2014 are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively most of the estimated surface wetness in the study area ranges from 3 to 7 by volume the forest cover area was masked using the landsat 8 generated ndvi mask keeping the threshold limit of 0 7 the regions affected with layover and shadow effect during the sar data acquisition were also masked using srtm 1 arcsec digital elevation model dem the surface wetness value varied in the study area between 0 4 and 8 09 with the mean values of about 4 although the backscattered power typically decreases with an increase in the permittivity of the snowpack or the wetness the processes are much complex to be modelled simply in a linear relationship as shown in fig 10 c in fig 10 c a general declining trend in the surface scattering power is observed as expected corresponding to an increase in the surface snow wetness generally the spatial distribution of the permittivity and the wetness are expected to be similar considering they are linearly related according to the empirical model by denoth denoth 1994 it is observed that both the permittivity and the wetness exhibit significantly lower values along the mountain ridges possibly due to errors introduced due to the viewing geometry of the sensor across steep slopes and dem errors corresponding to very high local incidence angle nagler et al 2016 it may also be possible that the snow in the higher altitudes may be relatively dry as compared to the mid and low altitudes further some sun facing slopes may exhibit increased melting of the surface leading to higher surface wetness the snowpack volume dielectric constant and the volume snow wetness estimated by the proposed model described in section 3 2 1 applying modeled generalized volume parameter γ m by utilizing fresnel s scattering coefficients for the date of 24 feb 2014 are shown in fig 11 a and b respectively fig 11 c shows the scatterplot of the volume scattering power and the volume wetness corresponding to the samples used to generate the boxplot in fig 9 b from the scatterplot a declining trend indicates the inverse relationship between the volume wetness and the backscattered power which is typically attributed to the absorption of the incident radiation the magnitude of the volume wetness observed ranges from 1 0 to 7 08 by volume where significantly lower wetness is observed along the mountain ridges however in contrast to the surface wetness the valley areas exhibit much higher volume wetness possibly due to the higher diurnal temperature differences in the low elevation areas in the winter season in the himalayas further it is observed that slopes facing the sensor show relatively higher volume wetness it is worth mentioning that the viewing geometry of the slopes significantly affects the polarized backscatter response particularly the polarization scattering angle varade et al 2020c the snow surface can melt many centimeters in the day and while the lower lying volume snow may remain dry therefore for an acquisition in the daytime a higher contribution from the surface snow is expected hence it is observed that the wetness contribution from the surface snow wetness is higher than that of volume snow wetness as observed from fig 8 further the standing snow measurement on 24 feb 2014 was 88 cm which was far lower than the maximum standing snow measurement of 106 cm observed on 22 feb 2014 the effective snow wetness we for the snowpack eq 35 is estimated as the weighted sum of the surface and volumetric snow wetness where the weights are derived corresponding to the scattering powers ps and pv as shown in fig 9 most of the effective snow wetness falls in the study area range from 3 to 7 by volume in general it can be observed that the uncertainties in the snow wetness due to issues associated with the ridgelines and the orientation of slopes with respect to the sensor viewing geometry are transferred to the effective wetness from the surface and volume snow wetness estimates during this process of snow wetness estimation the areas covered with the vegetation cover and the layover and shadow affected areas were excluded from the investigation using vegetation and layover and shadow masks the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi map generated using the landsat 8 datasets was applied to create vegetation masks in the area further the layover and shadow mask was generated using the digital elevation models dem and local incidence angle information 4 3 validation of the newly proposed method and comparative analysis with fully polarimetric sar datasets existing shi dozier method to evaluate the proposed method and the retrieved snow wetness using the risat 1 hybrid polsar data an accuracy assessment with respect to in situ measurements was carried out the geocoded samples of effective snow wetness were evaluated with respect to coincident in situ measurements collected during a field campaign in bahang and solang as discussed in section 2 3 fig 12 a shows the correlation between the observed snow wetness and the snow wetness estimates retrieved from the proposed methodology based on risat 1 data the linear fit between the observed snow wetness and the snow wetness estimates retrieved from the proposed methodology was implemented with 95 confidence bounds yielding a coefficient of determination r square of 0 862 the correlation coefficient r 0 928 and the root mean square error rmse was 0 667 fig 13 further the snow wetness was also estimated based on the shi dozier method shi dozier 2000 using fully polarimetric radarsat 2 datasets the accuracy assessment was done in a similar manner as for the risat 1 snow wetness estimates as shown in fig 12 b the parameters for evaluating the goodness of fit for shi dozier method were estimated coefficient of determination r square equaling to 0 786 and correlation coefficient r 0 886 the root mean square error rmse was observed to be 0 837 the accuracy assessment statistics for both the risat 1 snow wetness based on the proposed methodology and the radarsat 2 estimates based on the shi and dozier method shi dozier 2000 are summarized in table 2 it is evident that the proposed method based on hybrid polarimetric c band data significantly outperformed the shi and dozier method based on fully polarimetric c band data in our investigation the proposed hybrid polarimetric sar based approach provided competitive results with other snow wetness estimation approaches which utilized quad polarimetric sar datasets the decomposition based approach by surendar et al 2015 for snow wetness estimation using radarsat 2 datasets observed an absolute error of 1 3 by volume thakur et al 2016 demonstrated the applicability of risat 1 frs 2 quad pol c band datasets for snow wetness estimation in a previous study with a correlation coefficient r of 0 86 further ma et al 2020 proposed an approach using radarsat 2 and gaofen 3 datasets for snow wetness estimation the retrieved correlation coefficient r with gaofen 3 dataset using the proposed approach was 0 72 with root mean square error rmse of 3 89 the retrieved correlation coefficient r with radarsat 2 dataset applying the proposed approach was 0 62 with root mean square error rmse of 1 66 in general we observed the results from the proposed approach to be competitive with the other methods in the literature it is worth mentioning that the risat 1 satellite passes over the study area in a few minutes providing limited time to collect synchronized measurements due to the lack of any additional datasets the evaluation of the snow wetness estimates was carried out with the data collected on 24 02 21 only although the sample set used in this study for validation is relatively smaller it is well known that field campaigns in the winter season in the himalayas are constrained by numerous factors and collection of a large volume of in situ measurements is typically not possible for smaller working teams with limited finances thakur et al 2016 subsequently several studies have utilized limited in situ measurements for the validation of various methods based on remote sensing data for estimation of snow parameters garg et al 2014 bhattacharya et al 2014 thakur et al 2016 5 conclusion the quantitative estimates of snow geophysical parameters such as snow wetness are used in mapping avalanche zones and hydrological modelling most of the methods for the estimation of snow wetness using sar are only based on fully polarimetric sar datasets however fully polarimetric sar datasets are commercial and expensive further hybrid polarimetric datasets have the advantage of half pulse repetition frequency prf providing capabilities for high temporal resolution and high spatial swath covered the lack of hybrid polarimetry based methods for snow wetness estimation provided the motivation for this study we proposed a novel modeling approach for the estimation of snow wetness using risat 1 hybrid polarimetric datasets the approach is based on the formulation of the surface and volume scattering parameters based on the derived hybrid polarimetric stokes parameters these scattering parameters were then used to retrieve the surface and volume permittivity empirically modelled to corresponding snow wetness the effective snowpack wetness was derived using a conventional weighing scheme based on scattering powers and the surface and volume wetness when evaluated against the in situ measurements the proposed method showed a good correlation with an r square of 0 86 and an rmse of 0 667 vol however some uncertainties were observed in the snow wetness maps due to the complex sensor geometry in the steep slopes and the possible dem errors in such regions compared to the fully polarimetric radarsat 2 based estimates of snow wetness using state of the art shi and dozier method the estimates from the proposed method showed significantly higher correlation and much lower rmse with respect to the in situ measurements the proposed method being the first hybrid polarimetric approach as of we are aware for the estimation of snow wetness derives significance from the upcoming hybrid polarimetric sar mission such as risat 1a and 1b nasa isro sar mission nisar radarsat constellation mission rcm and alos palsar 3 the authors thus propose further experiments to investigate the robustness of the proposed approach utilizing the hybrid polarimetric sar datasets

3013,quantifying nitrogen n and phosphorus p sources and their contributions at a watershed scale is a primary step to design best management practices this task is challenging for a mixed watershed with both mountain and lowland areas because most existing watershed models were developed for mountain areas with clear water flow directions to solve this challenge we coupled the soil and water assessment tool swat for mountain watersheds phosphorus dynamic model for lowland polder systems pdp and nitrogen dynamic model for lowland polder systems ndp for lowland artificial watersheds i e polders to characterize n and p loading for a typical mountain lowland mixed watershed lake chaohu basin in china the coupled model was calibrated based on eight year 2011 2018 meteorological hydrological and water quality datasets and had a satisfactory performance for both hydrological and water quality variables r2 0 6 ns 0 6 our eight year investigation in the five watersheds of lake chaohu basin revealed that 1 the estimated n and p loading had an annual averaged amount of 10 832 and 781 t yr and an intensity of 15 72 and 1 33 kg ha yr respectively three watersheds nanfei pai and baishitian river watersheds had relatively high loading intensity for n 35 16 18 34 and 13 34 kg ha yr and p 2 49 1 25 and 2 72 kg ha yr and contributed 67 6 n and 68 5 p to the loading of the five investigated watersheds 2 polders in lake chaohu basin can be n and p sources or sinks for their surrounding rivers depending on the polder river interaction within nanfei pai and baishitian river watersheds n and p retention ability was higher in polders than that in mountain watersheds 3 population density precipitation intensity and soil erosion were critical drivers of n and p loss and showed positive correlation with n and p loss intensity this study demonstrated the high value model coupling to characterize n and p loading in a mountain lowland mixed watershed system and thus to improve our understanding on its n and p cycling keywords polders nitrogen phosphorus swat pdp and ndp data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction a rising trend of eutrophication in global freshwater ecosystems has been one of the most challenging problems during the past decades ho et al 2019 sinha et al 2017 in a global survey of 2058 water bodies in 2012 30 5 of the total surface area and 63 1 of the total number were found to be eutrophic wang et al 2018 nearly half of china s 634 rivers lakes and reservoirs fail to meet required water standards throughout the year or in several months and even cause eutrophication due to excessive nitrogen n and phosphorus p loading especially in lakes chaohu taihu and dianchi dong et al 2018 huang et al 2019 schindler et al 2016 wang et al 2019 therefore quantifying n and p sources and their contributions at a watershed scale allows us for accurate identification of significant pollution sources as well as critical source areas and is a necessary basis for mangers to design best management practices attempts to quantify n and p at a watershed scale have been developed in many previous publications including field monitoring runoff test site experiment emission factor method etc shen et al 2012 wang et al 2020 however the above mentioned methods are costly and difficult to achieve high accuracy estimation as an alternative watershed hydrological models have been developed and applied in modeling hydrological and nutrient dynamics such as distributed hydrological model and semi distributed hydrological model arnold et al 1998 francesconi et al 2016 strömqvist et al 2012 these watershed hydrological models are able to quantify n and p transport and biogeochemical cycling for various land use types blatchford et al 2019 craig et al 2020 paul et al 2021 at various spatial scales including field apostel et al 2021 wang et al 2021 watershed piazzi et al 2021 worku meshesha et al 2020 national liu et al 2020 sun et al 2012 and global scales cordell and white 2015 despite the great advances in watershed modelling most widely used models were developed for mountain watersheds with clear water flow direction arnold and fohrer 2005 daniel et al 2011 these models cannot be directly applied to lowland watersheds due to its unclear water flow direction brauer et al 2014 sun et al 2021a zhao et al 2011 and did not reflect the real water exchange pattern of lowland polder systems polders are generally considered as closed areas enclosed by dikes to protect lowland areas from flood brauer 2014 polders widely distributed around aquatic systems greatly affect the water quality of downstream freshwater systems due to their wide distributions and intense use as agricultural land such as the rhine and danube rivers in europe the delta in netherlands and mississippi river in north america etc van der grift et al 2016 wang et al 2019 yan et al 2017 in china the area of lowland polders has reached 4 07 105 km2 most of which are located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river huang et al 2020a yan et al 2019 excess n and p exported from these lowland polders with intensive agriculture could be a major source contributing to the severe eutrophication of surrounding water bodies brauer et al 2014 dausse et al 2005 ham et al 2010 recently models applicable to lowland polders have been gradually developed including phosphorus dynamic model for lowland polder systems pdp and nitrogen dynamic model for lowland polder systems ndp which can better simulate the n and p dynamics in these landscapes huang et al 2018 huang et al 2016 to fill the above mentioned knowledge and methodological gaps we select a typical mountain lowland mixed watershed lake chaohu basin in china as the study area swat pdp and ndp were coupled to describe the n and p dynamics in mountain and lowland watersheds respectively the specific aims of our study were 1 to estimate n and p loss amount and intensity from mountain and lowland watersheds 2 to characterize the spatial temporal pattern of n and p loss and their underlying mechanisms between mountain and lowland watersheds this investigation can help water managers to pinpoint the hot spots of n and p loss for a mountain lowland mixed watershed and would thus support the design of best management

basin is located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river with lake chaohu in the center connected with six main inflows hangbu zhegao pai nanfei zhao and baishitian rivers and one main outflow of yuxi river connected with yangtze river fig 1 the main landform of the basin are mountain areas 12199 km2 and lowland areas 986 8 km2 with 85 7 of the lowland polders as the main geographical unit of the lowland areas the annual averaged air temperature of the basin is 16 1 c the annual averaged rainfall and evaporation are 995 7 and 1220 mm respectively wu et al 2021 zheng et al 2022 with the rapid population growth and economic development the high intensity human activities have led to a significant increase of loss of n and p in the basin water eutrophication he et al 2019 ren et al 2015 cyanobacteria bloom huang et al 2020b xu et al 2021 and other prominent water environment problems have severely affected the sustainable development of the economy he et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 during 2001 2011 tp and nh4 loading from major tributaries had a range of 1 56 104 5 47 104 and 0 19 104 0 51 104 t yr respectively exceeding the aquatic environmental capacity of the lake for both nutrients by 3 6 times yang et al 2013 during 2012 2018 the n and p emissions in lake chaohu basin increased significantly nearly three times higher than that in 2008 lin et al 2021 despite a series of interception and reduction measures taken such as the construction of sewage treatment plants and the treatment of farming tail water the exogenous nutrient loading of lake chaohu basin remains high and cyanobacterial blooms have repeatedly occurred liu et al 2021 xu et al 2021 by 2018 the area of harmful algal blooms in lake chaohu was still as high as 75 km2 huang et al 2020b a series of measured datasets were collected during 2011 2018 for modeling in lake chaohu basin table 1 including land use meteorological hydrological and water quality data the daily meteorological data temperature wind speed humidity sunshine hours were obtained from 12 meteorological stations of the china meteorological assimilation driving dataset for swat cmads meng et al 2018 daily precipitation data were obtained from 72 rainfall stations of hefei water and drought information network https sq hfswj net 8000 2 2 model coupling to characterize nutrient loading in this study swat pdp and ndp were coupled to describe the n and p dynamics for mountain lowland mixed watersheds in lake chaohu basin fig 2 spatial data dem land use type soil and meteorological data precipitation temperature wind speed humidity sunshine hours were collected as the driving data for the model the coupled model was calibrated based on runoff and water quality datasets from 2011 to 2018 to obtain the optimal values of hydrological and water quality parameters then the spatial and temporal characteristics of n and p dynamics and the different mechanisms between mountain and lowland watersheds were analyzed 2 2 1 modeling nutrient dynamics in lowland watersheds polders pdp and ndp models were developed by huang et al 2016 and huang et al 2018 to simulate n and p dynamics in lowland watersheds compared with the existing watershed models e g swat pdp and ndp models contain specific mechanisms to describe water balance and nutrient transport in lowland polders these models consider the artificial drainage and water exchange processes among surface water groundwater and soil water in farmlands huang et al 2018 pdp and ndp models include six modules fig s1 water area paddy land dry land residential area water management and nutrient balance modules huang et al 2016 n and p dynamic modules of different land use types were described in detail fig s1 including 1 atmospheric deposition n and p loading from livestock and people in residential area 2 settling releasing and plant n and p uptake in water bodies 3 fertilizer application irrigation erosion n and p form transformation and crop harvest in agricultural land 4 export of water n and p to surrounding streams through infiltration and artificial drainage therefore it is able to identify the n and p sources and sinks in a mountain lowland mixed watershed cui et al 2019 these two models have been calibrated using n and p from a typical polder resulting in an acceptable mode fit r 2 0 55 huang et al 2018 huang et al 2016 2 2 2 modeling nutrient dynamics in mountain watersheds soil and water assessment tool swat was used to simulate n and p dynamics in mountain watersheds it is a semi distributed and continuous time watershed hydrological model developed by the united states department of agriculture usda swat can simulate and output at a daily monthly and annual scale gassman et al 2007 which is suitable for large and small watersheds under different land use types soil types and management conditions soil erosion pollutant migration and transformation modules are embedded in the model which can simulate the migration and transformation process of sediment and nutrient in water bodies of each sub basin bugaets et al 2019 gessesse et al 2015 mukundan et al 2013 due to its powerful computational power complete model structure and parameter improvement performance it is widely used in watershed hydrology nutrient loss simulation and scenario management arnold et al 1998 lee et al 2010 liu et al 2013 in this study 17 parameters table s1 sensitive to discharge tn and tp were selected by sensitivity analysis the analysis was done using the latin hypercube one at a time lh oat method in the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 procedure of the swat calibration uncertainty program swat cup abbaspour 2015 the lh oat assesses the model sensitivity to a given parameter by varying the values of this parameter within a predefined uncertainty range while holding the other parameters constant abbaspour et al 2015 mtibaa and asano 2022 the first eight are hydrological parameters and the rest are water quality parameters we selected three indicators coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency ns pbias to evaluate the applicability of the coupled model in lake chaohu basin the calculation method and performance criteria for recommended statistics are summarized in table s2 moriasi et al 2015 muleta 2012 the evaluation results of previous studies that using the swat model to simulate tn and tp are summarized in table s3 3 results 3 1 model performance the model revealed a satisfactory performance r2 ns 0 60 during 2011 2018 in describing hydrological fig s2 n and p dynamics fig 3 using the coupled model swat coupled with pdp and ndp the mean value of r2 and ns for tn and tp were 0 55 and 0 50 respectively fig s5 generally it is considered that the simulation result is satisfactory when ns 0 50 good when ns is between 0 54 and 0 65 and very good when ns 0 65 moriasi et al 2015 wellen et al 2015 therefore our model performance can reach the good level fig s5 the coupled model is closer to the measured values in terms of peak than the previous method of using mountain model to simulate mountain and lowland watersheds fig s3 comparison of the simulation of n and p in the polders of hangbu zhegao pai nanfei and baishitian river watersheds using swat pdp and ndp respectively fig 4 the n and p values simulated by using pdp and ndp follow a similar trend to the swat however there is a significant decrease or even a negative value during the rice season may october each year because pdp and ndp can better describe the process of flood drainage culvert drainage infiltration and irrigation fig s1 3 2 characterizing nutrient loading from lake chaohu basin 3 2 1 spatial pattern n and p loss in lake chaohu basin was severe with a large spatial variation of n and p loading intensity the annual averaged loading of n and p were 10 832 and 781 ton t among which the loss in mountain areas were 10 241 and 749 t yr and the loss in polders were 591 and 32 t yr among the five investigated watersheds nanfei n and p loading intensity 35 16 and 2 49 kg ha yr pai n and p loading intensity 18 34 and 1 25 kg ha yr and baishitian n and p loading intensity 13 34 and 2 72 kg ha yr river watersheds were the hot spots of n and p loss fig 5 their contributions of n and p loading in these five major watersheds were 67 6 and 68 5 respectively hangbu n and p loading intensity 8 22 and 7 01 kg ha yr and zhegao n and p loading intensity 4 81 and 0 91 kg ha yr river watersheds had a lower intensity of n and p loading this is related to the higher population densities in nanfei pai and baishitian river watersheds statistically the population densities in pai nanfei and baishitian river watersheds were 6 09 15 59 and 7 36 person ha much higher than that in hangbu and zhegao river watersheds 4 98 and 3 99 person ha the correlation analysis between population density and nutrient n and p loading intensity in lake chaohu basin indicated a positive correlation fig s4 covering a limited area polders can be either n and p sources or sinks for surrounding rivers polders in hangbu zhegao pai nanfei and baishitian river watersheds covered a limited area of 5 3 12 9 4 9 4 7 and 14 3 respectively fig 1 in hangbu and zhegao river watersheds where the water quality can basically meet the water quality standard of class iii tn concentration 1 mg l and tp concentration 0 2 mg l throughout the year the polders acted as the sources of n and p loss fig 5 there were 39 and 6 polders in hangbu and zhegao river watersheds respectively these polders had a higher n and p loss intensity than their upstream mountain watersheds fig 5 in hangbu river watershed the annual averaged loading of tn in the polders was 16 42 kg ha yr i e 2 12 times of than that in mountain watersheds in zhegao river watershed the annual averaged n and p loading in the polders were 7 27 and 0 65 kg ha yr which were 1 52 and 2 12 times of that in mountain watersheds compared with mountain areas polders increased n and p loading by 81 9 and 59 4 on average in pai nanfei and baishitian river watersheds where the land is mainly used for agricultural purposes the polders acted as sinks to n and p there were 5 6 and 19 polders in pai nanfei and baishitian river watersheds in these watersheds polders had a much lower n and p loading intensity than mountain watersheds fig 5 the annual averaged n and p loading intensity in mountain watersheds of pai river watershed were 7 29 and 0 51 kg ha yr which were 1 77 and 7 29 times of that in polders respectively the annual averaged n and p loading intensity in mountain watersheds of nanfei river watershed were 89 10 and 3 97 kg ha yr which were 4 94 and 12 03 times of that in polders the annual averaged loading intensity of p in mountain watersheds of baishitian river watershed was 2 76 kg ha yr which was 3 36 times of that in polders in pai river watershed one polder showed a negative loss of n and p year by year and three polders showed a negative loss of n and p from 2017 to 2018 a negative value means that the amount of n and p discharged from the polder to the outside is less than that entering the polder from its surrouding rivers fig s1 in nanfei river watershed there were two polders with negative n and p loss year by year and three polders with negative n and p loss from 2017 to 2018 in baishitian river watershed there were two polders with negative n and p loss compared with the mountain watersheds the n and p loading intensity in polders decreased by 61 7 and 64 9 respectively 3 2 2 temporal dynamics n and p loading intensity had a large seasonal variation influenced by precipitation fig 3 the response of n and p loading and precipitation showed a positive correlation in these watersheds fig 6 high levels of n and p loading occur during the wet season april to july daily precipitation throughout the year was classified into four classes according to the national rainfall class criteria table s4 the proportion of n and p loading and the daily average loading intensity in different watersheds under different rainfall levels are summarized in table 2 although the occurrence time of heavy rainfall grade is the shortest the daily average n and p loading intensity are the highest during this period which is especially obvious in the trend of tp fig 6 f j the duration of the no rain period was the highest accounting for 69 2 of the whole year at this period the contribution of tp loading in hangbu zhegao pai nanfei and baishitian river watersheds accounted for 42 1 45 6 41 9 44 8 and 47 9 through out a year respectively the daily averaged tp loading were 15 50 38 79 135 03 668 72 and 75 69 kg d however during the heavy rain period the tp loading in hangbu zhegao pai nanfei and baishitian river watersheds accounted for 6 3 2 6 5 8 5 5 and 3 4 of the whole year respectively the daily loading were 6 83 1 56 3 72 2 94 and 4 73 times of that in no rain period respectively different from tp tn had a larger daily loading in light rain period tn loading in light rain period accounted for 39 1 48 2 42 2 39 6 and 39 0 respectively that was related to the poor water quality of rainwater at the early stage of rain rainwater carries n and p in the atmosphere and washes the surface n and p after landing on the ground 4 discussion 4 1 n and p sources of lake chaohu basin agricultural pollution and domestic sewage are the main n and p sources n and p loading were output by sequentially adding different types of sources to the model where the background value is the initial n and p production without the addition of point and non point sources based on the proportion of different pollution sources in these five watersheds fig 7 we found that agricultural and domestic sewage had a n and p contribution of 30 this result is reasonable on the one hand due to the large population the intensity of human activities is high which brings domestic pollution and agricultural pollution yang et al 2022 yin et al 2021 for example nanfei river watershed has the large city of hefei hangbu pai and baishitian river watersheds had considerable villages in the downstream polders lu et al 2019 the disposal of domestic sewage in some areas had not reached the required standards qu et al 2022 on the other hand the cultivated land is the dominant land use type of the upper reaches of nanfei and pai river watersheds and the polders of hangbu and baishitian river watersheds n and p loading caused by high agricultural intensity is also an important source of n and p soil erosion in high slope area is an important factor enhancing n and p loss the land use type in hangbu river watershed is dominated by forest land 65 3 the cultivated land area is almost half of that in nanfei river watershed however the annual averaged loading of tn was similar to nanfei river watershed and the loading of tp was the highest among the five watersheds that is probably due to the larger slope of hangbu river watershed the overall topography of lake chaohu basin is high in the west and low in the east high in the south and low in the north the hangbu river watershed is located in the southwest of lake chaohu basin and the upper reaches are mainly mountain watersheds in the wet season the upstream soil erosion is severe the sediment in the upper reaches carries surface n and p which enhance n and p loss similarly due to the topography the pai river watershed is located in the west of lake chaohu basin with a steep slope leading to an increase in n and p loading especially in rainy summer the zhegao river watershed has a similar area to the pai river watershed but it is located in the east with a small slope so the loading of n and p is smaller than the pai river watershed 4 2 what s the differences of nutrient loading between mountain and polder ecosystem in hangbu and zhegao river watersheds the n and p loading intensity in lowland watersheds is higher than that in mountain watersheds the annual averaged loading of n and p were 10 832 and 781 t yr such n and p loading intensity was relatively high compared to that in the watersheds worldwide table s5 tn and tp concentration were reatively low in mountain watersheds of hangbu and zhegao river watersheds basically meeting the water quality standard of class iii tn concentration 1 mg l and tp concentration 0 2 mg l throughout the year affected by the terrain n and p exported from agricultural pollution and domestic sewage are transported to the downstream polders along the river channel the slow flow velocity and long hydraulic retention time lead to larger n and p retention capacity in nanfei pai and baishitian river watersheds the n and p loading intensity in lowland watersheds is lower than that in mountain watersheds in may and june the intensity of n and p loading from polders was small or even negative fig 4 the large n and p retention is reflected on the following three aspects huang et al 2018 huang et al 2016 1 during summer paddy fields require large amounts of water from surrouding rivers by irrigation which is an important pathway for the polders to absorb n and p from outside 2 compared with non polder areas the water surface ratio in polders is generally higher during rainfall period the water areas can receive large amounts of nutrient from discharge 3 the ditches inside the polders are widely distributed which have certain effect on the removal of n and p from runoff exported from agricultural fields and residential areas during non heavy rainfall events the runoff from residential areas and farmland may be manually kept in the ditches for agricultural use 4 3 implications for environmental management best management practices required technical support by coupling multi scale models that would accurately describes n and p cycling the complex composition mountain lowland mixed watershed of lake chaohu basin is a big challenge to achieve accurate modelling of n and p dynamics and thus to design best management practices previous studies did not adopt suitable models according to different geographical conditions when simulating n and p export amount lin et al 2021 zeng et al 2020 watershed hydrological models usually divide rivers according to elevation which are not applicable for lowland areas and cannot reflect the hydrological process artificially regulated in this study swat pdp and ndp models were used to simulate the n and p dynamics in mountain and lowland areas of lake chaohu basin respectively pdp and ndp models were based on water balance and consider the process of water n and p migration within the lowland polders fig s1 a series of n and p transport processes were included in pdp and ndp models such as precipitation irrigation flood drainage infiltration crop water requirement evaporation in the water area fig s1 the coupled model provides a better fit for n and p export fig s3 especially for the peaks of n and p loading best management practices required an accurate identification of hot spots for n and p loss restricted by the cost of the economy and the difficulty of implementation it is impractical to control and repair the whole river basin liu et al 2016 zeng et al 2020 therefore identifying critical source areas and designing best management practices based on quantifying n and p loading can improve pollution control efficiency dong et al 2018 giri et al 2020 lin et al 2020 the results of the n and p loading intensity indicate the nanfei river watershed the downstream of hangbu river watershed the upper reaches of pai and baishitian river watersheds were the critical areas for n and p reduction the nanfei river watershed was influenced by the high density population on the one hand on the other hand cultivated land was the main land use type which increased the sources of n and p loading from agriculture in lowland watersheds of the baishitian and hangbu river watersheds agricultural non point sources and domestic sewage were the main sources of n and p loading in the upper reaches of the pai river watershed the cultivated land was concentrated and the soil was loose during the wet season due to high slope the runoff washes the surface nutrient resulting in severe soil erosion and intensive n and p loading in lake chaohu basin polder can be a geographical unit designed for n and p retention our investigation found that polders can be either n and p sources or sinks depending on the polder river interaction ponds and ditches usually make up a larger proportion of the area of the polder from this perspective the ponds and agricultural drains in polders can be developed into natural wetland systems to effectively remove n and p from the water dunne et al 2015 fisher and acreman 2004 sun et al 2021a the type of land cover within the polder determines the characteristics of the polder and plant processes directly influence nutrient uptake increasing plant cover contributes significantly to the removal of n and p from aquatic systems fisher and acreman 2004 land et al 2016 in addition it is also important to investigate the thresholds that drive the polder to become a source or sink such as farmland area and population within the polder therefore zoning control should be carried out according to the characteristics of polders to maximize the capacity of n and p retention sun et al 2021a sun et al 2021b 5 conclusions n and p loading from a mountain lowland mixed watershed lake chaohu basin were characterized by coupling three models swat pdp and ndp together our calibration revealed a satisfactory performance r2 0 6 ns 0 6 of the coupled model in describing hydrological n and p dynamics the annually averaged n and p loading in five investigated watersheds of lake chaohu basin were 10 832 and 781 t yr respectively with an n and p loading intensity of 15 72 and 1 33 kg ha yr nanfei pai and baishitian river watersheds were the hot spots of n and p loss with n and p loading contribution of 67 6 and 68 5 polder as a major geographical unit in lowland areas can be a n and p source or sink for surrounding rivers depending on the polder river interaction within nanfei pai and baishitian river watersheds n and p retention ability was higher 61 7 and 64 9 in polders than that in mountain areas the critical drivers of n and p loss were population density precipitation intensity and soil erosion this study demonstrated the high value model coupling to characterize n and p loading in a mountain lowland mixed watershed which improved our understanding of n and p cycles in lowland areas and was helpful to accurately identify n and p loss hotspots formulate the best management measures to improve the reduction rate of n and p according to the nature of polders credit authorship contribution statement jing zhang conceptualization

3013,quantifying nitrogen n and phosphorus p sources and their contributions at a watershed scale is a primary step to design best management practices this task is challenging for a mixed watershed with both mountain and lowland areas because most existing watershed models were developed for mountain areas with clear water flow directions to solve this challenge we coupled the soil and water assessment tool swat for mountain watersheds phosphorus dynamic model for lowland polder systems pdp and nitrogen dynamic model for lowland polder systems ndp for lowland artificial watersheds i e polders to characterize n and p loading for a typical mountain lowland mixed watershed lake chaohu basin in china the coupled model was calibrated based on eight year 2011 2018 meteorological hydrological and water quality datasets and had a satisfactory performance for both hydrological and water quality variables r2 0 6 ns 0 6 our eight year investigation in the five watersheds of lake chaohu basin revealed that 1 the estimated n and p loading had an annual averaged amount of 10 832 and 781 t yr and an intensity of 15 72 and 1 33 kg ha yr respectively three watersheds nanfei pai and baishitian river watersheds had relatively high loading intensity for n 35 16 18 34 and 13 34 kg ha yr and p 2 49 1 25 and 2 72 kg ha yr and contributed 67 6 n and 68 5 p to the loading of the five investigated watersheds 2 polders in lake chaohu basin can be n and p sources or sinks for their surrounding rivers depending on the polder river interaction within nanfei pai and baishitian river watersheds n and p retention ability was higher in polders than that in mountain watersheds 3 population density precipitation intensity and soil erosion were critical drivers of n and p loss and showed positive correlation with n and p loss intensity this study demonstrated the high value model coupling to characterize n and p loading in a mountain lowland mixed watershed system and thus to improve our understanding on its n and p cycling keywords polders nitrogen phosphorus swat pdp and ndp data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction a rising trend of eutrophication in global freshwater ecosystems has been one of the most challenging problems during the past decades ho et al 2019 sinha et al 2017 in a global survey of 2058 water bodies in 2012 30 5 of the total surface area and 63 1 of the total number were found to be eutrophic wang et al 2018 nearly half of china s 634 rivers lakes and reservoirs fail to meet required water standards throughout the year or in several months and even cause eutrophication due to excessive nitrogen n and phosphorus p loading especially in lakes chaohu taihu and dianchi dong et al 2018 huang et al 2019 schindler et al 2016 wang et al 2019 therefore quantifying n and p sources and their contributions at a watershed scale allows us for accurate identification of significant pollution sources as well as critical source areas and is a necessary basis for mangers to design best management practices attempts to quantify n and p at a watershed scale have been developed in many previous publications including field monitoring runoff test site experiment emission factor method etc shen et al 2012 wang et al 2020 however the above mentioned methods are costly and difficult to achieve high accuracy estimation as an alternative watershed hydrological models have been developed and applied in modeling hydrological and nutrient dynamics such as distributed hydrological model and semi distributed hydrological model arnold et al 1998 francesconi et al 2016 strömqvist et al 2012 these watershed hydrological models are able to quantify n and p transport and biogeochemical cycling for various land use types blatchford et al 2019 craig et al 2020 paul et al 2021 at various spatial scales including field apostel et al 2021 wang et al 2021 watershed piazzi et al 2021 worku meshesha et al 2020 national liu et al 2020 sun et al 2012 and global scales cordell and white 2015 despite the great advances in watershed modelling most widely used models were developed for mountain watersheds with clear water flow direction arnold and fohrer 2005 daniel et al 2011 these models cannot be directly applied to lowland watersheds due to its unclear water flow direction brauer et al 2014 sun et al 2021a zhao et al 2011 and did not reflect the real water exchange pattern of lowland polder systems polders are generally considered as closed areas enclosed by dikes to protect lowland areas from flood brauer 2014 polders widely distributed around aquatic systems greatly affect the water quality of downstream freshwater systems due to their wide distributions and intense use as agricultural land such as the rhine and danube rivers in europe the delta in netherlands and mississippi river in north america etc van der grift et al 2016 wang et al 2019 yan et al 2017 in china the area of lowland polders has reached 4 07 105 km2 most of which are located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river huang et al 2020a yan et al 2019 excess n and p exported from these lowland polders with intensive agriculture could be a major source contributing to the severe eutrophication of surrounding water bodies brauer et al 2014 dausse et al 2005 ham et al 2010 recently models applicable to lowland polders have been gradually developed including phosphorus dynamic model for lowland polder systems pdp and nitrogen dynamic model for lowland polder systems ndp which can better simulate the n and p dynamics in these landscapes huang et al 2018 huang et al 2016 to fill the above mentioned knowledge and methodological gaps we select a typical mountain lowland mixed watershed lake chaohu basin in china as the study area swat pdp and ndp were coupled to describe the n and p dynamics in mountain and lowland watersheds respectively the specific aims of our study were 1 to estimate n and p loss amount and intensity from mountain and lowland watersheds 2 to characterize the spatial temporal pattern of n and p loss and their underlying mechanisms between mountain and lowland watersheds this investigation can help water managers to pinpoint the hot spots of n and p loss for a mountain lowland mixed watershed and would thus support the design of best management practices 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and datasets lake chaohu surface area 768 km2 mean depth 2 7 m the fifth largest freshwater lake in china is located in lake chaohu basin 13 555 km2 the basin is located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river with lake chaohu in the center connected with six main inflows hangbu zhegao pai nanfei zhao and baishitian rivers and one main outflow of yuxi river connected with yangtze river fig 1 the main landform of the basin are mountain areas 12199 km2 and lowland areas 986 8 km2 with 85 7 of the lowland polders as the main geographical unit of the lowland areas the annual averaged air temperature of the basin is 16 1 c the annual averaged rainfall and evaporation are 995 7 and 1220 mm respectively wu et al 2021 zheng et al 2022 with the rapid population growth and economic development the high intensity human activities have led to a significant increase of loss of n and p in the basin water eutrophication he et al

lake for both nutrients by 3 6 times yang et al 2013 during 2012 2018 the n and p emissions in lake chaohu basin increased significantly nearly three times higher than that in 2008 lin et al 2021 despite a series of interception and reduction measures taken such as the construction of sewage treatment plants and the treatment of farming tail water the exogenous nutrient loading of lake chaohu basin remains high and cyanobacterial blooms have repeatedly occurred liu et al 2021 xu et al 2021 by 2018 the area of harmful algal blooms in lake chaohu was still as high as 75 km2 huang et al 2020b

transformation and crop harvest in agricultural land 4 export of water n and p to surrounding streams through infiltration and artificial drainage therefore it is able to identify the n and p sources

huang et al 2016 2 2 2 modeling nutrient dynamics in mountain watersheds soil and water assessment tool swat was used to simulate n and p dynamics in mountain watersheds it is a semi distributed and continuous time watershed hydrological model developed by the united states department of agriculture usda swat can simulate and output at a daily monthly and annual scale gassman et al 2007 which is suitable for large and small watersheds under different land use types soil types and management conditions soil erosion pollutant migration and transformation modules are embedded in the model which can simulate the migration and transformation process of sediment and nutrient in water bodies of each sub basin bugaets et al 2019 gessesse et al 2015 mukundan et al 2013 due to its powerful computational power complete model structure and parameter improvement performance it is widely used in watershed hydrology nutrient loss simulation and scenario management arnold et al 1998 lee et al 2010 liu et al 2013 in this study 17 parameters table s1 sensitive to discharge tn and tp were selected by sensitivity analysis the analysis was done using the latin hypercube one at a time lh oat method in the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 procedure of the swat calibration uncertainty program swat cup abbaspour 2015 the lh oat assesses the model sensitivity to a given parameter by varying the values of this parameter within a predefined uncertainty range while holding the other parameters constant abbaspour et al 2015 mtibaa and asano 2022 the first eight are hydrological parameters and the rest are water quality parameters we selected three indicators coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency ns pbias to evaluate the applicability of the coupled model

hydrological fig s2 n and p dynamics fig 3 using the coupled model swat coupled with pdp and ndp the mean value of r2 and ns for tn and tp were 0 55 and 0 50 respectively fig s5 generally it is considered that the simulation result is satisfactory when ns 0 50 good when ns is between 0 54 and 0 65 and very good when ns 0 65 moriasi et al 2015 wellen et al 2015 therefore our model performance can reach the good level fig s5 the coupled model is closer to the measured values in terms of peak than the previous method of using mountain model to simulate mountain and lowland watersheds fig s3 comparison of the simulation of n and p in the polders of hangbu zhegao pai nanfei and baishitian river watersheds using swat pdp and ndp respectively fig 4 the n and p values simulated by using pdp and ndp follow a similar trend to the swat however there is a significant decrease or even a negative value during the rice season may october each year because pdp and ndp can better describe the process of flood drainage culvert drainage infiltration and irrigation fig s1 3 2 characterizing nutrient loading from lake chaohu basin 3 2 1 spatial pattern n and p loss in lake chaohu basin was severe with a large spatial variation of n and p loading intensity the annual averaged loading of n and p were 10 832 and 781 ton t among which the loss in mountain areas were 10 241 and 749 t yr and the loss in polders were 591 and 32 t yr among the five investigated watersheds nanfei n and p loading intensity 35 16 and 2 49 kg ha yr pai n and p loading intensity 18 34 and 1 25 kg ha yr and baishitian n and p loading intensity 13 34 and 2 72 kg ha yr river watersheds were the hot spots of n and p loss fig 5 their contributions of n and p loading in these five major watersheds were 67 6 and 68 5 respectively hangbu n and p loading intensity 8 22 and 7 01 kg ha yr and zhegao n and p loading intensity 4 81 and 0 91 kg ha yr river watersheds had a lower intensity of n and p loading this is related to the higher population densities in nanfei pai and baishitian river watersheds statistically the population densities in pai nanfei and baishitian river watersheds were 6 09 15 59 and 7 36 person ha much higher than that in hangbu and zhegao river watersheds 4 98 and 3 99 person ha the correlation analysis between population density and nutrient n and p loading intensity in lake chaohu basin indicated a positive correlation fig s4 covering a limited area polders can be either n and p sources or sinks for surrounding rivers polders in hangbu zhegao pai nanfei and baishitian river watersheds covered a limited area of 5 3 12 9 4 9 4 7 and 14 3 respectively fig 1 in hangbu and zhegao river watersheds where the water quality can basically meet the water quality standard of class iii tn concentration 1 mg l and tp concentration 0 2 mg l throughout the year the polders acted as the sources of n and p loss fig 5 there were 39 and 6 polders in hangbu and zhegao river watersheds respectively these polders had a higher n and p loss intensity than their upstream mountain watersheds fig 5 in hangbu river watershed the annual averaged loading of tn in the polders was 16 42 kg ha yr i e 2 12 times of than that in mountain watersheds in zhegao river watershed the annual averaged n and p loading in the polders were 7 27 and 0 65 kg ha yr which were 1 52 and 2 12 times of that in mountain watersheds compared with mountain areas polders increased n and p loading by 81 9 and 59 4 on average in pai nanfei and baishitian river watersheds where the land is mainly used for agricultural purposes the polders acted as sinks to n and p there were 5 6 and 19 polders in pai nanfei and baishitian river watersheds in these watersheds polders had a much lower n and p loading intensity than mountain watersheds fig 5 the annual averaged n and p loading intensity in mountain watersheds of pai river watershed were 7 29 and 0 51 kg ha yr which were 1 77 and 7 29 times of that in polders respectively the annual averaged n and p loading intensity in mountain watersheds of nanfei river watershed were 89 10 and 3 97 kg ha yr which were 4 94 and 12 03 times of that in polders the annual averaged loading intensity of p in mountain watersheds of baishitian river watershed was 2 76 kg ha yr which was 3 36 times of that in polders in pai river watershed one polder showed a negative loss of n and p year by year and three polders showed a negative loss of n and p from 2017 to 2018 a negative value means that the amount of n and p discharged from the polder to the outside is less than that entering the polder from its surrouding rivers fig s1 in nanfei river watershed there were two polders with negative n and p loss year by year and three polders with negative n and p loss from 2017 to 2018 in baishitian river watershed there were two polders with negative n and p loss compared with the mountain watersheds the n and p loading intensity in polders decreased by 61 7 and 64 9 respectively 3 2 2 temporal dynamics n and p loading intensity had a large seasonal variation influenced by precipitation fig 3 the response of n and p loading and precipitation showed a positive correlation in these watersheds fig 6 high levels of n and p loading occur during the wet season april to july daily precipitation throughout the year was classified into four classes according to the national rainfall class criteria table s4 the proportion of n and p loading and the daily average loading intensity in different watersheds under different rainfall levels are summarized in table 2 although the occurrence time of heavy rainfall grade is the shortest the daily average n and p loading intensity are the highest during this period which is especially obvious in the trend of tp fig 6 f j the duration of the no rain period was the highest accounting for 69 2 of the whole year at this period the contribution of tp loading in hangbu zhegao pai nanfei and baishitian river watersheds accounted for 42 1 45 6 41 9 44 8 and 47 9 through out a year respectively the daily averaged tp loading were 15 50 38 79 135 03 668 72 and 75 69 kg d however during the heavy rain period the tp loading in hangbu zhegao pai nanfei and baishitian river watersheds accounted for 6 3 2 6 5 8 5 5 and 3 4 of the whole year respectively the daily loading were 6 83 1 56 3 72 2 94 and 4 73 times of that in no rain period respectively different from tp tn had a larger daily loading in light rain period tn loading in light rain period accounted for 39 1 48 2 42 2 39 6 and 39 0 respectively that was related to the poor water quality of rainwater at the early stage of rain rainwater carries n and p in the atmosphere and washes the surface n and p after landing on the ground 4 discussion 4 1 n and p sources of lake chaohu basin agricultural pollution and domestic sewage are the main n and p sources n and p loading were output by sequentially adding different types of sources to the model where the background value is the initial n and p production without the addition of point and non point sources based on the proportion of different pollution sources in these five watersheds fig 7 we found that agricultural and domestic sewage had a n and p contribution of 30 this result is reasonable on the one hand due to the large population the intensity of human activities is high which brings domestic pollution and agricultural pollution yang et al 2022 yin et al 2021 for example nanfei river watershed has the large city of hefei hangbu pai and baishitian river watersheds had considerable villages in the downstream polders lu et al 2019 the disposal of domestic sewage in some areas had not reached the required standards qu et al 2022 on the other hand the cultivated land is the dominant land use type of the upper reaches of nanfei and pai river watersheds and the polders of hangbu and baishitian river watersheds n and p loading caused by high agricultural intensity is also an important source of n and p soil erosion in high slope area is an important factor enhancing n and p loss the land use type in hangbu river watershed is dominated by forest land 65 3 the cultivated land area is almost half of that in nanfei river watershed however the annual averaged loading of tn was similar to nanfei river watershed and the loading of tp was the highest among the five watersheds that is probably due to the larger slope of hangbu river watershed the overall topography of lake chaohu basin is high in the west and low in the east high in the south and low in the north the hangbu river watershed is located in the southwest of lake chaohu basin and the upper reaches are mainly mountain watersheds in the wet season the upstream soil erosion is severe the sediment in the upper reaches carries surface n and p which enhance n and p loss similarly due to the topography the pai river watershed is located in the west of lake chaohu basin with a steep slope leading to an increase in n and p loading especially in rainy summer the zhegao river watershed has a similar area to the pai river watershed but it is located in the east with a small slope so the loading of n and p is smaller than the pai river watershed 4 2 what s the differences of nutrient loading between mountain and polder ecosystem in hangbu and zhegao river watersheds the n and p loading intensity in lowland watersheds is higher than that in mountain watersheds the annual averaged loading of n and p were 10 832 and 781 t yr such n and p loading intensity was relatively high compared to that in the watersheds worldwide table s5 tn and tp concentration were reatively low in mountain watersheds of hangbu and zhegao river watersheds basically meeting the water quality standard of class iii tn concentration 1 mg l and tp concentration 0 2 mg l throughout the year affected by the terrain n and p exported from agricultural pollution and domestic sewage are transported to the downstream polders along the river channel the slow flow velocity and long hydraulic retention time lead to larger n and p retention capacity in nanfei pai and baishitian river watersheds the n and p loading intensity in lowland watersheds is lower than that in mountain watersheds in may and june the intensity of n and p loading from polders was small or even negative fig 4 the large n and p retention is reflected on the following three aspects huang et al 2018 huang et al 2016 1 during summer paddy fields require large amounts of water from surrouding rivers by irrigation which is an important pathway for the polders to absorb n and p from outside 2 compared with non polder areas the water surface ratio in polders is generally higher during rainfall period the water areas can receive large amounts of nutrient from discharge 3 the ditches inside the polders are widely distributed which have certain effect on the removal of n and p from runoff exported from agricultural fields and residential areas during non heavy rainfall events the runoff from residential areas and farmland may be manually kept in the ditches for agricultural use 4 3 implications for environmental management best management practices required technical support by coupling multi scale models that would accurately describes n and p cycling the complex composition mountain lowland mixed watershed of lake chaohu basin is a big challenge to achieve accurate modelling of n and p dynamics and thus to design best management practices previous studies did not adopt suitable models according to different geographical conditions when simulating n and p export amount lin et al 2021 zeng et al 2020 watershed hydrological models usually divide rivers according to elevation which are not applicable for lowland areas and cannot reflect the hydrological process artificially regulated in this study swat pdp and ndp models were used to simulate the n and p dynamics in mountain and lowland areas of lake chaohu basin respectively pdp and ndp models were based on water balance and consider the process of water n and p migration within the lowland polders fig s1 a series of n and p transport processes were included in pdp and ndp models such as precipitation irrigation flood drainage infiltration crop water requirement evaporation in the water area fig s1 the coupled model provides a better fit for n and p export fig s3 especially for the peaks of n and p loading best management practices required an accurate identification of hot spots for n and p loss restricted by the cost of the economy and the difficulty of implementation it is impractical to control and repair the whole river basin liu et al 2016 zeng et al 2020 therefore identifying critical source areas and designing best management practices based on quantifying n and p loading can improve pollution control efficiency dong et al 2018 giri et al 2020 lin et al 2020 the results of the n and p loading intensity indicate the nanfei river watershed the downstream of hangbu river watershed the upper reaches of pai and baishitian river watersheds were the critical areas for n and p reduction the nanfei river watershed was influenced by the high density population on the one hand on the other hand cultivated land was the main land use type which increased the sources of n and p loading from agriculture in lowland watersheds of the baishitian and hangbu river watersheds agricultural non point sources and domestic sewage were the main sources of n and p loading in the upper reaches of the pai river watershed the cultivated land was concentrated and the soil was loose during the wet season due to high slope the runoff washes the surface nutrient resulting in severe soil erosion and intensive n and p loading in lake chaohu basin polder can be a geographical unit designed for n and p retention our investigation found that polders can be either n and p sources or sinks depending on the polder river interaction ponds and ditches usually make up a larger proportion of the area of the polder from this perspective the ponds and agricultural drains in polders can be developed into natural wetland systems to effectively remove n and p from the water dunne et al 2015 fisher and acreman 2004 sun et al 2021a the type of land cover within the polder determines the characteristics of the polder and plant processes directly influence nutrient uptake increasing plant cover contributes significantly to the removal of n and p from aquatic systems fisher and acreman 2004 land et al 2016 in addition it is also important to investigate the thresholds that drive the polder to become a source or sink such as farmland area and population within the polder therefore zoning control should be carried out according to the characteristics of polders to maximize the capacity of n and p retention sun et al 2021a sun et al 2021b 5 conclusions n and p loading from a mountain lowland mixed watershed lake chaohu basin were characterized by coupling three models swat pdp and ndp together our calibration revealed a satisfactory performance r2 0 6 ns 0 6 of the coupled model in describing hydrological n and p dynamics the annually averaged n and p loading in five investigated watersheds of lake chaohu basin were 10 832 and 781 t yr respectively with an n and p loading intensity of 15 72 and 1 33 kg ha yr nanfei pai and baishitian river watersheds were the hot spots of n and p loss with n and p loading contribution of 67 6 and 68 5 polder as a major geographical unit in lowland areas can be a n and p source or sink for surrounding rivers depending on the polder river interaction within nanfei pai and baishitian river watersheds n and p retention ability was higher 61 7 and 64 9 in polders than that in mountain areas the critical drivers of n and p loss were population density precipitation intensity and soil erosion this study demonstrated the high value model coupling to characterize n and p loading in a mountain lowland mixed watershed which improved our understanding of n and p cycles in lowland areas and was helpful to accurately identify n and p loss hotspots formulate the best management measures to improve the reduction rate of n and p according to the nature of polders credit authorship contribution statement jing zhang conceptualization

3014,climate change and human activity such as reservoir operation have altered the hydrological system in the transboundary mekong river basin mrb over decades urging a need to assess the historical changes and future projections of freshwater availability here we examined changes of terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa from the gravity recovery and climate experiment satellites in the lower mrb during 2003 2020 and subsequently partitioned and attributed them into climate driven and non climate driven components using the watergap hydrological model wghm with and without consideration of human activities together with a statistical method driven by climatic forcing only further integrated future twsa was projected under different climate change scenarios during 2030 2099 forced with four downscaled and bias corrected simulations of four global climate models results show a decreasing twsa trend of 3 7 1 8 mm a during 2003 2020 the wghm based climate driven twsa which is highly correlated with the statistical modeling results and non climate driven part suggests a trend of 0 3 1 4 and 0 01 0 07 mm a during 2003 2016 respectively the climate driven twsa is well explained by the changes in decreasing precipitation 1 3 8 5 mm a and increasing air temperature 0 05 0 02 a spatially and temporally while the non climate driven component is closely linked to human activities such as growing sectoral human withdrawal 0 13 0 14 mm a increasing reservoir regulation 0 01 0 08 mm a and changing land cover twsa under future climate changes is projected to increase from 9 3 21 4 to 12 2 12 2 mm and from 1 6 41 2 to 12 3 30 mm in the near 2040 2059 and far future 2080 2099 under various scenarios comparing with the historical period 2003 2020 future flood potential estimated with twsa and precipitation was also projected to increase this study provides important inferences for decision makers and stakeholders to better understand the water cycle and manage water resources in a changing environment keywords terrestrial water storage climate variability and change human activities future projection lower mekong river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws which is summed from water stored in rivers lakes and reservoirs soil groundwater systems snow and glaciers and vegetation is a crucial variable in the global hydrological cycle and land atmosphere interaction processes rodell et al 2018 as an effective indicator of regional water balance or imbalance abhishek et al 2021 natural hazards such as floods and droughts abhishek and kinouchi 2022 terrestrial carbon uptake humphrey et al 2018 ice sheets and glaciers mass fluctuations van den broeke et al 2009 and sea level rise eicker et al 2016 tws changes play a determining role in modulating water flux interactions within various earth system components pokhrel et al 2021 nevertheless global variations in tws are still inadequately known due to the paucity of field observation gauges worldwide and considerable uncertainties in hydrological and land surface models scanlon et al 2018 particularly in the international river basins with restricted data sharing policies and intensive water conflicts among different countries as one of the most important international rivers of asia the mekong river flowing across six countries including china myanmar lao thailand vietnam and cambodia feeds approximately 70 million inhabitants and sustains crops livestock and the ecosystem of the basin yun et al 2021a under the background of emerging freshwater availability monitoring tws changes in the mekong river basin mrb is of great importance to address the comprehensive cooperation in regional water resources management and development jing et al 2020 liu et al 2022 jointly developed by the national aeronautics and space administration and the german aerospace center the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission that launched in march 2002 can provide monthly terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa worldwide with unprecedented accuracy by measuring distance changes between the twin satellites tapley et al 2019 after its decommissioning in june 2017 the grace follow on also referred to as grace hereafter satellites commissioned in may 2018 have continued to assess global twsa changes up to the present the grace satellites have enabled the investigation of spatiotemporal variability of twsa on multiple temporal from seasonal to decadal and spatial from regional to global scales humphrey et al 2016 sun et al 2020 guo et al 2021 a few studies have attempted to reveal twsa changes in the mrb pham duc et al 2019 jing et al 2020 bibi et al 2021 specifically jing et al 2020 used five different grace solutions and found a downward trend with trends ranging from 0 0 to 14 5 mm a between 2002 and 2016 in the upper reach p 0 05 while there were no statistically significant trends in the lower basin moreover bibi et al 2021 examined the twsa changes in the upstream region and also discovered significant p 0 05 negative trends at rates ranging from 3 3 to 5 9 mm a during 2002 2016 based on multiple grace solutions climate change has significantly altered the hydrological system of the mrb over decades which is mainly reflected by the variations in precipitation and temperature nie et al 2018 gao et al 2019 in addition the growing food demands rapid population expansion and dramatic urban development have resulted in massive changes in land use land cover lucc alteration of the hydrological cycle and development of hydropower systems throughout the basin johnston and kummu 2012 liu et al 2021 therefore both climate and non climate factors should have played a role in the historical twsa changes in the mrb therefore the quantification of the respective contributions of the two factors to the total change in the past twsa is crucial but remains unexamined most of the previous studies merely focused on the historical changes of twsa in the mrb due to the relatively short period 21 years of the grace missions while the future projections under the combined effects of both climatic and non climatic factors remain rarely examined there are generally two categories of methods to obtain future twsa the first group relies on physically based models to describe changes in climate land surface and hydrology as an example pokhrel et al 2021 forced a large ensemble of global hydrological models ghms land surface models lsms and dynamic global vegetation models dgvms using four different global climate models gcms from coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 and acquired global twsa projections under distinctive emission scenarios for drought possibility evaluation until the end of the 21st century this method has been used to assess the great potential of the combination of gcms and ghms lsms dgvms to simulate the future twsa oki and kanae 2006 schewe et al 2014 xiong et al 2022 directly used the original grace observations to perform the bias correction for the twsa simulations of multiple gcms from the cmip6 archive and subsequently applied this approach to assess the future twsa and associated flood potential changes in the yangtze river basin however the systematic analysis of projected twsa in the mrb is still unexplored using either kind of the above introduced methods therefore the main objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of climate driven and non climate driven twsa contributions as well as their influential factors over the lower mrb during the historical period 2003 2020 2 to project the future changes of twsa that are jointly affected by both climate and non climate factors under multiple scenarios during the future period 2030 2099 2 data and methods 2 1 study area we selected the lower mrb as the study region because the shape of upstream mrb is very narrow and elongated thus it is very likely that grace signals possess leakage errors i e contamination gain loss in the target signal from the surrounding region e g glacier melting on the qinghai tibet plateau chao et al 2020 located within the domain of 9 48 22 42 n and 99 51 108 42 e the lower mrb has a total area of 606 000 km2 occupying 77 of the whole of mrb with a total area of 795 000 km2 see fig 1 the lower mrb is shared by five countries in southeast asia including laos thailand vietnam cambodia and myanmar dominated by the tropical rainforest climate and tropical monsoon climate more than 80 of precipitation in the basin occurs in the wet season from june to november while only 20 is received during the dry season from december to may yun et al 2021b the cropland is the main land use type and more than 10 million hectares of cultivated land are employed for rice production jing et al 2020 the lower mrb has experienced significant climate changes since the 1980s which were mainly reflected by the warming at a rate higher than the global average warming rate and increasing annual precipitation kingston et al 2011 fan and he 2015 in addition future projections of air temperature are expected to steadily increase up to the end of the 21st century with the annual precipitation continuing to grow under multiple scenarios västilä et al 2010 kingston et al 2011 the lower mrb feeding more than 60 million people status 2010 you et al 2014 is heavily irrigated for agriculture purposes and the population is projected to grow by 60 by 2050 compared to its 2005 values pech and sunada 2008 therefore the growing demand for water and energy resources due to population and urban expansion has led to over 79 large reservoirs in operation with a total storage capacity of 57 5 km3 up to the year 2021 fig 1 the detailed information on these operational reservoirs is listed in table s1 the statistics of the operational reservoirs are provided by a recent study yun et al 2021a therefore the increasingly evident climate and non climate changes highlight the urgent need to understand the twsa changes in both the past and future 2 2 grace twsa we used the grace mass concentration block mascon data during 2003 2020 to assess the twsa changes in the lower mrb which was produced by the center for space research at the university of texas at austin csr watkins et al 2015 save et al 2016 table s2 the mascon solutions are derived by parameterizing the gravity field with regional mass concentration functions unlike the conventionally used spherical harmonics grace products the mascon solutions are free from leakage signals and several categories of post processing errors such as de correlated and de stripping noises scanlon et al 2016 wiese et al 2016 covering the period 2003 2020 the monthly mascon solutions have been resampled to a common 0 5 spatial resolution the mascon data represents the twsa relative to the average gravity field between 2004 and 2009 a total of 22 missing months due to instrumental issues and an 11 month data gap between two generations of grace satellites from july 2017 to may 2018 are filled with a recently published grace reconstructions dataset li et al 2021 which is also trained with the csr mascon solution based on multiple climatic hydrological variables and a combination of machine learning and statistical decomposition techniques since no calibration processes are needed across the missions and the precision and spatiotemporal sampling are equivalent there are no existing intermission biases between grace and grace follow on satellites landerer et al 2020 to investigate the influences of distinctive constraints and the scale of the grid cells from different processing institutions the mascon solution from the nasa jet propulsion laboratory jpl agency is also used for comparison similarly the missing months and the data gap are filled with a recent grace reconstructions dataset trained with the jpl mascon solution mo et al 2021 which is derived using the bayesian deep learning method combined with era5 land reanalysis the comparisons between the continuous csr and jpl mascon solutions on the basin and grid scales suggest high consistency with the correlation coefficient of 0 99 fig s1 highlighting the negligible influences of divergent grace solutions 2 3 decomposition of twsa the watergap v 2 2d hydrological model wghm eicker et al 2014 schmied et al 2021 was applied to decompose the twsa into climate and non climate driven parts from the period 2003 2016 the wghm is a state of the art hydrological model that simulates the full components of twsa including water stored in river snow lakes and reservoirs soil aquifers and vegetation over non glacierized regions forced by the watch forcing data methodology applied to era interim data wfdei dataset it provides direct human intervention with hydrological cycle such as irrigation reservoir regulation and groundwater extraction weedon et al 2014 schmied et al 2021 the wghm model has been widely employed in regional and global hydrology research an et al 2021 hosseini moghari et al 2020 we also used simulations of the surface water groundwater and soil moisture storage from the wghm to investigate the variations of different components of twsa the climate driven twsa is estimated using the nosoc mode of the wghm which did not account for direct human activities such as irrigation and reservoir management in addition a recently proposed statistical method liu et al 2021 which has been validated over major global river basins was also applied to identify the climate driven twsa for comparison and independent check this method can reconstruct both seasonal and non seasonal signals in climate driven twsa using precipitation and air temperature data which were also derived from the wfdei meteorological dataset in our study moreover several widely used climate forcing products such as era5 cru ts v 4 05 and gldas v2 1 were retrieved to detect the uncertainty sourced from different climate inputs table s2 then we subtract the naturalized wghm simulations i e nosoc mode from the standard wghm outputs i e histoc mode to estimate the non climate driven twsa which has considered both climate and human factors huang et al 2015 xie et al 2019 similarly we also estimated the non climate driven twsa by removing the statistically reconstructed climate driven twsa from the grace twsa for comparison zhong et al 2019 the training testing configurations and the optimized parameters of the statistical method have been summarized in table s3 2 4 projected twsa the wghm was applied to assess the future twsa changes under the joint effects of climate and non climate factors during the period 2030 2099 with a uniform spatial resolution of 0 5 the meteorological forcing data including precipitation air temperature solar radiation wind speed specific humidity and surface pressure generated from four gcms i e gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 of the cmip5 archive have undergone statistical downscaling and bias correction using the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip methods hempel et al 2013 lange 2018 2019 three future scenarios are considered for each gcm including a low rcp2 6 a medium high rcp6 0 and a high rcp8 5 greenhouse gas concentration scenario and are subsequently divided into near 2040 2059 and far 2080 2099 future periods for comparison the projected precipitation and air temperature were also derived to analyze the future changes in climatic factors furthermore we also calculated a flood potential index fpi using the projected twsa and precipitation to evaluate the future changes in flood probability over the lower mrb which were compared with the historical period during 2003 2020 fpi was initially introduced by reager and famiglietti 2009 and has been widely used in the grace community to represent the large scale flood possibility zhu and yuan 2021 higher fpi 1 can generally be translated into a greater flood potential and vice versa all the simulations are conducted under the framework of phase 2b of the isi mip project warszawski et al 2014 the applicability of the future projections of twsa has been fully evaluated in a recent global study pokhrel et al 2021 2 5 auxiliary data multi source data from the remote sensing reanalysis and models were collected to analyze the climatic and non climatic variables influencing the twsa specifically precipitation and air temperature from the wfdei meteorological dataset were used to study the climate variability during 2003 2016 which is consistent with the wghm model weedon et al 2014 however the fpi between 2003 and 2020 was derived based on grace twsa and era5 precipitation data due to the unavailability of the wfdei product after 2016 the comparisons among different precipitation datasets show satisfactory agreement in the lower mrb suggesting an insignificant uncertainty in the choices of precipitation datasets fig s2 era5 reanalysis dataset is the 5th generation atmospheric reanalysis of the global atmosphere produced by the copernicus climate change service at the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf further the era5 land product provides a consistent view of land variables from 1950 present at an enhanced resolution compared to era5 over global land based on the 4d var assimilation scheme integrated forecast system model 41r2 and htessel land surface model driven by meteorological forcing from the era interim atmospheric reanalysis and precipitation adjustments based on the global precipitation climatology project gpcp data hersbach et al 2020 further the monthly remote sensing normalized difference vegetation index ndvi from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 13c2 product was obtained to assess the influence of land cover on twsa which was also validated based on the yearly satellite based land cover map retrieved from the esa cci climate change initiative project esa 2017 two global irrigation datasets from the food and agriculture organization fao and nagaraj et al 2021 were utilized to assess the changes in the irritation area the basic information on dams and reservoirs in the lower mrb from yun et al 2021a was collected to investigate the changes in man made hydrologic constructions similarly simulated reservoir storage from the wghm was also collected for attribution analysis the monthly actual total consumptive water use as the sum of abstracted water from surface water and groundwater in the wghm model schmied et al 2021 was also used for the interpretation of human water use we also obtained a global gridded reconstruction of water withdrawal for sectoral water use including irrigation domestic electricity generation livestock mining and manufacturing during 2003 2010 from huang et al 2018 for comparison the irrigation withdrawals are derived from four optimized ghms including the wghm pcr globwb lpjml and h08 models of which the wghm was selected for consistency in this study finally we obtained the satellite based water level and surface area time series during 2003 2020 in the largest freshwater lake in south east asia the tonle sap lake to validate our examinations of twsa variations given its significant role in regulating the flows in the mrb campbell et al 2009 wang et al 2020 chen et al 2021 therefore the monthly water volume changes were estimated according to taube 2000 which has been widely used in lake volume change zhang et al 2017 2019 2021 2 6 uncertainty estimation various methods were applied to quantify the uncertainties inevitably embedded in and propagated from the multisource data used specifically the uncertainty in the csr mascon solution was estimated as the residuals after removing the long term trends and seasonal annual and semi annual signals from the raw series scanlon et al 2016 moreover the uncertainty in the wghm simulations under nosoc and histsoc modes was calculated as the 10 range i e 90 to 110 of modeling results schmied et al 2021 the uncertainty in the statistically reconstructed climate driven twsa was taken as one standard deviation of 20 000 equally acceptable samples from mcmc simulation when training the model liu et al 2021 consequently the non climate driven twsa from both the wghm and the statistical method were estimated as the square root of the sum of squares of uncertainty in wghm histsoc mode and grace data respectively moreover the uncertainty of long term trends in twsa can be calculated as one standard deviation of the linear regression with a significance level of 0 95 t test which was estimated using the linear regression method for the yearly average time series given the substantial uncertainties in future twsa projections sourced from four meteorological forcings i e gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 the generalized three cornered hat gtch method was employed to estimate their respective uncertainty during 2030 2099 the gtch method estimates the relative covariance of different sets of twsa projections among at least three datasets without the need for any prior knowledge information premoli and tavella 1993 it has been broadly used in estimating twsa uncertainty from both grace and models globally due to its high effectiveness and robustness long et al 2014 2017 moreover we fused different categories of twsa projections using the weighted averaging method in which the corresponding weights of various twsa datasets were determined based on the relative variance estimated by the gtch method under the assumption of no correlations with each other yan et al 2021 we also compared the fused projections and the ensemble mean to constrain the uncertainty 3 results 3 1 historical twsa variations fig 2 illustrates the monthly time series of twsa climate driven and non climate driven during the period 2003 2020 and their annual cycles are presented in fig s3 grace data generally ranges from 300 to 300 mm except for the extremely high value in the wet season of 2011 the overall negligible uncertainty of grace twsa is found grey shaded regions with relatively higher values in the 11 month data gap between july 2017 and may 2018 larger uncertainties in the peaks and troughs compared with other occasions are apparent as a result of both climate and non climate factors the grace twsa has a downward rate of 3 7 1 8 mm a similar to the trend 3 3 2 2 mm a during the period 2003 2016 moreover consistent changes in wghm twsa with grace results are detected with relatively low amplitude and high uncertainty therefore an underestimated trend of 0 3 1 4 mm a is discovered during 2003 2016 compared to the grace data which are mainly caused by the decrease in groundwater 0 2 0 4 mm a and surface water storage 0 2 0 6 mm a fig s4 the identified climate driven twsa from the wghm and statistical model in the lower mrb are shown in fig 2 the naturalized wghm modeled twsa illustrates close agreement with the statistically reconstructed climate driven twsa based on different climate forcings with the respective correlation coefficient of 0 89 wfdei 0 81 era5 0 91 cru ts and 0 89 gldas highlighting the robustness of wghm under the natural mode climte driven twsa and grace twsa share similar seasonal features that peak in september october while reacheing the lowest in april may which may be connected to the tropical monsoonal climate that is dominated by the southwest monsoon fig s3 however there are considerable uncertainties in the reconstructed climate driven twsa especially for the wfdei and era5 forcings the comparatively better performance of the cru ts and gldas forcing might be caused by the integration of the in situ observations and remote sensing products it indicates that different climate forcings might produce various uncertainties in the climatic reconstructions and the lack of consideration of inflow from the lancang river basin will inevitably introduce some uncertainty consequently divergent trends of climate driven twsa from the wghm 0 3 1 4 mm a and statistical model are seen during 2003 2016 which widely range from 3 3 6 cru ts and 6 7 5 9 era5 mm a in terms of non climate driven changes in twsa substantial differences are determined from the statistical model due to the propagated uncertainties in grace and climate driven twsa and multiple datasets of meteorological forcing causing the trends ranging from 10 4 6 era5 and 0 3 2 4 cru ts mm a during 2003 2016 similarly wghm based non climate driven twsa presents a pattern that non climate driven twsa is dominated by the spread of data uncertainty with relatively low amplitude and trend between 2003 and 2016 0 01 0 07 mm a fig s5 therefore despite the large uncertainty sourced from the different models and forcings we conclude that the trends in twsa from 2003 to 2016 2020 are primarily governed by the climate driven components with a limited contribution from the non climate driven changes the limited influence of the non climate driven twsa can be explained by the fact that despite a large number of dam reservoir constructions table s1 their total capacities 95 mm of equivalent water depth in 2020 are one order of magnitude less than the twsa amplitude variations 800 mm also the groundwater pumping in the lower mrb might have been small owing to the abundant precipitation and surface water resources the latter of which contributes 40 45 of twsa changes pham duc et al 2019 fig 3 demonstrates the spatial distribution of trends in twsa climate driven twsa and non climate driven twsa during 2003 2016 2020 for the period 2003 2020 the majority of the lower mrb illustrates overall twsa depletion trends p 0 05 except for the northern region where twsa increases from 2 to 8 mm a with the uncertainties of 3 mm a in addition grace observations show significant p 0 05 decreasing trends with rates ranging from 16 0 to 8 0 mm a over the western and southern parts of the basin and the uncertainties generally fluctuate between 2 0 and 4 0 mm a furthermore satellite based water levels from multi source altimetry sensors and water surface area from different optical imageries of the largest inland water body i e tonle sap lake in cambodia are demonstrated in fig s6 it can be seen that water surface area water level and derived water volume changes show downward trends during the period 2003 2020 agreeing well with grace observations a similar distribution of grace data is demonstrated for the period 2003 2016 while with relatively higher trends and uncertainties over the basin wghm modeled twsa generally shares a similar pattern with grace data between 2003 and 2016 with increasing trends in the north while decreasing trends mainly in the central and south basin however the southwestern eastern and southeastern regions illustrate positive trends with trends below 8 mm a with uncertainties higher than 3 mm a such differences might arise from the inherent uncertainty of the wghm and the bias of the climate inputs i e wfdei dataset moreover the climate driven twsa shares similar patterns in both trends and uncertainties with twsa from 2003 to 2016 implying the governing role of the climatic factors in twsa variations spatially the paradigm can be further validated according to the comparable distributions between wghm outputs and wfdei derived climatic reconstructions in contrast to that slightly increasing trends of twsa are captured by the non climate driven twsa in the west and south of the central basin whose trends are generally below 4 0 mm a and the uncertainties are lower than 1 mm a forced with the wfdei climate forcing same as the wghm the non climate driven twsa based on the statistical method illustrates generally similar distribution but with higher amplitudes and uncertainties due to the propagated uncertainty in the identification and separation of the climate driven parts we note considerable differences between the climatic and non climatic twsa reconstructions exist due to different meteorological forcings figs s7 and s8 however demonstrative insights can be provided by combining with the wghm and statistical approach forced by the same dataset i e wdfei apart from long term trends seasonal characteristics of trends in twsa are additionally analyzed owing to the divergent climate changes in wet and dry seasons together with the seasonality of non climate factors e g reservoir operation and irrigation fig 4 shows the annual cycles of trends in twsa climate driven twsa and non climate driven twsa it indicates grace data has a unimodal distribution that the negative trends from 8 5 3 6 to 7 9 3 2 mm a mainly occur in august and september and relatively small trends ranging from 5 5 3 july to 1 4 1 7 february mm a happen in other months during 2003 2020 there are no apparent differences detected in grace twsa during 2003 2016 than the period 2003 2020 compared to the grace results the wghm model demonstrates underestimated trends with rates ranging from 3 5 2 9 june to 0 5 1 3 april mm a unlike the long term trends the seasonal pattern of wghm twsa is dominated by soil moisture with apparent drying in the wet season mainly from may to june and august to september and the wetting trend in the dry season fig s4 the seasonal distributions of trends in climate driven twsa are also examined and consistent patterns between the wghm and the statistical models are observed especially with that forced with the wfdei dataset the climate driven twsa generally presents negative trends in the wet season while positive trends in the dry season which range from 3 5 2 9 june to 3 5 2 1 december mm a with considerable uncertainties overall deviations among different subsets of climatic reconstructions might be triggered by their inherent differences as a consequence the non climate driven component of twsa from the wghm is slightly positive from august to december whereas negative trends are found in other months particularly from january to may in the dry season the differences between the statistically estimated non climate driven twsa and the wghm simulations can be sourced from the propagated uncertainty of identification simulation and or isolation of the climatic and non climatic components 3 2 influential factors of twsa 3 2 1 climatic factors to assess the influential factors of climate driven twsa multiple climate variables have been analyzed in the lower mrb fig 5 shows the monthly evolution of precipitation and air temperature as well as their trends during 2003 2016 precipitation generally varies between 1 and 426 mm and shows obvious seasonality due to the monsoon climate a slight downward trend at a rate of 1 3 8 5 mm a is detected moreover the air temperature is generally greater than 20 4 and presents an increasing trend of 0 05 0 02 a under a warming climate consequently the reducing precipitation and increasing air temperature can reasonably explain the depletion of climate driven twsa 0 3 1 4 mm a due to the decreasing water availability under an intensified earth s water cycle the annual cycles of trends in different climatic variables are also depicted in fig 5 it can be clearly seen that precipitation has a bimodal distribution and there are increasing trends from september to january and june with trends below 3 6 1 6 mm a november while the negative trends with rates from 4 8 2 8 may to 0 2 1 8 april mm a appear in the remaining months in contrast the air temperature shows a consistent upward trend with trends higher than 0 03 0 01 a july in most of the months except for january 0 02 0 06 a and february 0 04 0 09 a the seasonal distribution of precipitation and air temperature can jointly explain the increase in the climate driven twsa from november to january and its decrease in april may july and august some disparities in june and march can be attributed to the uncertainty in the trend estimates and the precipitation air temperature datasets the spatial distributions of long term trends in precipitation and air temperature are presented in fig 6 the northern southeastern southwestern and western regions of the basins experience increasing precipitation with trends roughly between 5 0 and 30 0 mm a and the uncertainties are correspondingly as high as 30 0 mm a located in the southwestern area the central and southern parts witness significant downward trends in precipitation and the rates change between 30 0 to 15 0 mm a with the uncertainty between 10 0 and 15 0 mm a comprehensive rising temperature is detected over the lower mrb during 2003 2016 in which the significant trends p 0 05 are located in the northwestern and southeastern regions the rates range from 0 01 to 0 11 a and the uncertainties are favorably low 0 036 a especially in the northwestern region generally the spatial distributions of trends in precipitation and air temperature agree well with those in the climate driven twsa including the twsa gains in the north centre and south regions due to precipitation increase and the losses in the northwestern basin from the temperature growth 3 2 2 non climatic factors multiple variables including human water use reservoir regulation and land cover changes were subject to attribution analysis of non climate driven twsa in the lower mrb we examined the monthly variations in total water abstraction over the lower mrb during 2003 2016 fig 7 which generally fluctuates between 0 and 6 mm with high inter and intra annual variability an increasing trend of 0 13 0 14 mm a is identified between 2003 and 2016 and the value is 0 2 0 3 mm a for the period 2003 2010 however the sectoral water withdrawals show a different positive trend of 0 2 0 03 mm a which might be due to the uncertainty in the wghm model differences between total water abstraction indicate that the summed water withdrawals might arise from the underestimated sectoral water use such as reservoir impoundment in the wet season furthermore the individual sectoral water withdrawal presents the dominating role of irrigation to other categories of human activities such as manufacturing mining and electricity fig s9 and it also has the highest increasing trend of 0 08 0 03 mm a during 2003 2010 in addition seasonal distribution in water abstraction shows slight positive trends from february to march from may to august and december which might cause the decrease in non climate driven twsa however such effects might be constrained due to relatively small amplitudes 0 08 0 05 mm a the spatial distribution of trends in total water abstraction during 2003 2016 suggests the regions with significant increasing values are mainly located in the southeast of the basin fig 8 which might be caused by the rapid urbanization and expansion of the mekong delta yun et al 2021a both increasing and decreasing trends are detected in the west central basin that is highly irrigated fig s10 due to the changes in irrigations area regionally with trends ranging from 2 4 1 6 to 1 6 1 5 mm a we also examined the annual irrigation map over the lower mrb from 2001 to 2015 indicating both an increase and decrease in irrigation area over the centre basin agreeing with the spatial changes in water extraction fig 9 specifically the percentage of grid cells with high irrigation shows a downward trend of 0 05 0 01 a while an upward trend of 0 03 0 16 a is found for the area with low to medium irrigation between 2001 and 2015 the annual irrigation maps are depicted to show the spatiotemporal variations of irrigation area over the lower mrb fig s11 the reservoir storage generally changes between 3 9 0 4 and 16 6 1 7 mm and shows a non significant increasing trend 0 01 0 08 mm a during the period 2003 2016 fig 7 favouring the increase of non climate driven twsa annual cycles of trends do not present a significant trend from january to september except for may 0 02 0 06 mm a but steadily grow from october 0 02 0 22 mm a to december 0 08 0 2 mm a the changing pattern of reservoir storage can partly explain the seasonal distribution of trends in non climate driven twsa as well as its positive trend on the yearly scale even though the magnitude is relatively low 0 01 0 07 mm a there are no significant changes in reservoir storage that can be observed for the whole of lower mrb with only a few reservoirs in the lower reach experiencing surface water depletion the uncertainty of trends is relatively high in the west compared to that in the south of the basin such distribution and amplitude demonstrate similar patterns of the non climate driven twsa suggest the potential impacts of reservoir constructions on the regional non climatic twsa variations human activities such as dam operation and agricultural expansion can generally be considered as the main factors deriving the land use land cover changes in the lower mrb cho and qi 2021 no apparent trend in ndvi is determined 0 0005 0 0006 a while the decreasing trends between april 0 001 0 0013 a and june 0 0001 0 0009 a combined with the increasing trends from july 0 0006 0 0005 a to march 0 0 0008 a are identified such distribution could reflect the effects of various human activities on the regional land cover such as irrigation and urbanization spatially ndvi illustrates significant downward trends in the south of lower mrb which may be due to the rapid urbanization process over the mekong delta yun et al 2021a differently some areas in the central basin have growing ndvi consistent with the changes in the irrigation area these patterns are also validated by the annual map of land cover during 2003 2020 fig s12 3 3 future projections of twsa given the considerable differences among climatic projections from different gcms i e gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc5 we used the gtch method to evaluate the individual uncertainty and fuse the wghm based twsa projections under multiple scenarios i e rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 table s4 summarizes the basin scale results indicating the gfdl esm2m model has the highest uncertainty under different scenarios while the ipsl cm5a lr output shows the lowest except for the rcp2 6 scenario miroc5 consequently the relatively high weights were assigned to the ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 models while low weight was given to the gfdl esm2m data spatially similar distributions of uncertainties are observed on the grid scale under multiple scenarios in which there are higher values along with the mekong river stretch figs s13 and s14 the ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 models also show comparatively low uncertainties than the gfdl esm2m and hadgem2 es data which generally translate to higher weights for the fused twsa projections forced with different gcms hence we developed the fused wghm projected twsa forced with four gcms at both grid and basin scales to alleviate the forcing uncertainty similarly the precipitation and air temperature are also fused to analyze the future climatic variabilities over the lower mrb fig 10 exhibits the projected changes in twsa driven by projected climate changes in the lower mrb during the period 2030 2099 projected twsa changes under rcp8 5 scenario are smaller than the rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 results with relatively high uncertainties sourced from various climate forcings especially during the extreme wet and dry periods no obvious differences between the rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 scenarios are observed except for the peaks and troughs generally an increasing trend of 0 16 0 11 mm a during 2030 2099 is calculated under the rcp2 6 scenario and the value changes to 0 1 0 12 mm a for the rcp6 0 scenario however a negative trend of 0 06 0 11 mm a is estimated for the rcp8 5 scenario in addition we identified the annual cycle of projected twsa in the near 2040 2059 and far 2080 2099 future periods fig 10 similar distributions are discovered under multiple scenarios and periods suggesting twsa increases from april to september and decreases from october to march in the near future the projected twsa under rcp8 5 scenario shows high values compared with the rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 scenarios particularly in the wet season however the relatively lower twsa is projected for the rcp8 5 scenario in the far future moreover the uncertainties in projected twsa are larger in the extremely dry wet months than in other months and the differences become more obvious during the far future than in the near future higher inter model variabilities are observed among different gcms under the rcp8 5 scenarios than the other two scenarios in addition to the fused twsa the ensemble mean of various simulations forced by the four gcms is also presented fig s15 the spatial distribution of absolute changes in future twsa over the lower mrb is illustrated fig 11 under the rcp2 6 scenario twsa increases roughly ranging from 10 to 50 mm are discovered along the mekong river and in the northwestern and southwestern of the basin in the near future with the uncertainties generally greater than 10 mm fig s16 despite the subsequent enhancement of twsa over the lower reach some twsa reduction below 10 mm is found over the eastern region in the far future with overall higher uncertainties than the near future the rcp6 0 results present a similar pattern to the rcp2 6 scenario except for some twsa loss in the southwestern region in the near future which spread to the surrounding area in the far future however the twsa gains in the northwestern basin alleviate under the rcp8 5 scenario with the decreased twsa in the east basin furthermore the majority of the region in the central and northern basins experiences a twsa deficit in the far future the basin averaged examinations indicate that twsa is projected to increase by 12 2 12 2 mm and 11 6 25 8 mm under the rcp2 6 scenario in the near and far future respectively the numbers are similar to the rcp6 0 scenario that is 10 3 18 9 mm near future and 12 3 30 mm far future however the rcp8 5 scenario project a lower twsa increase of 9 3 21 4 mm and 1 6 41 2 mm for the near and far future periods respectively the projected patterns of twsa are closely associated with the projected future changes in precipitation and air temperature both temporally and spatially figs s17 and s18 for example the overall increase in precipitation in the northwest and south of the basin contributes to the twsa increase under the rcp8 5 scenario especially for the lower reach of the mekong river while the eastern basin is projected to undergo severe precipitation decrease as low as 40 mm in agreement with the twsa distributions such patterns can be intensified under the sharply increasing air temperature which reaches 4 in the upper reach of the lower mrb to examine the future variations of flood potential with changing precipitation and twsa we compared the probability density distributions of fpi during the past 2003 2020 and future i e near 2040 2059 and far 2080 2099 future periods fig 12 the overall positive offsets can be observed among historical and future periods under different climate change scenarios highlighting increased flood potential over the lower mrb in the 21st century due to increased precipitation which is more obvious for the high flood risk periods specifically the durations with relatively high flood potential fpi greater than 0 5 have increased by 3 5 2 2 in both the near and far future compared to the past period under the rcp2 6 scenario fig 12 the percentages reach 3 0 1 9 and 8 8 1 1 during the near future for the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively they are projected to be 4 3 3 8 rcp6 0 and 4 6 2 7 rcp8 5 in the far future in a nutshell the increasing flood potential induced by the changes in twsa and precipitation can be identified under multiple scenarios in both the near and far future 4 discussion a few studies have assessed the historical and future changes of twsa in the lower mrb jing et al 2020 used five different grace mascon and spherical harmonics solutions to detect the twsa trends in the lower mrb and an insignificant negative tendency was discovered based on mann kendall test and time series decomposition methods during the period 2003 2016 on the contrary the current study obtained a negative trend of 3 3 2 2 and 0 3 1 4 mm a between 2003 and 2016 using the linear regression approach based on the reconstructed csr mascon solution and wghm model respectively the slight difference can be triggered by the uncertainty in the different data used and distinctive calculation methods nevertheless another global perspective revealed a decreasing trend of twsa during the period 2002 2016 over the majority of the mrb especially in the midstream and downstream reaches rodell et al 2018 which is in line with our findings a recent study attempted to track the long term trends in twsa around the upper reach of the mrb and also found significant negative trends ranging from 3 2 to 6 0 mm a close to the results of this study for the lower basin bibi et al 2021 however these studies merely focused on the changes in full twsa neglecting the respective non climate driven and climate driven parts of twsa particularly in the context of significant human activity fig s19 and climate change over the last decades liu et al 2021 in terms of future changes in twsa pokhrel 2021 utilized seven different lsms ghms and dgvm forced with four gcms from the cmip5 archive to assess the future projections of global twsa under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 scenarios it was found that the twsa over the southeastern of the lower mrb was projected to increase while the other regions presented a decrease under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 scenarios in the late century 2070 2099 compared with the historical baseline from 1976 to 2005 which are generally in line with our results despite different calculation periods and models by combing the gcms and hydrological model the increased flood potential was reported by previous research wang et al 2021 yun et al 2021a coinciding with the enhancement of flood potential in our study to sum up this study systematically investigated the non climate driven and climate driven twsa in the past 2003 2020 and future projections of twsa 2030 2099 improving the understanding of the hydrological response to global change greve et al 2014 given the increasingly frequent water conflicts within different countries partitioning the climate driven and non climate driven components of twsa is essential for better management and cooperation of water related resources fan and he 2015 yun et al 2021b assessing the divergent changes in the two components of twsa also provides important implications for water balance studies in other basins worldwide with rapid reservoir constructions and varying climate conditions e g precipitation and evapotranspiration famiglietti and rodell 2013 chao et al 2020 moreover projecting future twsa under multiple scenarios indeed can be dedicated to the exploration of terrestrial dryness wetness and associated changes in hydrological extremes like floods and droughts in the future xiong et al 2022 although the historical and future twsa changes under the background of climatic and non climatic changes have been successfully characterized there are still some limitations existing at the current stage despite the use of reconstructed grace like products the relatively short time and a total of 33 missing months of grace satellites 21 years could inevitably generate the uncertainty for continuous monitoring of the twsa variability at the climate scale i e greater than30 years ghobadi far et al 2020 sun et al 2020 thus challenging the reasonable and accurate estimates of long term trends in twsa especially for the lower mrb that has undergone significant climate changes and human activities over decades nie et al 2018 the human water use and reservoir operation data are derived from the wghm owing to the restricted data sharing policies among different countries whose outputs are only available until the end of 2016 causing the inconsistency with the study period 2003 2020 of our research this difference might impact the rationality of the attribution analysis of non climate driven twsa also the future projections used in this study developed under the framework of isi mip 2b phase were forced by the gcm outputs from the cmip5 archive although the meteorological forcing data has gone through a bias correction and downscaling their bias may be higher than the latest cmip6 gcm data eyring et al 2016 ferguson et al 2018 the simulation round for the future scenario 2006 2099 is also relatively longer than that of the cmip6 archive 2015 2099 resulting in higher uncertainty in twsa simulations in this study hence the social economic conditions have been fixed at the 2005 level during the future projection which might have underestimated the influences of human activities such as reservoir regulation because of the rapid reservoir constructions after the year yun et al 2021a 5 conclusions in this study we identified the recent changes of twsa in the lower mrb during 2003 2020 and partitioned it into the climate driven and non climate driven twsa during the period 2003 2016 based on the wghm model and a statistical approach subsequently the spatiotemporal variability of the full twsa and its two components have been investigated furthermore the attribution analysis was performed in combination with multiple climatic i e precipitation and air temperature and non climatic i e water abstraction reservoir storage and land cover factors moreover the future projections of twsa under rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios have been conducted for the period 2030 2099 using the wghm model forced with four downscaled and bias corrected simulations of four cmip5 gcms which were subsequently integrated using the gtch method to eliminate the inter model uncertainties two future periods i e near 2040 2059 and far 2080 2099 future are analyzed independently in addition the future changes in flood potential that closely relate to precipitation and twsa were also analyzed the main findings and conclusions are summarized as follows 1 grace twsa decreases at a rate of 3 3 2 2 mm a 3 7 1 8 mm a that mainly occurs in the months from july to october during 2003 2016 2003 2020 and the trend is 0 3 1 4 mm a based on the wghm outputs climate driven twsa derived from the wghm model and statistical method forced with different datasets are highly correlated with the correlation coefficients ranging from 0 81 to 0 91 it exhibits a similarly negative trend 0 3 1 4 mm a and the seasonal distribution to the full twsa while the non climate driven part presents a small positive trend 0 01 0 07 mm a that occurs during august december spatially the grace twsa shows an apparent pattern with a depletion in the southwestern region and an increase in the northern region during 2003 2016 2020 which is consistent with spatial pattern of the changes in the climatic components however the non climate driven twsa component presents a slight increase over the west and south of the central basin consequently the trend in full twsa is dominated by climatic factors while the influence of the non climatic factors is limited 2 decreasing trends of precipitation 1 3 8 5 mm a and rising air temperature 0 05 0 02 a are detected during 2003 2016 the annual cycle and spatial distribution of precipitation are consistent with the climate driven twsa with the comprehensive warming climate over the lower mrb the variations in precipitation and air temperature can well explain the patterns of the climatic twsa a slight enhancement in human water abstraction 0 13 0 14 mm a during 2003 2020 and sectoral water withdrawal e g irrigation 0 2 0 03 mm a during 2003 2010 that are mainly located in the south and west central regions are identified causing regional depletion in non climate driven twsa the increase in reservoir storage 0 01 0 08 mm a is considered responsible for the growth of non climate driven twsa which can also be reflected by their consistent seasonal characteristics and spatial distribution changes in land cover from the varying ndvi can further support our attributions for non climate driven twsa including the decreasing trends over the southern basin due to urbanization and increasing trends over the central region because of the irrigation area changes 3 the gtch method explicitly quantifies the uncertainty of twsa projections forced by different gcms and their respective weights are estimated for data fusion under the rcp2 6 scenario twsa is expected to increase at a rate of 0 16 0 11 mm a during 2030 2099 and the trend changes to 0 1 0 12 and 0 06 0 11 mm a for the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively twsa is projected to increase by 12 2 12 2 mm and 11 6 25 8 mm under the rcp2 6 scenario in the near and far future respectively the increase is similar for the rcp6 0 scenario i e 10 3 18 9 mm in the near and 12 3 30 mm in the far future however the rcp8 5 scenario projects a lower twsa increase of 9 3 21 4 mm and 1 6 41 2 mm for the near and far future periods respectively the projected changes of twsa can be well explained by the future changes in precipitation and air temperature temporally and spatially an increase in flood potential induced by the changes in twsa and precipitation is identified under multiple scenarios in both the near and far future our results may foster the urgent discussion on a shift of the water withdrawals and allocations from the supply side e g over abstraction to the demand side e g using less water intense crops revising pumping regulations upgrading the prevailing irrigation and water supply technology to minimize the losses the results are expected to call attention to value added multilateral cooperation among the various nations and stakeholders to incentivize the water

3014,climate change and human activity such as reservoir operation have altered the hydrological system in the transboundary mekong river basin mrb over decades urging a need to assess the historical changes and future projections of freshwater availability here we examined changes of terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa from the gravity recovery and climate experiment satellites in the lower mrb during 2003 2020 and subsequently partitioned and attributed them into climate driven and non climate driven components using the watergap hydrological model wghm with and without consideration of human activities together with a statistical method driven by climatic forcing only further integrated future twsa was projected under different climate change scenarios during 2030 2099 forced with four downscaled and bias corrected simulations of four global climate models results show a decreasing twsa trend of 3 7 1 8 mm a during 2003 2020 the wghm based climate driven twsa which is highly correlated with the statistical modeling results and non climate driven part suggests a trend of 0 3 1 4 and 0 01 0 07 mm a during 2003 2016 respectively the climate driven twsa is well explained by the changes in decreasing precipitation 1 3 8 5 mm a and increasing air temperature 0 05 0 02 a spatially and temporally while the non climate driven component is closely linked to human activities such as growing sectoral human withdrawal 0 13 0 14 mm a increasing reservoir regulation 0 01 0 08 mm a and changing land cover twsa under future climate changes is projected to increase from 9 3 21 4 to 12 2 12 2 mm and from 1 6 41 2 to 12 3 30 mm in the near 2040 2059 and far future 2080 2099 under various scenarios comparing with the historical period 2003 2020 future flood potential estimated with twsa and precipitation was also projected to increase this study provides important inferences for decision makers and stakeholders to better understand the water cycle and manage water resources in a changing environment keywords terrestrial water storage climate variability and change human activities future projection lower mekong river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws which is summed from water stored in rivers lakes and reservoirs soil groundwater systems snow and glaciers and vegetation is a crucial variable in the global hydrological cycle and land atmosphere interaction processes rodell et al 2018 as an effective indicator of regional water balance or imbalance abhishek et al 2021 natural hazards such as floods and droughts abhishek and kinouchi 2022 terrestrial carbon uptake humphrey et al 2018 ice sheets and glaciers mass fluctuations van den broeke et al 2009 and sea level rise eicker et al 2016 tws changes play a determining role in modulating water flux interactions within various earth system components pokhrel et al 2021 nevertheless global variations in tws are still inadequately known due to the paucity of field observation gauges worldwide and considerable uncertainties in hydrological and land surface models scanlon et al 2018 particularly in the international river basins with restricted data sharing policies and intensive water conflicts among different countries as one of the most important international rivers of asia the mekong river flowing across six countries including china myanmar lao thailand vietnam and cambodia feeds approximately 70 million inhabitants and sustains crops livestock and the ecosystem of the basin yun et al 2021a under the background of emerging freshwater availability monitoring tws changes in the mekong river basin mrb is of great importance to address the comprehensive cooperation in regional water resources management and development jing et al 2020 liu et al 2022 jointly developed by the national aeronautics and space administration and the german aerospace center the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission that launched in march 2002 can provide monthly terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa worldwide with unprecedented accuracy by measuring distance changes between the twin satellites tapley et al 2019 after its decommissioning in june 2017 the grace follow on also referred to as grace hereafter satellites commissioned in may 2018 have continued to assess global twsa changes up to the present the grace satellites have enabled the investigation of spatiotemporal variability of twsa on multiple temporal from seasonal to decadal and spatial from regional to global scales humphrey et al 2016 sun et al 2020 guo et al 2021 a few studies have attempted to reveal twsa changes in the mrb pham duc et al 2019 jing et al 2020 bibi et al 2021 specifically jing et al 2020 used five different grace solutions and found a downward trend with trends ranging from 0 0 to 14 5 mm a between 2002 and 2016 in the upper reach p 0 05 while there were no statistically significant trends in the lower basin moreover bibi et al 2021 examined the twsa changes in the upstream region and also discovered significant p 0 05 negative trends at rates ranging from 3 3 to 5 9 mm a during 2002 2016 based on multiple grace solutions climate change has significantly altered the hydrological system of the mrb over decades which is mainly reflected by the variations in precipitation and temperature nie et al 2018 gao et al 2019 in addition the growing food demands rapid population expansion and dramatic urban development have resulted in massive changes in land use land cover lucc alteration of the hydrological cycle and development of hydropower systems throughout the basin johnston and kummu 2012 liu et al 2021 therefore both climate and non climate factors should have played a role in the historical twsa changes in the mrb therefore the quantification of the respective contributions of the two factors to the total change in the past twsa is crucial but remains unexamined most of the previous studies merely focused on the historical changes of twsa in the mrb due to the relatively short period 21 years of the grace missions while the future projections under the combined effects of both climatic and non climatic factors remain rarely examined there are generally two categories of methods to obtain future twsa the first group relies on physically based models to describe changes in climate land surface and hydrology as an example pokhrel et al 2021 forced a large ensemble of global hydrological models ghms land surface models lsms and dynamic global vegetation models dgvms using four different global climate models gcms from coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 and acquired global twsa projections under distinctive emission scenarios for drought possibility evaluation until the end of the 21st century this method has been used to assess the great potential of the combination of gcms and ghms lsms dgvms to simulate the future twsa oki and kanae 2006 schewe et al 2014 xiong et al 2022 directly used the original grace observations to perform the bias correction for the twsa simulations of multiple gcms from the cmip6 archive and subsequently applied this approach to assess the future twsa and associated flood potential changes in the yangtze river basin however the systematic analysis of projected twsa in the mrb is still unexplored using either kind of the above introduced methods therefore the main objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of climate driven and non climate driven twsa contributions as well as their influential factors over the lower mrb during the historical period 2003 2020 2 to project the future changes of twsa that are jointly affected by both climate and non climate factors under multiple scenarios during the future period 2030 2099 2 data and methods 2 1 study area we selected the lower mrb as the study region because the shape of upstream mrb is very narrow and elongated thus it is very likely that grace signals possess leakage errors i e contamination gain loss in the target signal from the surrounding region e g glacier melting on the qinghai tibet plateau chao et al 2020 located within the domain of 9 48 22 42 n and 99 51 108 42 e the lower mrb has a total area of 606 000 km2 occupying 77 of the whole of mrb with a total area of 795 000 km2 see fig 1 the lower mrb is shared by five countries in southeast asia including laos thailand vietnam cambodia and myanmar dominated by the tropical rainforest climate and tropical monsoon climate more than 80 of precipitation in the basin occurs in the wet season from june to november while only 20 is received during the dry season from december to may yun et al 2021b the cropland is the main land use type and more than 10 million hectares of cultivated land are employed for rice production jing et al 2020 the lower mrb has experienced significant climate changes since the 1980s which were mainly reflected by the warming at a rate higher than the global average warming rate and increasing annual precipitation kingston et al 2011 fan and he 2015 in addition future projections of air temperature are expected to steadily increase up to the end of the 21st century with the annual precipitation continuing to grow under multiple scenarios västilä et al 2010 kingston et al 2011 the lower mrb feeding more than 60 million people status 2010 you et al 2014 is heavily irrigated for agriculture purposes and the population is projected to grow by 60 by 2050 compared to its 2005 values pech and sunada 2008 therefore the growing demand for water and energy resources due to population and urban expansion has led to over 79 large reservoirs in operation with a total storage capacity of 57 5 km3 up to the year 2021 fig 1 the detailed information on these operational reservoirs is listed in table s1 the statistics of the operational reservoirs are provided by a recent study yun et al 2021a therefore the increasingly evident climate and non climate changes highlight the urgent need to understand the twsa changes in both the past and future 2 2 grace twsa we used the grace mass concentration block mascon data during 2003 2020 to assess the twsa changes in the lower mrb which was produced by the center for space research at the university of texas at austin csr watkins et al 2015 save et al 2016 table s2 the mascon solutions are derived by parameterizing the gravity field with regional mass concentration functions unlike the conventionally used spherical harmonics grace products the mascon solutions are free from leakage signals and several categories of post processing errors such as de correlated and de stripping noises scanlon et al 2016 wiese et al 2016 covering the period 2003 2020 the monthly mascon solutions have been resampled to a common 0 5 spatial resolution the mascon data represents the twsa relative to the average gravity field between 2004 and 2009 a total of 22 missing months due to instrumental issues and an 11 month data gap between two generations of grace satellites from july 2017 to may 2018 are filled with a recently published grace reconstructions dataset li et al 2021 which is also trained with the csr mascon solution based on multiple climatic hydrological variables and a combination of machine learning and statistical decomposition techniques since no calibration processes are needed across the missions and the precision and spatiotemporal sampling are equivalent there are no existing intermission biases between grace and grace follow on satellites landerer et al 2020 to investigate the influences of distinctive constraints and the scale of the grid cells from different processing institutions the mascon solution from the nasa jet propulsion laboratory jpl agency is also used for comparison similarly the missing months and the data gap are filled with a recent grace reconstructions dataset trained with the jpl mascon solution mo et al 2021 which is derived using the bayesian deep learning method combined with era5 land reanalysis the comparisons between the continuous csr and jpl mascon solutions on the basin and grid scales suggest high consistency with the correlation coefficient of 0 99 fig s1 highlighting the negligible influences of divergent grace solutions 2 3 decomposition of twsa the watergap v 2 2d hydrological model wghm eicker et al 2014 schmied et al 2021 was applied to decompose the twsa into climate and non climate driven parts from the period 2003 2016 the wghm is a state of the art hydrological model that simulates the full components of twsa including water stored in river snow lakes and reservoirs soil aquifers and vegetation over non glacierized regions forced by the watch forcing data methodology applied to era interim data wfdei dataset it provides direct human intervention with hydrological cycle such as irrigation reservoir regulation and groundwater extraction weedon et al 2014 schmied et al 2021 the wghm model has been widely employed in regional and global hydrology research an et al 2021 hosseini moghari et al 2020 we also used simulations of the surface water groundwater and soil moisture storage from the wghm to investigate the variations of different components of twsa the climate driven twsa is estimated using the nosoc mode of the wghm which did not account for direct human activities such as irrigation and reservoir management in addition a recently proposed statistical method liu et al 2021 which has been validated over major global river basins was also applied to identify the climate driven twsa for comparison and independent check this method can reconstruct both seasonal and non seasonal signals in climate driven twsa using precipitation and air temperature data which were also derived from the wfdei meteorological dataset in our study moreover several widely used climate forcing products such as era5 cru ts v 4 05 and gldas v2 1 were retrieved to detect the uncertainty sourced from different climate inputs table s2 then we subtract the naturalized wghm simulations i e nosoc mode from the standard wghm outputs i e histoc mode to estimate the non climate driven twsa which has considered both climate and human factors huang et al 2015 xie et al 2019 similarly we also estimated the non climate driven twsa by removing the statistically reconstructed climate driven twsa from the grace twsa for comparison zhong et al 2019 the training testing configurations and the optimized parameters of the statistical method have been summarized in table s3 2 4 projected twsa the wghm was applied to assess the future twsa changes under the joint effects of climate and non climate factors during the period 2030 2099 with a uniform spatial resolution of 0 5 the meteorological forcing data including precipitation air temperature solar radiation wind speed specific humidity and surface pressure generated from four gcms i e gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 of the cmip5 archive have undergone statistical downscaling and bias correction using the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip methods hempel et al 2013 lange 2018 2019 three future scenarios are considered for each gcm including a low rcp2 6 a medium high rcp6 0 and a high rcp8 5 greenhouse gas concentration scenario and are subsequently divided into near 2040 2059 and far 2080 2099 future periods for comparison the projected precipitation and air temperature were also derived to analyze the future changes in climatic factors furthermore we also calculated a flood potential index fpi using the projected twsa and precipitation to evaluate the future changes in flood probability over the lower mrb which were compared with the historical period during 2003 2020 fpi was initially introduced by reager and famiglietti 2009 and has been widely used in the grace community to represent the large scale flood possibility zhu and yuan 2021 higher fpi 1 can generally be translated into a greater flood potential and vice versa all the simulations are conducted under the framework of phase 2b of the isi mip project warszawski et al 2014 the applicability of the future projections of twsa has been fully evaluated in a recent global study pokhrel et al 2021 2 5 auxiliary data multi source data from the remote sensing reanalysis and models were collected to analyze the climatic and non climatic variables influencing the twsa specifically precipitation and air temperature from the wfdei meteorological dataset were used to study the climate variability during 2003 2016 which is consistent with the wghm model weedon et al 2014 however the fpi between 2003 and 2020 was derived based on grace twsa and era5 precipitation data due to the unavailability of the wfdei product after 2016 the comparisons among different precipitation datasets show satisfactory agreement in the lower mrb suggesting an insignificant uncertainty in the choices of precipitation datasets fig s2 era5 reanalysis dataset is the 5th generation atmospheric reanalysis of the global atmosphere produced by the copernicus climate change service at the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf further the era5 land product provides a consistent view of land variables from 1950 present at an enhanced resolution compared to era5 over global land based on the 4d var assimilation scheme integrated forecast system model 41r2 and htessel land surface model driven by meteorological forcing from the era interim atmospheric reanalysis and precipitation adjustments based on the global precipitation climatology project gpcp data hersbach et al 2020 further the monthly remote sensing normalized difference vegetation index ndvi from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 13c2 product was obtained to assess the influence of land cover on twsa which was also validated based on the yearly satellite based land cover map retrieved from the esa cci climate change initiative project esa 2017 two global irrigation datasets from the food and agriculture organization fao and nagaraj et al 2021 were utilized to assess the changes in the irritation area the basic information on dams and reservoirs in the lower mrb from yun et al 2021a was collected to investigate the changes in man made hydrologic constructions similarly simulated reservoir storage from the wghm was also collected for attribution analysis the monthly actual total consumptive water use as the sum of abstracted water from surface water and groundwater in the wghm model schmied et al 2021 was also used for the interpretation of human water use we also obtained a global gridded reconstruction of water withdrawal for sectoral water use including irrigation domestic electricity generation livestock mining and manufacturing during 2003 2010 from huang et al 2018 for comparison the irrigation withdrawals are derived from four optimized ghms including the wghm pcr globwb lpjml and h08 models of which the wghm was selected for consistency in this study finally we obtained the satellite based water level and surface area time series during 2003 2020 in the largest freshwater lake in south east asia the tonle sap lake to validate our examinations of twsa variations given its significant role in regulating the flows in the mrb campbell et al 2009 wang et al 2020 chen et al 2021 therefore the monthly water volume changes were estimated according to taube 2000 which has been widely used in lake volume change zhang et al 2017 2019 2021 2 6 uncertainty estimation various methods were applied to quantify the uncertainties inevitably embedded in and propagated from the multisource data used specifically the uncertainty in the csr mascon solution was estimated as the residuals after removing the long term trends and seasonal annual and semi annual signals from the raw series scanlon et al 2016 moreover the uncertainty in the wghm simulations under nosoc and histsoc modes was calculated as the 10 range i e 90 to 110 of modeling results schmied et al 2021 the uncertainty in the statistically reconstructed climate driven twsa was taken as one standard deviation of 20 000 equally acceptable samples from mcmc simulation when training the model liu et al 2021 consequently the non climate driven twsa from both the wghm and the statistical method were estimated as the square root of the sum of squares of uncertainty in wghm histsoc mode and grace data respectively moreover the uncertainty of long term trends in twsa can be calculated as one standard deviation of the linear regression with a significance level of 0 95 t test which was estimated using the linear regression method for the yearly average time series given the substantial uncertainties in future twsa projections sourced from four meteorological forcings i e gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 the generalized three cornered hat gtch method was employed to estimate their respective uncertainty during 2030 2099 the gtch method estimates the relative covariance of different sets of twsa projections among at least three datasets without the need for any prior knowledge information premoli and tavella 1993 it has been broadly used in estimating twsa uncertainty from both grace and models globally due to its high effectiveness and robustness long et al 2014 2017 moreover we fused different categories of twsa projections using the weighted averaging method in which the corresponding weights of various twsa datasets were determined based on the relative variance estimated by the gtch method under the assumption of no correlations with each other yan et al 2021 we also compared the fused projections and the ensemble mean to constrain the uncertainty 3 results 3 1 historical twsa variations fig 2 illustrates the monthly time series of twsa climate driven and non climate driven during the period 2003 2020 and their annual cycles are presented in fig s3 grace data generally ranges from 300 to 300 mm except for the extremely high value in the wet season of 2011 the overall negligible uncertainty of grace twsa is found grey shaded regions with relatively higher values in the 11 month data gap between july 2017 and may 2018 larger uncertainties in the peaks and troughs compared with other occasions are apparent as a result of both climate and non climate factors the grace twsa has a downward rate of 3 7 1 8 mm a similar to the trend 3 3 2 2 mm a during the period 2003 2016 moreover consistent changes in wghm twsa with grace results are detected with relatively low amplitude and high uncertainty therefore an underestimated trend of 0 3 1 4 mm a is discovered during 2003 2016 compared to the grace data which are mainly caused by the decrease in groundwater 0 2 0 4 mm a and surface water storage 0 2 0 6 mm a fig s4 the identified climate driven twsa from the wghm and statistical model in the lower mrb are shown in fig 2 the naturalized wghm modeled twsa illustrates close agreement with the statistically reconstructed climate driven twsa based on different climate forcings with the respective correlation coefficient of 0 89 wfdei 0 81 era5 0 91 cru ts and 0 89 gldas highlighting the robustness of wghm under the natural mode climte driven twsa and grace twsa share similar seasonal features that peak in september october while reacheing the lowest in april may which may be connected to the tropical monsoonal climate that is dominated by the southwest monsoon fig s3 however there are considerable uncertainties in the reconstructed climate driven twsa especially for the wfdei and era5 forcings the comparatively better performance of the cru ts and gldas forcing might be caused by the integration of the in situ observations and remote sensing products it indicates that different climate forcings might produce various uncertainties in the climatic reconstructions and the lack of consideration of inflow from the lancang river basin will inevitably introduce some uncertainty consequently divergent trends of climate driven twsa from the wghm 0 3 1 4 mm a and statistical model are seen during 2003 2016 which widely range from 3 3 6 cru ts and 6 7 5 9 era5 mm a in terms of non climate driven changes in twsa substantial differences are determined from the statistical model due to the propagated uncertainties in grace and climate driven twsa and multiple datasets of meteorological forcing causing the trends ranging from 10 4 6 era5 and 0 3 2 4 cru ts mm a during 2003 2016 similarly wghm based non climate driven twsa presents a pattern that non climate driven twsa is dominated by the spread of data uncertainty with relatively low amplitude and trend between 2003 and 2016 0 01 0 07 mm a fig s5 therefore despite the large uncertainty sourced from the different models and forcings we conclude that the trends in twsa from 2003 to 2016 2020 are primarily governed by the climate driven components with a limited contribution from the non climate driven changes the limited influence of the non climate driven twsa can be explained by the fact that despite a large number of dam reservoir constructions table s1 their total capacities 95 mm of equivalent water depth in 2020 are one order of magnitude less than the twsa amplitude variations 800 mm also the groundwater pumping in the lower mrb might have been small owing to the abundant precipitation and surface water resources the latter of which contributes 40 45 of twsa changes pham duc et al 2019 fig 3 demonstrates the spatial distribution of trends in twsa climate driven twsa and non climate driven twsa during 2003 2016 2020 for the period 2003 2020 the majority of the lower mrb illustrates overall twsa depletion trends p 0 05 except for the northern region where twsa increases from 2 to 8 mm a with the uncertainties of 3 mm a in addition grace observations show significant p 0 05 decreasing trends with rates ranging from 16 0 to 8 0 mm a over the western and southern parts of the basin and the uncertainties generally fluctuate between 2 0 and 4 0 mm a furthermore satellite based water levels from multi source altimetry sensors and water surface area from different optical imageries of the largest inland water body i e tonle sap lake in cambodia are demonstrated in fig s6 it can be seen that water surface area water level and derived water volume changes show downward trends during the period 2003 2020 agreeing well with grace observations a similar distribution of grace data is demonstrated for the period 2003 2016 while with relatively higher trends and uncertainties over the basin wghm modeled twsa generally shares a similar pattern with grace data between 2003 and 2016 with increasing trends in the north while decreasing trends mainly in the central and south basin however the southwestern eastern and southeastern regions illustrate positive trends with trends below 8 mm a with uncertainties higher than 3 mm a such differences might arise from the inherent uncertainty of the wghm and the bias of the climate inputs i e wfdei dataset moreover the climate driven twsa shares similar patterns in both trends and uncertainties with twsa from 2003 to 2016 implying the governing role of the climatic factors in twsa variations spatially the paradigm can be further validated according to the comparable distributions between wghm outputs and wfdei derived climatic reconstructions in contrast to that slightly increasing trends of twsa are captured by the non climate driven twsa in the west and south of the central basin whose trends are generally below 4 0 mm a and the uncertainties are lower than 1 mm a forced with the wfdei climate forcing same as the wghm the non climate driven twsa based on the statistical method illustrates generally similar distribution but with higher amplitudes and uncertainties due to the propagated uncertainty in the identification and separation of the climate driven parts we note considerable differences between the climatic and non climatic twsa reconstructions exist due to different meteorological forcings figs s7 and s8 however demonstrative insights can be provided by combining with the wghm and statistical approach forced by the same dataset i e wdfei apart from long term trends seasonal characteristics of trends in twsa are additionally analyzed owing to the divergent climate changes in wet and dry seasons together with the seasonality of non climate factors e g reservoir operation and irrigation fig 4 shows the annual cycles of trends in twsa climate driven twsa and non climate driven twsa it indicates grace data has a unimodal distribution that the negative trends from 8 5 3 6 to 7 9 3 2 mm a mainly occur in august and september and relatively small trends ranging from 5 5 3 july to 1 4 1 7 february mm a happen in other months during 2003 2020 there are no apparent differences detected in grace twsa during 2003 2016 than the period 2003 2020 compared to the grace results the wghm model demonstrates underestimated trends with rates ranging from 3 5 2 9 june to 0 5 1 3 april mm a unlike the long term trends the seasonal pattern of wghm twsa is dominated by soil moisture with apparent drying in the wet season mainly from may to june and august to september and the wetting trend in the dry season fig s4 the seasonal distributions of trends in climate driven twsa are also examined and consistent patterns between the wghm and the statistical models are observed especially with that forced with the wfdei dataset the climate driven twsa generally presents negative trends in the wet season while positive trends in the dry season which range from 3 5 2 9 june to 3 5 2 1 december mm a with considerable uncertainties overall deviations among different subsets of climatic reconstructions might be triggered by their inherent differences as a consequence the non climate driven component of twsa from the wghm is slightly positive from august to december whereas negative trends are found in other months particularly from january to may in the dry season the differences between the statistically estimated non climate driven twsa and the wghm simulations can be sourced from the propagated uncertainty of identification simulation and or isolation of the climatic and non climatic components 3 2 influential factors of twsa 3 2 1 climatic factors to assess the influential factors of climate driven twsa multiple climate variables have been analyzed in the lower mrb fig 5 shows the monthly evolution of precipitation and air temperature as well as their trends during 2003 2016 precipitation generally varies between 1 and 426 mm and shows obvious seasonality due to the monsoon climate a slight downward trend at a rate of 1 3 8 5 mm a is detected moreover the air temperature is generally greater than 20 4 and presents an increasing trend of 0 05 0 02 a under a warming climate consequently the reducing precipitation and increasing air temperature can reasonably explain the depletion of climate driven twsa 0 3 1 4 mm a due to the decreasing water availability under an intensified earth s water cycle the annual cycles of trends in different climatic variables are also depicted in fig 5 it can be clearly seen that precipitation has a bimodal distribution and there are increasing trends from september to january and june with trends below 3 6 1 6 mm a november while the negative trends with rates from 4 8 2 8 may to 0 2 1 8 april mm a appear in the remaining months in contrast the air temperature shows a consistent upward trend with trends higher than 0 03 0 01 a july in most of the months except for january 0 02 0 06 a and february 0 04 0 09 a the seasonal distribution of precipitation and air temperature can jointly explain the increase in the climate driven twsa from november to january and its decrease in april may july and august some disparities in june and march can be attributed to the uncertainty in the trend estimates and the precipitation air temperature datasets the spatial distributions of long term trends in precipitation and air temperature are presented in fig 6 the northern southeastern southwestern and western regions of the basins experience increasing precipitation with trends roughly between 5 0 and 30 0 mm a and the uncertainties are correspondingly as high as 30 0 mm a located in the southwestern area the central and southern parts witness significant downward trends in precipitation and the rates change between 30 0 to 15 0 mm a with the uncertainty between 10 0 and 15 0 mm a comprehensive rising temperature is detected over the lower mrb during 2003 2016 in which the significant trends p 0 05 are located in the northwestern and southeastern regions the rates range from 0 01 to 0 11 a and the uncertainties are favorably low 0 036 a especially in the northwestern region generally the spatial distributions of trends in precipitation and air temperature agree well with those in the climate driven twsa including the twsa gains in the north centre and south regions due to precipitation increase and the losses in the northwestern basin from the temperature growth 3 2 2 non climatic factors multiple variables including human water use reservoir regulation and land cover changes were subject to attribution analysis of non climate driven twsa in the lower mrb we examined the monthly variations in total water abstraction over the lower mrb during 2003 2016 fig 7 which generally fluctuates between 0 and 6 mm with high inter and intra annual variability an increasing trend of 0 13 0 14 mm a is identified between 2003 and 2016 and the value is 0 2 0 3 mm a for the period 2003 2010 however the sectoral water withdrawals show a different positive trend of 0 2 0 03 mm a which might be due to the uncertainty in the wghm model differences between total water abstraction indicate that the summed water withdrawals might arise from the underestimated sectoral water use such as reservoir impoundment in the wet season furthermore the individual sectoral water withdrawal presents the dominating role of irrigation to other categories of human activities such as manufacturing mining and electricity fig s9 and it also has the highest increasing trend of 0 08 0 03 mm a during 2003 2010 in addition seasonal distribution in water abstraction shows slight positive trends from february to march from may to august and december which might cause the decrease in non climate driven twsa however such effects might be constrained due to relatively small amplitudes 0 08 0 05 mm a the spatial distribution of trends in total water abstraction during 2003 2016 suggests the regions with significant increasing values are mainly located in the southeast of the basin fig 8 which might be caused by the rapid urbanization and expansion of the mekong delta yun et al 2021a both increasing and decreasing trends are detected in the west central basin that is highly irrigated fig s10 due to the changes in irrigations area regionally with trends ranging from 2 4 1 6 to 1 6 1 5 mm a we also examined the annual irrigation map over the lower mrb from 2001 to 2015 indicating both an increase and decrease in irrigation area over the centre basin agreeing with the spatial changes in water extraction fig 9 specifically the percentage of grid cells with high irrigation shows a downward trend of 0 05 0 01 a while an upward trend of 0 03 0 16 a is found for the area with low to medium irrigation between 2001 and 2015 the annual irrigation maps are depicted to show the spatiotemporal variations of irrigation area over the lower mrb fig s11 the reservoir storage generally changes between 3 9 0 4 and 16 6 1 7 mm and shows a non significant increasing trend 0 01 0 08 mm a during the period 2003 2016 fig 7 favouring the increase of non climate driven twsa annual cycles of trends do not present a significant trend from january to september except for may 0 02 0 06 mm a but steadily grow from october 0 02 0 22 mm a to december 0 08 0 2 mm a the changing pattern of reservoir storage can partly explain the seasonal distribution of trends in non climate driven twsa as well as its positive trend on the yearly scale even though the magnitude is relatively low 0 01 0 07 mm a there are no significant changes in reservoir storage that can be observed for the whole of lower mrb with only a few reservoirs in the lower reach experiencing surface water depletion the uncertainty of trends is relatively high in the west compared to that in the south of the basin such distribution and amplitude demonstrate similar patterns of the non climate driven twsa suggest the potential impacts of reservoir constructions on the regional non climatic twsa variations human activities such as dam operation and agricultural expansion can generally be considered as the main factors deriving the land use land cover changes in the lower mrb cho and qi 2021 no apparent trend in ndvi is determined 0 0005 0 0006 a while the decreasing trends between april 0 001 0 0013 a and june 0 0001 0 0009 a combined with the increasing trends from july 0 0006 0 0005 a to march 0 0 0008 a are identified such distribution could reflect the effects of various human activities on the regional land cover such as irrigation and urbanization spatially ndvi illustrates significant downward trends in the south of lower mrb which may be due to the rapid urbanization process over the mekong delta yun et al 2021a differently some areas in the central basin have growing ndvi consistent with the changes in the irrigation area these patterns are also validated by the annual map of land cover during 2003 2020 fig s12 3 3 future projections of twsa given the considerable differences among climatic projections from different gcms i e gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc5 we used the gtch method to evaluate the individual uncertainty and fuse the wghm based twsa projections under multiple scenarios i e rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 table s4 summarizes the basin scale results indicating the gfdl esm2m model has the highest uncertainty under different scenarios while the ipsl cm5a lr output shows the lowest except for the rcp2 6 scenario miroc5 consequently the relatively high weights were assigned to the ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 models while low weight was given to the gfdl esm2m data spatially similar distributions of uncertainties are observed on the grid scale under multiple scenarios in which there are higher values along with the mekong river stretch figs s13 and s14 the ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 models also show comparatively low uncertainties than the gfdl esm2m and hadgem2 es data which generally translate to higher weights for the fused twsa projections forced with different gcms hence we developed the fused wghm projected twsa forced with four gcms at both grid and basin scales to alleviate the forcing uncertainty similarly the precipitation and air temperature are also fused to analyze the future climatic variabilities over the lower mrb fig 10 exhibits the projected changes in twsa driven by projected climate changes in the lower mrb during the period 2030 2099 projected twsa changes under rcp8 5 scenario are smaller than the rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 results with relatively high uncertainties sourced from various climate forcings especially during the extreme wet and dry periods no obvious differences between the rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 scenarios are observed except for the peaks and troughs generally an increasing trend of 0 16 0 11 mm a during 2030 2099 is calculated under the rcp2 6 scenario and the value changes to 0 1 0 12 mm a for the rcp6 0 scenario however a negative trend of 0 06 0 11 mm a is estimated for the rcp8 5 scenario in addition we identified the annual cycle of projected twsa in the near 2040 2059 and far 2080 2099 future periods fig 10 similar distributions are discovered under multiple scenarios and periods suggesting twsa increases from april to september and decreases from october to march in the near future the projected twsa under rcp8 5 scenario shows high values compared with the rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 scenarios particularly in the wet season however the relatively lower twsa is projected for the rcp8 5 scenario in the far future moreover the uncertainties in projected twsa are larger in the extremely dry wet months than in other months and the differences become more obvious during the far future than in the near future higher inter model variabilities are observed among different gcms under the rcp8 5 scenarios than the other two scenarios in addition to the fused twsa the ensemble mean of various simulations forced by the four gcms is also presented fig s15 the spatial distribution of absolute changes in future twsa over the lower mrb is illustrated fig 11 under the rcp2 6 scenario twsa increases roughly ranging from 10 to 50 mm are discovered along the mekong river and in the northwestern and southwestern of the basin in the near future with the uncertainties generally greater than 10 mm fig s16 despite the subsequent enhancement of twsa over the lower reach some twsa reduction below 10 mm is found over the eastern region in the far future with overall higher uncertainties than the near future the rcp6 0 results present a similar pattern to the rcp2 6 scenario except for some twsa loss in the southwestern region in the near future which spread to the surrounding area in the far future however the twsa gains in the northwestern basin alleviate under the rcp8 5 scenario with the decreased twsa in the east basin furthermore the majority of the region in the central and northern basins experiences a twsa deficit in the far future the basin averaged examinations indicate that twsa is projected to increase by 12 2 12 2 mm and 11 6 25 8 mm under the rcp2 6 scenario in the near and far future respectively the numbers are similar to the rcp6 0 scenario that is 10 3 18 9 mm near future and 12 3 30 mm far future however the rcp8 5 scenario project a lower twsa increase of 9 3 21 4 mm and 1 6 41 2 mm for the near and far future periods respectively the projected patterns of twsa are closely associated with the projected future changes in precipitation and air temperature both temporally and spatially figs s17 and s18 for example the overall increase in precipitation in the northwest and south of the basin contributes to the twsa increase under the rcp8 5 scenario especially for the lower reach of the mekong river while the eastern basin is projected to undergo severe precipitation decrease as low as 40 mm in agreement with the twsa distributions such patterns can be intensified under the sharply increasing air temperature which reaches 4 in the upper reach of the lower mrb to examine the future variations of flood potential with changing precipitation and twsa we compared the probability density distributions of fpi during the past 2003 2020 and future i e near 2040 2059 and far 2080 2099 future periods fig 12 the overall positive offsets can be observed among historical and future periods under different climate change scenarios highlighting increased flood potential over the lower mrb in the 21st century due to increased precipitation which is more obvious for the high flood risk periods specifically the durations with relatively high flood potential fpi greater than 0 5 have increased by 3 5 2 2 in both the near and far future compared to the past period under the rcp2 6 scenario fig 12 the percentages reach 3 0 1 9 and 8 8 1 1 during the near future for the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively they are projected to be 4 3 3 8 rcp6 0 and 4 6 2 7 rcp8 5 in the far future in a nutshell the increasing flood potential induced by the changes in twsa and precipitation can be identified under multiple scenarios in both the near and far future 4 discussion a few studies have assessed the historical and future changes of twsa in the lower mrb jing et al 2020 used five different grace mascon and spherical harmonics solutions to detect the twsa trends in the lower mrb and an insignificant negative tendency was discovered based on mann kendall test and time series decomposition methods during the period 2003 2016 on the contrary the current study obtained a negative trend of 3 3 2 2 and 0 3 1 4 mm a between 2003 and 2016 using the linear regression approach based on the reconstructed csr mascon solution and wghm model respectively the slight difference can be triggered by the uncertainty in the different data used and distinctive calculation methods nevertheless another global perspective revealed a decreasing trend of twsa during the period 2002 2016 over the majority of the mrb especially in the midstream and downstream reaches rodell et al 2018 which is in line with our findings a recent study attempted to track the long term trends in twsa around the upper reach of the mrb and also found significant negative trends ranging from 3 2 to 6 0 mm a close to the results of this study for the lower basin bibi et al 2021 however these studies merely focused on the changes in full twsa neglecting the respective non climate driven and climate driven parts of twsa particularly in the context of significant human activity fig s19 and climate change over the last decades liu et al 2021 in terms of future changes in twsa pokhrel 2021 utilized seven different lsms ghms and dgvm forced with four gcms from the cmip5 archive to assess the future projections of global twsa under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 scenarios it was found that the twsa over the southeastern of the lower mrb was projected to increase while the other regions presented a decrease under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 scenarios in the late century 2070 2099 compared with the historical baseline from 1976 to 2005 which are generally in line with our results despite different calculation periods and models by combing the gcms and hydrological model the increased flood potential was reported by previous research wang et al 2021 yun et al 2021a coinciding with the enhancement of flood potential in our study to sum up this study systematically investigated the non climate driven and climate driven twsa in the past 2003 2020 and future projections of twsa 2030 2099 improving the understanding of the hydrological response to global change greve et al 2014 given the increasingly frequent water conflicts within different countries partitioning the climate driven and non climate driven components of twsa is essential for better management and cooperation of water related resources fan and he 2015 yun et al 2021b assessing the divergent changes in the two components of twsa also provides important implications for water balance studies in other basins worldwide with rapid reservoir constructions and varying climate conditions e g precipitation and evapotranspiration famiglietti and rodell 2013 chao et al 2020 moreover projecting future twsa under multiple scenarios indeed can be dedicated to the exploration of terrestrial dryness wetness and associated changes in hydrological extremes like floods and droughts in the future xiong et al 2022 although the historical and future twsa changes under the background of climatic and non climatic changes have been successfully characterized there are still some limitations existing at the current stage despite the use of reconstructed grace like products the relatively short time and a total of 33 missing months of grace satellites 21 years could inevitably generate the uncertainty for continuous monitoring of the twsa variability at the climate scale i e greater than30 years ghobadi far et al 2020 sun et al 2020 thus challenging the reasonable and accurate estimates of long term trends in twsa especially for the lower mrb that has undergone significant climate changes and human activities over decades nie et al 2018 the human water use and reservoir operation data are derived from the wghm owing to the restricted data sharing policies among different countries whose outputs are only available until the end of 2016 causing the inconsistency with the study period 2003 2020 of our research this difference might impact the rationality of the attribution analysis of non climate driven twsa also the future projections used in this study developed under the framework of isi mip 2b phase were forced by the gcm outputs from the cmip5 archive although the meteorological forcing data has gone through a bias correction and downscaling their bias may be higher than the latest cmip6 gcm data eyring et al 2016 ferguson et al 2018 the simulation round for the future scenario 2006 2099 is also relatively longer than that of the cmip6 archive 2015 2099 resulting in higher uncertainty in twsa simulations in this study hence the social economic conditions have been fixed at the 2005 level during the future projection which might have underestimated the influences of human activities such as reservoir regulation because of the rapid reservoir constructions after the year yun et al 2021a 5 conclusions in this study we identified the recent changes of twsa in the lower mrb during 2003 2020 and partitioned it into the climate driven and non climate driven twsa during the period 2003 2016 based on the wghm model and a statistical approach subsequently the spatiotemporal variability of the full twsa and its two components have been investigated furthermore the attribution analysis was performed in combination with multiple climatic i e precipitation and air temperature and non climatic i e water abstraction reservoir storage and land cover factors moreover the future projections of twsa under rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios have been conducted for the period 2030 2099 using the wghm model forced with four downscaled and bias corrected simulations of four cmip5 gcms which were subsequently integrated using the gtch method to eliminate the inter model uncertainties two future periods i e near 2040 2059 and far 2080 2099 future are analyzed independently in addition the future changes in flood potential that closely relate to precipitation and twsa were also analyzed the main findings and conclusions are summarized as follows 1 grace twsa decreases at a rate of 3 3 2 2 mm a 3 7 1 8 mm a that mainly occurs in the months from july to october during 2003 2016 2003 2020 and the trend is 0 3 1 4 mm a based on the wghm outputs climate driven twsa derived from the wghm model and statistical method forced with different datasets are highly correlated with the correlation coefficients ranging from 0 81 to 0 91 it exhibits a similarly negative trend 0 3 1 4 mm a and the seasonal distribution to the full twsa while the non climate driven part presents a small positive trend 0 01 0 07 mm a that occurs during august december spatially the grace twsa shows an apparent pattern with a depletion in the southwestern region and an increase in the northern region during 2003 2016 2020 which is consistent with spatial pattern of the changes in the climatic components however the non climate driven twsa component presents a slight increase over the west and south of the central basin consequently the trend in full twsa is dominated by climatic factors while the influence of the non climatic factors is limited 2 decreasing trends of precipitation 1 3 8 5 mm a and rising air temperature 0 05 0 02 a are detected during 2003 2016 the annual cycle and spatial distribution of precipitation are consistent with the climate driven twsa with the comprehensive warming climate over the lower mrb the variations in precipitation and air temperature can well explain the patterns of the climatic twsa a slight enhancement in human water abstraction 0 13 0 14 mm a during 2003 2020 and sectoral water withdrawal e g irrigation 0 2 0 03 mm a during 2003 2010 that are mainly located in the south and west central regions are identified causing regional depletion in non climate driven twsa the increase in reservoir storage 0 01 0 08 mm a is considered responsible for the growth of non climate driven twsa which can also be reflected by their consistent seasonal characteristics and spatial distribution changes in land cover from the varying ndvi can further support our attributions for non climate driven twsa including the decreasing trends over the southern basin due to urbanization and increasing trends over the central region because of the irrigation area changes 3 the gtch method explicitly quantifies the uncertainty of twsa projections forced by different gcms and their respective weights are estimated for data fusion under the rcp2 6 scenario twsa is expected to increase at a rate of 0 16 0 11 mm a during 2030 2099 and the trend changes to 0 1 0 12 and 0 06 0 11 mm a for the rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively twsa is projected to increase by 12 2 12 2 mm and 11 6 25 8 mm under the rcp2 6 scenario in the near and far future respectively the increase is similar for the rcp6 0 scenario i e 10 3 18 9 mm in the near and 12 3 30 mm in the far future however the rcp8 5 scenario projects a lower twsa increase of 9 3 21 4 mm and 1 6 41 2 mm for the near and far future periods respectively the projected changes of twsa can be well explained by the future changes in precipitation and air temperature temporally and spatially an increase in flood potential induced by the changes in twsa and precipitation is identified under multiple scenarios in both the near and far future our results may foster the urgent discussion on a shift of the water withdrawals and allocations from the supply side e g over abstraction to the demand side e g using less water intense crops revising pumping regulations upgrading the prevailing irrigation and water supply technology to minimize the losses the results are expected to call attention to value added multilateral cooperation among the various nations and stakeholders to incentivize the water
