representative of the emissions and the regulations for these emissions were framed in 1997 annex vi annex vi regulation 13 stipulates in the case of nox emissions eca should reduce by 80 or more from ships produced after 2016 compared with that of ships produced after 2000 according to annex vi regulation 14 the sox included in the present fuels is limited to 3 5 m m mass by mass 1 5 in eca since 2000 and the amount of sulfur contained in the total fuel from 2015 should be within 0 1 regulations on greenhouse gas emissions are also becoming stricter to prevent global warming according to the eedi regulation a reduction in co2 emissions of 10 at the design stage 20 after 2020 and 30 after 2025 is required before 2015 imo 2009 these regulations cannot be satisfied with the hfo currently used in ships as a result the need for new environmentally friendly alternative fuels has increased and lng has become an alternative fuel bernatik et al 2011 wang and notteboom 2014 ammar and seddiek 2017 globally the use of lng has increased and thus the number of ships capable of transporting lng has increased as the possibility of using lng as a fuel has been confirmed lng fueled vessels have been developed as eco friendly vessels schinas and butler 2016 wang and notteboom 2014 currently 143 lng fueled vessels are in operation and this number is expected to continue to increase sharples 2019 unlike conventional fuels natural gas has a boiling point of 163 c in the gas phase it has a volume of more than 600 times than that of the liquid phase as a result its temperature should be lowered to a cryogenic temperature for storage and transportation bernatik et al 2011 kumar et al 2011 wang and notteboom 2014 thus the design and production of storage vessels remain the greatest challenge as the material selected for the storage vessel must withstand extremely low temperatures when the temperature of the storage tank rises while the ship is moving bog is generated and the pressure inside the storage tank is increased as a rule it is not possible to discharge the bog thus the storage tank must be able to withstand the increase in pressure due to the bog or an additional system capable of handling the bog must be installed shin and lee 2009 kwak et al 2018 tu et al 2019 the lng storage tanks onboard vessels are defined in the igc code imo 2014 type a b c membrane tanks are used type c tanks currently use cylinder type tanks as they have a low volume efficiency they are rarely used except in small sized gas carriers however as the design vapor pressure is higher than that of other types of tanks generally type c tanks are used as the fuel tank in lng fueled ships because they can withstand bog harperscheidt 2011 tu et al 2019 when using a type c lng storage tank there are issues with volume efficiency and cost due to dead space fricke and bronsart 2012 which need to be solved technically wang and notteboom 2014 chryssakis et al 2015 several studies have been conducted with the aim to increase the volume efficiency of storage tank studies on circular shape cylinder like bi lobe tanks with two overlapping cylinders senjanović et al 2005 multi lobe tanks using cellular structures bergan and madsen 2006 and cubic shaped pressure vessels with 12 cylinders rammo et al 2011 have been performed in addition various studies have been conducted on non circular shaped tanks like non circular pressure vessels at 20 psig starczewski 1981 non circular vessels for waste storage at 3 barg rezvani et al 1993 rectangular pressure vessels

structure choi et al 2018 in this study we performed strength assessment for a plate stiffened prismatic pressure vessel which is a new type of pressure vessel in particular asme and igc igf codes were followed to ensure that these vessels can be used as fuel tanks for lng fueled ships the asme igc igf codes were analyzed and the design sequence for fuel tanks on board the ship is listed in section 2 section 3 describes the design principles of the new type of plate stiffened prismatic pressure vessel and section 4 presents the design and analysis of the fuel tank in a crude oil tanker based on the information provided in sections 2 and 3 the results of various finite element analyses are examined and discussed in section 5 and the conclusions are described in section 6 2 design regulation and procedure for ship application this paper describes the design of a prismatic pressure vessel using a new type of stiffened plate structure prismatic pressure vessels can withstand internal pressures of more than 0 2 barg so they can be viewed as type c in the igc igf code imo 2014 2015 in this section we explore the design criteria for designing a type c equivalent tank with a novel shape as a fuel tank for an lng fueled ship in addition we have summarized the parts that need to be applied when reflecting on the design abs abs 2017 dnvgl dnvgl 2016a 2016b and lloyd s lr 2016 2018 classification society have specified the rules for lng fueled ships or lng carriers and these rules must be met in order to certify the ship the rules covered by the classification are the igc code for lng carriers imo 2014 and igf code for lng fueled ships imo 2015 fuel tanks that can be used in lng fueled ships are covered in the igc igf code and generally type c tanks are used harperscheidt 2011 tu et al 2019 according to the united states coast guard when using type c independent tanks in gas fuel storage it is necessary to satisfy the asme boiler and pressure vessel code as well as the igc igf code uscg 2012 2017 therefore in order to use the type c tanks in all regions they should be designed according to the asme and igc igf codes methods for designing pressure tanks are listed in the asme boiler and pressure vessel code section viii a prismatic pressure vessel with a stiffened plate structure is a new type of pressure tank design it cannot be designed with division 1 and 3 as it is not a high pressure tank with a pressure higher than 70 mpa division 2 consists of a pressure tank for on board transport and a section for a pressure tank that does not have a round shape therefore in order to design this pressure tank the parts shown in division 2 should be used asme 2010a for the dba several conditions must be analyzed design loads consist of internal external pressure dead load of the components piping loads such as pressure thrust and wind thermal wave action loads this complex load is applied in the analysis and the acceptance criterion is judged the igc igf code describes the tank design method and the conditions to be met for the cargo containment system to load lng or the fuel containment system to use lng as fuel cargo tank installation ship arrangements cargo fuel containment system material and design conditions are presented for each type of tank in the igc igf code a prismatic pressure vessel with a stiffened plate structure does not belong to general type a b c or membrane type pressure vessels for the cargo fuel containment system with novel configuration igc part f and igf part a 1 annex are proposed as standard imo 2014 2015 table 1 shows the load conditions for the design in asme and igc igf codes when comparing the two codes it can be confirmed that there are some differences between the names and the degree of segmentation but they have almost the same conditions the asme and igc igf codes differ significantly with respect to obtaining the design pressure which consists of the vapor pressure and liquid pressure by liquid static head for the asme code process simulation is used to calculate the vapor pressure in contrast the vapor pressure in the igc igf code is calculated using the shape based equation for the static head part the asme code only calculates the static head but in the igc igf code storage tanks are installed on the ship thus it contains an additional dynamic load part asme 2010a imo 2014 2015 table 1 shows that the igc igf code is slightly more conservative than the asme code in terms of the test pressure analysis and acceptance criteria material selection for storage tanks is important for loading lng the asme code provides many materials that can be used at cryogenic temperatures asme 2010b astm 1996 1999 the igc igf codes limit the materials that can be used for fuel containment or piping systems among these materials imo 2014 2015 as shown in table 1 the asme code has a safety factor of 2 4 and that of the igc igf code varies from 2 3 to 2 5 depending on various factors igc 6 4 igf 7 4 3 design concept and principles of a prismatic pressure vessel with stiffened plate structures the demand for natural gas is increasing as natural gas is spotlighted as an environmentally friendly fuel however as the volume occupied by the natural gas in its gas phase is 600 times the volume in its liquid state it is usually liquefied and transported in the form of lng bernatik et al 2011 kumar et al 2011 wang and notteboom 2014 there are two ways to store lng increasing the pressure or lowering the temperature in the case of lowering the temperature the temperature must be continuously kept very low up to the lng vaporization point of 163 c in this case cryogenic storage tanks and regasification equipment are required if the temperature rises during transportation problems such as increase in volume and bog may occur in addition in order to use lng as fuel temperature and pressure conditions have to be adjusted to ensure that the engine can be used therefore when using lng as a fuel in general the fuel is stored using a type c tank according to the igc code fig 1 shows a commonly used type c tank a typical pressure vessel is a cylinder and the maximum volumetric efficiency is about 0 785 when it is used the volumetric efficiency of a sphere type pressure vessel is about 0 52 volumetric efficiency is an important factor in storage tank design to improve this new types of pressure vessels such as bi lobe and tri lobe which are made by stacking several cylinders have been designed and manufactured these include bi lobe tanks with two overlapping cylinders senjanović et al 2005 multi lobe tanks using cellular structures bergan and madsen 2006 and cubic shaped pressure vessels with 12 cylinders rammo et al 2011 in the case of the bi lobe type pressure vessel the volumetric efficiency is 0 84 which is different from that of the membrane or type b prismatic tank 0 95 0 98 in addition many studies have been conducted on pressure tanks with non circular shapes like non circular pressure vessel at 20 psig starczewski 1981 non circular vessel for waste storage at 3 barg rezvani et al 1993 rectangular pressure vessel using external reinforcement zeng et al 1987 prismatic pressure vessel with internal structures chang and bergan 2012 ahn 2012 choi 2016 x beam type supports prismatic pressure vessel ahn 2012 ahn et al 2017 a non stiffened prismatic pressure vessel lee et al 2017 and a prismatic pressure vessel with plate stiffened structure choi et al 2018 when considering a fuel tank for lng the fuel tank can be installed on deck or under deck as shown in fig 1 in case of using the lower part of the deck like on a tanker an on deck type fuel tank is mainly used the under deck type fuel tank is used when there is only a small space on the deck by using the upper part of the deck like on a container ship if an on deck type fuel tank is used there is no reduction in cargo capacity but the size of the tank is limited as the visibility needs to be considered in the case of the under deck type the cargo capacity is reduced therefore when using lng as a fuel it was found that the dimensions of the fuel tank is a very important factor in the design of both the on deck and the under deck type of fuel tanks in particular when used in container ships an annual financial loss occurs due to the volume of the fuel tank therefore the volumetric efficiency of the tank is directly related to economics and remains a challenge cylindrical and prismatic pressure vessels can be installed on deck or under deck when used as fuel tanks assuming 4261 m3 of lng ahn et al 2017 as fuel for aframax tanker operation in the case of the on deck installation the occupied area and the side area of the prismatic fuel tank were approximately twice that of the cylindrical one if we assume the same amount of lng as fuel for a container ship the fuel tank is installed in under deck in this case the cylindrical tank occupied 1 4 times more volume than the prismatic one when considering the volume of the fuel tank as the container teu assuming 5 round trips per year and an income of 750 teu per transfer we can see a financial loss of about 228 000 occurring annually in addition cylinder pressure vessels use several pressure vessels instead of one large pressure vessel such as prismatic pressure vessels due to low volumetric efficiency and height constraints this increases the number of instruments and piping required to accommodate the pressure vessels being added therefore if a prismatic pressure vessel is used instead of the conventional cylindrical pressure vessel an economic advantage may be achieved ahn et al 2017 a plate stiffened prismatic pressure vessel is a type of pressure tank which is composed of a parallel plate a vertical plate and an inter stiffener to withstand pressure plate stiffened cells are repeated to form a whole lattice pressure vessel when the desired size is changed the size of the plate stiffened cell or the number of repetition times can be expanded fig 2 shows the configuration of a plate stiffened prismatic pressure vessel it is possible to maximize the volume efficiency by deforming the cylinder shape to the rectangular shape ahn 2012 ahn et al 2017 choi 2016 lee et al 2017 choi et al 2018 the prismatic pressure vessel consists of three parts a shell structure capable of storing the whole fluid a plate stiffener as a load carrying structure capable of withstanding tensile load in the height direction and a shell stiffener reinforcing a shell structure the plate stiffener has an open structure to ensure that the fluid can move freely and the shape is reinforced slightly to withstand the up and down or right and left shell structures only in the open structure near the corner the inner stiffener helps the external shell to withstand internal pressure the parallel and vertical plates endure the buckling stress caused by tensile stress of the outer shell due to internal pressure and self weight of the external shell and pressure vessel the external shell is designed to withstand the internal pressure by using a plate and the plate thickness can be obtained through force equilibrium fig 2 shows the force equilibrium between the parallel plate and the vertical plate when the parallel plate or vertical plate has n x pieces in the x direction and n y pieces in the y direction if the plate thickness is t p p the force equilibrium is as follows 1 a a t p p n y b t p p n x if a constant pressure p acts on the outer shell the tensile stress is given by eq 2 if a b the thickness of the plate can be obtained from eq 3 2 σ a p a b 3 t p p p a σ a n x n y 4 case study aframax lng fueled tanker this section describes a case where a plate stiffened prismatic pressure vessel ppv is used as a fuel tank in an aframax lng fueled tanker fig 3 shows the use of a ppv as a fuel tank in an aframax lng fueled tanker the ppv is composed of a load carrying parallel plate vertical plate and stiffeners the shell thickness is determined to withstand the overall load and it is composed of insulation to prevent temperature increase the target tanker has a length of 234 m breadth of 42 m depth of 21 m and draft of 15 m and when it sails at a speed of 12 knots 4261 m3 lng is required for 30 days of sailing ahn et al 2017 in order to load this amount of lng the dimensions of the fuel tank are required to be l 15 m b 33 m and h 9 m the design vapor pressure is set at 6 barg based on the discussion in section 2 and the hydrostatic test pressure is required to be 9 barg which is 1 5 times the design vapor pressure according to the asme code to satisfy this requirement the shell thickness of ppv was 30 mm the thickness of vertical horizontal plate was 45 mm and the thickness of stiffener was 45 mm the material of the ppv was 9 nickel steel which can be used at cryogenic temperatures and the mechanical properties are shown in table 2 this material was used for design and analysis based on the design procedure structure assessment was performed based on section 2 the following tasks were undertaken design vapor pressure test pressure condition analysis ultimate strength analysis dynamic acceleration analysis buckling analysis thermal analysis fatigue analysis crack propagation analysis the finite element analysis was performed using abaqus cae 6 12 a commercial program and was designed based on a 3d shell the mesh uses s8r an eight node shell element for structural analysis and s8rt an eight node coupled temperature displacement element for thermal analysis the basic mesh size was set to a 100 mm based on the dnvgl guidelines for finite element analysis a minimum of three elements between the elementary lengths and a minimum of three longitudinal elements dnvgl 2015 in the asme code and igc igf code the stress is divided into primary and secondary stresses the stress should be designed to have low value compared with design allowable strength in table 1 primary stress is divided into membrane stress and bending stress obtain the membrane stress and bending stress values generated by the forces and moments acting on the pressure tank and check whether it is within the allowable strength of the material shown in table 2 based on the results from the structural analysis using the basic shell model the sum of the membrane stress and the bending stress is expressed and the bending stress which is the difference between the top and bottom of the shell results are expressed in sneg and spos in abaqus is eliminated membrane stress was also determined to be within the allowable strength the basic static analysis was conducted by considering the self weight due to internal pressure and gravity and the results were confirmed to be within the allowable strength of the material the basic design vapor pressure condition and the hydrostatic pressure condition were analyzed in each analysis the fluid was set as lng and water the ultimate strength analysis determined the extent to which the designed ppv could withstand pressure loads and analyzed the weak points under specific load conditions to perform this analysis the curve values of 9 nickel steel were entered using the stress strain curve formulas provided in asme code section viii division 2 asme 2010a when the aframax tanker is operating dynamic motion of the ship is caused by waves the same motion is generated in the lng fuel tank installed onboard and dynamic analysis of the acceleration condition in three axial directions should be performed in order to consider safety fig 4 shows the manner in which acceleration works in the ppv on the ship in the igc igf code the accelerations in the vertical and horizontal directions can be calculated using eqs 4 5 and 6 the acceleration load in the draught condition was calculated by the following equation and the results are shown in table 3 imo 2014 2015 using these calculated results the acceleration load caused by ship motion is analyzed 4 longitudinal a x a 0 0 06 a 2 0 25 a 5

structure using a plate these internal structures have columnar shapes under compression load if the compression member is thin buckling analysis should be performed because the entire structure may be damaged due to lateral deflection the buckling analysis of the entire structure provided the critical buckling stress at which buckling failure occurred lng fueled tanks are loaded with lng at 163 c which causes temperature imbalance throughout the pressure tank due to the outside high temperature this causes thermal stresses in the whole structure which may hamper the stability of the structure in this analysis the temperature distribution and thermal analysis when loading lng were used to determine the stress distribution of the pressure tank structure in the case of the lng tank an insulation layer is installed to reduce the temperature difference in this analysis the insulation is assumed to be made of commonly used polyurethane foam puf and temperature distribution and stress analysis are conducted with 60 filling ratio under various loading conditions the initial temperature was assumed to be 163 c for lng 100 c for lng vapor and 45 c for outside air in the cases of many ppvs the stiffener and plate are welded to each other therefore these ppvs are expected to be vulnerable to fatigue thus fatigue and crack propagation analysis were conducted in this study fatigue strength was determined using the igc igf code and classification rule imo 2014 2015 abs 2017 to obtain the fatigue strength we make the following assumptions abs 2017 a linear cumulative damage model has been used in connection with the s n data cyclic stresses due to wave induced loads have been used the target design life of the vessel is taken at 25 years 5 results and discussion the results of the structural analysis were analyzed based on the asme and igc igf codes as mentioned in section 2 the general membrane stress was 230 mpa the bending stress was 345 mpa and the secondary stress was 690 mpa for 9 nickel steel which is the main constituent material of the lng fuel tank we confirmed that the results of the overall analyses satisfied the allowable stress criteria shown in table 1 fig 5 a shows the result when the load is 6 barg in the prismatic pressure vessel the shell structure was inflated by the internal pressure and displacement occurred in the overall shell structure the equivalent von mises stress value was found to be within the allowable stress and the largest stress distribution was observed in the open structure where the vertical horizontal plate and the shell were joined in the stiffener structure it is confirmed that the stress applied to the shell structure is shared as shown in the analysis results when the internal pressure is applied when the pressure was applied to the shell structure it was confirmed that high stress occurred at the edge portion where the plate was joined a higher stress distribution was observed on the longer sides of the ppv fig 5 b shows the result when the load is a test pressure of 9 barg which is 1 5 times the design vapor pressure of 6 barg the overall stress distribution tendency was the same as that in the normal design condition shown in fig 5 a but it was confirmed that the stress value increased due to the increase of the internal pressure as a whole and of the hydrostatic pressure due to the fluid conversion from lng to water overall the stress was within the allowable stress furthermore the secondary parts were found to satisfy the criteria through this analysis it was confirmed that the designed ppv was safe even under the test pressure condition fig 6 a shows the ultimate strength analysis results of the pressure vessel with increasing internal pressure up to the design vapor pressure when the pressure exceeds the design vapor pressure of 6 barg the stress strain curve of the material passes through the plastic region beyond the elastic region and plastic deformation occurs at the portion where stress concentration occurs fig 6 b shows the hot spot area and fig 6 c shows the change in stress with increasing pressure up to 25 barg at a pressure of 21 barg or more the stress of the plate stiffener exceeded the yielding strength of 9 nickel steel at 585 mpa and yielding began to occur in the rest of the area except this hot spot area the structure was confirmed to be safe even under 4 times higher pressure than the design vapor pressure of 6 barg next we verified that the pressure vessel meets the acceleration criterion under the motion of the ship the analysis was performed using the three acceleration conditions calculated in the previous section the results are as follows fig 7 a shows the stress distribution in the pressure vessel when transverse acceleration is applied this condition has the largest acceleration value among the three acceleration conditions therefore it was expected to have the largest stress distribution when the acceleration is applied in the x direction an additional fluid hydrostatic pressure is generated in the same direction in the inner fluid and it is confirmed that the stress distributions in the positive and negative directions are different the stress distribution was slightly larger in the acceleration direction and the largest stress occurred at the edge of the vertical plate the overall stress was confirmed to be within the allowable stress the stress was high at some secondary stresses but was smaller than 690 mpa which is the standard value thus it was confirmed that the criteria are met even in the transverse acceleration condition fig 7 b shows the result of longitudinal acceleration analysis the acceleration in the longitudinal direction is expected to have the smallest stress distribution in the dynamic analysis because it is smaller than that in the other directions it was confirmed to be within the allowable stress which is the standard in the whole part fig 7 c shows the result when acceleration is applied in the vertical direction it is expected to have a moderately higher stress distribution because it has a smaller value than the acceleration in the transverse direction but a larger value than that in the longitudinal direction as a result of the analysis it was confirmed that the total area has a smaller value than the standard as in the longitudinal direction through the dynamic analysis it was confirmed that the pressure vessel satisfies the criteria sufficiently even under the acceleration condition next the critical buckling mode was obtained by conducting a buckling analysis to determine whether bending as a result of deflection due to self weight and external pressure occurred the analytical results are shown in fig 8 the critical buckling mode occurred at 18 barg and buckling occurred at the edge of the vertical plate with the largest stress distribution in the static analysis however in the critical buckling mode buckling is expected to have no effect during normal operation because it has a pressure 3 times higher the design vapor pressure fig 9 a shows the heat distribution in the ppv due to the lng loading and it was confirmed that the external heat is blocked due to the effect of the insulation when the temperature distribution in the ppv is the same as that in fig 9 a the analysis was conducted with increasing pressure to 6 barg which is the design vapor pressure the result is shown in fig 9 b the stress due to pure heat had a maximum value of 45 mpa and when the thermal load and the design vapor pressure are simultaneously applied it is confirmed that the structure is safe because stress below 345 mpa is generated in the case of the overall thermal deformation the contraction expansion due to the pure heat was large in the part where the temperature difference was large but when the design vapor pressure was additionally applied the influence of the heat induced deformation was reduced because the effect of internal pressure was large the maximum deformation amount was 26 5 mm as shown in fig 9 c and the deformation was less than 0 08 of the total length of ppv fatigue analysis was performed on the area where the ppv structure shell and stiffener were welded due to repeated loading unloading fatigue analysis consists of analysis of high cycle fatigue damage caused by internal pressure change due to the movement of ship and low cycle fatigue damage due to loading unloading of liquid cargo we confirmed whether each cumulative fatigue damage value was less than 1 or 0 5 and satisfied the criterion for fatigue high cycle fatigue damage was analyzed and the cumulative fatigue damage value was found to be much smaller than 1 and it was confirmed that high cycle fatigue was satisfied when including low cycle fatigue damage analysis which added the fatigue damage value by loading and unloading this value was found to be less than 0 5 and it was confirmed that the criterion was satisfied for fatigue as a whole the fracture analysis was performed for the critical location due to high dynamic stress fatigue crack propagation analysis was performed on the part connecting the tank shell to the stiffener and fig 10 shows the result if the initial crack depth is 2 mm the maximum crack size reaches 2 004 mm and the maximum crack height reaches 5 015 mm for 5 mm even if the crack progresses during the design life of 25 years 6 conclusions in this paper we propose a plate stiffened type prismatic pressure vessel with higher volume efficiency and analyze the code that the proposed pressure vessel should satisfy to be used as a fuel tank in a ship the asme and igc igf codes were analyzed to obtain the design conditions the igc igf code has been proposed to conduct the design and analysis as it uses more conservative conditions than those of the asme code the igc igf code has proposed a design procedure for a novel concept cargo fuel containment system which has an unusual shape using this we conducted the pressure loading ultimate strength dynamic acceleration buckling thermal and fatigue analyses of the plate stiffened type prismatic pressure vessel in accordance with the igc igf code according to the analysis results of the design pressure it was confirmed that the pressure vessel is below the allowable stress in the overall stress distribution and that it is safe in operation it was also confirmed that the pressure vessel does not face any problems when handling a test pressure that is 1 5 times the design pressure which is the experimental condition when the actual design and manufacture are performed furthermore ultimate strength analysis showed that even at pressures greater than 4 times the design pressure the entire pressure vessel can be operated without local failure in the dynamic acceleration buckling thermal and fatigue analyses the results were found to satisfy the igc igf code and it was confirmed that the plate stiffened type prismatic pressure vessel a novel shaped pressure fuel tank could be used in lng fueled ships author contribution section younseok choi

2019 unlike conventional fuels natural gas has a boiling point of 163 c in the gas phase it has a volume of more than 600 times than that of the liquid phase as a result its temperature should be lowered to a cryogenic temperature for storage and transportation bernatik et al 2011 kumar et al 2011 wang and notteboom 2014 thus the design and production of storage vessels remain the greatest challenge as the material selected for the storage vessel must withstand extremely low temperatures when the temperature of the storage tank rises while the ship is moving bog is generated and the pressure inside the storage tank is increased as a rule it is not possible to discharge the bog thus the storage tank must be able to withstand the increase in pressure due to the bog or an additional system capable of handling the bog must be installed shin and lee 2009 kwak et al 2018 tu et al 2019 the lng storage tanks onboard vessels are defined in the igc code imo 2014 type a b c membrane tanks are used type c tanks currently use cylinder type tanks as they have a low volume efficiency they are rarely used except in small sized gas carriers however as the design vapor pressure is higher than that of other types of tanks generally type c tanks are used as the fuel tank in lng fueled ships because they can withstand bog harperscheidt 2011 tu et al 2019 when using a type c lng storage tank there are issues with volume efficiency and cost due to dead space fricke and bronsart 2012 which need to be solved technically wang and notteboom 2014 chryssakis et al 2015 several studies have been conducted with the aim to increase the volume efficiency of storage tank studies on circular shape cylinder like bi lobe tanks with two overlapping cylinders senjanović et al 2005 multi lobe tanks using cellular structures bergan and madsen 2006 and cubic shaped pressure vessels with 12 cylinders rammo et al 2011 have been performed in addition various studies have been conducted on non circular shaped tanks like non circular pressure vessels at 20 psig starczewski 1981 non circular vessels for waste storage at 3 barg rezvani et al 1993 rectangular pressure vessels using external reinforcement zeng et al 1987 a new type of prismatic pressure vessel capable of withstanding high pressures using internal structures chang and bergan 2012 fuel storage tanks that can be used in lng filled ships using x beam type supports ahn 2012 ahn et al 2017 a non stiffened prismatic pressure vessel lee et al 2017 and a prismatic pressure vessel using a plate stiffened structure choi et al 2018 in this study we performed strength assessment for a plate stiffened prismatic pressure vessel which is a new type of pressure vessel in particular asme and igc igf codes were followed to ensure that these vessels can be used as fuel tanks for lng fueled ships the asme igc igf codes were analyzed and the design sequence for fuel tanks on board the ship is listed in section 2 section 3 describes the design principles of the new type of plate stiffened prismatic pressure vessel and section 4 presents the design and analysis of the fuel tank in a crude oil tanker based on the information provided in sections 2 and 3 the results of various finite element analyses are examined and discussed in section 5 and the conclusions are described in section 6 2 design regulation and procedure for ship application this paper describes the design of a prismatic pressure vessel using a new type of stiffened plate structure prismatic pressure vessels can withstand internal pressures of more than 0 2 barg so they can be viewed as type c in the igc igf code imo 2014 2015 in this section we explore the design criteria for designing a type c equivalent tank with a novel shape as a fuel tank for an lng fueled ship in addition we have summarized the parts that need to be applied when reflecting on the design abs abs 2017 dnvgl dnvgl 2016a 2016b and lloyd s lr 2016 2018 classification society have specified the rules for lng fueled ships or lng carriers and these rules must be met in order to certify the ship the rules covered by the classification are the igc code for lng carriers imo 2014 and igf code for lng fueled ships imo 2015 fuel tanks that can be used in lng fueled ships are covered in the igc igf code and generally type c tanks are used harperscheidt 2011 tu et al 2019 according to the united states coast guard when using type c independent tanks in gas fuel storage it is necessary to satisfy the asme boiler and pressure vessel code as well as the igc igf code uscg 2012 2017 therefore in order to use the type c tanks in all regions they should be designed according to the asme and igc igf codes methods for designing pressure tanks are listed in the asme boiler and pressure vessel code section viii a prismatic pressure vessel with a stiffened plate structure is a new type of pressure tank design it cannot be designed with division 1 and 3 as it is not a high pressure tank with a pressure higher than 70 mpa division 2 consists of a pressure tank for on board transport and a section for a pressure tank that does not have a round shape therefore in order to design this pressure tank the parts shown in division 2 should be used asme 2010a for the dba several conditions must be analyzed design loads consist of internal external pressure dead load of the components piping loads such as pressure thrust and wind thermal wave action loads this complex load is applied in the analysis and the acceptance criterion is judged the igc igf code describes the tank design method and the conditions to be met for the cargo containment system to load lng or the fuel containment system to use lng as fuel cargo tank installation ship arrangements cargo fuel containment system material and design conditions are presented for each type of tank in the igc igf code a prismatic pressure vessel with a stiffened plate structure does not belong to general type a b c or membrane type pressure vessels for the cargo fuel containment system with novel configuration igc part f and igf part a 1 annex are proposed as standard imo 2014 2015 table 1 shows the load conditions for the design in asme and igc igf codes when comparing the two codes it can be confirmed that there are some differences between the names and the degree of segmentation but they have almost the same conditions the asme and igc igf codes differ significantly with respect to obtaining the design pressure which consists of the vapor pressure and liquid pressure by liquid static head for the asme code process simulation is used to calculate the vapor pressure in contrast the vapor pressure in the igc igf code is calculated using the shape based equation for the static head part the asme code only calculates the static head but in the igc igf code storage tanks are installed on the ship thus it contains an additional dynamic load part asme 2010a imo 2014 2015 table 1 shows that the igc igf code is slightly more conservative than the asme code in terms of the test pressure analysis and acceptance criteria material selection for storage tanks is important for loading lng the asme code provides many materials that can be used at cryogenic temperatures asme 2010b astm 1996 1999 the igc igf codes limit the materials that can be used for fuel containment or piping systems among these materials imo 2014 2015 as shown in table 1 the asme code has a safety factor of 2 4 and that of the igc igf code varies from 2 3 to 2 5 depending on various factors igc 6 4 igf 7 4 3 design concept and principles of a prismatic pressure vessel with stiffened plate structures the demand for natural gas is increasing as natural gas is spotlighted as an environmentally friendly fuel however as the volume occupied by the natural gas in its gas phase is 600 times the volume in its liquid state it is usually liquefied and transported in the form of lng bernatik et al 2011 kumar et al 2011 wang and notteboom 2014 there are two ways to store lng increasing the pressure or lowering the temperature in the case of lowering the temperature the temperature must be continuously kept very low up to the lng vaporization point of 163 c in this case cryogenic storage tanks and regasification equipment are required if the temperature rises during transportation problems such as increase in volume and bog may occur in addition in order to use lng as fuel temperature and pressure conditions have to be adjusted to ensure that the engine can be used therefore when using lng as a fuel in general the fuel is stored using a type c tank according to the igc code fig 1 shows a commonly used type c tank a typical pressure vessel is a cylinder and the maximum volumetric efficiency is about 0 785 when it is used the volumetric efficiency of a sphere type pressure vessel is about 0 52 volumetric efficiency is an important factor in storage tank design to improve this new types of pressure vessels such as bi lobe and tri lobe which are made by stacking several cylinders have been designed and manufactured these include bi lobe tanks with two overlapping cylinders senjanović et al 2005 multi lobe tanks using cellular structures bergan and madsen 2006 and cubic shaped pressure vessels with 12 cylinders rammo et al 2011 in the case of the bi lobe type pressure vessel the volumetric efficiency is 0 84 which is different from that of the membrane or type b prismatic tank 0 95 0 98 in addition many studies have been conducted on pressure tanks with non circular shapes like non circular pressure vessel at 20 psig starczewski 1981 non circular vessel for waste storage at 3 barg rezvani et al 1993 rectangular pressure vessel using external reinforcement zeng et al 1987 prismatic pressure vessel with internal structures chang and bergan 2012 ahn 2012 choi 2016 x beam type supports prismatic pressure vessel ahn 2012 ahn et al 2017 a non stiffened prismatic pressure vessel lee et al 2017 and a prismatic pressure vessel with plate stiffened structure choi et al 2018 when considering a fuel tank for lng the fuel tank can be installed on deck or under deck as shown in fig 1 in case of using the lower part of the deck like on a tanker an on deck type fuel tank is mainly used the under deck type fuel tank is used when there is only a small space on the deck by using the upper part of the deck like on a container ship if an on deck type fuel tank is used there is no reduction in cargo capacity but the size of the tank is limited as the visibility needs to be considered in the case of the under deck type the cargo capacity is reduced therefore when using lng as a fuel it was found that the dimensions of the fuel tank is a very important factor in the design of both the on deck and the under deck type of fuel tanks in particular when used in container ships an annual financial loss occurs due to the volume of the fuel tank therefore the volumetric efficiency of the tank is directly related to economics and remains a challenge cylindrical and prismatic pressure vessels can be installed on deck or under deck when used as fuel tanks assuming 4261 m3 of lng ahn et al 2017 as fuel for aframax tanker operation in the case of the on deck installation the occupied area and the side area of the prismatic fuel tank were approximately twice that of the cylindrical one if we assume the same amount of lng as fuel for a container ship the fuel tank is installed in under deck in this case the cylindrical tank occupied 1 4 times more volume than the prismatic one when considering the volume of the fuel tank as the container teu assuming 5 round trips per year and an income of 750 teu per transfer we can see a financial loss of about 228 000 occurring annually in addition cylinder pressure vessels use several pressure vessels instead of one large pressure vessel such as prismatic pressure vessels due to low volumetric efficiency and height constraints this increases the number of instruments and piping required to accommodate the pressure vessels being added therefore if a prismatic pressure vessel is used instead of the conventional cylindrical pressure vessel an economic advantage may be achieved ahn et al 2017 a plate stiffened prismatic pressure vessel is a type of pressure tank which is composed of a parallel plate a vertical plate and an inter stiffener to withstand pressure plate stiffened cells are repeated to form a whole lattice pressure vessel when the desired size is changed the size of the plate stiffened cell or the number of repetition times can be expanded fig 2 shows the configuration of a plate stiffened prismatic pressure vessel it is possible to maximize the volume efficiency by deforming the cylinder shape to the rectangular shape ahn 2012 ahn et al 2017 choi 2016 lee et al 2017 choi et al 2018 the prismatic pressure vessel consists of three parts a shell structure capable of storing the whole fluid a plate stiffener as a load carrying structure capable of withstanding tensile load in the height direction and a shell stiffener reinforcing a shell structure the plate stiffener has an open structure to ensure that the fluid can move freely and the shape is reinforced slightly to withstand the up and down or right and left shell structures only in the open structure near the corner the inner stiffener helps the external shell to withstand internal pressure the parallel and vertical plates endure the buckling stress caused by tensile stress of the outer shell due to internal pressure and self weight of the external shell and pressure vessel the external shell is designed to withstand the internal pressure by using a plate and the plate thickness can be obtained through force equilibrium fig 2 shows the force equilibrium between the parallel plate and the vertical plate when the parallel plate or vertical plate has n x pieces in the x direction and n y pieces in the y direction if the plate thickness is t p p the force equilibrium is as follows 1 a a t p p n y b t p p n x if a constant pressure p acts on the outer shell the tensile stress is given by eq 2 if a b the thickness of the plate can be obtained from eq 3 2 σ a p a b 3 t p p p a σ a n x n y 4 case study aframax lng fueled tanker this section describes a case where a plate stiffened prismatic pressure vessel ppv is used as a fuel tank in an aframax lng fueled tanker fig 3 shows the use of a ppv as a fuel tank in an aframax lng fueled tanker the ppv is composed of a load carrying parallel plate vertical plate and stiffeners the shell thickness is determined to withstand the overall load and it is composed of insulation to prevent temperature increase the target tanker has a length of 234 m breadth of 42 m depth of 21 m and draft of 15 m and when it sails at a speed of 12 knots 4261 m3 lng is required for 30 days of sailing ahn et al 2017 in order to load this amount of lng the dimensions of the fuel tank are required to be l 15 m b 33 m and h 9 m the design vapor pressure is set at 6 barg based on the discussion in section 2 and the hydrostatic test pressure is required to be 9 barg which is 1 5 times the design vapor pressure according to the asme code to satisfy this requirement the shell thickness of ppv was 30 mm the thickness of vertical horizontal plate was 45 mm and the thickness of stiffener was 45 mm the material of the ppv was 9 nickel steel which can be used at cryogenic temperatures and the mechanical properties are shown in table 2 this material was used for design and analysis based on the design procedure structure assessment was performed based on section 2 the following tasks were undertaken design vapor pressure test pressure condition analysis ultimate strength analysis dynamic acceleration analysis buckling analysis thermal analysis fatigue analysis crack propagation analysis the finite element analysis was performed using abaqus cae 6 12 a commercial program and was designed based on a 3d shell the mesh uses s8r an eight node shell element for structural analysis and s8rt an eight node coupled temperature displacement element for thermal analysis the basic mesh size was set to a 100 mm based on the dnvgl guidelines for finite element analysis a minimum of three elements between the elementary lengths and a minimum of three longitudinal elements dnvgl 2015 in the asme code and igc igf code the stress is divided into primary and secondary stresses the stress should be designed to have low value compared with design allowable strength in table 1 primary stress is divided into membrane stress and bending stress obtain the membrane stress and bending stress values generated by the forces and moments acting on the pressure tank and check whether it is within the allowable strength of the material shown in table 2 based on the results from the structural analysis using the basic shell model the sum of the membrane stress and the bending stress is expressed and the bending stress which is the difference between the top and bottom of the shell results are expressed in sneg and spos in abaqus is eliminated membrane stress was also determined to be within the allowable strength the basic static analysis was conducted by considering the self weight due to internal pressure and gravity and the results were confirmed to be within the allowable strength of the material the basic design vapor pressure condition and the hydrostatic pressure condition were analyzed in each analysis the fluid was set as lng and water the ultimate strength analysis determined the extent to which the designed ppv could withstand pressure loads and analyzed the weak points under specific load conditions to perform this analysis the curve values of 9 nickel steel were entered using the stress strain curve formulas provided in asme code section viii division 2 asme 2010a when the aframax tanker is operating dynamic motion of the ship is caused by waves the same motion is generated in the lng fuel tank installed onboard and dynamic analysis of the acceleration condition in three axial directions should be performed in order to consider safety fig 4 shows the manner in which acceleration works in the ppv on the ship in the igc igf code the accelerations in the vertical and horizontal directions can be calculated using eqs 4 5 and 6 the acceleration load in the draught condition was calculated by the following equation and the results are shown in table 3 imo 2014 2015 using these calculated results the acceleration load caused by ship motion is analyzed 4 longitudinal a x a 0 0 06 a 2 0 25 a 5

structure using a plate these internal structures have columnar shapes under compression load if the compression member is thin buckling analysis should be performed because the entire structure may be damaged due to lateral deflection the buckling analysis of the entire structure provided the critical buckling stress at which buckling failure occurred lng fueled tanks are loaded with lng at 163 c which causes temperature imbalance throughout the pressure tank due to the outside high temperature this causes thermal stresses in the whole structure which may hamper the stability of the structure in this analysis the temperature distribution and thermal analysis when loading lng were used to determine the stress distribution of the pressure tank structure in the case of the lng tank an insulation layer is installed to reduce the temperature difference in this analysis the insulation is assumed to be made of commonly used polyurethane foam puf and temperature distribution and stress analysis are conducted with 60 filling ratio under various loading conditions the initial temperature was assumed to be 163 c for lng 100 c for lng vapor and 45 c for outside air in the cases of many ppvs the stiffener and plate are welded to each other therefore these ppvs are expected to be vulnerable to fatigue thus fatigue and crack propagation analysis were conducted in this study fatigue strength was determined using the igc igf code and classification rule imo 2014 2015 abs 2017 to obtain the fatigue strength we make the following assumptions abs 2017 a linear cumulative damage model has been used in connection with the s n data cyclic stresses due to wave induced loads have been used the target design life of the vessel is taken at 25 years 5 results and discussion the results of the structural analysis were analyzed based on the asme and igc igf codes as mentioned in section 2 the general membrane stress was 230 mpa the bending stress was 345 mpa and the secondary stress was 690 mpa for 9 nickel steel which is the main constituent material of the lng fuel tank we confirmed that the results of the overall analyses satisfied the allowable stress criteria shown in table 1 fig 5 a shows the result when the load is 6 barg in the prismatic pressure vessel the shell structure was inflated by the internal pressure and displacement occurred in the overall shell structure the equivalent von mises stress value was found to be within the allowable stress and the largest stress distribution was observed in the open structure where the vertical horizontal plate and the shell were joined in the stiffener structure it is confirmed that the stress applied to the shell structure is shared as shown in the analysis results when the internal pressure is applied when the pressure was applied to the shell structure it was confirmed that high stress occurred at the edge portion where the plate was joined a higher stress distribution was observed on the longer sides of the ppv fig 5 b shows the result when the load is a test pressure of 9 barg which is 1 5 times the design vapor pressure of 6 barg the overall stress distribution tendency was the same as that in the normal design condition shown in fig 5 a but it was confirmed that the stress value increased due to the increase of the internal pressure as a whole and of the hydrostatic pressure due to the fluid conversion from lng to water overall the stress was within the allowable stress furthermore the secondary parts were found to satisfy the criteria through this analysis it was confirmed that the designed ppv was safe even under the test pressure condition fig 6 a shows the ultimate strength analysis results of the pressure vessel with increasing internal pressure up to the design vapor pressure when the pressure exceeds the design vapor pressure of 6 barg the stress strain curve of the material passes through the plastic region beyond the elastic region and plastic deformation occurs at the portion where stress concentration occurs fig 6 b shows the hot spot area and fig 6 c shows the change in stress with increasing pressure up to 25 barg at a pressure of 21 barg or more the stress of the plate stiffener exceeded the yielding strength of 9 nickel steel at 585 mpa and yielding began to occur in the rest of the area except this hot spot area the structure was confirmed to be safe even under 4 times higher pressure than the design vapor pressure of 6 barg next we verified that the pressure vessel meets the acceleration criterion under the motion of the ship the analysis was performed using the three acceleration conditions calculated in the previous section the results are as follows fig 7 a shows the stress distribution in the pressure vessel when transverse acceleration is applied this condition has the largest acceleration value among the three acceleration conditions therefore it was expected to have the largest stress distribution when the acceleration is applied in the x direction an additional fluid hydrostatic pressure is generated in the same direction in the inner fluid and it is confirmed that the stress distributions in the positive and negative directions are different the stress distribution was slightly larger in the acceleration direction and the largest stress occurred at the edge of the vertical plate the overall stress was confirmed to be within the allowable stress the stress was high at some secondary stresses but was smaller than 690 mpa which is the standard value thus it was confirmed that the criteria are met even in the transverse acceleration condition fig 7 b shows the result of longitudinal acceleration analysis the acceleration in the longitudinal direction is expected to have the smallest stress distribution in the dynamic analysis because it is smaller than that in the other directions it was confirmed to be within the allowable stress which is the standard in the whole part fig 7 c shows the result when acceleration is applied in the vertical direction it is expected to have a moderately higher stress distribution because it has a smaller value than the acceleration in the transverse direction but a larger value than that in the longitudinal direction as a result of the analysis it was confirmed that the total area has a smaller value than the standard as in the longitudinal direction through the dynamic analysis it was confirmed that the pressure vessel satisfies the criteria sufficiently even under the acceleration condition next the critical buckling mode was obtained by conducting a buckling analysis to determine whether bending as a result of deflection due to self weight and external pressure occurred the analytical results are shown in fig 8 the critical buckling mode occurred at 18 barg and buckling occurred at the edge of the vertical plate with the largest stress distribution in the static analysis however in the critical buckling mode buckling is expected to have no effect during normal operation because it has a pressure 3 times higher the design vapor pressure fig 9 a shows the heat distribution in the ppv due to the lng loading and it was confirmed that the external heat is blocked due to the effect of the insulation when the temperature distribution in the ppv is the same as that in fig 9 a the analysis was conducted with increasing pressure to 6 barg which is the design vapor pressure the result is shown in fig 9 b the stress due to pure heat had a maximum value of 45 mpa and when the thermal load and the design vapor pressure are simultaneously applied it is confirmed that the structure is safe because stress below 345 mpa is generated in the case of the overall thermal deformation the contraction expansion due to the pure heat was large in the part where the temperature difference was large but when the design vapor pressure was additionally applied the influence of the heat induced deformation was reduced because the effect of internal pressure was large the maximum deformation amount was 26 5 mm as shown in fig 9 c and the deformation was less than 0 08 of the total length of ppv fatigue analysis was performed on the area where the ppv structure shell and stiffener were welded due to repeated loading unloading fatigue analysis consists of analysis of high cycle fatigue damage caused by internal pressure change due to the movement of ship and low cycle fatigue damage due to loading unloading of liquid cargo we confirmed whether each cumulative fatigue damage value was less than 1 or 0 5 and satisfied the criterion for fatigue high cycle fatigue damage was analyzed and the cumulative fatigue damage value was found to be much smaller than 1 and it was confirmed that high cycle fatigue was satisfied when including low cycle fatigue damage analysis which added the fatigue damage value by loading and unloading this value was found to be less than 0 5 and it was confirmed that the criterion was satisfied for fatigue as a whole the fracture analysis was performed for the critical location due to high dynamic stress fatigue crack propagation analysis was performed on the part connecting the tank shell to the stiffener and fig 10 shows the result if the initial crack depth is 2 mm the maximum crack size reaches 2 004 mm and the maximum crack height reaches 5 015 mm for 5 mm even if the crack progresses during the design life of 25 years 6 conclusions in this paper we propose a plate stiffened type prismatic pressure vessel with higher volume efficiency and analyze the code that the proposed pressure vessel should satisfy to be used as a fuel tank in a ship the asme and igc igf codes were analyzed to obtain the design conditions the igc igf code has been proposed to conduct the design and analysis as it uses more conservative conditions than those of the asme code the igc igf code has proposed a design procedure for a novel concept cargo fuel containment system which has an unusual shape using this we conducted the pressure loading ultimate strength dynamic acceleration buckling thermal and fatigue analyses of the plate stiffened type prismatic pressure vessel in accordance with the igc igf code according to the analysis results of the design pressure it was confirmed that the pressure vessel is below the allowable stress in the overall stress distribution and that it is safe in operation it was also confirmed that the pressure vessel does not face any problems when handling a test pressure that is 1 5 times the design pressure which is the experimental condition when the actual design and manufacture are performed furthermore ultimate strength analysis showed that even at pressures greater than 4 times the design pressure the entire pressure vessel can be operated without local failure in the dynamic acceleration buckling thermal and fatigue analyses the results were found to satisfy the igc igf code and it was confirmed that the plate stiffened type prismatic pressure vessel a novel shaped pressure fuel tank could be used in lng fueled ships author contribution section younseok choi

22191,results from a spectral wave model of the persian gulf for a long term period 32 year are used to describe and quantify the seasonal wave climate and trends the model is forced by a wind reanalysis dataset and validated against a set of field measurements and altimeter data from various satellite missions the results revealed the existence of a more energetic wave higher hm0 and larger tp zone located at the southern regions of the gulf that is linked to the predominant and stronger north westerly winds the wave heights and periods are intensified in winter hm0 2 7m and tp 8s for the 99th percentile followed by spring the waves conditions are milder in autumn the analysis of wave climate trends throughout the region clearly show an overall slight positive trend 0 0 2 year in mean hm0 which is associated with long term positive trends in wind speed there is generally a positive trend in the mean significant wave height during winter 0 0 8 year spring 0 0 6 year and autumn 0 1 0 year and negative during summer 0 0 8 year the results indicate that the more statistically significant results are at the areas with larger magnitude of trends keywords persian gulf wave modelling hindcast swan satellite altimeter wave climate trends 1 introduction the persian gulf hereafter referred to as the gulf is a strategically important region due to its significant global oil and gas reserves it includes the largest offshore oil and gas fields in the world the region is also recognized for some iconic coastal and marine infrastructure projects such as palm jumeirah and jebel ali port in dubai uae knowledge of the sea state is of critical relevance for navigation port and terminal operability coastal processes shoreline management and design of coastal and marine structures it is thus important to accurately estimate long term wave conditions in order to improve the understanding of the regional wave climate although there are measurements of wave conditions throughout the gulf these are typically limited to scattered locations and periods not exceeding a few months these measurements are generally carried out in support of design studies for marine infrastructure projects and therefore not available furthermore the data collected rarely capture significant storm events usually less than the 1 year average return interval event some authorities have established monitoring programs with measurements at several stations but the data only spans for periods which are insufficient for a detailed gulf wide long term wave climate analysis satellite data for the gulf is relatively sparse spatially and temporarily to obtain a reliable historical wave climate given the lack of long term measurements limited number of existing measuring locations and sparse altimeter data the most widely acceptable way to obtain information is through numerical modelling forced with meteorological reanalysis e g stopa et al 2016a several studies have been developed to date to estimate the wave climate for the gulf neelamani et al 2007 applied the wam the wamdi group 1988 komen et al 1994 model to develop a 12 year hindcast data set in order to obtain extreme wave conditions along the coast of kuwait liao and kaihatu 2016 developed a 5 year hindcast using the swan simulating waves nearshore booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 wave model to understand the effects of bathymetrically controlled processes such as depth induced breaking and refraction on the seasonal characteristics of the wave climate in the gulf with particular focus on the coastal areas of qatar in moeini et al 2010 swan was implemented to undertake an extreme value analysis off the northern coast of the gulf an analysis of two types of wind forcing and their influence on the wave model results was then carried out the swan wave model was also applied by kamranzad et al 2013 to assess the wave energy variation in the gulf in this work the model was run for a period of 25 years to evaluate seasonal and decadal variations in wave energy throughout the gulf more recently kamranzad 2018 applied swan to assess the wind and wave spatial temporal variability in the gulf for a 31 year period the results showed that the highest values occur mainly in the middle part of the domain especially during winter they found that the seasonal variation of the wind and wave climate is mostly affected by the shamal arabic for north wind phenomenon their results also indicate that winter and summer time shamal winds affect the middle and north western parts of the gulf respectively the models in the above mentioned studies were only validated based on a maximum of two measurement locations and periods not exceeding 2 months it is also important to highlight that no satellite altimeter data have been used for validation or assessment of model performance in any of the above mentioned studies for the gulf validation of spectral wave models using satellite altimeter data is widely used for studies worldwide such as cox and swail 2001 li et al 2016 perez et al 2017 shanas et al 2017 and stopa 2018 other studies focusing on wave climate characterization for closed or semi enclosed basins were carried out by shanas et al 2017 for the red sea amirinia et al 2017 bruneau and toumi 2016 and kamranzad et al 2016 for the caspian sea akpinar et al 2016 and akpinar and komurcu 2012 for the black sea björkvist et al 2018 and soomere and räämet 2014 for the baltic sea and sebastian et al 2014 for galveston bay texas usa no detailed wave climate trend study is available for the gulf regionally shanas et al 2017 have studied the wind wave climate variability in the red sea they found that in general the wave height trends for summer are negative and for winter are positive in the range of 1 cm year at a global scale cox and swail 2001 developed a 40 year 1958 1997 wave simulation using the national centers for environmental prediction ncep national center for atmospheric research reanalysis nra surface wind fields a global trend analysis showed statistically significant areas of both increasing and decreasing winds and waves the mean significant wave height changes are in the range of 1m 2 5 cm year sterl and caires 2005 produced a global wave hindcast using the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era 40 reanalysis trends during the period 1971 to 2000 were calculated and the results show that the trends vary per calendar month and from location to location with some regions characterized by negative trends and others by positive trends the trends in the 90 and 99 quantiles show the same spatial patterns as those in the mean but they have higher slopes maximum trends in the mean significant wave height are of about 4 cm year and in the 99 quantiles of about 7 cm year young et al 2011 has carried out a study based on a 23 year database of satellite data to estimate wind speed and wave height trends the results of the study indicate that there is a global trend of increasing values and this rate is greater for extreme events as compared to the mean condition the purpose of this study is to develop a validated gulf wave model in order to generate an accurate long term 30 years wave climate database from which climate analysis and trends can be determined the term trend in this paper relates to the variability over the 32 year period this variability can potentially be part of a longer term cycle which is not the focus of this study the paper is divided into 4 sections following the introduction in section 1 section 2 presents the study area swan numerical model setup and validation the results and discussion of the wave climate in the gulf and historical trends are described in section 3 conclusions of the study are presented in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the gulf is a semi enclosed basin bordered by oman united arab emirates saudi arabia qatar bahrain kuwait iraq and iran fig 1 it has a length and width along and across the north west south east orientation of approximately 800 km by 250 km respectively and is located between longitudes 47 5 e and 57 0 e and latitudes 23 5 n and 30 5 n it is connected to the indian ocean through the strait of hormuz and has an average and maximum water depth of 35m and 90m respectively it covers an area of approximately 250 000 m2 the climate in the gulf region is classified as arid resulting in an excess of evaporation over precipitation plus river runoff the relatively high evaporation combined with restricted exchange with the open ocean leads to formation of a saline dense water mass gulf deep water and a reverse estuary circulation through the strait of hormuz swift and bower 2003 the climate can be divided into two main seasons with two transition periods summer season jun sep fall transition oct nov winter season dec mar and spring transition apr may walters 1990 the ambient wind climate in the region is characterized by strong north westerly wind events referred to as shamals shamals produce the most widespread hazardous weather known in the region the summer shamal is caused by a steep pressure gradient between a low pressure system centred in north west india and a high pressure system over the eastern mediterranean with a ridge extending south east towards the gulf the summer shamal wind speeds typically are in the range of 7 to 13 m s 1 senafi and anis 2015 the winter shamal occurs mainly between november and march and is directly associated with mid latitude disturbances moving from west to east they are caused by the presence of a large pressure gradient that develops behind a cold front passage upper level subsidence and rapidly building high pressure over saudi arabia and iraq reinforces the low level north westerly winds during a shamal winds typically reach 15 20 m s 1 near the surface during the daytime a shamal occurs first in the north western part of the gulf and then spreads south east behind the advancing cold front thoppil and hogan 2010 2 2 model setup version 41 20ab of swan was applied in this study swan is a third generation phase averaged wind wave model based on the spectral action balance equation the model is capable of representing wave growth by wind wave dissipation by whitecapping and bottom friction refraction three and four wave non linear interactions and wave breaking the swan team 2018 the governing equation of swan in cartesian co ordinates is 1 n t c x n x c y n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s t o t σ where σ is the radian frequency as observed in a frame of reference moving with current velocity n is wave action density equal to energy density divided by relative frequency n e σ θ is wave propagation direction c is the wave action propagation velocities in x y σ θ space and stot is the non conservative source sink term expressed as wave energy density that represents all physical processes which generate dissipate or redistribute wave energy swan uses an implicit upwind scheme to propagate the wave action density which has the great advantage that the propagation time step is not limited by any numerical condition since the scheme is unconditionally stable in the geographic and spectral spaces the swan team 2018 the swan model was implemented for the geographical area 47 5 e to 57 0 e and 23 5 n to 30 5 n the model has a grid resolution of 0 05 in both directions corresponding to 191 by 141 grid points only islands larger than 0 05 by 0 05 were included as dry cells the bathymetric information was obtained from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco the gebco 2014 grid http www gebco net the model domain and bathymetry are presented in fig 2 the model was forced with 1 h time step climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr wind fields from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis dataset saha et al 2010 available from january 1979 to 2010 with a spatial resolution of 0 3 in both directions this data set has been used in a number of wave climate studies akpinar et al 2016 shanas et al 2017 stopa 2018 campos et al 2018 stopa et al 2016b chawla et al 2013 li et al 2016 mentaschi et al 2015 perez et al 2017 the model eastern boundary gulf of oman was considered closed with no energy input to the model domain from the indian ocean the wave energy significantly decays as the waves coming from the gulf of oman refract around the strait of hormuz and therefore the influence to the results will be negligible this approach was previously adopted in liao and kaihatu 2016 moeini et al 2010 kamranzad et al 2013 and kamranzad 2018 the model was implemented with 36 directions 10 bins and 31 frequencies logarithmically spaced from 0 05 hz to 1 hz at intervals of δf f 0 1 in spectral space the model was run in non stationary mode and the computational time step was set to 15 min the formulation of komen et al 1984 was adopted for the wave generation all remaining model parameters were kept as default the model was run at mean sea level and outputs were obtained for each computational grid point every 1h 2 3 model validation 2 3 1 field measurements from 26 february to 8 september 2009 a period of approximately 6 months with a gap of 1 week during april 2009 and 1 week during july 2009 a 600 khz rd instruments workhorse sentinel acoustic doppler current profiler adcp was deployed at approximately 17m water depth 15 km off the coast of dubai 55 0211 n 25 1834 e uae the adcp was mounted on a fixed tripod and placed in an upward facing position with the transducer 0 5m above the benthos cavalcante et al 2016 the adcp location is depicted in fig 1 the wave spectrum was calculated using the measured wave orbital velocity the frequency cut off was approximately 2s and the minimum measured wave height is 0 05m examples of details on performance of adcp measurements can be found in herbers et al 1991 and hoitink et al 2007 2 3 2 satellite altimeter the satellite altimeter data used in this study was obtained from the australian ocean data network aodn portal ribal and young 2018 this is a consistent quality controlled set of satellite wave data covering a period of 33 years 1985 2018 obtained from 13 altimeters geosat ers 1 topex ers 2 geosat follow on gfo jason 1 envisat jason 2 cryosat 2 hy 2a saral jason 3 and sentinel 3a only satellites that have data concurrent to the wind reanalysis 1979 2010 and data with quality control flag equals to 1 corresponding to good data were used in this study details of each satellite are provided in table 1 fig 3 presents all altimeter data within the gulf 2 3 3 model performance model results were extracted at the field measurement location fig 1 for the altimeter data points as these vary in space and time a routine was prepared to extract the nearest point in space and time from the model output grid model performance statistics were computed for the significant wave height hm0 and peak wave period tp parameters only for the field measurements the statistics include bias root mean square error rmse scatter index si and correlation coefficient r the statistics can be defined by the formulas 2 b i a s y x 3 r m s e i x i y i 2 n 4 s i r m s e x 5 r i x i x y i y i x i x 2 i y i y 2 where x and y represent the measured and modelled values respectively and n is the number of samples the adcp data was filtered using a 3 point running average and compared to the model results figs 4 and 5 the comparison of time series depicted in fig 4 shows good agreement between the model and data in terms of significant wave height and peak wave period for the period of measurements statistics are presented in table 2 the correlation coefficient is 0 85 for hm0 and 0 59 for tp the root mean square error is 0 22m for hm0 and 1 25s for tp the bias is 0 11m for hm0 and 0 17s for tp the scatter index is 0 47 for hm0 and 0 27 for tp and the slope is 1 07 for hm0 and 1 01 for tp the statistical analysis results for hm0 demonstrate the good performance of the model the results for tp are reasonable considering that this parameter has a larger variability the model derived significant wave heights are compared with the satellite altimeter data fig 6 satellite data from the older satellites geosat ers 1 and topex was excluded from the data set for comparison as some erroneous values were found in these observations additional altimeter data was excluded from the data set for comparison based on the following filters distance to the coast closer than 10 km water depth less than 20m and standard deviation of significant wave height greater than 1m density scatter plots for the satellite vs model results are depicted in fig 6 for each satellite and all data combined the scatter plots shows good agreement between the model and altimeter data for all satellites statistics are presented in table 3 the results show that the fit is reasonable with a small bias 2 cm for all satellites and 7 cm for each satellite the correlation coefficient root mean square error and scatter index are reasonably good it is expected that error statistics for the different sets of data field measurements from adcp and satellite altimeter are different due to the nature of the data field measurements are available for a single point for a period of 6 5 months whilst the satellite data spans over a period of more than 30 years and covers the entire gulf the current model setup shows a good compromise considering these factors 2 4 climate and trend analysis the 32 year period model results were analysed to provide a description of the overall and seasonal wave climate and trends within the gulf calculations were carried out at each grid point in order to present the spatial variability of the wave conditions the average conditions were obtained by averaging the wave parameters at each model grid point for the 32 year period the 90th and 99th percentiles were also calculated at each grid point for the entire simulation period seasonal values are computed using three month periods and were divided into december january february djf march april may mam june july august jja and september october november son corresponding to the northern hemisphere winter spring summer and autumn respectively a linear trend based on the least square method was applied to each model grid point to estimate historical trends of significant wave height the significance of the trends was analysed with the mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 this non parametric test of randomness against trend was previously used in other wave climate trend studies such as young et al 2011 and aydogan and ayat 2018 the mk test analyses data collected over time for consistently increasing or decreasing trends the test gives one of two options null hypothesis no monotonic trend in the series or alternative hypothesis there is a trend and it can be positive negative or null the variance obtained from the mk statistic is used to define the value for a specific significance level 3 results and discussion 3 1 wave climate fig 7 depicts the mean 90th p90 and 99th p99 percentiles of hm0 and tp over the entire gulf for the period 1979 2010 the results show that the higher mean significant wave height hm0 0 6m is at the gulf s deeper central area between 24 5 n and 28 5 n where storms from both north west and south east will have an influence the larger p90 hm0 1 5m waves cover a smaller area between 26 0 n and 27 0 n the region with larger p99 with hm0 above 2 4m is at the southern gulf between 25 0 n and 26 5 n which is in agreement with the predominant and stronger north westerly winds thoppil and hogan 2010 lower values are found at the northern gulf the wave heights also become smaller towards south east as the distance to the coast decreases likely due to a reduction in depths in the direction of the uae coastline the qatar peninsula causes a sheltering effect on the predominant north westerly wave conditions the leeside south of bahrain is also very protected and the wave conditions are mild the areas of largest wave periods 4s for the mean 6s for the p90 and 8s for the p99 are also found at the southern part of the gulf and the lower wave periods at the northern part seasonal maps with mean p90 and p99 are prepared for winter december january and february spring march april and may summer june july and august and autumn september october and november for hm0 and tp the seasonal wave climate is presented in fig 8 and fig 9 for hm0 and tp respectively the results show that the wave climate is more energetic during winter months djf hm0 0 6m and tp 4s for mean hm0 1 8m and tp 6s for p90 and hm0 2 7m and tp 8s for p99 followed by spring mam and summer jja the calmer season is autumn son hm0 0 3m and tp 4s for mean hm0 1 2m and tp 6s for p90 and hm0 2 1m and tp 7s for p99 the results also show that the most energetic area is in the southern region between 25 0 and 26 5 n during winter djf and spring mam seasons figs 8 and 9 this area shifts slightly northward towards the central region of the gulf between 25 5 n and 27 0 n during summer jja and autumn son this is likely due to the fact that the winter shamal is stronger at the central region whilst during the summer shamal the highest wind speeds are shifted to the northern area according to the results presented in kamranzad 2018 the highest mean hm0 are 0 85m 0 78m 0 69m and 0 56m for winter spring summer and autumn respectively these values are in agreement with the results presented by the work of kamranzad 2018 highest mean hm0 of 0 8m and 0 6m for winter and autumn respectively 3 2 wave climate trends the significant wave height trends over the 32 year simulation are presented in fig 10 the results show that there is a slight positive trend 0 0 2 year in mean hm0 over most of the gulf with smaller areas at the north and south with minor negative trends 0 0 2 the rate of increase in hm0 for p90 is of the same order but predominantly on the eastern side of the gulf along the kuwait saudi arabia bahrain qatar and western uae coasts a trend in hm0 of 0 to 0 2 year is observed for the p99 south of 27 0 n and negative above this latitude there is a larger negative trend with magnitude of 0 4 year at the north east corner of the gulf around 51 0 n 29 0 e the general increase in the mean hm0 is likely caused by an increase in wind speeds as presented in senafi and anis 2015 those authors indicate that the development of north westerly winds during shamal events between 1973 and 2012 showed an average increase in wind speed of 2 7 m s 1 the results presented here in this study are also consistent with the global trends young et al 2011 which shows that there is a slight increase in hm0 up to 0 25 year for the mean condition and this increase has a higher rate for more extreme conditions 0 4 year for p99 fig 11 presents the yearly average hm0 and trend line for the mean 90th and 99th percentile at points in the north central and south areas of the gulf refer to fig 1 for location map the results in table 4 show that there is a negative trend for mean 0 01 cm year p90 0 03 cm year and p99 0 17 cm year at the northern location at the central point the trend is positive for the mean 0 04 cm year and p99 0 18 cm year and negative for p90 0 07 cm year the results for the southern point show a negative trend for the mean 0 02 cm year and p90 0 12 cm year and positive for the more extreme conditions p99 0 26 cm year the wave climate seasonal trends are presented in fig 12 for winter and spring there is a general positive trend in the mean p90 and p99 hm0 with minor areas at the northern part of the gulf showing a negative trend an overall negative trend is observed for summer in spring there is a positive trend for the mean and p90 but there is a predominantly negative trend in p99 in winter the largest increase for the mean 0 6 0 8 year p90 0 4 0 6 year and p99 0 4 0 6 year is at the eastern side of the gulf between bahrain and qatar the area with positive mean and p90 trend 0 2 year occurs along the qatar bahrain and saudi arabia coastline the area of p99 trend above 0 2 year occurs at the gulf central region between 25 5 n and 27 n there is a small area at the north of the gulf above 29 5⁰n that shows a negative trend of 0 4 0 6 year for spring the increasing p99 hm0 trend shifts southwards towards the uae coast there is a general negative trend in hm0 for summer with values between 0 6 and 0 8 year for the mean and p90 and between 0 4 and 0 6 for p99 in summer for the p99 there is a positive trend 0 0 2 year along stretches of the iran coast the largest positive trends in the mean hm0 0 6 0 8 year occur in autumn between qatar and saudi arabia with a maximum of 0 8 1 0 year between bahrain and qatar the magnitude of the trend decreases in p90 for p99 the trend is generally negative with larger magnitudes 0 4 0 6 along the uae coastline in general the results show that for the simulation period the extreme conditions become more energetic during winter and spring and less during summer and autumn the mean conditions increased in winter spring and autumn and reduced intensity in summer it is suggested that the seasonal variation in the trends is caused by the variations in the regional wind climate the study of azorin molina et al 2018 indicates that the wind speed trend for the damman on the east coast of saudi arabia meteorological station is positive for the winter months and negative for summer months this is consistent with the results of this study where waves are becoming more energetic during winter and milder during summer the results in the present study are also in agreement with the findings of shanas et al 2017 for the neighbouring red sea where also a significant negative trend of hm0 was found for summer and positive for winter and spring trend significance at the model grid points for the mean 90th and 99th percentile for different confidence levels 50 75 90 and 95 are presented in fig 13 fig 13 shows that the areas where trends have larger magnitude positive or negative are quite significant over 90 confidence level fig 14 depicts the seasonal trend significance for the mean 90th and 99th percentile the results in figs 13 and 14 indicate that the more statistically significant results are at the areas where the larger trend magnitude occur this can be observed in the mean condition for autumn where most of the gulf is statistically significant at the 95 level the results for the p90 in spring where the trends have rates that are mainly smaller than 0 2 year are less statistically significant 4 conclusions a spectral wave model for the persian gulf was developed and validated based on field measurements and satellite altimeter data the results show that the model performs relatively well when compared to the field measurements and satellite altimeter data the validation against satellite altimeter data ensures that the model is performing well all over the gulf and not only at a specific area the model was run for a 32 year period 1979 2010 with cfsr wind forcing and the results analysed to provide an overall description of the wave climate it is expected that the results of this study are more accurate than previous works as the model resolution spatial and temporal is higher and the model has been validated for the entire gulf the main result found in this work is the shift in wave climate energy pattern during different seasons and throughout the gulf while the waves are more energetic during the winter season followed by spring they become milder in autumn the spatial variation in wave height hm0 confirms that the more energetic area is at the southern regions of the gulf compared to the overall area this study presents new insights into the wave climate trends in the gulf the mean hm0 shows a maximum positive trend of approximately 0 2 year throughout the study period and the larger positive rate for hm0 considering the more extreme waves p99 are at the southern end of the gulf maximum of approximately 0 2 year the mean and p90 hm0 show a maximum negative trend of 0 8 year during the summer season the maximum positive trend in mean hm0 is during autumn 0 8 1 0 year the wave height trends can be explained by the trends in wind speeds the results indicate that the more statistically significant results are at the areas where the larger trend magnitude occur the results of this study are essential for understanding and assessing potential future impacts of the wave climate on the offshore and

22191,results from a spectral wave model of the persian gulf for a long term period 32 year are used to describe and quantify the seasonal wave climate and trends the model is forced by a wind reanalysis dataset and validated against a set of field measurements and altimeter data from various satellite missions the results revealed the existence of a more energetic wave higher hm0 and larger tp zone located at the southern regions of the gulf that is linked to the predominant and stronger north westerly winds the wave heights and periods are intensified in winter hm0 2 7m and tp 8s for the 99th percentile followed by spring the waves conditions are milder in autumn the analysis of wave climate trends throughout the region clearly show an overall slight positive trend 0 0 2 year in mean hm0 which is associated with long term positive trends in wind speed there is generally a positive trend in the mean significant wave height during winter 0 0 8 year spring 0 0 6 year and autumn 0 1 0 year and negative during summer 0 0 8 year the results indicate that the more statistically significant results are at the areas with larger magnitude of trends keywords persian gulf wave modelling hindcast swan satellite altimeter wave climate trends 1 introduction the persian gulf hereafter referred to as the gulf is a strategically important region due to its significant global oil and gas reserves it includes the largest offshore oil and gas fields in the world the region is also recognized for some iconic coastal and marine infrastructure projects such as palm jumeirah and jebel ali port in dubai uae knowledge of the sea state is of critical relevance for navigation port and terminal operability coastal processes shoreline management and design of coastal and marine structures it is thus important to accurately estimate long term wave conditions in order to improve the understanding of the regional wave climate although there are measurements of wave conditions throughout the gulf these are typically limited to scattered locations and periods not exceeding a few months these measurements are generally carried out in support of design studies for marine infrastructure projects and therefore not available furthermore the data collected rarely capture significant storm events usually less than the 1 year average return interval event some authorities have established monitoring programs with measurements at several stations but the data only spans for periods which are insufficient for a detailed gulf wide long term wave climate analysis satellite data for the gulf is relatively sparse spatially and temporarily to obtain a reliable historical wave climate given the lack of long term measurements limited number of existing measuring locations and sparse altimeter data the most widely acceptable way to obtain information is through numerical modelling forced with meteorological reanalysis e g stopa et al 2016a several studies have been developed to date to estimate the wave climate for the gulf neelamani et al 2007 applied the wam the wamdi group 1988 komen et al 1994 model to develop a 12 year hindcast data set in order to obtain extreme wave conditions along the coast of kuwait liao and kaihatu 2016 developed a 5 year hindcast using the swan simulating waves nearshore booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 wave model to understand the effects of bathymetrically controlled processes such as depth induced breaking and refraction on the seasonal characteristics of the wave climate in the gulf with particular focus on the coastal areas of qatar in moeini et al 2010 swan was implemented to undertake an extreme value analysis off the northern coast of the gulf an analysis of two types of wind forcing and their influence on the wave model results was then carried out the swan wave model was also applied by kamranzad et al 2013 to assess the wave energy variation in the gulf in this work the model was run for a period of 25 years to evaluate seasonal and decadal variations in wave energy throughout the gulf more recently kamranzad 2018 applied swan to assess the wind and wave spatial temporal variability in the gulf for a 31 year period the results showed that the highest values occur mainly in the middle part of the domain especially during winter they found that the seasonal variation of the wind and wave climate is mostly affected by the shamal arabic for north wind phenomenon their results also indicate that winter and summer time shamal winds affect the middle and north western parts of the gulf respectively the models in the above mentioned studies were only validated based on a maximum of two measurement locations and periods not exceeding 2 months it is also important to highlight that no satellite altimeter data have been used for validation or assessment of model performance in any of the above mentioned studies for the gulf validation of spectral wave models using satellite altimeter data is widely used for studies worldwide such as cox and swail 2001 li et al 2016 perez et al 2017 shanas et al 2017 and stopa 2018 other studies focusing on wave climate characterization for closed or semi enclosed basins were carried out by shanas et al 2017 for the red sea amirinia et al 2017 bruneau and toumi 2016 and kamranzad et al 2016 for the caspian sea akpinar et al 2016 and akpinar and komurcu 2012 for the black sea björkvist et al 2018 and soomere and räämet 2014 for the baltic sea and sebastian et al 2014 for galveston bay texas usa no detailed wave climate trend study is available for the gulf regionally shanas et al 2017 have studied the wind wave climate variability in the red sea they found that in general the wave height trends for summer are negative and for winter are positive in the range of 1 cm year at a global scale cox and swail 2001 developed a 40 year 1958 1997 wave simulation using the national centers for environmental prediction ncep national center for atmospheric research reanalysis nra surface wind fields a global trend analysis showed statistically significant areas of both increasing and decreasing winds and waves the mean significant wave height changes are in the range of 1m 2 5 cm year sterl and caires 2005 produced a global wave hindcast using the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era 40 reanalysis trends during the period 1971 to 2000 were calculated and the results show that the trends vary per calendar month and from location to location with some regions characterized by negative trends and others by positive trends the trends in the 90 and 99 quantiles show the same spatial patterns as those in the mean but they have higher slopes maximum trends in the mean significant wave height are of about 4 cm year and in the 99 quantiles of about 7 cm year young et al 2011 has carried out a study based on a 23 year database of satellite data to estimate wind speed and wave height trends the results of the study indicate that there is a global trend of increasing values and this rate is greater for extreme events as compared to the mean condition the purpose of this study is to develop a validated gulf wave model in order to generate an accurate long term 30 years wave climate database from which climate analysis and trends can be determined the term trend in this paper relates to the variability over the 32 year period this variability can potentially be part of a longer term cycle which is not the focus of this study the paper is divided into 4 sections following the introduction in section 1 section 2 presents the study area swan numerical model setup and validation the results and discussion of the wave climate in the gulf and historical trends are described in section 3

approximately 250 000 m2 the climate in the gulf region is classified as arid resulting in an excess of evaporation over precipitation plus river runoff the relatively high evaporation combined with restricted exchange with the open ocean leads to formation of a saline dense water mass gulf deep water and a reverse estuary circulation through the strait of hormuz swift and bower 2003 the climate can be divided into two main seasons with two transition periods summer season jun sep fall transition oct nov winter season dec mar and spring transition apr may walters 1990 the ambient wind climate in the region is characterized by strong north westerly wind events referred to as shamals shamals produce the most widespread hazardous weather known in the region the summer shamal is caused by a steep pressure gradient between a low pressure system centred in north west india and a high pressure system over the eastern mediterranean with a ridge extending south east towards the gulf the summer shamal wind speeds typically are in the range of 7 to 13 m s 1 senafi and anis 2015 the winter shamal occurs mainly between november and march and is directly associated with mid latitude disturbances moving from west to east they are caused by the presence of a large pressure gradient that develops behind a cold front passage upper level subsidence and rapidly building high pressure over saudi arabia and iraq reinforces the low level north westerly winds during a shamal winds typically reach 15 20 m s 1 near the surface during the daytime a shamal occurs first in the north western part of the gulf and then spreads south east behind the advancing cold front thoppil and hogan 2010 2 2 model setup version 41 20ab of swan was applied in this study swan is a third generation

wave energy significantly decays as the waves coming from the gulf of oman refract around the strait of hormuz and therefore the influence to the results will be negligible this approach was previously adopted in liao and kaihatu 2016 moeini et al 2010 kamranzad et al 2013 and kamranzad 2018 the model was implemented with 36 directions 10 bins and 31 frequencies logarithmically spaced from 0 05 hz to 1 hz at intervals of δf f 0 1 in spectral space the model was run in non stationary mode and the computational time step was set to 15 min the formulation of komen et al 1984 was adopted for the wave generation all remaining model parameters were kept as default the model was run at mean sea level and outputs were obtained for each computational grid point every 1h 2 3 model validation 2 3 1 field measurements from 26 february to 8 september 2009 a period of approximately 6 months with a gap of 1 week during april 2009 and 1 week during july 2009 a 600 khz rd instruments workhorse sentinel acoustic doppler current profiler adcp was deployed at approximately 17m water depth 15 km off the coast of dubai 55 0211 n 25 1834 e uae the adcp was mounted on a fixed tripod and placed in an upward facing position with the transducer 0 5m above the benthos cavalcante et al 2016 the adcp location is depicted in fig 1 the wave spectrum was calculated using the measured wave orbital velocity the frequency cut off was approximately 2s and the minimum measured wave height is 0 05m examples of details on performance of adcp measurements can be found in herbers et al 1991 and hoitink et al 2007 2 3 2 satellite altimeter the satellite altimeter data used in this study was obtained from the australian ocean data network aodn portal ribal and young 2018 this is a consistent quality controlled set of satellite wave data covering a period of 33 years 1985 2018 obtained from 13 altimeters geosat ers 1 topex ers 2 geosat follow on gfo jason 1 envisat jason 2 cryosat 2 hy 2a saral jason 3 and sentinel 3a only satellites that have data concurrent to the wind reanalysis 1979 2010 and data with quality control flag equals to 1 corresponding to good data were used in this study details of each satellite are provided in table 1 fig 3 presents all altimeter data within the gulf 2 3 3 model performance model results were extracted at the field measurement location fig 1 for the altimeter data points as these vary in space and time a routine was prepared to extract the nearest point in space and time from the model output grid model performance statistics were computed for the significant wave height hm0 and peak wave period tp parameters only for the field measurements the statistics include bias root mean square error rmse scatter index si and correlation coefficient r the statistics can be defined by the formulas 2 b i a s y x 3 r m s e i x i y i 2 n 4 s i r m s e x 5 r i x i x y i y i x i x 2 i y i y 2 where x and y represent the measured and modelled values respectively and n is the number of samples the adcp data was filtered using a 3 point running average and compared to the model results figs 4 and 5 the comparison of time series depicted in fig 4 shows good agreement between the model and data in terms of significant wave height and peak wave period for the period of measurements statistics are presented in table 2 the correlation coefficient is 0 85 for hm0 and 0 59 for tp the root mean square error is 0 22m for hm0 and 1 25s for tp the bias is 0 11m for hm0 and 0 17s for tp the scatter index is 0 47 for hm0 and 0 27 for tp and the slope is 1 07 for hm0 and 1 01 for tp the statistical analysis results for hm0 demonstrate the good performance of the model the results for tp are reasonable considering that this parameter has a larger variability the model derived significant wave heights are compared with the satellite altimeter data fig 6 satellite data from the older satellites geosat ers 1 and topex was excluded from the data set for comparison as some erroneous values were found in these observations additional altimeter data was excluded from the data set for comparison based on the following filters distance to the coast closer than 10 km water depth less than 20m and standard deviation of significant wave height greater than 1m density scatter plots for the satellite vs model results are depicted in fig 6 for each satellite and all data combined the scatter plots shows good agreement between the model and altimeter data for all satellites statistics are presented in table 3 the results show that the fit is reasonable with a small bias 2 cm for all satellites and 7 cm for each satellite the correlation coefficient root mean square error and scatter index are reasonably good it is expected that error statistics for the different sets of data field measurements from adcp and satellite altimeter are different due to the nature of the data field measurements are available for a single point for a period of 6 5 months whilst the satellite data spans over a period of more than 30 years and covers the entire gulf the current model setup shows a good compromise considering these factors 2 4 climate and trend analysis the 32 year period model results were analysed to provide a description of the overall and seasonal wave climate and trends within the gulf calculations were carried out at each grid point in order to present the spatial variability of the wave conditions the average conditions were obtained by averaging the wave parameters at each model grid point for the 32 year period the 90th and 99th percentiles were also calculated at each grid point for the entire simulation period seasonal values are computed using three month periods and were divided into december january february djf march april may mam june july august jja and september october november son corresponding to the northern hemisphere winter spring summer and autumn respectively a linear trend based on the least square method was applied to each model grid point to estimate historical trends of significant wave height the significance of the trends was analysed with the mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 this non parametric test of randomness against trend was previously used in other wave climate trend studies such as young et al 2011 and aydogan and ayat 2018 the mk test analyses data collected over time for consistently increasing or decreasing trends the test gives one of two options null hypothesis no monotonic trend in the series or alternative hypothesis there is a trend and it can be positive negative or null the variance obtained from the mk statistic is used to define the value for a specific significance level 3 results and discussion 3 1 wave climate fig 7 depicts the mean 90th p90 and 99th p99 percentiles of hm0 and tp over the entire gulf for the period 1979 2010 the results show that the higher mean significant wave height hm0 0 6m is at the gulf s deeper central area between 24 5 n and 28 5 n where storms from both north west and south east will have an influence the larger p90 hm0 1 5m waves cover a smaller area between 26 0 n and 27 0 n the region with larger p99 with hm0 above 2 4m is at the southern gulf between 25 0 n and 26 5 n which is in agreement with the predominant and stronger north westerly winds thoppil and hogan 2010 lower values are found at the northern gulf the wave heights also become smaller towards south east as the distance to the coast decreases likely due to a reduction in depths in the direction of the uae coastline the qatar peninsula causes a sheltering effect on the predominant north westerly wave conditions the leeside south of bahrain is also very protected and the wave conditions are mild the areas of largest wave periods 4s for the mean 6s for the p90 and 8s for the p99 are also found at the southern part of the gulf and the lower wave periods at the northern part seasonal maps with mean p90 and p99 are prepared for winter december january and february spring march april and may summer june july and august and autumn september october and november for hm0 and tp the seasonal wave climate is presented in fig 8 and fig 9 for hm0 and tp respectively the results show that the wave climate is more energetic during winter months djf hm0 0 6m and tp 4s for mean hm0 1 8m and tp 6s for p90 and hm0 2 7m and tp 8s for p99 followed by spring mam and summer jja the calmer season is autumn son hm0 0 3m and tp 4s for mean hm0 1 2m and tp 6s for p90 and hm0 2 1m and tp 7s for p99 the results also show that the most energetic area is in the southern region between 25 0 and 26 5 n during winter djf and spring mam seasons figs 8 and 9 this area shifts slightly northward towards the central region of the gulf between 25 5 n and 27 0 n during summer jja and autumn son this is likely due to the fact that the winter shamal is stronger at the central region whilst during the summer shamal the highest wind speeds are shifted to the northern area according to the results presented in kamranzad 2018 the highest mean hm0 are 0 85m 0 78m 0 69m and 0 56m for winter spring summer and autumn respectively these values are in agreement with the results presented by the work of kamranzad 2018 highest mean hm0 of 0 8m and 0 6m for winter and autumn respectively 3 2 wave climate trends the significant wave height trends over the 32 year simulation are presented in fig 10 the results show that there is a slight positive trend 0 0 2 year in mean hm0 over most of the gulf with smaller areas at the north and south with minor negative trends 0 0 2 the rate of increase in hm0 for p90 is of the same order but predominantly on the eastern side of the gulf along the kuwait saudi arabia bahrain qatar and western uae coasts a trend in hm0 of 0 to 0 2 year is observed for the p99 south of 27 0 n and negative above this latitude there is a larger negative trend with magnitude of 0 4 year at the north east corner of the gulf around 51 0 n 29 0 e the general increase in the mean hm0 is likely caused by an increase in wind speeds as presented in senafi and anis 2015 those authors indicate that the development of north westerly winds during shamal events between 1973 and 2012 showed an average increase in wind speed of 2 7 m s 1 the results presented here in this study are also consistent with the global trends young et al 2011 which shows that there is a slight increase in hm0 up to 0 25 year for the mean condition and this increase has a higher rate for more extreme conditions 0 4 year for p99 fig 11 presents the yearly average hm0 and trend line for the mean 90th and 99th percentile at points in the north central and south areas of the gulf refer to fig 1 for location map the results in table 4 show that there is a negative trend for mean 0 01 cm year p90 0 03 cm year and p99 0 17 cm year at the northern location at the central point the trend is positive for the mean 0 04 cm year and p99 0 18 cm year and negative for p90 0 07 cm year the results for the southern point show a negative trend for the mean 0 02 cm year and p90 0 12 cm year and positive for the more extreme conditions p99 0 26 cm year the wave climate seasonal trends are presented in fig 12 for winter and spring there is a general positive trend in the mean p90 and p99 hm0 with minor areas at the northern part of the gulf showing a negative trend an overall negative trend is observed for summer in spring there is a positive trend for the mean and p90 but there is a predominantly negative trend in p99 in winter the largest increase for the mean 0 6 0 8 year p90 0 4 0 6 year and p99 0 4 0 6 year is at the eastern side of the gulf between bahrain and qatar the area with positive mean and p90 trend 0 2 year occurs along the qatar bahrain and saudi arabia coastline the area of p99 trend above 0 2 year occurs at the gulf central region between 25 5 n and 27 n there is a small area at the north of the gulf above 29 5⁰n that shows a negative trend of 0 4 0 6 year for spring the increasing p99 hm0 trend shifts southwards towards the uae coast there is a general negative trend in hm0 for summer with values between 0 6 and 0 8 year for the mean and p90 and between 0 4 and 0 6 for p99 in summer for the p99 there is a positive trend 0 0 2 year along stretches of the iran coast the largest positive trends in the mean hm0 0 6 0 8 year occur in autumn between qatar and saudi arabia with a maximum of 0 8 1 0 year between bahrain and qatar the magnitude of the trend decreases in p90 for p99 the trend is generally negative with larger magnitudes 0 4 0 6 along the uae coastline in general the results show that for the simulation period the extreme conditions become more energetic during winter and spring and less during summer and autumn the mean conditions increased in winter spring and autumn and reduced intensity in summer it is suggested that the seasonal variation in the trends is caused by the variations in the regional wind climate the study of azorin molina et al 2018 indicates that the wind speed trend for the damman on the east coast of saudi arabia meteorological station is positive for the winter months and negative for summer months this is consistent with the results of this study where waves are becoming more energetic during winter and milder during summer the results in the present study are also in agreement with the findings of shanas et al 2017 for the neighbouring red sea where also a significant negative trend of hm0 was found for summer and positive for winter and spring trend significance at the model grid points for the mean 90th and 99th percentile for different confidence levels 50 75 90 and 95 are presented in fig 13 fig 13 shows that the areas where trends have larger magnitude positive or negative are quite significant over 90 confidence level fig 14 depicts the seasonal trend significance for the mean 90th and 99th percentile the results in figs 13 and 14 indicate that the more statistically significant results are at the areas where the larger trend magnitude occur this can be observed in the mean condition for autumn where most of the gulf is statistically significant at the 95 level the results for the p90 in spring where the trends have rates that are mainly smaller than 0 2 year are less statistically significant 4 conclusions a spectral wave model for the persian gulf was developed and validated based on field measurements and satellite altimeter data the results show that the model performs relatively well when compared to the field measurements and satellite altimeter data the validation against satellite altimeter data ensures that the model is performing well all over the gulf and not only at a specific area the model was run for a 32 year period 1979 2010 with cfsr wind forcing and the results analysed to provide an overall description of the wave climate it is expected that the results of this study are more accurate than previous works as the model resolution spatial and temporal is higher and the model has been validated for the entire gulf the main result found in this work is the shift in wave climate energy pattern during different seasons and throughout the gulf while the waves are more energetic during the winter season followed by spring they become milder in autumn the spatial variation in wave height hm0 confirms that the more energetic area is at the southern regions of the gulf compared to the overall area this study presents new insights into the wave climate trends in the gulf the mean hm0 shows a maximum positive trend of approximately 0 2 year throughout the study period and the larger positive rate for hm0 considering the more extreme waves p99 are at the southern end of the gulf maximum of approximately 0 2 year the mean and p90 hm0 show a maximum negative trend of 0 8 year during the summer season the maximum positive trend in mean hm0 is during autumn 0 8 1 0 year the wave height trends can be explained by the trends in wind speeds the results indicate that the more statistically significant results are at the areas where the larger trend magnitude occur the results of this study are essential for understanding and assessing potential future impacts of the wave climate on the offshore and

22192,in this study a probabilistic framework was employed to evaluate the relationship among the wave parameters seabed sediment conditions and pile groups geometry and the wave induced scour depth around pile installed in the marine environment considering uncertainties due to randomness in some parameters first the parameters from the database were categorized into random and deterministic parameters for describing the random parameters the probabilistic distribution of them was determined then a probabilistic model was developed using an artificial intelligence method so as to predict the scour depth at pile groups under regular waves in the second part this model was employed in the probabilistic framework through 6250000 monte carlo sampling analysis to assess the effect of various parameters on the confidence level reliability for the scour depth to be less than a specific value it is concluded that marine structures have to be assessed for scouring under the loading of waves with short periods moreover it is recommended that the pile spacing limited less than 4 times their diameter a higher number of piles should be considered in parallel to the flow rather than normal to the flow keywords reliability probabilistic analysis uncertainty data driven model scouring assessment pile groups regular waves 1 introduction a group of piles installed in marine environments has a substantial role to play in supporting the safety of structures scouring is a natural phenomenon that jeopardizes the stability of the system and has been under attention for years since the early 80s of the 19th century a good many endeavors were performed to characterize the mechanism of scouring phenomena and categorizing the effective variables due to flow conditions and sediment transport states chow and herbich 1978 sumer and fredsøe 1998 bayram and larson 2000 mostafa and agamy 2011 chow and herbich 1978 conducted laboratory researches to study the effects of various piles group arrangements they concluded that the pile spacing played a substantial role in the estimation of the wave induced local scour depth experimental investigations performed by sumer and fredsøe 1998 demonstrated that the keulegan carpenter kc number can be considered as the key factor for the assessment of the scour depth when piles were spaced shortly bayram and larson 2000 proposed an empirical equation based on the field data to measure the scour profile in the vicinity of the piles group additionally mostafa and agamy 2011 concluded that when the regular waves in the steady flow condition are considered the local scour depth gets larger values in comparison to the results from experiments generally previous experimental works showed that the kc and froude numbers have conceptually remarkable effects on the wave induced scour depth empirical equations were proposed through regression analysis on the results from experimental investigations to assess the effect of local scour depth on pile groups in this way artificial intelligence ai approaches such artificial neural networks anns model tree mt support vector machine svm adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and group method of data handling gmdh have recently been employed to estimate the wave induced scour depth at pile groups najafzadeh and azamathulla hazi 2015 etemad shahidi and ghaemi 2011 ghazanfari hashemi et al 2010 kambekar and deo 2003 these intelligent techniques which were introduced as data driven models ddms have been proven to be at a higher precision level of ai models when compared to empirical equations results from these methods are usually expressed in the form of mathematical functions that are employed to estimate the scour depth values in the convincing range of accuracy the accuracy of the proposed relations depends on experimental variables and the scale of physical models which lead to a typical restriction in empirical equations bayram and larson 2000 etemad shahidi and ghaemi 2011 moreover due to the random nature of most input parameters the dispersion of the outcomes will result failure of structures is contingent upon the accuracy level of the mathematical model and reliability computing failure assessment in terms of uncertainty which is in connection with randomizing effective variables on the wave induced scour depth is capable of representing more practical insights of results when compared with empirical equations furthermore evaluation of failure function with preserving the physical meaning of the scouring process can determine parsimonious lifespan and the embedment of the pile foundation in the case of reliability analysis a wide range of probabilistic models was proposed to estimate the scour depth values at hydraulic structures khalid et al 2018 tubaldi et al 2017 yanmaz and calamak 2016 liang and lee 2013 yanmaz 2002a yanmaz 2002b johnson 1999 johnson peggy and ayyub bilal 1992 johnson peggy 1992 through previous studies empirical equations suffering from various limitations have been employed to express the function in the limit state in these methods each equation was developed for a specific range of datasets under various experimental conditions and without considering the uncertainty and randomness in the datasets to overcome this shortage reliability analysis can be employed it considers the effect of random variability of parameters on the performance of the system to this end a failure mode has to be identified to describe how the component fails or indicates the exceedance of component also introduced as demand d e from a specific value also known as capacity c 1 f a i l u r e d e c when it comes to the scour depth failure is expressed in terms of increasing the scour depth s d from a specific value s c which can be interpreted as the safe scour depth the failure mode is described in the form of a limit state function lsf 2 l i m i t s t a t e f u n c t i o n l s f s c s d therefore the probability of failure is expressed as 3 p f p s d s c p s c s d 0 a wide range of probabilistic models was proposed in order to assess the scour depth values at hydraulic structures khalid et al 2018 tubaldi et al 2017 yanmaz and calamak 2016 yanmaz 2002b johnson peggy and ayyub bilal 1992 johnson peggy 1992 however as mentioned by mahsuli and haukaas 2013 a probabilistic model has to follow a series of rules to be suitable for applying in the analysis of reliability in brief the model must be an equation or algorithm which simulated the physical phenomena it considers the uncertainty in the form of random variables but returns one or more physical responses not probabilities it is continuously differentiable which makes it suitable for gradient based reliability methods like form and sorm the list of the rules can be found in mahsuli and haukaas 2013 therefore the aim of this study is first to propose a probabilistic model of scour depth around the marine structure piles for this purpose the database parameters were categorized into deterministic and random parameters then the probabilistic distribution of random parameters was identified next a robust probabilistic model was proposed to estimate the scour depth values at the pile groups the well known model tree mt method was employed to create the probabilistic model a normal distributed probabilistic variable was also introduced in this model to consider the randomness of the error function in the second part the developed model was employed to build the limit state function lsf the lsf was used in the probabilistic framework through 6250000 monte carlo sampling analysis to assess the effect of various parameters on the confidence level reliability for the scour depth values at the pile groups finally the efficiency of the proposed model was assessed in employing the gradient based reliability methods like the first order reliability method form and second order reliability method sorm 2 overview of probabilistic models into scouring depth evaluation johnson johnson peggy 1992 proposed a probabilistic model for risk study of local scour depth around bridge pier he could get an acceptable safety margin for united states bridges in fact the regression based equation introduced as colorado state university csu equation was used to provide a general mathematical expression for prediction of local scour depth johnson and ayyub johnson peggy and ayyub bilal 1992 studied uncertainty of local scour depth around bridge pier based fuzzy linear regression flr the dataset used come in small scale experiments with a limited range of variables one of the major drawbacks of their study was that the flr model suffered from a lack of effective variable considerations in fact the flr model was proposed just based on flow depth the width of the pier and bed gradation later yanmaz 2002b computed uncertainty of scour depth around bridge piers his investigation comes in two remarkable merits the first one was to use comprehensive datasets from literature and secondly the uncertainty of various effective variables was investigated a few investigations were made to create probabilistic models for the scouring process at downstream of spillway and outlet facilities of dams yanmaz 2002b li et al 2012 ghahfarokhi et al 2008 through these studies regression based equations have been employed to assess the safety margin of local scour depth predictions there is no denying the fact that the mathematical shape of these regression equations was inspired by traditional equations yanmaz and salamak yanmaz and calamak 2016 investigated the risk of scouring process at bridge piers in order to establish a probabilistic model for the safety margin of the scour depth predictions they used a general form of empirical equations in the dimensional state their probabilistic models come in one remarkable demerit due to the existence of a dimensional form of equations their proposed models did not have the required potential to upscale the results i e uncertainty level and risk assessment from experimental observations to field ones furthermore khalid et al 2018 calculated the reliability of scour depth values at bridge piers installed in cohesive bed sediments to develop a probabilistic model in this case they applied a non linear regression based technique even though their analysis had an acceptable level of accuracy to establish an equation between the reliability index and safety factor the proposed regression equation came in limited ranges of variables and relatively low accuracy khalid et al 2019 proposed a probabilistic approach for the scour depth estimation in the live bed state of bed sediments their proposed model was on the basis of sheppard and miller 2006 equation in which effective variables i e flow velocity flow depth pier diameter and mean size of bed sediments come in limited ranges of observations 3 overview of experimental and field dataset 3 1 descriptions of datasets in this section three datasets are described the first dataset pertains to the sumer and fredsøe sumer and fredsøe 1998 investigations they performed the experimental set up in a wave flume with length 28m width 4m and depth 1m three kinds of pile group arrangements have been employed for the performance of experiments in forms of side by side tandem and 4 4 arrangements as shown in fig 1 for the first four configurations pile diameter was 90 mm while for the square arrangements a 32 mm pile diameter d has been used pile surface whose surface is smooth has been employed in their investigation furthermore 0 2 mm median sediment size d 50 and 0 40m water depth were used within their experiments furthermore bayram and larson 2000 studied the wave induced scour process at a pile group whose arrangement is 2 2 during their field investigations the median diameter of bed sediment the direct distance between every two piles and the diameter of the pile were reported 0 2 mm 3m and 0 6m respectively additionally the depth of water and period of regular wave have been limited to 1 93 4 50 m and 6 7 98s ranges respectively the third section of datasets is related to experimental investigations conducted by mostafa and agamy 2011 their experimental study was performed in a flume which has 23 3m length 0 8m width and 0 9m deep additionally mostafa and agamy 2011 used the diameter of the pile and median diameter of non cohesive bed sediments with values of 7 6 cm and 0 5 mm respectively piles have been configurations during experiments with side by side and tandem arrangements furthermore the depth of approaching flow and height of wave was adjusted between 15 20 cm and 10 12 cm respectively 3 2 identifying parameters with random nature in the database the scour around the marine piles group depends on three main parameters i e the properties of the wave the sediment characteristics and the geometry of the pile sumer et al 1992 4 s ψ 2 t d d 50 m n u m u f m g μ ρ w ρ s where t is the wave period m is the number of piles parallel to the flow n is the number of piles normal to the flow u m is the maximum undisturbed orbital velocity at the sea bottom and above the wave boundary u f m is the shear velocity at the undisturbed bed g is the distance between two piles and μ is the absolute viscosity of water ρ w is the mass gravity of water and ρ s is the mass gravity of bed sediments among these parameters d 50 u m u f m and ρ s ρ w i e introduced as the density of bed sediment g s can be categorized as random parameters in fact these parameters took various values in the database which shows their stochastic nature in experiments in this study in order to conduct a reliability analysis of the scour depth there is a bare bone need for establishing a relationship or formulation on the basis of experimental data the required formulation is generated using mt table 1 indicates the range of experimental datasets performed by literature sumer and fredsøe 1998 bayram and larson 2000 mostafa and agamy 2011 4 developing probabilistic models reliability methods usually address the problem by using two components the limit state function and random variables in fact lsf is used to describe the failure event while random variables are employed to characterize the uncertainty of the problem in this section the probability distribution of random parameters is proposed then a predictive model is presented for estimation of the scour depth this model is employed to build the limit state function to compute the exceedance probability of scour depth from different limits under the uncertainty of input variables 4 1 probabilistic distribution of hydraulic parameters when it comes to experimental data attention is paid to the mean or median values of the results the mean median values present the tendency to the central value without any mark of dispersion the statistical dispersion of the results greatly affects their probabilistic distribution and hence it has to be considered in the evaluation procedure in the case of engineering problems many probabilistic distributions can be used to capture the statistical properties of the parameters appropriately the main objective is to determine the suitable distribution for a specific parameter in this regard the kolmogorov smirnov test also known as the k s test ang and tang 2007 is employed which compares the numerical cumulative frequency of the parameter with the cumulative distribution of the presumed distribution 5 d n max f x r s n r d n κ in this equation f x r and s n r represent the theoretical and numerical cumulative distribution of the parameter r respectively κ is the significance level and can be found in typical engineering probability literature chau 2007 in this study the k s test was employed on seven theoretical distributions namely the poisson exponential normal lognormal uniform rayleigh and weibull distributions the distribution with the smallest d n is selected as the best theoretical distribution the summary of the results from the k s test is presented in fig 2 it is observed that the exponential distribution is the most suitable distribution for d 50 u m and u f m however the lognormal distribution is proposed for the g s 4 2 a probabilistic model for the scour depth reliability methods repeatedly consider new realization of random variables to assess the values of limit state functions in this type of reliability analysis the model of the limit state function must return measurable values in other word the employed model in the reliability analysis takes random variables as input and return values which are not probabilities as mentioned previously the scour around the marine structure pile depends on three groups of main parameters i e the properties of the wave the sediment characteristics and the geometry of the pile see eq 4 in accordance with the determination of the design curve for the scour depth parameters mentioned in eq 4 are required to convert into non dimensional parameters in this way with the aid of п theorem the dimensionless form of eq 4 can be expressed as sumer et al 1992 6 s d ψ 2 n s θ m n k c g d re in this equation n s u m g g s 1 d 50 θ u f m 2 g g s 1 d 50 k c u m t d and re ρ w u m d μ are the sediment number shields parameter and keulegan carpenter number respectively these parameters show the effects associated with various processes during the scour range of re number 3000 1122000 indicates that this non dimensional parameter puts in the fully turbulent flow regime and does not have a meaningful impact on the scour depth furthermore this issue was proved in the literature najafzadeh and azamathulla hazi 2015 etemad shahidi and ghaemi 2011 ghazanfari hashemi et al 2010 kambekar and deo 2003 in this way the reynolds parameter can be ignored during the further analysis of scour depth prediction and reliability in this study the mt technique was employed for developing the empirical equation in order to estimate the scour depth values basically the main idea of the mt emanates from dividing a complex space search into smaller ones thus mt is considered as a powerful method employed for classification and estimation the deep appreciation of mt performance is more remarkable than other data mining techniques such as anns mt applies the traditional decision tree accompanying a multivariate regression technique at the leaves etemad shahidi and taghipour 2012 in this study the m5 method of mt was employed the m5 approach firstly proposed by quinlan 1993 is taken into account as one of the most frequently applied techniques of mts the performance of m5 is fully completed once two stages are processed the first step is to construct the tree and secondly is knowledge extraction from the tree m5 has the capability to build a regression tree by means of a factor known as standard deviation reduction srd in order to split the search space this factor is expressed as 7 s d r s d x i 1 k s d x i x i x where x is the original group of data samples or points prior to the splitting stage x i is the data sample obtained from the splitting phase whose points are fallen into a sub division on the basis of a specific value for the splitting parameter moreover sd is the standard deviation being used as an error measure for data samples which place inside a sub division in the m5 various splitting points for all input vectors or parameters are tested for every subdivision the value of sd is computed and thus compared to the sd values related to the original data samples prior to diminishing the search space other descriptions of model tree performances can be found in the literature etemad shahidi and taghipour 2012 m5mt estimates the scour depth values at pile groups exposed to waves by using the construction of linear regression equations in this way weka3 9 software was used to develop m5mt general multiple linear regression models to predict the scour depth is defined as 8 s d a 0 a 1 θ a 2 k c a 3 n s a 4 g d a 5 m n to model the scour depth g d was assigned as the splitting variable and consequently the search space was divided into two sub domains or two rules the two if then rules and the corresponding linear equations given by m5mt were presented as 9 i f g d 3 225 t h e n s d 0 1385 0 0246 k c 0 0187 n s 0 0582 g d 0 1316 m n ε e l s e s d 0 0681 2 3863 θ 0 1484 k c 0 0182 n s 0 00568 g d ε where ε is the model uncertainty which is defined in the form of a probabilistic distribution this parameter represents the difference between the results from experiments and the proposed model it is also known as the error parameter fig 3 depicts the model prediction of the s d in eq 9 against the experimental scour depth values data it is observed that the majority of data points are put inside a satisfying level of accuracy 25 additionally in terms of statistical viewpoint eq 10 had a convincing precision level with the coefficient of correlation r 0 867 and root mean square error rmse 0 37 in predicting wave induced scour depth in fact there are several statistical benchmarks for assessment of accuracy level which can be found in the literature yaseen et al 2018 moazenzadeh et al 2018 fotovatikhah et al 2018 fig 4 shows the residual quantile of the model against the normal quantiles the points are asymptote to the line which indicates the normality of errors 5 parametric study through reliability assessment the random nature and complexity of real problems almost make it impossible to obtain accurate solutions in these cases the probabilistic methods are employed to incorporate the randomness and uncertainty of different parameters in results in this study parametric studies were carried out in the framework of reliability analysis to study the influence of various parameters on the values of local scour depth for this purpose the probabilistic models of g s u fm u m and d 50 was considered as one set of the input parameter to capture the uncertainty of the random variables meanwhile a wide range of deterministic measurable parameters d g t and m n was employed to perform parametric studies on the confidence level of the scour depth s less than a specific value the confidence level is assessed by computing the violation of the lsf under different conditions fig 5 shows the schema of the employed model as shown g s u fm u m and d 50 were taken as the input parameters to compute n s kc and θ in the form of probabilistic models the outputs values from n s kc and θ in conjugate with other deterministic parameters were used as inputs for calculating the reliability of the scour depth the confidence level is assessed by computing the failure probability which is expressed as the probability that the limit state function lsf takes negative values 10 p f p l s x 1 x 2 x n 0 l s x 1 x 2 x n f x 1 x 2 x n d x 1 d x 2 d x n where x 1 x 2 x n are function variables the lsf takes a negative or zero value on failure and a positive value for safety when it comes to scouring depth failure shows the exceedance of the scour depth from a specific limit in this study the monte carlo simulation method has been employed in order to predict the probability of failure 11 p f 1 n i 1 n i x 1 x 2 x n i x 1 x 2 x n 1 i f l s x 1 x 2 x n 0 0 i f l s x 1 x 2 x n 0 after computing the failure probability the reliability of that the scour depth remain under a specific level which is summarized as reliability in the following sections can be expressed as 12 reliability 1 p f 6 results and discussion in this section the results from studying the influence of different parameters on the reliability of the scour depth were presented fig 6 depicted the effect of t on reliability under the condition where g d 1 and m n 1 0 as seen in fig 6 the simultaneous influences of s and d values on the reliability level come from the same patterns for all the t values generally from fig 6 it can be inferred that when d increased the larger s values were given however the reliability was on the decline when d took larger values on the other hand the variation of reliability level versus t had an upward trend in terms of qualitative illustration fig 7 presents the variation of the reliability level against s values for d 0 5m from fig 7 for a constant level of reliability an increase in the t values leads to an increase in the safe scour depth values overall the reliability levels have gone through a downward trend as the scour depth values increase as demonstrated in fig 7 for s values greater than 0 8 reliability levels remained marginal for t 0 5 and 1s whereas for s 1 2 reliability of the scour depth values asymptote to zero for t 5 and 10s furthermore fig 8 indicates that for a constant value of t the reliability level plummeted with an increase in the safe scour depth values for instance at t 5s the reliability level has decreased from 0 6 in s 0 28m to 0 2 in s 0 55m moreover as seen in fig 8 for the same reliability level the variation of the scour depth values versus the time period of the regular wave had an upward trend for example when the reliability level is equal to 0 4 the scour depth values increased from 0 31m in t 0 5s to 0 5m in t 10s fig 9 presented the effect of m n on the reliability levels for different s and d values from fig 9 as m n ratios increased reliability becomes larger for various d values what is more fig 9 showed that an increase in the number of piles in parallel to the flow can lead to an increase in the reliability of safe scour depth similarly the general pattern of variation of scour depth values against pile diameter for various wave periods presented in fig 8 is at the same as that given for different pile arrangements in fig 9 fig 10 illustrated that variation of reliability level versus the scour depth values has gone through a downward trend from fig 10 for m n 1 almost a constant level of confidence was obtained which is indicative of the negligible effect of m n on the scour depth values however higher values of the scour depth led to a constant level of reliability when m n took larger values more specifically for m n 0 33 1 reliability levels have remained marginal at s 0 8m furthermore for the scour depth greater than 1m the confidence levels asymptote to zero for all m n ratios additionally as demonstrated in fig 11 for the same confidence level the safe scour depth increased generally with an increase in m n ratios for instance as the reliability level is equal to 0 8 s values had generally an upward trend increasing from 0 31m in m n 0 33 0 5m in m n 3 the effect of g d on the reliability of scour depth relative to pile diameters has been studied and then graphical results were shown in fig 12 it is observed that as g d ratios were on the rise confidence level or reliability level increased for different pile diameter values the pattern of variation of s values against pile diameter for various g d ratios is generally similar to that given for different t and m n values in figs 6 and 9 respectively variation of reliability level versus s values was shown for g d values in fig 13 there seen a dawn ward trend between the confidence levels and the scour depth values for g d ratios in fig 14 as seen in fig 13 for g d 4 the reliability level stood at the lowest rank when compared with those obtained by other g d values moreover for s 0 8 there was no significant difference between the reliability of systems with a small value of g d i e less than 4 in addition fig 14 demonstrated that with an exception of g d 4 safe scour depth values decreased with an increase in reliability level for a certain amount of g d ratio overall fig 14 showed that for a certain value of confidence level the scour depth increased generally with an increase in g d ratios for example when the reliability level is equal to 0 6 s values increased from 0 18m in g d 0 0 25m in g d 2 7 the efficiency of the developed model for gradient based reliability methods besides mone carlo sampling various reliability techniques i e form and sorm were developed for the purpose of reliability estimation in systems with random parameters random parameters fed systems in fact the form and sorm approach addresses the problem by using random variables and lsfs these methods are gradient based which requires a differentiable lsf detailed on these methods can be found in the literature chang 2013 in this section the efficiency of the proposed model for lsf is assessed by computing the reliability of the safe scour depth with the form and sorm techniques in addition to this the results are compared with the monte carlo sampling model for this purpose five datasets of various deterministic parameters i e d t g d and m n were randomly generated as listed in table 2 in the case of five datasets the confidence levels given by the three mentioned reliability methods corresponding to the exceedance of the scour depth from 0 2m to 0 6m were illustrated in fig 15 as shown in fig 15 the reliability values from the form and sorm methods are almost equal to the values from the monte carlo sampling for example in fig 15a it was demonstrated that in case 4 the sorm technique had the same performance as that given by monte carlo with a reliability of 0 70 however the reliability value from the form method is about 0 66 which is close to the value given by monte carlo through cases 1 2 fig 15a illustrated that there was marginal difference between values of confidence levels given by monte carlo and the other techniques moreover it can be said that the lowest values of confidence levels were related to case 1 where form sorm and monte carlo methods obtained 0 53 0 54 and 0 55 in the state of the safe scour depth less than 0 6m as seen in fig 15b cases 1 5 indicated the lowest and highest levels of confidence respectively in a way that all the reliability levels for the case 1 computed by the proposed methods stood at lower than 0 05 for both cases 3 4 the sorm method obtained comparatively higher confidence levels 0 53 and 0 2 for case 3 4 respectively than those given by form and monte carlo techniques but the difference between the values is relatively small about 0 5 this shows the efficiency of the proposed lsf model for utilizing in gradient based reliability methods like form and sorm mahsuli and haukaas 2013 8 conclusions this study aimed to employ the probabilistic framework to evaluate the influence of various contributory parameters i e flow conditions the status of bed sediment incipient motion and piles arrangement on the scour depth values at pile groups installed in the marine environment considering uncertainties due to randomness in some parameters to this end the distribution of different random parameters was determined and a probabilistic model was developed to predict the scour depth under different conditions the proposed model was employed to assess the reliability of the safe scour depth based on the results from the probabilistic analysis the following conclusions were driven marine structures under the loading of waves with short periods should be taken into account for scouring phenomena due to the fact that there is a higher probability than the scour depth around the piles increases from the safe limit under this condition large values of g d i e more than 4 have a considerable effect on the reliability of scour depth this item has to be considered by the structure designer of marine structures by limiting the pile spacing less than 4 times their diameter for the design purpose of marine structures a higher number of piles should be considered in parallel to the flow rather than normal to the flow this will increase the reliability of the safe scour depth around the piles the probability distribution of various random parameters was determined through the k s test which shows the dominance of the exponential and lognormal distributions on the studied parameters the efficiency of the proposed model was assessed in gradient based reliability methods which depict the satisfying performance of the developed model in different reliability methods although the efficiency of the proposed limit state function has been assessed the accuracy of the model might be improved by updating the constant coefficients of eq 9 in another world the constant coefficients in eq 9 can be updated by means of some well known evolutionary algorithms such as particle swarm optimization pso genetic algorithm ga and gravitational search algorithm gsa to enhance accuracy level of eq 9 in this way limit state function and failure analysis will provide more reliable results

22192,in this study a probabilistic framework was employed to evaluate the relationship among the wave parameters seabed sediment conditions and pile groups geometry and the wave induced scour depth around pile installed in the marine environment considering uncertainties due to randomness in some parameters first the parameters from the database were categorized into random and deterministic parameters for describing the random parameters the probabilistic distribution of them was determined then a probabilistic model was developed using an artificial intelligence method so as to predict the scour depth at pile groups under regular waves in the second part this model was employed in the probabilistic framework through 6250000 monte carlo sampling analysis to assess the effect of various parameters on the confidence level reliability for the scour depth to be less than a specific value it is concluded that marine structures have to be assessed for scouring under the loading of waves with short periods moreover it is recommended that the pile spacing limited less than 4 times their diameter a higher number of piles should be considered in parallel to the flow rather than normal to the flow keywords reliability probabilistic analysis uncertainty data driven model scouring assessment pile groups regular waves 1 introduction a group of piles installed in marine environments has a substantial role to play in supporting the safety of structures scouring is a natural phenomenon that jeopardizes the stability of the system and has been under attention for years since the early 80s of the 19th century a good many endeavors were performed to characterize the mechanism of scouring phenomena and categorizing the effective variables due to flow conditions and sediment transport states chow and herbich 1978 sumer and fredsøe 1998 bayram and larson 2000 mostafa and agamy 2011 chow and herbich 1978 conducted laboratory researches to study the effects of various piles group arrangements they concluded that the pile spacing played a substantial role in the estimation of the wave induced local scour depth experimental investigations performed by sumer and fredsøe 1998 demonstrated that the keulegan carpenter kc number can be considered as the key factor for the assessment of the scour depth when piles were spaced shortly bayram and larson 2000 proposed an empirical equation based on the field data to measure the scour profile in the vicinity of the piles group additionally mostafa and agamy 2011 concluded that when the regular waves in the steady flow condition are considered the local scour depth gets larger values in comparison to the results from experiments generally previous experimental works showed that the kc and froude numbers have conceptually remarkable effects on the wave induced scour depth empirical equations were proposed through regression analysis on the results from experimental investigations to assess the effect of local scour depth on pile groups in this way artificial intelligence ai approaches such artificial neural networks anns model tree mt support vector machine svm adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and group method of data handling gmdh have recently been employed to estimate the wave induced scour depth at pile groups najafzadeh and azamathulla hazi 2015 etemad shahidi and ghaemi 2011 ghazanfari hashemi et al 2010 kambekar and deo 2003 these intelligent techniques which were introduced as data driven models ddms have been proven to be at a higher precision level of ai models when compared to empirical equations results from these methods are usually expressed in the form of mathematical functions that are employed to estimate the scour depth values in the convincing range of accuracy the accuracy of the proposed relations depends on experimental variables and the scale of physical models which lead to a typical restriction in empirical equations bayram and larson 2000 etemad shahidi and ghaemi 2011 moreover due to the random nature of most input parameters the dispersion of the outcomes will result failure of structures is contingent upon the accuracy level of the mathematical model and reliability computing failure assessment in terms of uncertainty which is in connection with randomizing effective variables on the wave induced scour depth is capable of representing more practical insights of results when compared with empirical equations furthermore evaluation of failure function with preserving the physical meaning of the scouring process can determine parsimonious lifespan and the embedment of the pile foundation in the case of reliability analysis a wide range of probabilistic models was proposed to estimate the scour depth values at hydraulic structures khalid et al 2018 tubaldi et al 2017 yanmaz and calamak 2016 liang and lee 2013 yanmaz 2002a yanmaz 2002b johnson 1999 johnson peggy and ayyub bilal 1992 johnson peggy 1992 through previous studies empirical equations suffering from various limitations have been employed to express the function in the limit state in these methods each equation was developed for a specific range of datasets under various experimental conditions and without considering the uncertainty and randomness in the datasets to overcome this shortage reliability analysis can be employed it considers the effect of random variability of parameters on the performance of the system to this end a failure mode has to be identified to describe how the component fails or indicates the exceedance of component also introduced as demand d e from a specific value also known as capacity c 1 f a i l u r e d e c when it comes to the scour depth failure is expressed in terms of increasing the scour depth s d from a specific value s c which can be interpreted as the safe scour depth the failure mode is described in the form of a limit state function lsf 2 l i m i t s t a t e f u n c t i o n l s f s c s d therefore the probability of failure is expressed as 3 p f p s d s c p s c s d 0 a wide range of probabilistic models was proposed in order to assess the scour depth values at hydraulic structures khalid et al 2018 tubaldi et al 2017 yanmaz and calamak 2016 yanmaz 2002b johnson peggy and ayyub bilal 1992 johnson peggy 1992 however as mentioned by mahsuli and haukaas 2013 a probabilistic model has to follow a series of rules to be suitable for applying in the analysis of reliability in brief the model must be an equation or algorithm which simulated the physical phenomena it considers the uncertainty in the form of random variables but returns one or more physical responses not probabilities it is continuously differentiable which makes it suitable for gradient based reliability methods like form and sorm the list of the rules can be found in mahsuli and haukaas 2013 therefore the aim of this study is first to propose a probabilistic model of scour depth around the marine structure piles for this purpose the database parameters were categorized into deterministic and random parameters then the probabilistic distribution of random parameters was identified next a robust probabilistic model was proposed to estimate the scour depth values at the pile groups the well known model tree mt method was employed to create the probabilistic model a normal distributed probabilistic variable was also introduced in this model to consider the randomness of the error function in the second part the developed model was employed to build the limit state function lsf the lsf was used in the probabilistic framework through 6250000 monte carlo sampling analysis to assess the effect of various parameters on the confidence level reliability for the scour depth values at the pile groups finally the efficiency of the proposed model was assessed in employing the gradient based reliability methods like the first order reliability method form and second order reliability method sorm 2 overview of probabilistic models into scouring depth evaluation johnson johnson peggy 1992 proposed a probabilistic model for risk study of local scour depth around bridge pier he could get an acceptable safety margin for united states bridges in fact the regression based equation introduced as colorado state university csu equation was used to provide a general mathematical expression for prediction of local scour depth johnson and ayyub johnson peggy and ayyub bilal 1992 studied uncertainty of local scour depth around bridge pier based fuzzy linear regression flr the dataset used come in small scale experiments with a limited range of variables one of the major drawbacks of their study was that the flr model suffered from a lack of effective variable considerations in fact the flr model was proposed just based on flow depth the width of the pier and bed gradation later yanmaz 2002b computed uncertainty of scour depth around bridge piers his investigation comes in two remarkable merits the first one was to use comprehensive datasets from literature and secondly the uncertainty of various effective variables was investigated a few investigations were made to create probabilistic models for the scouring process at downstream of spillway and outlet facilities of dams yanmaz 2002b li et al 2012 ghahfarokhi et al 2008 through these studies regression based equations have been employed to assess the safety margin of local scour depth predictions there is no denying the fact that the mathematical shape of these regression equations was inspired by traditional equations yanmaz and salamak yanmaz and calamak 2016 investigated the risk of scouring process at bridge piers in order to establish a probabilistic model for the safety margin of the scour depth predictions they used a general form of empirical equations in the dimensional state their probabilistic models come in one remarkable demerit due to the existence of a dimensional form of equations their proposed models did not have the required potential to upscale the results i e uncertainty level and risk assessment from experimental observations to field ones furthermore khalid et al 2018 calculated the reliability of scour depth values at bridge piers installed in cohesive bed sediments to develop a probabilistic model in this case they applied a non linear regression based technique even though their analysis had an acceptable level of accuracy to establish an equation between the reliability index and safety factor the proposed regression equation came in limited ranges of variables and relatively low accuracy khalid et al 2019 proposed a probabilistic approach for the scour depth estimation in the live bed state of bed sediments their proposed model was on the basis of sheppard and miller 2006 equation in which effective variables i e flow velocity flow depth pier diameter and mean size of bed sediments come in limited ranges of observations 3 overview of experimental and field dataset 3 1 descriptions of datasets in this section three datasets are described the first dataset pertains to the sumer and fredsøe sumer and fredsøe 1998 investigations they performed the experimental set up in a wave flume with length 28m width 4m and depth 1m three kinds of pile group arrangements have been employed for the performance of experiments in forms of side by side tandem and 4 4 arrangements as shown in fig 1 for the first four configurations pile diameter was 90 mm while for the square arrangements a 32 mm pile diameter d has been used pile surface whose surface is smooth has been employed in their investigation furthermore 0 2 mm median sediment size d 50 and 0 40m water depth were used within their experiments furthermore bayram and larson 2000 studied the wave induced scour process at a pile group whose arrangement is 2 2 during their field investigations the median diameter of bed sediment the direct distance between every two piles and the diameter of the pile were reported 0 2 mm 3m and 0 6m respectively additionally the depth of water and period of regular wave have been limited to 1 93 4 50 m and 6 7 98s ranges respectively the third section of datasets is related to experimental investigations conducted by mostafa and agamy 2011 their experimental study was performed in a flume which has 23 3m length 0 8m width and 0 9m deep additionally mostafa and agamy 2011 used the diameter of the pile and median diameter of non cohesive bed sediments with values of 7 6 cm and 0 5 mm respectively piles have been configurations during experiments with side by side and tandem arrangements furthermore the depth of approaching flow and height of wave was adjusted between 15 20 cm and 10 12 cm respectively 3 2 identifying parameters with random nature in the database the scour around the marine piles group depends on three main parameters i e the properties of the wave the sediment characteristics and the geometry of the pile sumer et al 1992 4 s ψ 2 t d d 50 m n u m u f m g μ ρ w ρ s where t is the wave period m is the number of piles parallel to the flow n is the number of piles normal to the flow u m is the maximum undisturbed orbital velocity at the sea bottom and above the wave boundary u f m is the shear velocity at the undisturbed bed g is the distance between two piles and μ is the absolute viscosity of water ρ w is the mass gravity of water and ρ s is the mass gravity of bed sediments among these parameters d 50 u m u f m and ρ s ρ w i e introduced as the density of bed sediment g s can be categorized as random parameters in fact these parameters took various values in the database which shows their stochastic nature in experiments in this study in order to conduct a reliability analysis of the scour depth there is a bare bone need for establishing a relationship or formulation on the basis of experimental data the required formulation is generated using mt table 1 indicates the range of experimental datasets performed by literature sumer and fredsøe 1998 bayram and larson 2000 mostafa and agamy 2011 4 developing probabilistic models reliability methods usually address the problem by using two components the limit state function and random variables in fact lsf is used to describe the failure event while random variables are employed to characterize the uncertainty of the problem in this section the probability distribution of random parameters is proposed then a predictive model is presented for estimation of the scour depth this model is employed to build the limit state function to compute the exceedance probability of scour depth from different limits under the uncertainty of input variables 4 1 probabilistic distribution of hydraulic parameters when it comes to experimental data attention is paid to the mean or median values of the results the mean median values present the tendency to the central value without any mark of dispersion the statistical dispersion of the results greatly affects their probabilistic distribution and hence it has to be considered in the evaluation procedure in the case of engineering problems many probabilistic distributions can be used to capture the statistical properties of the parameters appropriately the main objective is to determine the suitable distribution for a specific parameter in this regard the kolmogorov smirnov test also known as the k s test ang and tang 2007 is employed which compares the numerical cumulative frequency of the parameter with the cumulative distribution of the presumed distribution 5 d n max f x r s n r d n κ in this equation f x r and s n r represent the theoretical and numerical cumulative distribution of the parameter r respectively κ is the significance level and can be found in typical engineering probability literature chau 2007 in this study the k s test was employed on seven theoretical distributions namely the poisson exponential normal lognormal uniform rayleigh and weibull distributions the distribution with the smallest d n is selected as the best theoretical distribution the summary of the results from the k s test is presented in fig 2 it is observed that the exponential distribution is the most suitable distribution for d 50 u m and u f m however the lognormal distribution is proposed for the g s 4 2 a probabilistic model for the scour depth reliability methods repeatedly consider new realization of random variables to assess the values of limit state functions in this type of reliability analysis the model of the limit state function must return measurable values in other word the employed model in the reliability analysis takes random variables as input and return values which are not probabilities as mentioned previously the scour around the marine structure pile depends on three groups of main parameters i e the properties of the wave the sediment characteristics and the geometry of the pile see eq 4 in accordance with the determination of the design curve for the scour depth parameters mentioned in eq 4 are required to convert into non dimensional parameters in this way with the aid of п theorem the dimensionless form of eq 4 can be expressed as sumer et al 1992 6 s d ψ 2 n s θ m n k c g d re in this equation n s u m g g s 1 d 50 θ u f m 2 g g s 1 d 50 k c u m t d and re ρ w u m d μ are the sediment number shields parameter and keulegan carpenter number respectively these parameters show the effects associated with various processes during the scour range of re number 3000 1122000 indicates that this non dimensional parameter puts in the fully turbulent flow regime and does not have a meaningful impact on the scour depth furthermore this issue was proved in the literature najafzadeh and azamathulla hazi 2015 etemad shahidi and ghaemi 2011 ghazanfari hashemi et al 2010 kambekar and deo 2003 in this way the reynolds parameter can be ignored during the further analysis of scour depth prediction and reliability in this study the mt technique was employed for developing the empirical equation in order to estimate the scour depth values basically the main idea of the mt emanates from dividing a complex space search into smaller ones thus mt is considered as a powerful method employed for classification and estimation the deep appreciation of mt performance is more remarkable than other data mining techniques such as anns mt applies the traditional decision tree accompanying a multivariate regression technique at the leaves etemad shahidi and taghipour 2012 in this study the m5 method of mt was employed the m5 approach firstly proposed by quinlan 1993 is taken into account as one of the most frequently applied techniques of mts the performance of m5 is fully completed once two stages are processed the first step is to construct the tree and secondly is knowledge extraction from the tree m5 has the capability to build a regression tree by means of a factor known as standard deviation reduction srd in order to split the search space this factor is expressed as 7 s d r s d x i 1 k s d x i x i x where x is the original group of data samples or points prior to the splitting stage x i is the data sample obtained from the splitting phase whose points are fallen into a sub division on the basis of a specific value for the splitting parameter moreover sd is the standard deviation being used as an error measure for data samples which place inside a sub division in the m5 various splitting points for all input vectors or parameters are tested for every subdivision the value of sd is computed and thus compared to the sd values related to the original data samples prior to diminishing the search space other descriptions of model tree performances can be found in the literature etemad shahidi and taghipour 2012 m5mt estimates the scour depth values at pile groups exposed to waves by using the construction of linear regression equations in this way weka3 9 software was used to develop m5mt general multiple linear regression models to predict the scour depth is defined as 8 s d a 0 a 1 θ a 2 k c a 3 n s a 4 g d a 5 m n to model the scour depth g d was assigned as the splitting variable and consequently the search space was divided into two sub domains or two rules the two if then rules and the corresponding linear equations given by m5mt were presented as 9 i f g d 3 225 t h e n s d 0 1385 0 0246 k c 0 0187 n s 0 0582 g d 0 1316 m n ε e l s e s d 0 0681 2 3863 θ 0 1484 k c 0 0182 n s 0 00568 g d ε where ε is the model uncertainty which is defined in the form of a probabilistic distribution this parameter represents the difference between the results from experiments and the proposed model it is also known as the error parameter fig 3 depicts the model prediction of the s d in eq 9 against the experimental scour depth values data it is observed that the majority of data points are put inside a satisfying level of accuracy 25 additionally in terms of statistical viewpoint eq 10 had a convincing precision level with the coefficient of correlation r 0 867 and root mean square error rmse 0 37 in predicting wave induced scour depth in fact there are several statistical benchmarks for assessment of accuracy level which can be found in the literature yaseen et al 2018 moazenzadeh et al 2018 fotovatikhah et al 2018 fig 4 shows the residual quantile of the model against the normal quantiles the points are asymptote to the line which indicates the normality of errors 5 parametric study through reliability assessment the random nature and complexity of real problems almost make it impossible to obtain accurate solutions in these cases the probabilistic methods are employed to incorporate the randomness and uncertainty of different parameters in results in this study parametric studies were carried out in the framework of reliability analysis to study the influence of various parameters on the values of local scour depth for this purpose the probabilistic models of g s u fm u m and d 50 was considered as one set of the input parameter to capture the uncertainty of the random variables meanwhile a wide range of deterministic measurable parameters d g t and m n was employed to perform parametric studies on the confidence level of the scour depth s less than a specific value the confidence level is assessed by computing the violation of the lsf under different conditions fig 5 shows the schema of the employed model as shown g s u fm u m and d 50 were taken as the input parameters to compute n s kc and θ in the form of probabilistic models the outputs values from n s kc and θ in conjugate with other deterministic parameters were used as inputs for calculating the reliability of the scour depth the confidence level is assessed by computing the failure probability which is expressed as the probability that the limit state function lsf takes negative values 10 p f p l s x 1 x 2 x n 0 l s x 1 x 2 x n f x 1 x 2 x n d x 1 d x 2 d x n where x 1 x 2 x n are function variables the lsf takes a negative or zero value on failure and a positive value for safety when it comes to scouring depth failure shows the exceedance of the scour depth from a specific limit in this study the monte carlo simulation method has been employed in order to predict the probability of failure 11 p f 1 n i 1 n i x 1 x 2 x n i x 1 x 2 x n 1 i f l s x 1 x 2 x n 0 0 i f l s x 1 x 2 x n 0 after computing the failure probability the reliability of that the scour depth remain under a specific level which is summarized as reliability in the following sections can be expressed as 12 reliability 1 p f 6 results and discussion in this section the results from studying the influence of different parameters on the reliability of the scour depth were presented fig 6 depicted the effect of t on reliability under the condition where g d 1 and m n 1 0 as seen in fig 6 the simultaneous influences of s and d values on the reliability level come from the same patterns for all the t values generally from fig 6 it can be inferred that when d increased the larger s values were given however the reliability was on the decline when d took larger values on the other hand the variation of reliability level versus t had an upward trend in terms of qualitative illustration fig 7 presents the variation of the reliability level against s values for d 0 5m from fig 7 for a constant level of reliability an increase in the t values leads to an increase in the safe scour depth values overall the reliability levels have gone through a downward trend as the scour depth values increase as demonstrated in fig 7 for s values greater than 0 8 reliability levels remained marginal for t 0 5 and 1s whereas for s 1 2 reliability of the scour depth values asymptote to zero for t 5 and 10s furthermore fig 8 indicates that for a constant value of t the reliability level plummeted with an increase in the safe scour depth values for instance at t 5s the reliability level has decreased from 0 6 in s 0 28m to 0 2 in s 0 55m moreover as seen in fig 8 for the same reliability level the variation of the scour depth values versus the time period of the regular wave had an upward trend for example when the reliability level is equal to 0 4 the scour depth values increased from 0 31m in t 0 5s to 0 5m in t 10s fig 9 presented the effect of m n on the reliability levels for different s and d values from fig 9 as m n ratios increased reliability becomes larger for various d values what is more fig 9 showed that an increase in the number of piles in parallel to the flow can lead to an increase in the reliability of safe scour depth similarly the general pattern of variation of scour depth values against pile diameter for various wave periods presented in fig 8 is at the same as that given for different pile arrangements in fig 9 fig 10 illustrated that variation of reliability level versus the scour depth values has gone through a downward trend from fig 10 for m n 1 almost a constant level of confidence was obtained which is indicative of the negligible effect of m n on the scour depth values however higher values of the scour depth led to a constant level of reliability when m n took larger values more specifically for m n 0 33 1 reliability levels have remained marginal at s 0 8m furthermore for the scour depth greater than 1m the confidence levels asymptote to zero for all m n ratios additionally as demonstrated in fig 11 for the same confidence level the safe scour depth increased generally with an increase in m n ratios for instance as the reliability level is equal to 0 8 s values had generally an upward trend increasing from 0 31m in m n 0 33 0 5m in m n 3 the effect of g d on the reliability of scour depth relative to pile diameters has been studied and then graphical results were shown in fig 12 it is observed that as g d ratios were on the rise confidence level or reliability level increased for different pile diameter values the pattern of variation of s values against pile diameter for various g d ratios is generally similar to that given for different t and m n values in figs 6 and 9 respectively variation of reliability level versus s values was shown for g d values in fig 13 there seen a dawn ward trend between the confidence levels and the scour depth values for g d ratios in fig 14 as seen in fig 13 for g d 4 the reliability level stood at the lowest rank when compared with those obtained by other g d values moreover for s 0 8 there was no significant difference between the reliability of systems with a small value of g d i e less than 4 in addition fig 14 demonstrated that with an exception of g d 4 safe scour depth values decreased with an increase in reliability level for a certain amount of g d ratio overall fig 14 showed that for a certain value of confidence level the scour depth increased generally with an increase in g d ratios for example when the reliability level is equal to 0 6 s values increased from 0 18m in g d 0 0 25m in g d 2 7 the efficiency of the developed model for gradient based reliability methods besides mone carlo sampling various reliability techniques i e form and sorm were developed for the purpose of reliability estimation in systems with random parameters random parameters fed systems in fact the form and sorm approach addresses the problem by using random variables and lsfs these methods are gradient based which requires a differentiable lsf detailed on these methods can be found in the literature chang 2013 in this section the efficiency of the proposed model for lsf is assessed by computing the reliability of the safe scour depth with the form and sorm techniques in addition to this the results are compared with the monte carlo sampling model for this purpose five datasets of various deterministic parameters i e d t g d and m n were randomly generated as listed in table 2 in the case of five datasets the confidence levels given by the three mentioned reliability methods corresponding to the exceedance of the scour depth from 0 2m to 0 6m were illustrated in fig 15 as shown in fig 15 the reliability values from the form and sorm methods are almost equal to the values from the monte carlo sampling for example in fig 15a it was demonstrated that in case 4 the sorm technique had the same performance as that given by monte carlo with a reliability of 0 70 however the reliability value from the form method is about 0 66 which is close to the value given by monte carlo through cases 1 2 fig 15a illustrated that there was marginal difference between values of confidence levels given by monte carlo and the other techniques moreover it can be said that the lowest values of confidence levels were related to case 1 where form sorm and monte carlo methods obtained 0 53 0 54 and 0 55 in the state of the safe scour depth less than 0 6m as seen in fig 15b cases 1 5 indicated the lowest and highest levels of confidence respectively in a way that all the reliability levels for the case 1 computed by the proposed methods stood at lower than 0 05 for both cases 3 4 the sorm method obtained comparatively higher confidence levels 0 53 and 0 2 for case 3 4 respectively than those given by form and monte carlo techniques but the difference between the values is relatively small about 0 5 this shows the efficiency of the proposed lsf model for utilizing in gradient based reliability methods like form and sorm mahsuli and haukaas 2013 8 conclusions this study aimed to employ the probabilistic framework to evaluate the influence of various contributory parameters i e flow conditions the status of bed sediment incipient motion and piles arrangement on the scour depth values at pile groups installed in the marine environment considering uncertainties due to randomness in some parameters to this end the distribution of different random parameters was determined and a probabilistic model was developed to predict the scour depth under different conditions the proposed model was employed to assess the reliability of the safe scour depth based on the results from the probabilistic analysis the following conclusions were driven marine structures under the loading of waves with short periods should be taken into account for scouring phenomena due to the fact that there is a higher probability than the scour depth around the piles increases from the safe limit under this condition large values of g d i e more than 4 have a considerable effect on the reliability of scour depth this item has to be considered by the structure designer of marine structures by limiting the pile spacing less than 4 times their diameter for the design purpose of marine structures a higher number of piles should be considered in parallel to the flow rather than normal to the flow this will increase the reliability of the safe scour depth around the piles the probability distribution of various random parameters was determined through the k s test which shows the dominance of the exponential and lognormal distributions on the studied parameters the efficiency of the proposed model was assessed in gradient based reliability methods which depict the satisfying performance of the developed model in different reliability methods although the efficiency of the proposed limit state function has been assessed the accuracy of the model might be improved by updating the constant coefficients of eq 9 in another world the constant coefficients in eq 9 can be updated by means of some well known evolutionary algorithms such as particle swarm optimization pso genetic algorithm ga and gravitational search algorithm gsa to enhance accuracy level of eq 9 in this way limit state function and failure analysis will provide more reliable results

22193,the irregular frequencies affect the analysis of hydroelastic responses and wave loading of the floating structures such as springing and whipping in numerical prediction the responses are likely to be overestimated the theoretical basis of three dimensional hydroelasticity for removing irregular frequencies in infinite and finite water depths is formed by a boundary integral method and adding a rigid lid to free surface of the inner fluid zone one barge and one bulk carrier are taken as research objects for validating the feasibility of method for hydroelasticity and investigating the influence of the irregular frequency on hydrodynamic coefficients diffraction forces and hydroelastic responses the effectiveness of the method and mesh of the rigid lid are assessed the method adopted in the paper could efficiently eliminate the irregular frequency for infinite and finite water depths the irregular frequencies should be eliminated in a hydroelastic response assessment especially for the large floating structures keywords irregular frequency hydroelasticity green s function potential fluid boundary element method 1 introduction irregular frequencies correspond to the eigenfrequencies of the interior homogeneous dirichlet problem ohmatsu 1975 and affect the correctness of the solution which have large influence on hydrodynamic coefficients diffraction forces and motion responses in wave body interaction analysis the irregular frequency elimination of rigid floating structures in seakeeping is a traditional problem there are many studies involving the irregular frequencies of rigid floating structures ohmatsu 1975 ursell 1981 lee and sclavounos 1989 zhu 1994 lee et al 1996 teng and li 1996 du et al 2011 song and teng 2016 the extended integral equation is widely used for removing irregular frequencies lee and sclavounos 1989 zhu 1994 lee et al 1996 another method is to modify the green s function zhu 1994 one new approach is the wall damping method liu and falzarano 2019 where the gap resonance in side by side offloading problems has been investigated by the method a unique solvable higher order bem boundary element method for wave diffraction and radiation was investigated teng and li 1996 the occurrence of irregular frequencies in the numerical calculations of forward speed ship seakeeping has been studied du et al 2011 indicating that there are few irregular frequencies in forward floating structures an integral equation removing the irregular frequency was introduced into the pre corrected fft method for the wave structure interaction song and teng 2016 the irregular frequency influences elastic response prediction but few studies have considered irregular frequencies in hydroelastic mechanics some researchers have tried to eliminate irregular frequencies in a 3d hydroelastic analysis ni et al 2019 and the studies indicated that the hydroelastic responses are influenced by irregular frequency effect however the detailed framework and deepening summary of the phenomenon have not been presented by considering hydroelasticity thus it is necessary to form the framework of the fundamental theory and integral equation for eliminating irregular frequencies in the past two decades floating structures have developed rapidly on a large scale for example the maximum volume of containers has increased from several thousand to more than 22 000 teu the springing of an ultra large ore carrier with 500 000 dwt was investigated using the 3d second order nonlinear hydroelastic method in the frequency domain hu et al 2012 furthermore the nonlinear hydroelastic responses springing and whipping of a large bulk carrier were studied by means of an inner and outer region matching method and model tests yang 2016 yang et al 2018 a fully coupled time domain solution for the hydroelastic analysis of a floating body was established pal et al 2018 however due to the emergence of large offshore structures or multi module floating structures the hydroelastic method has been increasingly widely used the hydroelasticity of very large floating structures in the presence of inhomogeneous sea conditions and unsteady external loads was investigated by an indirect time domain method wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the contribution of wave energy generation devices and auxiliary buoys in reducing the hydroelastic responses of very large floating structures was studied nguyen et al 2019 the hydroelastic responses of legged floating box structures were also studied by a numerical method and model tests wu et al 2019 thus the development of hydroelastic mechanics is very important for marine structure and ocean engineering and there are also irregular frequency problems for the direct method in time domain but specific solutions will not be studied in this paper based on a potential fluid model and the superposition of structural elastic modes extended integral equations of elastic floating structures with a forward speed are applied for three dimensional hydroelastic mechanics assuming that the floating body moves slightly at its equilibrium position the nonlinear free surface condition is linearized under the assumption of a low speed and high frequency the radiation potential and solution conditions of hydroelasticity in the three dimensional frequency domain are simplified furthermore the influence of the irregular frequency on hydrodynamic coefficients diffraction forces and hydroelastic responses are investigated in hydroelastic mechanics the effectiveness of the method in removing the irregular frequency is assessed for infinite and finite water depths 2 fundamental theory and mathematical formulation 2 1 basic assumption the fluid around an elastic ship hull is usually assumed to be uniform incompressible non viscous and non rotating when studying the interaction between the floating structure and a wave meanwhile the effects of lift force and surface tension are not considered on the other hand the elastic deformation of the structure is considered to be small and the overall response satisfies the linear superposition principle of the modal deformation 2 2 definition of the coordinate system the ships straightly travel with a constant forward speed u 0 for convenience of the presentation three coordinate systems are established as shown in fig 1 which are 1 the space fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 the coordinate origin is located at the still water surface the axis o 0 x 0 points to the bow the axis o 0 y 0 points to the port side and the axis o 0 z 0 points upward perpendicular to the still water surface 2 the equilibrium coordinate system also called the reference coordinate system oxyz the coordinate system moves forward accompanying the ship along the x axis at a constant speed u 0 which coincides with the space fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 in the initial moment in addition the axis ox remains pointed towards the axis o 0 x 0 during the ship motion 3 the local coordinate system o x y z this coordinate system is fixed on the hull when the hull is in the equilibrium position this coordinate system overlaps with the equilibrium coordinate system the origin position changes with the translational motion of the hull and the direction changes with the rotation of the hull the fluid boundary

analysis of the results 4 1 barge to validate the influence of irregular frequencies and the elimination method adopted in the paper one rectangular barge is taken as the research object the main scales of the barge are shown in table 1 as the barge exhibits mirror symmetry about the x z plane the left half of the hydrodynamic model is used which is shown in fig 5 a the panel number of the half hydrodynamic model is 448 for the barge to eliminate the irregular frequencies three kinds of rigid lids are introduced as shown in fig 5 b d with mesh sizes of 6 m 6 m 51 panels 3 m 3 m 170 panels 2 m 2 m 350 panels respectively six cases are considered for the water depth and the influence of the panel size of the rigid lid as shown in table 2 a 3d fem model of the barge in vacuum is used to calculate the dry global modes and corresponding dry natural frequencies fig 6 shows the modes of the two node vertical bending one node torsion three node vertical bending and two node horizontal bending with dry natural frequencies from 3 0 rad s to 4 0 rad s then four structural elastic modes are involved in the hydroelastic response analysis the wet resonance frequencies in the fluid are calculated by eq 14 as shown in table 3 it is concluded that the vibration frequencies of the barge in the fluid are obviously reduced the artificial viscous damping ratio is 3 for heave roll and pitch and zero for the other modes the wave direction is 45 the irregular frequencies of the barge are calculated theoretically by eq 15 which are 1 990 1 994 2 002 2 015 rad s obviously the irregular frequencies predicted by the above equation become closer to each other when m and n are large for the case of a 10 m water depth the added mass and added damping of all modes are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 meanwhile ρ and a denote the fluid density displacement volume and wave amplitude respectively the numerical results show that the first irregular frequency appears at 2 00 rad s which coincides with the theoretical result at the same time it is concluded that the method adopted in the paper can efficiently eliminate the irregular frequency the coarse mesh rigid lid 1 can eliminate the irregular frequencies from 2 0 rad s to 3 0 rad s and the finer mesh rigid lid 2 can eliminate the irregular frequencies from 2 0 rad s to 4 2 rad s the finest mesh rigid lid 3 can almost eliminate all the irregular frequencies it is concluded that the finer the mesh is the better the result the mesh rigid lid 3 is fine enough for a numerical assessment of removing irregular frequencies generally the concerned frequency range is from 0 05 rad s to 1 5 rad s for traditional motion and a wave load assessment for rigid floating structures in this range there are few irregular frequencies therefore the irregular frequencies only have a small influence on the rigid floating structures however for elastic floating structures such as the barge in the paper the wet resonance frequencies are from 1 85 rad s to 3 80 rad s which just lie in the range of 2 0 rad s to 6 0 rad s with many irregular frequencies therefore it is necessary to eliminate the irregular frequencies for the hydroelastic response analysis or the structural dynamic elastic responses will exhibit distortion as shown in fig 9 the black arrows in figs 9 and 10 indicate the influence although the results in fig 9 only show a small effect on the elastic mode responses the diffraction forces of the barge in fig 10 from 2 0 rad s to 6 0 rad s are almost zero this causes the elastic principal coordinate responses from 2 0 rad s to 6 0 to be almost zero except for the resonance points therefore it is difficult to determine the influence of irregular frequencies on the elastic principal coordinate responses however the next results of one bulk carrier show an obvious influence on the elastic principal coordinate responses on the other hand the motion modes in the horizontal direction have more abundant irregular frequencies such as the surge sway yaw and the horizontal bending modes for a vertical mode such as the heave roll pitch vertical bending and torsion modes the irregular frequencies only lie from 2 0 rad s to 3 0 rad s for surge sway and the horizontal bending mode the irregular frequencies have an obvious influence from 2 0 rad s to 6 0 rad s the irregular frequencies become very weak for all modes when ω is larger than 6 0 rad s therefore the numerical results show that the influence of the irregular frequencies decreases rapidly as the frequency increases hence when the frequency is high enough the influence of the irregular frequencies can hardly be observed this is particularly helpful for the hydroelastic analysis of a flexible body here the irregular frequency at low frequency range is called the significant irregular frequency to validate the method adopted in the paper for an infinite water depth the added mass and added damping are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 to save space parts of the results are shown in the figures it is concluded that the method adopted in the paper can efficiently eliminate the irregular frequency for an infinite water depth the other conclusions are the same as the cases of a finite water depth 4 2 bulk carrier a bulk carrier with forward speed is considered to validate the influence of irregular frequencies and the elimination method adopted in the paper the dead weight of the ship is 205 000 tons the main parameters are shown in table 4 a model test of the ship under full loading conditions was carried out at the wave basin of the china ship scientific research center cssrc the 3d fem model of the ship hull has 178157 shell elements 124032 beam elements and 302189 elements in total the symmetry of the ship allows the hydroelastic responses to be numerically calculated using half of the wetted surface the half hydrodynamic model of the ship hull and rigid lid are shown in fig 13 with panels 794 and 293 respectively case1 is without the rigid lid and case2 is with the rigid lid for removing the irregular frequencies in addition the artificial viscous damping ratio is 3 for heave roll and pitch 1 for all elastic modes and zero for the other modes the wave direction is 45 the 3d fem model of the bulk carrier in vacuum is used to calculate the dry global modes and corresponding dry natural frequencies fig 14 shows the modes of the two node vertical bending one node torsion two node horizontal bending and three node vertical bending with full scale dry natural frequencies from 3 8 rad s to 7 6 rad s the dry natural frequencies and wet resonance frequencies are as shown in table 5 the wet resonance frequencies of the elastic modes are from 2 80 rad s to 5 53 rad s according to the numerical calculation the wet resonance frequency of the two node vertical bending mode is obtained by a hammering test the added mass and damping for an infinite water depth are shown in fig 15 and fig 16 meanwhile ρ and a denote the fluid density displacement volume and wave amplitude respectively the number of irregular frequencies of the bulk carrier is less than that of the barge the rigid lid has eliminated the influence of irregular frequencies on hydrodynamic coefficients and diffraction forces successfully with l 295 m b 50 m and t 18 1 m the approximate results of the irregular frequencies calculated by eq 15 are 0 775 0 783 0 799 0 874 0 883 rad s the numerical results in figs 15 and 16 show that the first irregular frequency appears at 1 15 rad s which is larger than the first frequency of the approximate result the diffraction forces and elastic principal coordinate responses in fig 17 and fig 18 are also obviously affected by the irregular frequencies marked by a black arrow generally the larger the scale of the floating structure is the lower the wet resonance frequency for the elastic floating structures meanwhile based on eq 15 for the larger scale the irregular frequency has a lower range thus the wet resonance frequencies of eq 14 will lie in the range of the low irregular frequencies also called significant irregular frequencies and then the elastic responses will be obviously affected by the significant irregular frequencies 5 conclusions the theoretical basis for eliminating irregular frequencies in three dimensional hydroelasticity is applied by an extended boundary integral method inherently adding a rigid lid to validate the feasibility of the adopted method in hydroelasticity and investigate the phenomenon and law of the irregular frequency one barge and one bulk carrier are taken as research objects the effectiveness of the method and mesh of the rigid lid are assessed some important conclusions are as follows 1 the extended integral method adopted in the paper can efficiently eliminate the irregular frequency for an infinite water depth and a finite water depth the finer the mesh of the rigid lid is the better the result 2 the numerical results show that the influence of the irregular frequencies on hydrodynamic coefficients and diffraction forces decreases rapidly as the responding frequency increases hence when the main responding frequency of hydrodynamic coefficients diffraction forces and hydroelastic responses is high enough the influence of the irregular frequencies can hardly be observed this is particularly helpful for the hydroelastic analysis of a flexible body 3 it is quite necessary to eliminate the irregular frequency for large scale elastic floating structures in the hydroelastic response assessments since the wet resonance frequencies will lie in the range of the low irregular frequencies author contribution section guarantor of

22193,the irregular frequencies affect the analysis of hydroelastic responses and wave loading of the floating structures such as springing and whipping in numerical prediction the responses are likely to be overestimated the theoretical basis of three dimensional hydroelasticity for removing irregular frequencies in infinite and finite water depths is formed by a boundary integral method and adding a rigid lid to free surface of the inner fluid zone one barge and one bulk carrier are taken as research objects for validating the feasibility of method for hydroelasticity and investigating the influence of the irregular frequency on hydrodynamic coefficients diffraction forces and hydroelastic responses the effectiveness of the method and mesh of the rigid lid are assessed the method adopted in the paper could efficiently eliminate the irregular frequency for infinite and finite water depths the irregular frequencies should be eliminated in a hydroelastic response assessment especially for the large floating structures keywords irregular frequency hydroelasticity green s function potential fluid boundary element method 1 introduction irregular frequencies correspond to the eigenfrequencies of the interior homogeneous dirichlet problem ohmatsu 1975 and affect the correctness of the solution which have large influence on hydrodynamic coefficients diffraction forces and motion responses in wave body interaction analysis the irregular frequency elimination of rigid floating structures in seakeeping is a traditional problem there are many studies involving the irregular frequencies of rigid floating structures ohmatsu 1975 ursell 1981 lee and sclavounos 1989 zhu 1994 lee et al 1996 teng and li 1996 du et al 2011 song and teng 2016 the extended integral equation is widely used for removing irregular frequencies lee and sclavounos 1989 zhu 1994 lee et al 1996 another method is to modify the green s function zhu 1994 one new approach is the wall damping method liu and falzarano 2019 where the gap resonance in side by side offloading problems has been investigated by the method a unique solvable higher order bem boundary element method for wave diffraction and radiation was investigated teng and li 1996 the occurrence of irregular frequencies in the numerical calculations of forward speed ship seakeeping has been studied du et al 2011 indicating that there are few irregular frequencies in forward floating structures an integral equation removing the irregular frequency was introduced into the pre corrected fft method for the wave structure interaction song and teng 2016 the irregular frequency influences elastic response prediction but few studies have considered irregular frequencies in hydroelastic mechanics some researchers have tried to eliminate irregular frequencies in a 3d hydroelastic analysis ni et al 2019 and the studies indicated that the hydroelastic responses are influenced by irregular frequency effect however the detailed framework and deepening summary of the phenomenon have not been presented by considering hydroelasticity thus it is necessary to form the framework of the fundamental theory and integral equation for eliminating irregular frequencies in the past two decades floating structures have developed rapidly on a large scale for example the maximum volume of containers has increased from several thousand to more than 22 000 teu the springing of an ultra large ore carrier with 500 000 dwt was investigated using the 3d second order nonlinear hydroelastic method in the frequency domain hu et al 2012 furthermore the nonlinear hydroelastic responses springing and whipping of a large bulk carrier were studied by means of an inner and outer region matching method and model tests yang 2016 yang et al 2018 a fully coupled time domain solution for the hydroelastic analysis of a floating body was established pal et al 2018 however due to the emergence of large offshore structures or multi module floating structures the hydroelastic method has been increasingly widely used the hydroelasticity of very large floating structures in the presence of inhomogeneous sea conditions and unsteady external loads was investigated by an indirect time domain method wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the contribution of wave energy generation devices and auxiliary buoys in reducing the hydroelastic responses of very large floating structures was studied nguyen et al 2019 the hydroelastic responses of legged floating box structures were also studied by a numerical method and model tests wu et al 2019 thus the development of hydroelastic mechanics is very important for marine structure and ocean engineering and there are also irregular frequency problems for the direct method in time domain but specific solutions will not be studied in this paper based on a potential fluid model and the superposition of structural elastic modes extended integral equations of elastic floating structures with a forward speed are applied for three dimensional hydroelastic mechanics assuming that the floating body moves slightly at its equilibrium position the nonlinear free surface condition is linearized under the assumption of a low speed and high frequency the radiation potential and solution conditions of hydroelasticity in the three dimensional frequency domain are simplified furthermore the influence of the irregular frequency on hydrodynamic coefficients diffraction forces and hydroelastic responses are investigated in hydroelastic mechanics the effectiveness of the method in removing the irregular frequency is assessed for infinite and finite water depths 2 fundamental theory and mathematical formulation 2 1 basic assumption the fluid around an elastic ship hull is usually assumed to be uniform incompressible non viscous and non rotating when studying the interaction between the floating structure and a wave meanwhile the effects of lift force and surface tension are not considered on the other hand the elastic deformation of the structure is considered to be small and the overall response satisfies the linear superposition principle of the modal deformation 2 2 definition of the coordinate system the ships straightly travel with a constant forward speed u 0 for convenience of the presentation three coordinate systems are established as shown in fig 1 which are 1 the space fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 the coordinate origin is located at the still water surface the axis o 0 x 0 points to the bow the axis o 0 y 0 points to the port side and the axis o 0 z 0 points upward perpendicular to the still water surface 2 the equilibrium coordinate system also called the reference coordinate system oxyz the coordinate system moves forward accompanying the ship along the x axis at a constant speed u 0 which coincides with the space fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 in the initial moment in addition the axis ox remains pointed towards the axis o 0 x 0 during the ship motion 3 the local coordinate system o x y z this coordinate system is fixed on the hull when the hull is in the equilibrium position this coordinate system overlaps with the equilibrium coordinate system the origin position changes with the translational motion of the hull and the direction changes with the rotation of the hull the fluid boundary

following sea and heading sea respectively 2 3 decomposition of the velocity potential when studying the motion of ocean structures in waves the total velocity potential φ x 0 y 0 z 0 t in the fixed coordinate system is usually decomposed into a wave making velocity potential φ x y z and an unsteady velocity potential φ x y z t the velocity potential of the wave making fluid field is generated by the floating structure sailing in still water the unsteady velocity potential is constituted by incident potential diffraction potential and radiation potential induced by the rigid motion and elastic deformation of the floating structures 2a φ x 0 y 0 z 0 t φ ˆ x y z t u 0 φ x y z t φ x y z t then a new function φ ˆ x y z t is introduced which is the velocity potential in the equilibrium

amplitude and water depth respectively it is assumed that the motions and distortions of the floating structure in the waves are small and that the dynamic responses of the whole fluid structure system are linear according to the principle of linear superposition the radiation potential φ r is expressed as a superposition of the velocity potential corresponding to each normal or natural mode

problem ohmatsu 1975 the solution of velocity potential φ can be either do not exist or are non unique lee et al 1996 and has singularity that causes the hydrodynamic coefficients eq 13a and 13b and the exciting force of diffraction eq 11a have singularity thus the hydrodynamic coefficients and exciting force of diffraction are influenced by the irregular frequencies for an arbitrary floating

on the interior free surface to suppress the interior sloshing modes this method has been derived by researchers ohmatsu 1975 kleiman 1982 for rigid floating structures in an infinite water depth the extended boundary integral equation method for the removal of an irregular frequency has been deduced zhu 1994 lee et al 1996 herein the methods for an irregular frequency elimination in 3d

analysis of the results 4 1 barge to validate the influence of irregular frequencies and the elimination method adopted in the paper one rectangular barge is taken as the research object the main scales of the barge are shown in table 1 as the barge exhibits mirror symmetry about the x z plane the left half of the hydrodynamic model is used which is shown in fig 5 a the panel number of the half hydrodynamic model is 448 for the barge to eliminate the irregular frequencies three kinds of rigid lids are introduced as shown in fig 5 b d with mesh sizes of 6 m 6 m 51 panels 3 m 3 m 170 panels 2 m 2 m 350 panels respectively six cases are considered for the water depth and the influence of the panel size of the rigid lid as shown in table 2 a 3d fem model of the barge in vacuum is used to calculate the dry global modes and corresponding dry natural frequencies fig 6 shows the modes of the two node vertical bending one node torsion three node vertical bending and two node horizontal bending with dry natural frequencies from 3 0 rad s to 4 0 rad s then four structural elastic modes are involved in the hydroelastic response analysis the wet resonance frequencies in the fluid are calculated by eq 14 as shown in table 3 it is concluded that the vibration frequencies of the barge in the fluid are obviously reduced the artificial viscous damping ratio is 3 for heave roll and pitch and zero for the other modes the wave direction is 45 the irregular frequencies of the barge are calculated theoretically by eq 15 which are 1 990 1 994 2 002 2 015 rad s obviously the irregular frequencies predicted by the above equation become closer to each other when m and n are large for the case of a 10 m water depth the added mass and added damping of all modes are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 meanwhile ρ and a denote the fluid density displacement volume and wave amplitude respectively the numerical results show that the first irregular frequency appears at 2 00 rad s which coincides with the theoretical result at the same time it is concluded that the method adopted in the paper can efficiently eliminate the irregular frequency the coarse mesh rigid lid 1 can eliminate the irregular frequencies from 2 0 rad s to 3 0 rad s and the finer mesh rigid lid 2 can eliminate the irregular frequencies from 2 0 rad s to 4 2 rad s the finest mesh rigid lid 3 can almost eliminate all the irregular frequencies it is concluded that the finer the mesh is the better the result the mesh rigid lid 3 is fine enough for a numerical assessment of removing irregular frequencies generally the concerned frequency range is from 0 05 rad s to 1 5 rad s for traditional motion and a wave load assessment for rigid floating structures in this range there are few irregular frequencies therefore the irregular frequencies only have a small influence on the rigid floating structures however for elastic floating structures such as the barge in the paper the wet resonance frequencies are from 1 85 rad s to 3 80 rad s which just lie in the range of 2 0 rad s to 6 0 rad s with many irregular frequencies therefore it is necessary to eliminate the irregular frequencies for the hydroelastic response analysis or the structural dynamic elastic responses will exhibit distortion as shown in fig 9 the black arrows in figs 9 and 10 indicate the influence although the results in fig 9 only show a small effect on the elastic mode responses the diffraction forces of the barge in fig 10 from 2 0 rad s to 6 0 rad s are almost zero this causes the elastic principal coordinate responses from 2 0 rad s to 6 0 to be almost zero except for the resonance points therefore it is difficult to determine the influence of irregular frequencies on the elastic principal coordinate responses however the next results of one bulk carrier show an obvious influence on the elastic principal coordinate responses on the other hand the motion modes in the horizontal direction have more abundant irregular frequencies such as the surge sway yaw and the horizontal bending modes for a vertical mode such as the heave roll pitch vertical bending and torsion modes the irregular frequencies only lie from 2 0 rad s to 3 0 rad s for surge sway and the horizontal bending mode the irregular frequencies have an obvious influence from 2 0 rad s to 6 0 rad s the irregular frequencies become very weak for all modes when ω is larger than 6 0 rad s therefore the numerical results show that the influence of the irregular frequencies decreases rapidly as the frequency increases hence when the frequency is high enough the influence of the irregular frequencies can hardly be observed this is particularly helpful for the hydroelastic analysis of a flexible body here the irregular frequency at low frequency range is called the significant irregular frequency to validate the method adopted in the paper for an infinite water depth the added mass and added damping are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 to save space parts of the results are shown in the figures it is concluded that the method adopted in the paper can efficiently eliminate the irregular frequency for an infinite water depth the other conclusions are the same as the cases of a finite water depth 4 2 bulk carrier a bulk carrier with forward speed is considered to validate the influence of irregular frequencies and the elimination method adopted in the paper the dead weight of the ship is 205 000 tons the main parameters are shown in table 4 a model test of the ship under full loading conditions was carried out at the wave basin of the china ship scientific research center cssrc the 3d fem model of the ship hull has 178157 shell elements 124032 beam elements and 302189 elements in total the symmetry of the ship allows the hydroelastic responses to be numerically calculated using half of the wetted surface the half hydrodynamic model of the ship hull and rigid lid are shown in fig 13 with panels 794 and 293 respectively case1 is without the rigid lid and case2 is with the rigid lid for removing the irregular frequencies in addition the artificial viscous damping ratio is 3 for heave roll and pitch 1 for all elastic modes and zero for the other modes the wave direction is 45 the 3d fem model of the bulk carrier in vacuum is used to calculate the dry global modes and corresponding dry natural frequencies fig 14 shows the modes of the two node vertical bending one node torsion two node horizontal bending and three node vertical bending with full scale dry natural frequencies from 3 8 rad s to 7 6 rad s the dry natural frequencies and wet resonance frequencies are as shown in table 5 the wet resonance frequencies of the elastic modes are from 2 80 rad s to 5 53 rad s according to the numerical calculation the wet resonance frequency of the two node vertical bending mode is obtained by a hammering test the added mass and damping for an infinite water depth are shown in fig 15 and fig 16 meanwhile ρ and a denote the fluid density displacement volume and wave amplitude respectively the number of irregular frequencies of the bulk carrier is less than that of the barge the rigid lid has eliminated the influence of irregular frequencies on hydrodynamic coefficients and diffraction forces successfully with l 295 m b 50 m and t 18 1 m the approximate results of the irregular frequencies calculated by eq 15 are 0 775 0 783 0 799 0 874 0 883 rad s the numerical results in figs 15 and 16 show that the first irregular frequency appears at 1 15 rad s which is larger than the first frequency of the approximate result the diffraction forces and elastic principal coordinate responses in fig 17 and fig 18 are also obviously affected by the irregular frequencies marked by a black arrow generally the larger the scale of the floating structure is the lower the wet resonance frequency for the elastic floating structures meanwhile based on eq 15 for the larger scale the irregular frequency has a lower range thus the wet resonance frequencies of eq 14 will lie in the range of the low irregular frequencies also called significant irregular frequencies and then the elastic responses will be obviously affected by the significant irregular frequencies 5 conclusions the theoretical basis for eliminating irregular frequencies in three dimensional hydroelasticity is applied by an extended boundary integral method inherently adding a rigid lid to validate the feasibility of the adopted method in hydroelasticity and investigate the phenomenon and law of the irregular frequency one barge and one bulk carrier are taken as research objects the effectiveness of the method and mesh of the rigid lid are assessed some important conclusions are as follows 1 the extended integral method adopted in the paper can efficiently eliminate the irregular frequency for an infinite water depth and a finite water depth the finer the mesh of the rigid lid is the better the result 2 the numerical results show that the influence of the irregular frequencies on hydrodynamic coefficients and diffraction forces decreases rapidly as the responding frequency increases hence when the main responding frequency of hydrodynamic coefficients diffraction forces and hydroelastic responses is high enough the influence of the irregular frequencies can hardly be observed this is particularly helpful for the hydroelastic analysis of a flexible body 3 it is quite necessary to eliminate the irregular frequency for large scale elastic floating structures in the hydroelastic response assessments since the wet resonance frequencies will lie in the range of the low irregular frequencies author contribution section guarantor of

22194,oblique gravity wave interaction with a thick porous breakwater is analyzed in a two layer ocean having bottom undulation the plane wave solution in water of constant depth is matched with the solution of mild slope equation in the region of varying depth the breakwater is assumed to be extended from free surface to seabed two different physical aspects such as i wave scattering and ii wave trapping by porous breakwater near an impermeable wall are investigated reflection and transmission coefficients due to interaction of surface and interfacial waves with the breakwater are analyzed for parameters associated with waves breakwater and seabed profiles in this study it is found that porous breakwater reduces transmission considerably in surface and interfacial waves for bottoms over which more wave transmission occurs at lee side wave reflection is found to be zero remarkably at some incident angles depth ratios and bottom topographies distance between wall and breakwater is optimized to attain less force on wall the present study will enhance the understanding of scattering and trapping of waves from a porous breakwater under wave wave interaction in a two layer ocean of continental shelf the findings are likely to be useful for creation of tranquility zones and protection of coasts keywords two layer fluid porous breakwater varying bottom mild slope equation reflection coefficient transmission coefficient 1 introduction a large percentage of world s population are inhabitant near shorelines by utilizing coastal facilities this results in a rise in global trade and transportation moreover from the past few decades global warming shows impact on coastal areas by increasing water level which is due to melting of ice glaciers consequently these matters give rise to detrimental issues to harbors ports inlets and other coastal infrastructure therefore to protect those regions from oceanic wave effects or to create zones of tranquility porous wave absorbers as breakwaters are widely used to attenuate wave energy through dissipation mechanism due to tremendous reduction in wave height by wave energy dissipation depending on breakwater s geometry a number of investigators have been fascinated towards wave motion through porous media in practical applications porous wave absorbers of thin type and thick type are in use theoretical analysis of thin type porous structures is mainly based on the theory of chwang 1983 followed by darcy s law on the other hand study of thick type porous structures is based on the model of sollitt and cross 1972 which simulates wave energy dissipation through linear friction term both the studies on wave motion within a porous structure and through the structure are carried out parallelly to understand hydrodynamic behaviors such as reflection transmission and dissipation however the study of wave motion within a porous structure reveals much wider range phenomena than that of through porous structure by virtue of this the analysis of wave interaction with porous block has been enlarged through theoretical investigations and is further being validated by experimental results by many authors for theoretical study most often the eigenfunction expansion technique along with orthogonal property of functions was applied using plane wave approximation dalrymple et al 1991 calculated reflection and transmission coefficients explicitly for oblique waves past a rectangular porous block of finite and semi infinite extent with without a back wall losada et al 1993 considered a porous breakwater with an impermeable crown and evaluated reflection and transmission coefficients of oblique waves and pressure distribution under the crown since variations in bottom geometry alter wave conditions considerably effects of varying depth on wave propagation are essential in coastal engineering practices thus porous breakwater models were further investigated by taking depth variations into account this was carried out through an application of mild slope type equations as one of the accurate means in the regions of arbitrary bottom topographies use of this type equations in the regions of refraction diffraction has been successful in predicting wave characteristics for bottom topographies with a slope up to 1 rojanakamthorn et al 1989 proposed a two dimensional model for wave transformation over a submerged permeable breakwater and studied by deriving a new mild slope equation later this study was extended to three dimensional problem for oblique waves by losada et al 1996 suh and park 1995 studied the model involving perforated wall caisson breakwater on a rubble mound foundation to predict oblique wave scattering in water of sloping step type bottom by applying the extended mild slope equation of massel 1993 zhu and chwang 2001 analyzed reflection characteristics of a complete porous structure placed on impermeable bottom with a seaward slope their analysis was based on the extended modified mild slope equation of massel 1993 and porter and staziker 1995 for uneven bottom however they considered bottom with constant slope but not arbitrary slope zhu 2001 further extended their study for reflection behavior of porous structure placed exactly on a sloping bottom in front of an impermeable wall this was carried out by employing a newly derived mild slope equation for waves within a porous medium on an undulated bed breakwater consisting of multiple thin porous walls in different positions alternative to porous structure of certain width is also found to be much effective in attenuating wave energy in this aspect liu et al 2012b 2016 constructed a vertical breakwater with an array of multi chamber perforated caissons with partition walls of impermeable and permeable types respectively and handled wave interaction with the breakwater analytically under the assumption of constant water depth kaligatla et al 2018 studied transmission of waves over multiple thin porous walls in vertical position located at low depth water region of a sloping step type bottom in this study the region of sloping bottom was handled with the modified mild slope equation of porter and staziker 1995 liu et al 2012a developed a new analytical solution for wave scattering by a submerged porous plate of finite thickness in horizontal position study on wave interaction with dual porous plate breakwaters in horizontal positions was conducted by cho et al 2013 which was further generalized by fang et al 2017 for multiple porous plates all the studies described above concentrated on wave motion through or within porous structures in homogeneous fluid on the other hand wave interaction with porous structure in a stratified ocean is another interesting topic of water waves this is because the occurrence of differences in temperature and salinity is quite realistic in coastal regions this leads to considerable changes in water density thus ocean water in general is inhomogeneous in space and time in stratified oceans fluid has been formed by different density layers with sharp interfaces the surfaces of interfaces between density gradient layers are unstable and under some impulse wavelike disturbances are often generated termed as interfacial internal waves a comprehensive illustration of interfacial waves and their significance may be found in the monograph of massel 2015 chamberlain and porter 2005 derived a mild slope equation for waves in a two layer fluid of varying depth by dint of variational principle but their study did not include porous structure due to exchange of momentum and wave energy between surface and interfacial waves effects of wave amplitudes on marine structures lead to explore characteristics of interfacial waves impinging upon structures the research that was conducted so far for porous structures in a two layer fluid involved constant water depth for instance using havelock s expansion of potential function manam and sahoo 2005 analyzed radiation and scattering of oblique waves by a thin porous structure in two layer fluid of finite and infinite depth their study reveals that porous structure experiences strong resistance by interfacial waves afterwards kumar et al 2007 generalized this problem to a flexible porous membrane structure by means of least square method behera and sahoo 2014 extended the analysis of dalrymple et al 1991 for a single layer fluid to two layer fluid however wave wave interaction was not considered in their investigation which is a possible phenomenon in two layer fluid case see linton and mciver 1995 applying biot seepage consolidation theory zhu et al 2015 examined seepage loads induced by surface and interfacial waves on a porous breakwater resting on permeable seabed in a two layer fluid this study demonstrates seepage effects in same order of magnitude on structure by both the waves in the present study effect of bottom undulation on wave scattering and trapping by a thick porous breakwater in a two layer ocean is studied taking into account of wave wave interaction in the model of behera and sahoo 2014 moreover the present model extends the model of zhu and chwang 2001 for oblique wave trapping in a two layer ocean analysis is performed for wave scattering and trapping by means of eigenfunction expansion for horizontal uniform bottom while for arbitrary bottom topography mild slope equation of chamberlain and porter 2005 is used in the study it is assumed that oblique waves approaching from deeper water depth to lower water depth will impinge upon the porous structure two depth levels are linked by a sloping bottom topography so that the entire fluid region may be regarded as a continental shelf oblique wave interaction with the porous structure is studied here when the structure is backed with and without an impermeable wall sea walls are often protected by porous wave absorbers for coastal engineering applications fluid flow equations for motion within the porous medium are followed by the notions given in behera and sahoo 2014 the physical quantities such as reflection and transmission coefficients which measure wave scattering are determined by a system of algebraic equations the equations are deduced by matching the solutions at vertical interface boundaries between fluid and porous medium and at the lines of slope discontinuities in bottom geometry the scattering coefficients for two wave modes are studied for various bottom topographies and physical parameters related to depth levels and porous structure in addition hydrodynamic forces on the wall are computed and analyzed 2 statement of boundary value problems this section presents 3d mathematical problems through cartesian coordinate system x y z for small amplitude wave interaction with a rectangular porous breakwater in a two layer ocean of uneven bottom the coordinate x and y axes lie in the mean free surface of fluid z 0 where z points positively upwards as in fig 1 we assume that the shape of impermeable sea bottom continuously varies in x direction but not in y and is characterized by a step thus the entire bottom is composed of three parts z h 1 z h 2 x and z h 3 where h 1 h 3 are constants h 1 h 3 and h 2 x is a continuous function in 0 l with h 2 0 h 1 and h 2 l h 3 the densities of upper and lower fluids are denoted by ρ and ρ ρ ρ respectively and the two fluids meet at a mean interface z d d h 3 a rectangular porous block of fine pores having width b is located at the leeward side of a sea the entire fluid region is divided into five sub regions according to the decomposition of bottom geometry and the location of porous breakwater that is backed without and with an impermeable wall as in figs 1 a and b respectively the first region ω i x y z x 0 y h 1 z 0 second region ω i i x y z 0 x l y h 2 z 0 third region ω i i i x y z l x l l 1 y h 3 z 0 fourth region ω i v x y z l l 1 x l l 1 b y h 3 z 0 and the last region ω v x y z l l 1 b x y h 3 z 0 when no wall is present while ω v x y z l l 1 b x l l 1 b w y h 3 z 0 when a wall is present at the interfaces of these regions certain matching conditions under physical principles will be specified the usual assumptions of two fluids such as incompressible inviscid and their motion being irrotational and time harmonic enable one to describe the fluid flow by velocity potential φ r having the form φ r x y z t r e ϕ r x z e i μ y y ω t for r i i i v where ω is an angular frequency i 2 1 and μ y p 1 sin θ here p 1 is a positive wavenumber of upper surface wave that makes an angle θ with x axis on incident from region ω i the fluid motion is governed by the helmholtz equation 1 2 x 2 2 z 2 μ y 2 ϕ r 0 for r i i i i i i i v v in addition ϕ r has to satisfy the free surface boundary condition in open water region 2 ϕ r z k ϕ r 0 on z 0 r i i i i i i v where k ω 2 g with the gravitational constant g on the other hand following sollitt and cross 1972 the free surface boundary condition within the porous medium is given by 3 ϕ i v z k m i f ϕ i v 0 on z 0 where m is an inertial coefficient and f is a linearized friction coefficient boundary condition on flat bottom is given by 4 ϕ r z 0 on z h 1 h 3 r i i i i i v v whilst the boundary condition on varying bottom yields 5 ϕ i i z d h 2 d x ϕ i i x 0 on z h 2 at the mean interface z d kinematic condition yields 6 ϕ r z ϕ r z for r i i i i i i i v v at the mean interface z d the dynamic conditions in water and porous regions yield 7 ρ ϕ r z k ϕ r ρ ϕ r z k ϕ j for r i i i i i i v 8 ρ ϕ i v z k m i f ϕ i v ρ ϕ i v z k m i f ϕ i v conditions at the interfaces between flat and varying bottoms yield 9 ϕ i ϕ i i at x 0 10 ϕ i i ϕ i i i at x l the boundary conditions on the porous breakwater are given by 11 ϕ i i i x ϵ ϕ i v x ϕ i i i m i f ϕ i v at x l l 1 12 ϕ v x ϵ ϕ i v x ϕ v m i f ϕ i v at x l l 1 b where ϵ is the porosity of porous medium since the right hand side of fluid domain is equipped with an impermeable wall as in fig 1 b no flow condition on wall is given by 13 ϕ v x 0 at x l l 1 b w 3 method of solution the present problem is tackled for its solution by applying the method of matched eigenfunction expansion the form of expansions in each fluid domain is based mainly on bottom geometry thus the expansion in each domain is referred to as plane wave approximation to the solution the bottom function h 2 x is allowed to span over the interval 0 l in the case of constant depth the eigenfunction expansion follows behera and sahoo 2014 whereas in the case of varying depth it adopts the approach of chamberlain and porter 2005 who derived coupled partial differential equations called as mild slope equations this method of solution uses only propagating wave modes in two layers since general mild slope equations unifying all wave modes are not available in literature in the present problem to determine scattering coefficients which arise due to the irregularities in bottom geometry as well as wave wave interaction the solution of differential equations is matched with that of constant depth at the interface boundaries by the requirement of continuity of fluid pressure in addition mass conserving jump conditions are also applied at the bottom slope discontinuous points x 0 and x l the mass conserving jump conditions have been found to be necessary at the lines of slope discontinuity in bottom geometry to obtain accurate solutions the potential function ϕ i in region ω i is expanded as 14 ϕ i i 1 2 i i e i p x i x r i e i p x i x u i where i 1 and i 2 are given amplitudes of incident waves on surface and interface layers respectively r 1 and r 2 represent the corresponding unknown amplitudes of reflected waves the wavenumbers p x i p i 2 μ y 2 for i 1 2 with positive real solutions p i in the region ω i of the dispersion equation 15 ρ x 2 k 2 k coth x

as δ i ρ k sinh p i h 1 d p i k cosh p i d p i sinh p i d sinh p i h 1 γ i ρ k p i sinh p i h 1 for i 1 2 according to chamberlain and porter 2005 potential function ϕ i i in region ω i i is given by 16 ϕ i i i 1 2 ψ i v i h 2 z where ψ i s are unknown functions to be determined and the eigenfunctions v i h 2 z ζ i k i cosh k i z k sinh k i z d z 0 τ i cosh k i z h 2 h 2 z d with ζ i ρ k sinh k i h 2 d k i k cosh k i d k i sinh k i d sinh k i h 2 τ i ρ k k i sinh k i h 2 for i 1 2 the eigenfunctions v i s correspond to propagating wave modes with wavenumber k i k i x which is the local real solution of 17 ρ k 2 k 2 k coth k d k k coth k h 2 d k 0 in k for the depth h 2 x thus the approximate solution 16 is valid for slowly varying bottom in the sense that d h 2 d x p 1 h 2 o ϵ where ϵ 1

or interfacial wave it is observed that sixteen unknowns occur including arbitrary constants in the solution of the mild slope equation 18 hence we have derived a consistent system of equations for the determination of the unknowns and that is described below from eqs 9 and 10 which imply continuity of fluid pressure at the interfaces we have 23 i 1 2 ψ i a i j r i j e i p x i x a i j i 1 2 i i

computational results for wave scattering and trapping of surface and interfacial waves from the porous structure under two possible situations of wave incidence first situation considers surface wave incidence while interfacial wave is in stationary position whereas second one assumes interfacial wave incidence while surface wave is in stationary position each incident case gives rise to four scattering quantities that describe reflection and transmission of both waves the mild slope eq 18 is solved numerically for several bottom configurations by using ndsolve in mathematica programming we adopt the notation k r i j and k t i j for normalized reflection and transmission coefficients respectively of the wave in i th layer due to an incident wave in j th layer for i j 1 2 the normalized scattering coefficients are written here following chamberlain and porter 2005 32 k r 11 k 1 0 a 11 0 k 1 0 a 11 0 r 1 k t 11 k 1 l a 11 l k 1 0 a 11 0 t 1 k r 21 k 2 0 a 22 0 k 1 0 a 11 0

be one and the gravitational constant g 9 81 m s 2 is fixed moreover numerical values of parameters such as nondimensional length of varying bottom l λ 1 1 with wavelength λ 1 in the first region nondimensional distance between varying bottom and porous breakwater l 1 λ 1 0 4 depth ratio h 3 h 1 0 5 non dimensional width of breakwater b h 1 0 5 interface depth d h 1 0 2 inertial coefficient m 1 linearized friction factor f 0 5 porosity of permeable material ϵ 0 5 time period t 8 s angle of incidence θ 30 and density ratio ρ 0 5 are fixed unless otherwise specified for results 4 1 wave scattering 4 1 1 wave scattering due to incident progressive wave along surface layer in this subsection scattering coefficients of both surface and interfacial modes are described graphically for surface wave incidence hereafter we will refer to the two propagating wave modes as sm and im for surface mode and interface mode respectively in fig 3 scattering coefficients are plotted against nondimensional length of varying bottom k l for different values of frictional parameter f and porous effect parameter ϵ under normal incidence θ 0 particularly figs 3 a and b are given for reflection and transmission coefficients of sm respectively while figs 3 c and d are provided for the same coefficients of im accordingly the case f 0 and ϵ 1 represents the full transparent property of porous medium and therefore the present model reduces to the one of chamberlain and porter 2005 in this case the four scattering coefficients in fig 1 b of chamberlain and porter 2005 are reproduced and compared with the present results for results as depicted in fig 2 we have applied a symmetric bottom profile mound 34 h 2 x h 1 3 5 2 5 cos 2 π x l 0 x l with k h 1 0 8 k d 0 1 ρ 0 5 as in chamberlain and porter 2005 in the case of f 0 and ϵ 1 for a wider mound topography surface and interfacial waves are very less reflected due to negligible effect of bottom on waves on the other hand due to the presence of breakwater higher amount of wave reflection in both sm and im can be seen from the results in fact it is an obvious phenomenon when a breakwater is present however it is seen that waves which are very less reflected for certain bottom lengths are more dissipated by the porous breakwater especially dissipation of energy in interfacial wave is high due to breakwater with large frictional values thus the breakwater reduces the transmission of wave energy at leeward side next for the following results we have used a class of step type bottom topographies which are asymmetric in nature the bottom profiles are generated from the function as in porter and porter 2000 35 h x h 1 x 0 h 2 0 x l h 3 l x where h 2 h 1 h 1 h 3 1 α 1 x l 2 α 1 1 x l this represents bottom beds of plane sloping concave down and concave up accordingly when α 0 α 1 and α 1 respectively as shown in fig 4 figs 5 a d are plotted to show the variation of scattering coefficients against non dimensional width p 1 b of porous breakwater for a plane sloping bottom α 0 with different h 3 h 1 values due to incidence of surface wave the reflection and transmission coefficients are higher for surface wave than that of interfacial wave under wave wave interaction a small amount of energy of the incident wave is transmitted to interfacial wave the results in figs 5 a and c reveal an increase in the reflection of both sm and im for breakwaters of certain width p 1 b 4 and then waves are uniformly reflected for higher width of breakwater on the other hand from figs 5 b and c there is monotonic decreasing in the transmission of waves as the width of breakwater increases which implies an occurrence of more wave energy dissipation by the breakwater transmission of surface wave energy is less for small depth ratio values in fig 5 b while it is more for interfacial wave energy for the same depth ratio values in fig 5 d figs 6 a d display the scattering coefficients as functions of angle of incident θ for various bottom profiles given in eq 35 with the depth ratio h 3 h 1 0 5 and α 2 1 0 1 2 in fig 6 a for incident wave directions up to 45 the assumed bottom shapes do not much affect on the reflection of surface wave whereas for larger angles all the bottom shapes induce considerable effect on reflection the results exhibit an occurrence of critical angle θ 70 for plane sloping bed α 0 at which almost zero reflection occurs in surface waves this implies that the wave motion dominates the plane sloping bed at this angle moreover the bottom with α 2 causes higher reflection because of the strong reflective nature of concave up bottom bed the associated transmission coefficient in fig 6 b of surface wave illustrates a substantial attenuation of surface wave energy by the porous breakwater at critical angle since transmission coefficient does not attain maximum at that angle further figs 6 c and d demonstrate the effect of bottom topography on the propagation of interfacial wave induced by given surface wave lowest reflection occurs in the case of α 1 due to smoothness of bottom at the point where the horizontal water depth level h 3 is connected porter and porter 2000 noticed a similar phenomenon in single layer fluid while studying wave scattering by a step type bottom topography however in this model the corresponding transmitted wave energy is very less because of energy dissipation due to wave wave interaction interfacial wave is also highly reflected by the depressed bottom α 2 this reveals that maximum energy is transferred between two layers of fluid in the presence of bottom with α 2 but dissipation of transmitted energy in im is relatively less fig 7 shows the reflection and transmission coefficients in sm and im against angle of wave incidence θ for different values of depth ratio h 3 h 1 from fig 7 a an increase in depth h 3 relative to depth h 1 results in enhanced reflection in sm for angles up to θ 45 whereas reflection decreases with the increase in h 3 for angles greater than θ 45 for larger depth ratio values minimum reflection in sm occurs at angles around θ 70 however from fig 7 b transmitted wave energy in sm over breakwater at the critical angles is less for all the depth ratios except in the case of h 1 and h 3 being very close in the case of closure depth levels negligible reflection and transmission in im can be noticed from figs 7 c and d thus these results indicate considerable changes in reflection and transmission of surface and interfacial waves in very distant depth levels fig 8 illustrates the variations in reflection and transmission coefficients of sm and im with respect to wave angle θ for different interface depth d h 1 values the depressed bottom α 2 with h 3 h 1 0 35 is considered for the results fig 8 a brings out that a minimum reflection in sm occurs around θ 52 for each interface depth level further little higher reflection in sm is seen when the interface d h 1 is near the bottom for angles up to θ 70 similarly higher reflection happens in im from fig 8 c thus waves will be highly reflected when an interface between two fluids is near the bottom 4 1 2 wave scattering due to incident progressive wave along interface layer in this subsection interaction of sm and im with the porous structure due to incident interfacial progressive wave is illustrated in this case the four normalized scattering coefficients given in 33 are studied for different parameters in addition we have compared present results with that of chamberlain and porter 2005 for mound bottom when no porous breakwater is present as shown the results in fig 3 for the surface wave incidence fig 9 shows the coefficients k r 12 k t 12 k r 22 and k t 22 for different values of friction and porosity parameters under normal incident case θ 0 according to chamberlain and porter 2005 k r 12 k r 21 and k t 12 k t 21 due to symmetric bottom but from figs 3 and 9 k r 12 k r 21 but k t 12 k t 21 due to presence of porous structure further one can see that the breakwater reflects both wave modes sm and im and allow waves to be less transmitted into leeward region from figs 3 b and 9 d when a wave along interface layer is impinged on breakwater transmission in im is less than that in sm in the former case hence in this incident case we infer that either more dissipation of wave energy occurs or as the lower fluid layer is near the mound bottom wave energy may be trapped between the mound and porous structure the subsequent figures display results for bottom profiles in eq 35 figs 10 a d show the variation of scattering coefficients against width p 1 b of the porous breakwater for different values of depth ratio h 3 h 1 in this case it may be observed that the trend of reflection and transmission coefficients of sm and im is interchanged between figs 5 and 10 and the amount of reflection in both modes is more or less the same with respect to p 1 b however it is remarkable that in this incident case the transmission in im is less than that in the first incident case which is evident from figs 5 b and 10 d moreover with respect to different depth ratio a change appears in the transmission of im that is for any fixed width of the porous structure less transmission in im occurs when the two depth levels are relatively close as in fig 10 d this is in contrast to case of incident surface wave which can be compared from fig 5 b further from figs 5 a and 10 c breakwater of smaller width reflects little more wave energy in im in this incidence case as compared with the amount of reflection in sm in the previous incident case in fig 11 scattering coefficients are plotted against non dimensional width p 1 b of the porous structure for a particular case of varying interface depth level d h 1 bottom profile 35 with α 2 with depth ratio h 3 h 1 0 35 is applied for the results in fig 11 c for a fixed d h 1 value it can be seen that the variation in reflection of im appears for smaller width up to p 1 b 2 it is also true in the case of sm as in fig 11 a moreover the position of interface also affects reflection of waves for a fixed width of porous breakwater figs 11 c and d show that when the interface depth is very near the bottom i e d h 1 0 3 higher reflection and less transmission in im takes place for larger width of the breakwater when p 1 b is fixed we find that the order in which reflection coefficient varies with d h 1 differs from the order of variation in d h 1 this is due to oscillatory nature in reflection of waves with respect to interface depth as illustrated in fig 3 of chamberlain and porter 2005 the reflection in im is higher for d h 1 0 3 since lower layer is near the bottom for this value at the same time less wave reflection occurs in sm due to less energy transmission from im to sm thus the results demonstrates that the influence of a position of interface depth is accounted for a breakwater of not only smaller width but also of larger width fig 12 displays the scattering coefficients versus porosity parameter of the breakwater for different depth ratio h 3 h 1 the results clearly show a known fact that a porous medium of smaller porosity reflects much amount of wave energy whereas a porous medium of larger porosity reflects little amount of wave energy however the results reveal significant changes in reflection of sm and im due to varying depth ratio h 3 h 1 from figs 12 c and d for smaller value of depth ratio there is higher reflection and lower transmission in im respectively figs 12 a and b exhibit that smaller depth ratio leads to higher reflection as well as transmission in sm 4 2 wave trapping in this subsection wave trapping by the porous breakwater placed at finite distance from impermeable wall on lee side is studied in two layer fluid of varying depth the two reflection coefficients k r 11 and k r 21 for the incident case of surface wave whereas the coefficients k r 12 and k r 22 for the incident case of interfacial wave are analyzed moreover the wave induced forces k f i for i 1 2 on wall are plotted for different parameters the non dimensional force k f i is expressed as in behera and sahoo 2014 by 36 k f i i ρ ω h 3 0 ϕ v x z d z ρ g d h 1 the superscripts 1 and 2 assigned to k f i refer to incidence of surface and interfacial waves respectively 4 2 1 wave trapping due to incident progressive wave along surface layer figs 13 a and b present reflection coefficients k r 11 and k r 21 of sm and im respectively against incident wave angle θ for different h 3 h 1 values the parametric values t 4 s w λ 1 0 15 b λ 1 0 2 f 1 l h 1 1 l 1 λ 1 0 are taken from zhu and chwang 2001 who studied the present model for a single layer fluid fig 13 a reveals angles of minimum reflection in sm for each value of h 3 h 1 the phenomenon is similar to the one shown in fig 6 of zhu and chwang 2001 at the angles of minimum reflection more wave may be trapped in the chamber between breakwater and wall the minimum in reflection increases as the depth ratio decreases however the minimum in reflection occurs for higher angles 60 when depth ratio decreases which is in contrast to the results in the fig 6 of zhu and chwang 2001 thus for two layer fluid the minimum in reflection occurs for higher angles whereas it occurs for smaller angles for single layer fluid which may be due to resonant interaction between waves in sm and im from fig 13 b interfacial waves are reflected effectively by the breakwater and also minimum in reflection of im occurs for some values of h 3 h 1 at certain angle figs 14 a and b display reflection coefficients k r 11 and k r 21 of sm and im respectively against incident wave angle θ for different values of chamber width w λ 1 the parametric values t 4 s h 3 h 1 0 75 b λ 1 0 2 f 1 l h 1 1 l 1 λ 1 0 are used for the results fig 14 a brings out that for certain wave angles minimum reflection in sm happens for any chamber width w λ 1 at which more wave shall be trapped it is remarkable that the number of minima in reflection increases as the chamber width becomes wider which implies wider chambers can trap much wave energy due to an increase in w λ 1 standing waves are generally formed and this occurrence leads to an increase in minima in wave reflection for wider chamber higher reflection in im is found around incident angle 40 figs 15 a and b depict reflection coefficients of sm and im versus chamber width w λ 1 for different values of depth ratio h 3 h 1 from fig 15 a reflection coefficient k r 11 possesses periodic nature with respect to chamber width reflection in sm increases with the increase in depth ratio h 3 h 1 at the same time the number of minima in reflection decreases on the other hand there is no periodicity in the reflection of im from fig 15 b reflection in im has sharp peaks at smaller values of h 3 h 1 with varying chamber width which refers to a resonant motion in surface wave due to interaction between waves reflected by the wall and porous breakwater a similar phenomenon was noticed earlier by medina rodríguez and silva 2018 in the study of oblique wave scattering by a trench in seabed before a wall in a two layer fluid fig 16 is plotted to show the reflection coefficients of sm and im versus chamber width w λ 1 for different values of time period t it is observed from fig 16 a that k r 11 of sm is periodic in nature with respect to w λ 1 for any time period reflection in sm increases as time period increases yet the changes in k r 11 with respect to h 3 h 1 in fig 15 a distinguish with that in fig 16 a with respect to time period since the number of minima and maxima in k r 11 does not alter as time period changes as observed in fig 15 b im has sharp peaks for different time periods in fig 16 b fig 17 displays variations in reflection coefficients k r 11 and k r 21 with h 3 h 1 when different chamber width w λ 1 is considered reflection in sm is found to increase as h 3 h 1 increases moreover it attains more oscillatory behavior with an increase in w λ 1 thus it brings out that for larger values of w λ 1 both minimum and maximum of reflection occurs in sm at many depth ratios but reflection in im decays with increasing h 3 h 1 im is highly reflected by the bottom for wider chamber widths the resulting force on wall is shown in fig 18 as a function of incident angle θ for different values of a depth ratio h 3 h 1 b chamber width w λ 1 and as a function of chamber width w λ 1 for different values of c depth ratio h 3 h 1 and d time period t the values of other parameters are the same as used for figs 13 16 respectively here reflection coefficients in figs 13 16 the wave induced force in figs 18 a d are co related respectively that is higher reflection corresponds to lower force on the wall and the other way around thus from 18 a when the depth levels are far from each other higher reflection and less force on wall can be achieved moreover for most of wave angles smaller chamber widths for example w λ 1 0 15 may be suitable since they let the wall experience less force which is evident form fig 18 b figs 18 c and d provide optimum chamber width w λ 1 for each value of h 3 h 1 and time period for which minimum force on wall is attained 4 2 2 wave trapping due to incident progressive wave along interface layer fig 19 demonstrates the reflection coefficients k r 12 and k r 22 as functions of chamber width w λ 1 for different values of depth ratio h 3 h 1 when waves are impinging on the porous structure under the incidence of im fig 19 a depicts the occurrence of subharmonic peaks between consecutive harmonic peaks which is due to the interaction of waves in surface layer with that of waves in interface layer unlike the periodic nature of reflection coefficient as in fig 15 a in this incident case reflection coefficient k r 12 of sm in fig 19 a is varying almost periodically and it changes very sharply as chamber width w λ 1 varies for each value of depth ratio a similar phenomenon is also seen in the reflection coefficient of im in fig 19 b which is due to the resonant interaction between waves the occurrence of subharmonic peaks between consecutive harmonic peaks in reflection coefficient in fig 19 are due to the reflection of individual waves in sm and im whilst the harmonic peaks are due the combined effect of reflection pattern of waves in both the modes these harmonic peaks are generated almost at periodic intervals due to the back and forth motion of waves within the chamber between the wall and the barrier fig 20 depicts force k f 2 on wall against a w λ 1 and b p 1 b for different values of depth ratio h 3 h 1 fig 20 a is provided to show the resulting force co relating with the reflection in fig 19 in contrast to fig 18 c k f 2 in fig 20 a is not varying periodically and the amount of force on wall in this incidence case is less thus it deduces that wall gets higher amount of force in the first incident case the variations in the forces exerted on the wall in surface and interface modes are observed to be non periodic in nature which is due to the superposition of waves in sm and im generated due to incident wave in im moreover as in fig 18 c interfacial waves exert higher force on wall in the case of nearly flat bottom in fig 20 b force on wall decreases as width of breakwater increases since much attenuation of wave energy occurs by the breakwater for any depth ratio however for smaller values of p 1 b wall experiences higher force for depth levels which are close to each other 5 conclusions in this paper a model of oblique wave scattering and trapping by a thick porous structure in a two layer ocean is investigated ocean depth is assumed to vary in a finite interval and different configurations of ocean bottom are considered in this investigation wave incidence in each layer is considered to understand the reflection and transmission of waves by the porous structure due to wave wave interaction as a first profile of bottom topography the symmetric mound is considered according to chamberlain and porter 2005 k r 12 k r 21 and k t 12 k t 21 due to symmetric bottom however in this study symmetric property is preserved in reflection coefficient but not in transmission coefficient moreover when surface wave is impinging on porous structure the transmission of sm is found be higher than transmission of im when interfacial wave is impinging on the porous structure next a class of step type bottom profiles is applied to this model when a plane sloping bottom is assumed the angle of zero reflection in surface wave exists however at this angle more wave energy is dissipated by the porous structure in the case of a bottom profile which joints upper horizontal depth level smoothly α 1 interfacial waves are less reflected and more dissipated by the porous structure bottom profiles of concave up show higher reflection in surface and interfacial waves for a fixed thickness of breakwater transmission in sm decreases as depth ratio decreases in the case of surface wave incidence whereas it is in opposite trend in im in the case of interfacial wave incidence influence of different locations of the interface is shown in the present study in the situation of surface wave incidence it brings out that interfacial wave is less transmitted when the interface depth is near the free surface for all incident angles in the case of interfacial wave incidence higher reflection and lower transmission is noticed in im when the interface is close to the bottom moreover wave trapping between porous structure and a rigid wall is analyzed reflection coefficient as a function of the angle of incidence is plotted for different values of depth ratio of h 3 h 1 it is found that for h 3 h 1 1 minimum wave reflection occurs for higher angles in the present case whereas it occurs for smaller angles in the case of a single layer fluid as shown in zhu and chwang 2001 in the case of incidence of surface wave for very smaller values of h 3 h 1 most of wave energy is reflected back for all incident angles as a result less wave force is exerted on the wall for larger values of depth ratio critical angles are found at which zero reflection occurs and it implies that the wall experiences a higher force however the amount of force may vary based on depth levels in the incidence of surface wave wider gaps w λ 1 lead to occurrence of minimum reflection at multiple angles it is noticed that force on the wall is high for angles around 35 since minimum reflection is attained at these angles smaller depth ratios give rise to minimum force on wall and vice versa reflection in sm increases as time period increases and due to this force on wall decreases when h 3 h 1 1 reflection in sm enhances whereas reflection in im decays sharp variations in reflection occur for waves in im at different gap length w λ 1 for smaller values of depth ratio which may be due to resonant interaction between waves within the chamber of wave trapping moreover the gap w λ 1 induces resonant interaction between the two waves as a result it causes an occurrence of subharmonic peaks between consecutive harmonic peaks hence we infer that the findings obtained from the present work may be useful for understanding wave interaction with a porous structure in a two layer ocean of varying depth declaration of competing interest the authors

22194,oblique gravity wave interaction with a thick porous breakwater is analyzed in a two layer ocean having bottom undulation the plane wave solution in water of constant depth is matched with the solution of mild slope equation in the region of varying depth the breakwater is assumed to be extended from free surface to seabed two different physical aspects such as i wave scattering and ii wave trapping by porous breakwater near an impermeable wall are investigated reflection and transmission coefficients due to interaction of surface and interfacial waves with the breakwater are analyzed for parameters associated with waves breakwater and seabed profiles in this study it is found that porous breakwater reduces transmission considerably in surface and interfacial waves for bottoms over which more wave transmission occurs at lee side wave reflection is found to be zero remarkably at some incident angles depth ratios and bottom topographies distance between wall and breakwater is optimized to attain less force on wall the present study will enhance the understanding of scattering and trapping of waves from a porous breakwater under wave wave interaction in a two layer ocean of continental shelf the findings are likely to be useful for creation of tranquility zones and protection of coasts keywords two layer fluid porous breakwater varying bottom mild slope equation reflection coefficient transmission coefficient 1 introduction a large percentage of world s population are inhabitant near shorelines by utilizing coastal facilities this results in a rise in global trade and transportation moreover from the past few decades global warming shows impact on coastal areas by increasing water level which is due to melting of ice glaciers consequently these matters give rise to detrimental issues to harbors ports inlets and other coastal infrastructure therefore to protect those regions from oceanic wave effects or to create zones of tranquility porous wave absorbers as breakwaters are widely used to attenuate wave energy through dissipation mechanism due to tremendous reduction in wave height by wave energy dissipation depending on breakwater s geometry a number of investigators have been fascinated towards wave motion through porous media in practical applications porous wave absorbers of thin type and thick type are in use theoretical analysis of thin type porous structures is mainly based on the theory of chwang 1983 followed by darcy s law on the other hand study of thick type porous structures is based on the model of sollitt and cross 1972 which simulates wave energy dissipation through linear friction term both the studies on wave motion within a porous structure and through the structure are carried out parallelly to understand hydrodynamic behaviors such as reflection transmission and dissipation however the study of wave motion within a porous structure reveals much wider range phenomena than that of through porous structure by virtue of this the analysis of wave interaction with porous block has been enlarged through theoretical investigations and is further being validated by experimental results by many authors for theoretical study most often the eigenfunction expansion technique along with orthogonal property of functions was applied using plane wave approximation dalrymple et al 1991 calculated reflection and transmission coefficients explicitly for oblique waves past a rectangular porous block of finite and semi infinite extent with without a back wall losada et al 1993 considered a porous breakwater with an impermeable crown and evaluated reflection and transmission coefficients of oblique waves and pressure distribution under the crown since variations in bottom geometry alter wave conditions considerably effects of varying depth on wave propagation are essential in coastal engineering practices thus porous breakwater models were further investigated by taking depth variations into account this was carried out through an application of mild slope type equations as one of the accurate means in the regions of arbitrary bottom topographies use of this type equations in the regions of refraction diffraction has been successful in predicting wave characteristics for bottom topographies with a slope up to 1 rojanakamthorn et al 1989 proposed a two dimensional model for wave transformation over a submerged permeable breakwater and studied by deriving a new mild slope equation later this study was extended to three dimensional problem for oblique waves by losada et al 1996 suh and park 1995 studied the model involving perforated wall caisson breakwater on a rubble mound foundation to predict oblique wave scattering in water of sloping step type bottom by applying the extended mild slope equation of massel 1993 zhu and chwang 2001 analyzed reflection characteristics of a complete porous structure placed on impermeable bottom with a seaward slope their analysis was based on the extended modified mild slope equation of massel 1993 and porter and staziker 1995 for uneven bottom however they considered bottom with constant slope but not arbitrary slope zhu 2001 further extended their study for reflection behavior of porous structure placed exactly on a sloping bottom in front of an impermeable wall this was carried out by employing a newly derived mild slope equation for waves within a porous medium on an undulated bed breakwater consisting of multiple thin porous walls in different positions alternative to porous structure of certain width is also found to be much effective in attenuating wave energy in this aspect liu et al 2012b 2016 constructed a vertical breakwater with an array of multi chamber perforated caissons with partition walls of impermeable and permeable types respectively and handled wave interaction with the breakwater analytically under the assumption of constant water depth kaligatla et al 2018 studied transmission of waves over multiple thin porous walls in vertical position located at low depth water region of a sloping step type bottom in this study the region of sloping bottom was handled with the modified mild slope equation of porter and staziker 1995 liu et al 2012a developed a new analytical solution for wave scattering by a submerged porous plate of finite thickness in horizontal position study on wave interaction with dual porous plate breakwaters in horizontal positions was conducted by cho et al 2013 which was further generalized by fang et al 2017 for multiple porous plates all the studies described above concentrated on wave motion through or within porous structures in homogeneous fluid on the other hand wave interaction with porous structure in a stratified ocean is another interesting topic of water waves this is because the occurrence of differences in temperature and salinity is quite realistic in coastal regions this leads to considerable changes in water density thus ocean water in general is inhomogeneous in space and time in stratified oceans fluid has been formed by different density layers with sharp interfaces the surfaces of interfaces between density gradient layers are unstable and under some impulse wavelike disturbances are often generated termed as interfacial internal waves a comprehensive illustration of interfacial waves and their significance may be found in the monograph of massel 2015 chamberlain and porter 2005 derived a mild slope equation for waves in a two layer fluid of varying depth by dint of variational principle but their study did not include porous structure due to exchange of momentum and wave energy between surface and interfacial waves effects of wave amplitudes on marine structures lead to explore characteristics of interfacial waves impinging upon structures the research that was conducted so far for porous structures in a two layer fluid involved constant water depth for instance using havelock s expansion of potential function manam and sahoo 2005 analyzed radiation and scattering of oblique waves by a thin porous structure in two layer fluid of finite and infinite depth their study reveals that porous structure experiences strong resistance by interfacial waves afterwards kumar et al 2007 generalized this problem to a flexible porous membrane structure by means of least square method behera and sahoo 2014 extended the analysis of dalrymple et al 1991 for a single layer fluid to two layer fluid however wave wave interaction was not considered in their investigation which is a possible phenomenon in two layer fluid case see linton and mciver 1995 applying biot seepage consolidation theory zhu et al 2015 examined seepage loads induced by surface and interfacial waves on a porous breakwater resting on permeable seabed in a two layer fluid this study demonstrates seepage effects in same order of magnitude on structure by both the waves in the present study effect of bottom undulation on wave scattering and trapping by a thick porous breakwater in a two layer ocean is studied taking into account of wave wave interaction in the model of behera and sahoo 2014 moreover the present model extends the model of zhu and chwang 2001 for oblique wave trapping in a two layer ocean analysis is performed for wave scattering and trapping by means of eigenfunction expansion for horizontal uniform bottom while for arbitrary bottom topography mild slope equation of chamberlain and porter 2005 is used in the study it is assumed that oblique waves approaching from deeper water depth to lower water depth will impinge upon the porous structure two depth levels are linked by a sloping bottom topography so that the entire fluid region may be regarded as a continental shelf oblique wave interaction with the porous structure is studied here when the structure is backed with and without an impermeable wall sea walls are often protected by porous wave absorbers for coastal engineering applications fluid flow equations for motion within the porous medium are followed by the notions given in behera and sahoo 2014 the physical quantities such as reflection and transmission coefficients which measure wave scattering are determined by a system of algebraic equations the equations are deduced by matching the solutions at vertical interface boundaries between fluid and porous medium and at the lines of slope discontinuities in bottom geometry the scattering coefficients for two wave modes are studied for various bottom topographies and physical parameters related to depth levels and porous structure in addition hydrodynamic forces on the wall are computed and analyzed 2 statement of boundary value problems this section presents 3d mathematical problems through cartesian coordinate system x y z for small amplitude wave interaction with a rectangular porous breakwater in a two layer ocean of uneven bottom the coordinate x and y axes lie in the mean free surface of fluid z 0 where z points positively upwards as in fig 1 we assume that the shape of impermeable sea bottom continuously varies in x direction but not in y and is characterized by a step thus the entire bottom is composed of three parts z h 1 z h 2 x and z h 3 where h 1 h 3 are constants h 1 h 3 and h 2 x is a continuous function in 0 l with h 2 0 h 1 and h 2 l h 3 the densities of upper and lower fluids are denoted by ρ and ρ ρ ρ respectively and the two fluids meet at a mean interface z d d h 3 a rectangular porous block of fine pores having width b is located at the leeward side of a sea the entire fluid region is divided into five sub regions according to the decomposition of bottom geometry and the location of porous breakwater that is backed without and with an impermeable wall as in figs 1 a and b respectively the first region ω i x y z x 0 y h 1 z 0 second region ω i i x y z 0 x l y h 2 z 0 third region ω i i i x y z l x l l 1 y h 3 z 0 fourth region ω i v x y z l l 1 x l l 1 b y h 3 z 0 and the last region ω v x y z l l 1 b x y h 3 z 0 when no wall is present while ω v x y z l l 1 b x l l 1 b w y h 3 z 0 when a wall is present at the interfaces of these regions certain matching conditions under physical principles will be specified the usual assumptions of two fluids such as incompressible inviscid and their motion being irrotational and time harmonic enable one to describe the fluid flow by velocity potential φ r having the form φ r x y z t r e ϕ r x z e i μ y y ω t for r i i i v where ω is an angular frequency i 2 1 and μ y p 1 sin θ here p 1 is a positive wavenumber of upper surface wave that makes an angle θ with x axis on incident from region ω i the fluid motion is governed by the helmholtz equation 1 2 x 2 2 z 2 μ y 2 ϕ r 0 for r i i i i i i i v v in addition ϕ r has to satisfy the free surface boundary condition in open water region 2 ϕ r z k ϕ r 0 on z 0 r i i i i i i v where k ω 2 g with the gravitational constant g on the other hand following sollitt and cross 1972 the free surface boundary condition within the porous medium is given by 3 ϕ i v z k m i f ϕ i v 0 on z 0 where m is an inertial coefficient and f is a linearized friction coefficient boundary condition on flat bottom is given by 4 ϕ r z 0 on z h 1 h 3 r i i i i i v v whilst the boundary condition on varying bottom yields 5 ϕ i i z d h 2 d x ϕ i i x 0 on z h 2 at the mean interface z d kinematic condition yields 6 ϕ r z ϕ r z for r i i i i i i i v v at the mean interface z d the dynamic conditions in water and porous regions yield 7 ρ ϕ r z k ϕ r ρ ϕ r z k ϕ j for r i i i i i i v 8 ρ ϕ i v z k m i f ϕ i v ρ ϕ i v z k m i f ϕ i v conditions at the interfaces between flat and varying bottoms yield 9 ϕ i ϕ i i at x 0 10 ϕ i i ϕ i i i at x l the boundary conditions on the porous breakwater are given by 11 ϕ i i i x ϵ ϕ i v x ϕ i i i m i f ϕ i v at x l l 1 12 ϕ v x ϵ ϕ i v x ϕ v m i f ϕ i v at x l l 1 b where ϵ is the porosity of porous medium since the right hand side of fluid domain is equipped with an impermeable wall as in fig 1 b no flow condition on wall is given by 13 ϕ v x 0 at x l l 1 b w 3 method of solution the present problem is tackled for its solution by applying the method of matched eigenfunction expansion the form of expansions in each fluid domain is based mainly on bottom geometry thus the expansion in each domain is referred to as plane wave approximation to the solution the bottom function h 2 x is allowed to span over the interval 0 l in the case of constant depth the eigenfunction expansion follows behera and sahoo 2014 whereas in the case of varying depth it adopts the approach of chamberlain and porter 2005 who derived coupled partial differential equations called as mild slope equations this method of solution uses only propagating wave modes in two layers since general mild slope equations unifying all wave modes are not available in literature in the present problem to determine scattering coefficients which arise due to the irregularities in bottom geometry as well as wave wave interaction the solution of differential equations is matched with that of constant depth at the interface boundaries by the requirement of continuity of fluid pressure in addition mass conserving jump conditions are also applied at the bottom slope discontinuous points x 0 and x l the mass conserving jump conditions have been found to be necessary at the lines of slope discontinuity in bottom geometry to obtain accurate solutions the potential function ϕ i in region ω i is expanded as 14 ϕ i i 1 2 i i e i p x i x r i e i p x i x u i where i 1 and i 2 are given amplitudes of incident waves on surface and interface layers respectively r 1 and r 2 represent

equation 15 are ordered as p 1 p 2 and the corresponding eigenfunctions u 1 and u 2 are referred to as free surface and interfacial modes respectively the coefficients δ i and γ i in u i are defined as δ i ρ k sinh p i h 1 d p i k cosh p i d p i sinh p i d sinh p i h 1 γ i ρ k p i sinh p i h 1 for i 1 2 according to chamberlain and porter 2005 potential function ϕ i i in region ω i i is given by 16 ϕ i i i 1 2 ψ i v i h 2 z where ψ i s are unknown functions to be determined and the eigenfunctions v i h 2 z ζ i k i cosh k i z k sinh k i z d z 0 τ i cosh k i z h 2 h 2 z d with ζ i ρ k sinh k i

computational results for wave scattering and trapping of surface and interfacial waves from the porous structure under two possible situations of wave incidence first situation considers surface wave incidence while interfacial wave is in stationary position whereas second one assumes interfacial wave incidence while surface wave is in stationary position each incident case gives rise to four scattering quantities that describe reflection and transmission of both waves the mild slope eq 18 is solved numerically for several bottom configurations by using ndsolve in mathematica programming we adopt the notation k r i j and k t i j for normalized reflection and transmission coefficients respectively of the wave in i th layer due to an incident wave in j th layer for i j 1 2 the normalized scattering coefficients are written here following chamberlain and porter 2005 32 k r 11 k 1 0 a 11 0 k 1 0 a 11 0 r 1 k t 11 k 1 l a 11 l k 1 0 a 11 0 t 1 k r 21 k 2 0 a 22 0 k 1 0 a 11 0

be one and the gravitational constant g 9 81 m s 2 is fixed moreover numerical values of parameters such as nondimensional length of varying bottom l λ 1 1 with wavelength λ 1 in the first region nondimensional distance between varying bottom and porous breakwater l 1 λ 1 0 4 depth ratio h 3 h 1 0 5 non dimensional width of breakwater b h 1 0 5 interface depth d h 1 0 2 inertial coefficient m

scattering 4 1 1 wave scattering due to incident progressive wave along surface layer in this subsection scattering coefficients of both surface and interfacial modes are described graphically for surface wave incidence hereafter we will refer to the two propagating wave modes as sm and im for surface mode and interface mode respectively in fig 3 scattering coefficients are plotted against nondimensional length of varying bottom k l for different values of frictional parameter f and porous effect parameter ϵ under normal incidence θ 0 particularly figs 3 a and b are given for reflection and transmission coefficients of sm respectively while figs 3 c and d are provided for the same coefficients of im accordingly the case f 0 and ϵ 1 represents the full transparent property of porous medium and therefore the present model reduces to the one of chamberlain and porter 2005 in this case the four scattering coefficients in fig 1 b of chamberlain and porter 2005 are reproduced and compared with the present results for results as depicted in fig 2 we have applied a symmetric bottom profile mound 34 h 2 x h 1 3 5 2 5 cos 2 π x l 0 x l with k h 1 0 8 k d 0 1 ρ 0 5 as in chamberlain and porter 2005 in the case of f 0 and ϵ 1 for a wider mound topography surface and interfacial waves are very less reflected due to negligible effect of bottom on waves on the other hand due to the presence of breakwater higher amount of wave reflection in both sm and im can be seen from the results in fact it is an obvious phenomenon when a breakwater is present however it is seen that waves which are very less reflected for certain bottom lengths are more dissipated by the porous breakwater especially dissipation of energy in interfacial wave is high due to breakwater with large frictional values thus the breakwater reduces the transmission of wave energy at leeward side next for the following results we have used a class of step type bottom topographies which are asymmetric in nature the bottom profiles are generated from the function as in porter and porter 2000 35 h x h 1 x 0 h 2 0 x l h 3 l x where h 2 h 1 h 1 h 3 1 α 1 x l 2 α 1 1 x l this represents bottom beds of plane sloping concave down and concave up accordingly when α 0 α 1 and α 1 respectively as shown in fig 4 figs 5 a d are plotted to show the variation of scattering coefficients against non dimensional width p 1 b of porous breakwater for a plane sloping bottom α 0 with different h 3 h 1 values due to incidence of surface wave the reflection and transmission coefficients are higher for surface wave than that of interfacial wave under wave wave interaction a small amount of energy of the incident wave is transmitted to interfacial wave the results in figs 5 a and c reveal an increase in the reflection of both sm and im for breakwaters of certain width p 1 b 4 and then waves are uniformly reflected for higher width of breakwater on the other hand from figs 5 b and c there is monotonic decreasing in the transmission of waves as the width of breakwater increases which implies an occurrence of more wave energy dissipation by the breakwater transmission of surface wave energy is less for small depth ratio values in fig 5 b while it is more for interfacial wave energy for the same depth ratio values in fig 5 d figs 6 a d display the scattering coefficients as functions of angle of incident θ for various bottom profiles given in eq 35 with the depth ratio h 3 h 1 0 5 and α 2 1 0 1 2 in fig 6 a for incident wave directions up to 45 the assumed bottom shapes do not much affect on the reflection of surface wave whereas for larger angles all the bottom shapes induce considerable effect on reflection the results exhibit an occurrence of critical angle θ 70 for plane sloping bed α 0 at which almost zero reflection occurs in surface waves this implies that the wave motion dominates the plane sloping bed at this angle moreover the bottom with α 2 causes higher reflection because of the strong reflective nature of concave up bottom bed the associated transmission coefficient in fig 6 b of surface wave illustrates a substantial attenuation of surface wave energy by the porous breakwater at critical angle since transmission coefficient does not attain maximum at that angle further figs 6 c and d demonstrate the effect of bottom topography on the propagation of interfacial wave induced by given surface wave lowest reflection occurs in the case of α 1 due to smoothness of bottom at the point where the horizontal water depth level h 3 is connected porter and porter 2000 noticed a similar phenomenon in single layer fluid while studying wave scattering by a step type bottom topography however in this model the corresponding transmitted wave energy is very less because of energy dissipation due to wave wave interaction interfacial wave is also highly reflected by the depressed bottom α 2 this reveals that maximum energy is transferred between two layers of fluid in the presence of bottom with α 2 but dissipation of transmitted energy in im is relatively less fig 7 shows the reflection and transmission coefficients in sm and im against angle of wave incidence θ for different values of depth ratio h 3 h 1 from fig 7 a an increase in depth h 3 relative to depth h 1 results in enhanced reflection in sm for angles up to θ 45 whereas reflection decreases with the increase in h 3 for angles greater than θ 45 for larger depth ratio values minimum reflection in sm occurs at angles around θ 70 however from fig 7 b transmitted wave energy in sm over breakwater at the critical angles is less for all the depth ratios except in the case of h 1 and h 3 being very close in the case of closure depth levels negligible reflection and transmission in im can be noticed from figs 7 c and d thus these results indicate considerable changes in reflection and transmission of surface and interfacial waves in very distant depth levels fig 8 illustrates the variations in reflection and transmission coefficients of sm and im with respect to wave angle θ for different interface depth d h 1 values the depressed bottom α 2 with h 3 h 1 0 35 is considered for the results fig 8 a brings out that a minimum reflection in sm occurs around θ 52 for each interface depth level further little higher reflection in sm is seen when the interface d h 1 is near the bottom for angles up to θ 70 similarly higher reflection happens in im from fig 8 c thus waves will be highly reflected when an interface between two fluids is near the bottom 4 1 2 wave scattering due to incident progressive wave along interface layer in this subsection interaction of sm and im with the porous structure due to incident interfacial progressive wave is illustrated in this case the four normalized scattering coefficients given in 33 are studied for different parameters in addition we have compared present results with that of chamberlain and porter 2005 for mound bottom when no porous breakwater is present as shown the results in fig 3 for the surface wave incidence fig 9 shows the coefficients k r 12 k t 12 k r 22 and k t 22 for different values of friction and porosity parameters under normal incident case θ 0 according to chamberlain and porter 2005 k r 12 k r 21 and k t 12 k t 21 due to symmetric bottom but from figs 3 and 9 k r 12 k r 21 but k t 12 k t 21 due to presence of porous structure further one can see that the breakwater reflects both wave modes sm and im and allow waves to be less transmitted into leeward region from figs 3 b and 9 d when a wave along interface layer is impinged on breakwater transmission in im is less than that in sm in the former case hence in this incident case we infer that either more dissipation of wave energy occurs or as the lower fluid layer is near the mound bottom wave energy may be trapped between the mound and porous structure the subsequent figures display results for bottom profiles in eq 35 figs 10 a d show the variation of scattering coefficients against width p 1 b of the porous breakwater for different values of depth ratio h 3 h 1 in this case it may be observed that the trend of reflection and transmission coefficients of sm and im is interchanged between figs 5 and 10 and the amount of reflection in both modes is more or less the same with respect to p 1 b however it is remarkable that in this incident case the transmission in im is less than that in the first incident case which is evident from figs 5 b and 10 d moreover with respect to different depth ratio a change appears in the transmission of im that is for any fixed width of the porous structure less transmission in im occurs when the two depth levels are relatively close as in fig 10 d this is in contrast to case of incident surface wave which can be compared from fig 5 b further from figs 5 a and 10 c breakwater of smaller width reflects little more wave energy in im in this incidence case as compared with the amount of reflection in sm in the previous incident case in fig 11 scattering coefficients are plotted against non dimensional width p 1 b of the porous structure for a particular case of varying interface depth level d h 1 bottom profile 35 with α 2 with depth ratio h 3 h 1 0 35 is applied for the results in fig 11 c for a fixed d h 1 value it can be seen that the variation in reflection of im appears for smaller width up to p 1 b 2 it is also true in the case of sm as in fig 11 a moreover the position of interface also affects reflection of waves for a fixed width of porous breakwater figs 11 c and d show that when the interface depth is very near the bottom i e d h 1 0 3 higher reflection and less transmission in im takes place for larger width of the breakwater when p 1 b is fixed we find that the order in which reflection coefficient varies with d h 1 differs from the order of variation in d h 1 this is due to oscillatory nature in reflection of waves with respect to interface depth as illustrated in fig 3 of chamberlain and porter 2005 the reflection in im is higher for d h 1 0 3 since lower layer is near the bottom for this value at the same time less wave reflection occurs in sm due to less energy transmission from im to sm thus the results demonstrates that the influence of a position of interface depth is accounted for a breakwater of not only smaller width but also of larger width fig 12 displays the scattering coefficients versus porosity parameter of the breakwater for different depth ratio h 3 h 1 the results clearly show a known fact that a porous medium of smaller porosity reflects much amount of wave energy whereas a porous medium of larger porosity reflects little amount of wave energy however the results reveal significant changes in reflection of sm and im due to varying depth ratio h 3 h 1 from figs 12 c and d for smaller value of depth ratio there is higher reflection and lower transmission in im respectively figs 12 a and b exhibit that smaller depth ratio leads to higher reflection as well as transmission in sm 4 2 wave trapping in this subsection wave trapping by the porous breakwater placed at finite distance from impermeable wall on lee side is studied in two layer fluid of varying depth the two reflection coefficients k r 11 and k r 21 for the incident case of surface wave whereas the coefficients k r 12 and k r 22 for the incident case of interfacial wave are analyzed moreover the wave induced forces k f i for i 1 2 on wall are plotted for different parameters the non dimensional force k f i is expressed as in behera and sahoo 2014 by 36 k f i i ρ ω h 3 0 ϕ v x z d z ρ g d h 1 the superscripts 1 and 2 assigned to k f i refer to incidence of surface and interfacial waves respectively 4 2 1 wave trapping due to incident progressive wave along surface layer figs 13 a and b present reflection coefficients k r 11 and k r 21 of sm and im respectively against incident wave angle θ for different h 3 h 1 values the parametric values t 4 s w λ 1 0 15 b λ 1 0 2 f 1 l h 1 1 l 1 λ 1 0 are taken from zhu and chwang 2001 who studied the present model for a single layer fluid fig 13 a reveals angles of minimum reflection in sm for each value of h 3 h 1 the phenomenon is similar to the one shown in fig 6 of zhu and chwang 2001 at the angles of minimum reflection more wave may be trapped in the chamber between breakwater and wall the minimum in reflection increases as the depth ratio decreases however the minimum in reflection occurs for higher angles 60 when depth ratio decreases which is in contrast to the results in the fig 6 of zhu and chwang 2001 thus for two layer fluid the minimum in reflection occurs for higher angles whereas it occurs for smaller angles for single layer fluid which may be due to resonant interaction between waves in sm and im from fig 13 b interfacial waves are reflected effectively by the breakwater and also minimum in reflection of im occurs for some values of h 3 h 1 at certain angle figs 14 a and b display reflection coefficients k r 11 and k r 21 of sm and im respectively against incident wave angle θ for different values of chamber width w λ 1 the parametric values t 4 s h 3 h 1 0 75 b λ 1 0 2 f 1 l h 1 1 l 1 λ 1 0 are used for the results fig 14 a brings out that for certain wave angles minimum reflection in sm happens for any chamber width w λ 1 at which more wave shall be trapped it is remarkable that the number of minima in reflection increases as the chamber width becomes wider which implies wider chambers can trap much wave energy due to an increase in w λ 1 standing waves are generally formed and this occurrence leads to an increase in minima in wave reflection for wider chamber higher reflection in im is found around incident angle 40 figs 15 a and b depict reflection coefficients of sm and im versus chamber width w λ 1 for different values of depth ratio h 3 h 1 from fig 15 a reflection coefficient k r 11 possesses periodic nature with respect to chamber width reflection in sm increases with the increase in depth ratio h 3 h 1 at the same time the number of minima in reflection decreases on the other hand there is no periodicity in the reflection of im from fig 15 b reflection in im has sharp peaks at smaller values of h 3 h 1 with varying chamber width which refers to a resonant motion in surface wave due to interaction between waves reflected by the wall and porous breakwater a similar phenomenon was noticed earlier by medina rodríguez and silva 2018 in the study of oblique wave scattering by a trench in seabed before a wall in a two layer fluid fig 16 is plotted to show the reflection coefficients of sm and im versus chamber width w λ 1 for different values of time period t it is observed from fig 16 a that k r 11 of sm is periodic in nature with respect to w λ 1 for any time period reflection in sm increases as time period increases yet the changes in k r 11 with respect to h 3 h 1 in fig 15 a distinguish with that in fig 16 a with respect to time period since the number of minima and maxima in k r 11 does not alter as time period changes as observed in fig 15 b im has sharp peaks for different time periods in fig 16 b fig 17 displays variations in reflection coefficients k r 11 and k r 21 with h 3 h 1 when different chamber width w λ 1 is considered reflection in sm is found to increase as h 3 h 1 increases moreover it attains more oscillatory behavior with an increase in w λ 1 thus it brings out that for larger values of w λ 1 both minimum and maximum of reflection occurs in sm at many depth ratios but reflection in im decays with increasing h 3 h 1 im is highly reflected by the bottom for wider chamber widths the resulting force on wall is shown in fig 18 as a function of incident angle θ for different values of a depth ratio h 3 h 1 b chamber width w λ 1 and as a function of chamber width w λ 1 for different values of c depth ratio h 3 h 1 and d time period t the values of other parameters are the same as used for figs 13 16 respectively here reflection coefficients in figs 13 16 the wave induced force in figs 18 a d are co related respectively that is higher reflection corresponds to lower force on the wall and the other way around thus from 18 a when the depth levels are far from each other higher reflection and less force on wall can be achieved moreover for most of wave angles smaller chamber widths for example w λ 1 0 15 may be suitable since they let the wall experience less force which is evident form fig 18 b figs 18 c and d provide optimum chamber width w λ 1 for each value of h 3 h 1 and time period for which minimum force on wall is attained 4 2 2 wave trapping due to incident progressive wave along interface layer fig 19 demonstrates the reflection coefficients k r 12 and k r 22 as functions of chamber width w λ 1 for different values of depth ratio h 3 h 1 when waves are impinging on the porous structure under the incidence of im fig 19 a depicts the occurrence of subharmonic peaks between consecutive harmonic peaks which is due to the interaction of waves in surface layer with that of waves in interface layer unlike the periodic nature of reflection coefficient as in fig 15 a in this incident case reflection coefficient k r 12 of sm in fig 19 a is varying almost periodically and it changes very sharply as chamber width w λ 1 varies for each value of depth ratio a similar phenomenon is also seen in the reflection coefficient of im in fig 19 b which is due to the resonant interaction between waves the occurrence of subharmonic peaks between consecutive harmonic peaks in reflection coefficient in fig 19 are due to the reflection of individual waves in sm and im whilst the harmonic peaks are due the combined effect of reflection pattern of waves in both the modes these harmonic peaks are generated almost at periodic intervals due to the back and forth motion of waves within the chamber between the wall and the barrier fig 20 depicts force k f 2 on wall against a w λ 1 and b p 1 b for different values of depth ratio h 3 h 1 fig 20 a is provided to show the resulting force co relating with the reflection in fig 19 in contrast to fig 18 c k f 2 in fig 20 a is not varying periodically and the amount of force on wall in this incidence case is less thus it deduces that wall gets higher amount of force in the first incident case the variations in the forces exerted on the wall in surface and interface modes are observed to be non periodic in nature which is due to the superposition of waves in sm and im generated due to incident wave in im moreover as in fig 18 c interfacial waves exert higher force on wall in the case of nearly flat bottom in fig 20 b force on wall decreases as width of breakwater increases since much attenuation of wave energy occurs by the breakwater for any depth ratio however for smaller values of p 1 b wall experiences higher force for depth levels which are close to each other 5 conclusions in this paper a model of oblique wave scattering and trapping by a thick porous structure in a two layer ocean is investigated ocean depth is assumed to vary in a finite interval and different configurations of ocean bottom are considered in this investigation wave incidence in each layer is considered to understand the reflection and transmission of waves by the porous structure due to wave wave interaction as a first profile of bottom topography the symmetric mound is considered according to chamberlain and porter 2005 k r 12 k r 21 and k t 12 k t 21 due to symmetric bottom however in this study symmetric property is preserved in reflection coefficient but not in transmission coefficient moreover when surface wave is impinging on porous structure the transmission of sm is found be higher than transmission of im when interfacial wave is impinging on the porous structure next a class of step type bottom profiles is applied to this model when a plane sloping bottom is assumed the angle of zero reflection in surface wave exists however at this angle more wave energy is dissipated by the porous structure in the case of a bottom profile which joints upper horizontal depth level smoothly α 1 interfacial waves are less reflected and more dissipated by the porous structure bottom profiles of concave up show higher reflection in surface and interfacial waves for a fixed thickness of breakwater transmission in sm decreases as depth ratio decreases in the case of surface wave incidence whereas it is in opposite trend in im in the case of interfacial wave incidence influence of different locations of the interface is shown in the present study in the situation of surface wave incidence it brings out that interfacial wave is less transmitted when the interface depth is near the free surface for all incident angles in the case of interfacial wave incidence higher reflection and lower transmission is noticed in im when the interface is close to the bottom moreover wave trapping between porous structure and a rigid wall is analyzed reflection coefficient as a function of the angle of incidence is plotted for different values of depth ratio of h 3 h 1 it is found that for h 3 h 1 1 minimum wave reflection occurs for higher angles in the present case whereas it occurs for smaller angles in the case of a single layer fluid as shown in zhu and chwang 2001 in the case of incidence of surface wave for very smaller values of h 3 h 1 most of wave energy is reflected back for all incident angles as a result less wave force is exerted on the wall for larger values of depth ratio critical angles are found at which zero reflection occurs and it implies that the wall experiences a higher force however the amount of force may vary based on depth levels in the incidence of surface wave wider gaps w λ 1 lead to occurrence of minimum reflection at multiple angles it is noticed that force on the wall is high for angles around 35 since minimum reflection is attained at these angles smaller depth ratios give rise to minimum force on wall and vice versa reflection in sm increases as time period increases and due to this force on wall decreases when h 3 h 1 1 reflection in sm enhances whereas reflection in im decays sharp variations in reflection occur for waves in im at different gap length w λ 1 for smaller values of depth ratio which may be due to resonant interaction between waves within the chamber of wave trapping moreover the gap w λ 1 induces resonant interaction between the two waves as a result it causes an occurrence of subharmonic peaks between consecutive harmonic peaks hence we infer that the findings obtained from the present work may be useful for understanding wave interaction with a porous structure in a two layer ocean of varying depth declaration of competing interest the authors
