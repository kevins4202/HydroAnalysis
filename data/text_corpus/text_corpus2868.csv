14340,this research exemplifies the effectual mineralization of bisphenol a bpa persisting in thermal cash receipts thru feasible integrated electro oxidation cum biodegradation about 42 mg of bpa was eluted from 1 g of thermal cash receipts at supra alkaline conditions the non biodegradable eluted bpa was electro oxidized in a membrane less cell employing ti tio2 iro2 ruo2 anode and ti as cathode the optimized process parameters were of ph 9 chloride concentration of 17 mm applied current density of 20 ma cm 2 and reaction time of 10 min owing to it the bpa were electro transformed into dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone dihydroxy benzoic acid 4 hydroxy benzoic acid trihydroxy benzene and 2 hydroxy proponoic acid by the united smack of ocl ions and oh radicals in silico toxicity analysis revealed that intermediates namely dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone dihydroxy benzoic acid and trihydroxy benzene exhibited mutagenicity and carcinogenicity the biodegradability of the electro transformed bpa solution tweaked to 0 459 further the electro transformed bpa products were degraded using acclimatized naphthalene degrading microbial consortia by 91 9 in 50 h employing partial packed bed reactor the toxic intermediates formed after electro oxidation were converted into aliphatic compounds such as maleyl acetate malate fumarate acetopyruvate oxodipic acid by the bacterial enzyme system on the whole about 91 cod and 56 toc removal was obtained by this unified scheme it was also confirmed that the final effluent exhibited zero toxicity and doesn t pose estrogenic activity via in silico toxicity analysis keywords thermal cash receipts bisphenol a electro transformation partial packed bed reactor and in silico toxicity 1 introduction bisphenol a 4 4 propane 2 2 diyl diphenol xenobiotic estrogen mimicker roots metabolic dis regulation in mammals the worldwide production of bpa was estimated to be of 2 106 metric tons and its production is increasing until recent years 1 it has been widely used in the production of polycarbate plastics and expoy resins even though it has a 2 10 3 times of lower affinity on the estrogen receptor erα and erβ than estradiol 2 its estrogen correlated activity causes potential negative impact on physical neurological behavioral and reproductive development 3 4 its toxic effect is highly pronounced even at lower concentrations of 1 10 0 mg l bpa is regularly used in the manufacture of thermal cash receipts as color developers due to its availability efficacy and low cost 5 the primary exposure routes of bpa from thermal cash receipts to environment were via consumer use and largely by recycling these are generally transformed into various recycled paper products containing bpa the value added sludge generated during paper recycling also contains bpa which is used for agriculture activities 5 the recycling paper mill effluent entering the waste water treatment plants are not completely treated owing to the inefficiency of the most of the waste water treatment plants to degrade bpa and this has resulted in release of these contaminants into the aquatic water bodies along with the treated waste water 6 ever fascinating electrochemical oxidation technology has been researched for transformation mineralization of bio recalcitrant bpa via anodic oxidation anodes such as graphite 7 pt pbo2 ti 8 sno2 ti 9 sb sno2 ti bdd ti ruo2 ti 10 pbo2 sb2o2 sno2 ti ruo2 iro2 ti 11 co3o2 β pbo2 ti 12 have been studied for direct and indirect electrochemical oxidation of bpa emerging novel electrodes such as pbo2 ti ionic liquid electrode 13 n doped graphene aerogels 14 graphene doped carbon black gas electrode 15 multi walled carbon nano tube paste 16 and n doped reduced graphene oxide 17 electrode have been researched to enhance the performance of electrochemical oxidation towards bpa the electrochemical oxidation of bpa by graphite and noble electrodes results in formation of insoluble electro polymer over the electrode and substantially causes electrode deactivation 9 18 the mineralization of bpa to co2 can be achieved by employing high oxygen overpotential anodes such as bdd or ti sb sno2 at demanding higher current densities 10 added with the above mass transfer limitations of adsorbed oh radicals mandate the requirement of large area electrodes 19 the by products of direct oxidation mainly aromatic and quinone types are resistant to further degradation by electrochemical means 8 the indirect electro oxidation employing active chlorine process was also investigated for bpa the formation of low molecular weight chlorinated compounds such as halo acetic acids chloro alkanes and chloro phenols of bpa have been reported 20 21 these forms of chlorinated compounds are also resistant to electrochemical degradation and have increased estrogenic activity 22 these limitations of anodic oxidation hinder the complete mineralization of bpa at nominal electrolytic conditions eco friendly biodegradation of bpa has been investigated by employing microbes such as sphingomonas sp 23 achromobacter xylosoxidans 24 arthrobacter sp 25 cupriavidus basilensis jf1 26 bacillus sp 27 isolated from different sites activated sludge systems 28 membrane bioreactors 29 immobilized microbes 30 indigenous bacterial communities 31 algal bacterial system 32 aerobic granular sludge 33 and genetic manipulation 34 have been attempted to meet the low biodegradability as well as to enhance the bpa degradation rate of the strains recently a recombinant e coli exhibiting bpa binding peptide has been developed for adsorption and removal of bpa 35 36 however still the slow degradation kinetics insignificant bpa removal concerns over eco safety of the genetically modified organisms and increase in estrogenic activity after biodegradation limits the greener biological approach 37 38 in order to effectively depollute the bio recalcitrant bpa a unified mode of bpa degradation by indirect electrochemical oxidation i eo cum bio degradation has been attempted mendum et al 2011 and gehring et al 2004 have reported the existence of bpa in thermal cash receipts 39 40 to the light of the knowledge papers are not available insisting the mineralization of bpa from thermal cash receipts and this is the first paper to report on combined electro bio degradation of bpa specifically eluted from thermal cash receipts therefore this study was attempted in the view of curtailing the release of bpa during recycling of thermal cash receipts primarily chloride mediated electro oxidation was performed on bpa eluted from thermal cash receipts and the resulting electro transformed solution was subjected to biodegradation the mechanism of bpa degradation has been analyzed for the first time in integrated approach the surge in estrogenic activity of the bpa degradation products has been reported by many investigators 27 37 38 41 42 hence the assessment of acute toxicity of the degraded bpa by products is critical to ensure the eco friendliness of the degradation course in this study for the first time in silico toxicity and estrogenic activity of the degraded bpa by products have been initiated 2 materials and method 2 1 elution of bpa from thermal cash receipts the printed thermal cash receipts were collected from a local automatic telling machine center in karaikudi tamil nadu india for elution 1 g of thermal cash receipts were added to 1000 ml of distilled water at ph 11 kept under stirring for 24 h the mobility of

et al 2016 44 while the ti mesh was purchased from titan chennai india the electrodes were oriented perpendicularly to the electrochemical cell the anode and cathode potentials were measured during the experiments using saturated calomel electrode the eluted bpa from thermal cash receipts were made into 100 ppm and used for the electro oxidation experiments an ac dc power supply was used to apply required current between the electrodes the experiments were optimized at different current densities 5 20 40 60 and 80 ma cm 2 chloride concentration 4 9 17 25 and 34 mm and ph 2 5 7 9 and 11

consortia utilized for degradation of aromatic intermediates in textile effluent by priyadharshini et al 2016 were exploited in this work after acclimatization 46 the modified procedure of pramila et al 2015 was adopted for acclimatization of consortia in electrolyzed bpa e bpa an aliquots of 1 106 cfu ml 1 of naphthalene degrading consortia were inoculated into 25 e bpa solutions containing enrichment medium peptone 5 g l 1 nacl 5 g l 1 beef extract 1 5 g l 1 and yeast extract 1 5 g l 1 and cultured at 37 c and 120 rpm until the cells concentration reached an optical density od close to

was inoculated into the pu foam containing medium and left for 10 days to ensure biofilm formation over the pu foam the amount of cells loaded into the pu foam was quantified by periodic serial dilution the field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem analysis was performed to visualize the biofilm formed on the pu foam the microbe laden active foam was then employed for degradation of e bpa solution the microbe active pu foam was added to 100 ml of e bpa and incubated at 37 c for 5 days and the cod of the solution was checked periodically 2 3 4 partial packed bed reactor for biodegradation of e bpa a partial packed bed reactor was designed to ensure the efficient mineralization of e bpa employing bacterial consortia the pu foam was used as biofilm carrier acrylic based home made cylindrical packed bed reactor was used for the studies the dimensions of the reactor are of 52 mm external diameter and 260 mm length with a total capacity of 450 ml the reactor has an outlet and inlet where the both ends were connected to reservoir the recirculation of the e bpa was ensured with the help of peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 5 ml min 1 initially the reactor was filled with pu foam and enrichment medium containing 25 of e bpa and 3 of acclimatized bacterial consortia was passed into the reactor and allowed to ensure biofilm formation for 10 days during the biofilm formation the enrichment media was changed periodically to ensure active growth of biofilm over the pu foam after which the enrichment media was discarded and the biofilm was adapted to increasing strengths of e bpa finally 1 l of 100 e bpa was filled into the reactor and biodegradation of e bpa was monitored in recirculation mode the cod of the solution was analyzed periodically 2 4

elution and characterization of bpa from thermal cash receipts under supra alkaline condition 42 mg of bpa was eluted from 1 g 25 42 cm2 of printed thermal cash receipts supporting information si table 1 this corresponds to 1 7 mg of bpa present per cm2 of the thermal cash receipts the reported quantity of bpa in 1 g of thermal receipts from literature is of about 9 21 mg g 1 50 51 the 42 mg g 1 of bpa reported in this study is quite higher as the amount of bpa present in the thermal cash receipts varies depending on its intended use and manufacturer the uv vis spectra of the eluted solution exhibited two characteristic peaks around 276 and 225 nm similar to that of commercial bpa the absorption peaks corresponds to π π transition of the phenol moiety and indicates the presence of bisphenol in the eluted solution fig 1 a the congener of bisphenol was identified by gc ms analysis as bpa and it had a retention time of 37 68 with m z of 228 fig 1 b and si table 2 the physio chemical characteristics of the eluted solution containing bpa 100 mg l 1 is given in table 1 3 2 indirect electrochemical oxidation 3 2 1 optimization of nacl concentration the i eo was performed for 300 ml of eluted bpa 100 mg l 1 in diverse chloride concentrations of 4 9 17 25 and 34 mm the effect of chloride ion concentration on cod removal e bpa transformation and electrical energy consumption is shown in fig 2 a about 90 of bpa transformation was observed at all studied chloride ion concentration indicating that the minimal amount of chloride ions were sufficient for electro transformation of bpa however unsatisfactory cod reduction 27 5 was observed at 4 mm of cl ions at chloride ion concentrations of 9 and 17 mm the cod removal percentage was of 45 9 and 54 7 at concentrations of 25 and 34 mm the cod removal efficiency was insignificant it is understood that for 100 mg ml 1 of studied bpa concentration about 17 mm of chloride concentration was sufficient to achieve partial cod reduction above which it was insignificant increase in chloride concentration substantially decreased the electrochemical energy consumption the energy consumption was of 0 0175 kw h l 1 to achieve 55 of cod reduction employing 17 mm of chloride ions the optimized chloride concentration was selected for further studies 3 2 2 optimization of ph the i eo of eluted bpa was carried out under various ph 2 5 7 9 and 11 at constant chloride concentration of 17 mm and current density of 20 ma cm 2 for 2 h the effect of ph on cod removal and bpa transformation is shown in fig 2 b the 100 mg l 1 of eluted bpa exhibiting ph of 9 was prepared after dilution of the stock which had a ph of 11 the bpa transformation and cod removal was about 99 and 55 respectively in all studied ph the effect of ph on bpa transformation and cod removal was inconsequential thus the i eo was carried out without changing the actual ph of the eluted bpa with the concentration of 100 mg l 1 3 2 3 optimization of current density the experiment was conducted at various current densities such as 5 20 40 60 and 80 ma cm 2 at ph 9 with the chloride concentration of 17 mm for 2 h the effect of the current densities on cod removal and bpa transformation is shown in fig 2 c at current density of 5 ma cm 2 the cod removal was insignificant and only about 35 of bpa transformation was observed the cod removal percentage incremented with increase in current density upto 60 ma cm2 above which it turned out to be insignificant about 99 bpa transformation was observed from 20 to 80 ma cm 2 where the electrical power consumption increased from 5 ma cm 2to 80 ma cm 2 the percentage of bpa transformation rose from 5 ma cm 2 to 20 ma cm 2 after that it became inconsequential it is obvious that there is a complete transformation of bpa and partial removal of cod at 20 ma cm 2 was observed the electrical energy consumption for the optimized current density was 0 7kwh l 1 3 2 4 performance of i eo under optimized conditions under optimized conditions of chloride concentration 17 mm ph 9 and current density of 20 ma cm 2 the i eo was able to remove only 53 of cod in 60 min in initial 10 min of i eo the bi index of the solutions increased from 0 to 0 55 and then decreased to 0 in course of 240 min of i eo the possible transformation of non biodegradable bpa to readily biodegradable components increases the bod to 100 mg l 1 and the bi of the solution to 0 45 during 10 min the decrease in bi to 0 after 20 min is majorly due to the deprivation and degradation of biodegradable organic content by i eo as seen from the fig 2 d the bi falls after 10 min of i eo where the cod removal is only of 25 and the bi is of around 0 45 hence the electro oxidation process was carried out only for 10 min for further biodegradation the anodic potential and cathodic potential of the electrodes were of 1 2 v vs she and 1 0 v vs she the residual chlorine concentration was about 35 mg l 1 the table 1 lists out the physio chemical characteristics of the bpa solution after 10 min of i eo the eluted bpa appeared turbid with a whitish pink color pink color due to the presence of dyes in printed thermal cash receipts whereas after i eo the pinkish color disappeared due to the possible decolourization of dyes by ocl ions the toc reduction was only up to 30 the cellulose of 130 mg l 1 eluted along with bpa was not degraded during i eo and this contributes to the turbid appearance of the solution however the concentration of aox increased at 10 min of i eo to 64 5 mg l 1 which may be due to the formation chlorinated aromatic compounds 3 3 biodegradation the growth of bacterial consortia in eluted bpa and electrolyzed bpa is shown in fig 3 a in eluted bpa the cell od decreased after few hours of inoculation and reached a value of 0 1 in 120 h this shows that the bacterial consortia were not able to withstand the bpa toxicity and supports the non biodegradability of the eluted bpa solution in case of e bpa the cell od slowly increased from the initial inoculum od 0 3 and maintained a stationary state in the studied time of 120 h this evidences supports that the previous claim i e i eo increased the biodegradability of the bpa solution 3 3 1 batch mode of degradation the immobilization of bacterial consortia in the pu foam was visualized by fe sem studies fig 4 shows the images of non active foam and microbe active foam the biofilm of the naphthalene degrading bacterial consortia was developed over the foam in 10 days of incubation from the table 2 it is evident that about 3 7 108 colony forming units of bacteria were enumerated in 100 mg of pu foam at 10 days of incubation the percentage of cod removal by employing free cells as well immobilized active microbial foam is shown in fig 3 b the bacterial consortia removed cod in eluted bpa by only 37 in 120 h the free bacterial consortia were able to remove cod by 71 in 120 h however the microbe active foams were able to reduce cod by 80 in 100 h the cod removal via adsorption by foam accounted to 20 only from the results the increased amount of cod removal by microbe active foam was noticed it is because the foams provide micro environment for bacterial biofilm and it facilitates the adsorption of organic compounds over the foam this favours the degradation of electro transformed bpa products effectively the bacterial biofilm over the foam withstands the toxicity created by the chloride mediated electro oxidation compounds compared to free cells 3 3 2 partial packed bed reactor for degradation of e bpa the partial packed bed bioreactor employing pu foam as microbe carrier was designed to increase the cod removal efficiency of the bacterial consortia fig 5 the reservoir was continuously aerated to ensure sufficient oxygen supply to the bacterial cells the outlet of the reactor was re circulated throughout the study the e bpa adsorption by the non active foam accounted to 16 of cod reduction in 30 h fig 5b above which no significant cod reduction was observed this shows that the foam was saturated with e bpa within 30 h during initial run employing e bpa with microbe active foam about 60 cod removal was observed in 50 h upon consecutive cycle 2nd 3rd run the cod reduction increased to 80 and 91 9 respectively in 50 h the increase in cod reduction about 90 within 50 h upon consecutive cycle was due to the adaptability of the bacteria towards the e bpa environment the continuous aeration as well as micro environment provided by the pu foam favours rapid degradation of e bpa also the adsorption of aromatic compounds present in the i eo solution upon the foam also stipulates the degradation of i eo intermediates by the immobilized biofilm the cellulose present in the e bpa solution was reduced to 15 mg l 1 suggesting the bacterial utilization by cellulose enzyme complex the toc of the bio processed solution was of 24 57 mg l 1 the aox concentration also drastically reduced after bio process to 12 6 mg l 1 suggesting the conversion of chlorinated electro by products to non chlorinated products table 1 3 4 mechanism of bpa degradation by unified method 3 4 1 in indirect electro oxidation the anodic oxidation of eluted bpa in presence of chloride ions occurs majorly via ocl ions and partly by oh0 radicals the chloride ions are oxidized directly at anode surface to form chlorine which is hydrated to yield hypochlorous acid the hypochlorous acid dissociates at alkaline ph to generate ocl ions 52 these hypochlorite ions with an oxidizing potential of 0 89 v vs she reacts with bpa leading to its transformation 5 2 cl a n o d e o cl 2 2 e 6 c l 2 h 2 o h o c l h c l 7 2 h 2 o 4 e c a t h o d e r h 2 2 o h 8 h o c l p h 7 5 h o c l in case of active anodes employed the oxidation of water molecules leads to the formation of physisorbed hydroxyl radical 53 these m oh radicals also may react with bpa leading to its electro transformation the electrochemical oxidation pathway of bpa is proposed in fig 6 from gc ms analysis the retention time of the observed compounds and their m z is provided in table 3 the reaction of electro generated ocl ions on bpa primarily generated tetrachlorobisphenol a t1 tentative step which was transformed to dichloro 4 2 hydroxy propan 2 yl phenol t2 and tri chlorophenol t3 54 the dichloro 4 2 hydroxy propan 2 yl phenol undergoes dehydration to yield dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone d1 determined step rt 21 9 m z 203 9 the action of oh0 on bpa resulted in formation of 3 hydroxy 1 3 5 hexadiene t4 and 4 2 hydroxy propan 2 yl phenol t5 which further degraded to 4 hydroxy benzoic acid d2 rt 11 6 m z 281 as tms derivative 41 the oxidation of oh0 on 4 hydroxy benzoic acid yielded 2 hydroxy propanoic acid d3 rt 8 5 m z 235 6 as one of the final by products of electro oxidation the combined action of ocl ions and oh0 may also resulted in formation of dihydroxy benzoic acid d4 rt 26 1 m z 385 as tms derivative and trihydroxy benzene d5 rt 15 3 m z 341 as tms derivative 3 4 2 in biodegradation the intermediates formed after electro oxidation was metabolized to aliphatic organic compound which contributes to cod reduction the elucidated biodegradation pathway for electro transformed bpa intermediates is sketched in fig 7 whereas the m z and retention time of the determined compound observed in gc ms is shown in table 4 the intermediates were metabolized by the sequential action of oxidative enzymes mono and di oxygenases expressed by the bacterial consortia the dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone was transformed to dichlorophenol 55 which is hydroxylated by the hydroxylase enzyme to dichloro catechol t1 tentative step it was acted by dioxygenase to produce dichloro muconic acid t2 via ortho cleavage and is further transformed by series of enzymes to chloro maleyl acetate d1 determined step rt 9 8 and m z 191 1 56 the trichloro phenol was converted to chloro hydroxy quinol t3 by the action of momo oxygenases which was then acted upon by dioxygenase to form chloro maleyl acetate d1 rt 9 8 and m z 191 1 the chloro maleyl acetate formed from the metabolism of dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone and trichlorophenol was converted to maleyl acetate d2 rt 13 8 and m z 159 by the removal of chloride ions via dehalogenase enzyme 56 this is implicated in reduction of aox concentration from 4 5 to 12 6 mg l 1 after biodegradation the hydroxyl benzoic acid was converted to oxoadipic acid d3 rt 11 5 and m z 17 by the catalysis of mono and di oxygenases via oxo adipate pathway present in the bacteria consortia 57 the dihydroxy benzoic acid was converted to maleyl pyurate t3 by the catalysis of di oxygenase the maleyl pyruvate was isomerized to form fumaryl pyruvate which was transformed into malate d4 rt 14 3 and m z 117 and fumarate d5 rt 8 0 and m z 135 by hydroxylases 58 the trihydroxy benzene was hydroxylated to form tetra hydroxy benzene d6 rt 11 7 and m z 145 1 which was cleaved by dioxygenase to form di hydroxy hexadiene diolic acid d7 rt 9 7 and m z 174 which was further cleaved to yield aceto pyruvate d8 rt 12 8 and m z 131 these aliphatic compounds such as maleyl acetate oxoadipic acid malate fumarate and aceto pyruvate enter into tca cycle and get converted into co2 this results in reduction of cod from 217 5 to 24 mg l 1 table 1 the concentration of cellulose reduced from 130 mg l 1 to 1 5 mg l 1 due the utilization of cellulose by the bacteria consortia and so the final solution appeared colourless 3 5 insilico analysis the insilico toxicity and estrogenic analysis were performed only for the products determined after i eo it was not performed for the determined final products formed by biodegradation as it generally enters into tca cycle for bacterial catabolic processes and were converted to co2 3 5 1 insilico toxicity analysis the insilico toxicity analysis performed for determined products after electro oxidation for different toxicity parameters by toxtree analaysis is given in table 5 the oral toxicity predicted by carmer rules was high for initial bpa dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone and for tri hydroxy benzene the 4 hydroxy benzoic acid dihydroxy benzoic acid exhibited low level oral toxicity the bpa were estimated as less inert compounds i e not reactive but are slightly more toxic than baseline toxicity by verhaar scheme the other intermediates were not possible to be classified by this scheme the dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone dihydroxy benzoic acid and tri hydroxy benzene exhibited alerts for in vitro mutagenicity by ames test the dihydroxy benzoic acid and trihydroxy benzene exhibited carcinogenicity in rat few compounds namely dihydroxy benzoic acid and tri hydroxy benzene exhibited skin irritation the in silico biodegradability assay predicted the bpa and dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone as persistent compounds while other intermediates being easily biodegradable apart from bpa the other compounds exhibited low risk for herg inhibition this shows that the few products of electro oxidation namely dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone trihydroxy benzene and dihydroxy benzoic acid exhibited toxicity and this suggests that the i eo employed must be complimented with the biological process to generate non toxic effluent 3 5 2 insilico estrogenicity the in silico estrogenicity of the products formed after electro oxidation were evaluated by hex docking suite and is shown in fig 8 and table 6 the h bond interaction with the estrogen receptor was evidenced in bpa dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone 4 hydroxy benzoic acid dihydroxy benzoic acid and trihydroxy benzene the e value of the estrogen estrogen receptor complex is of 859 and the e value for bpa estrogen receptor complex is of 625 the electrooxidized products complexed with estrogen receptor displayed lesser e value from the table 6 it is clear that only bpa had estrogenic activity and other eo products doesn t have any estrogen like activity the bpa docked with estrogen receptor with 2 h bond at leu549 and ser 527 with a bond length of 2 01 and 2 80 in α and β helix of the receptor the docking of bpa estrogen receptor was exactly in the active site where estrogen binds and hence it attributes estrogenicity the other eo products also displayed h bond interaction with the estrogen receptor however the residues involved in h bonding and the active sites were different from that of the bpa hence the eluted bpa alone displayed estrogen like h bond interaction it is clear that the determined electro oxidized product doesn t exhibit any estrogen like activity 4 conclusion the degradation of bpa eluted from thermal cash receipts was investigated in an eco friendly approach about 1 7 mg of bpa was eluted from 1 cm2 of thermal cash receipts under optimized i eo conditions 17 mm of chloride ph 9 current density 20 ma cm2 99 of bpa was electro transformed and only 25 cod reduction was observed the bi increased from 0 0 to 0 45 the end products of i eo include dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone 4 hydroxy benzoic acid 2 hydroxy propanoic acid dihydroxy benzoic acid and trihydroxy benzene the active microbial foam employed in partial packed bed bioreactor was more effective in reducing the cod above 90 the eluted bpa and the electro transformed dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone alone exhibited toxicity estrogenic activity was not visualized for the i eo products the formed toxic i eo products were metabolized by bacterial consortia to co2 the final compounds of bacterial degradation were the precursors of tca cycle those were non toxic as well as don t pose estrogenic activity about 91 9 cod and 56 toc reduction were observed during combined eo and bio process table 1 this strongly suggests that the unified mode of electro cum bio degradation is highly efficient in mineralizing the potent estrogen mimicker bpa acknowledgments priyadharshini aravind

14340,this research exemplifies the effectual mineralization of bisphenol a bpa persisting in thermal cash receipts thru feasible integrated electro oxidation cum biodegradation about 42 mg of bpa was eluted from 1 g of thermal cash receipts at supra alkaline conditions the non biodegradable eluted bpa was electro oxidized in a membrane less cell employing ti tio2 iro2 ruo2 anode and ti as cathode the optimized process parameters were of ph 9 chloride concentration of 17 mm applied current density of 20 ma cm 2 and reaction time of 10 min owing to it the bpa were electro transformed into dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone dihydroxy benzoic acid 4 hydroxy benzoic acid trihydroxy benzene and 2 hydroxy proponoic acid by the united smack of ocl ions and oh radicals in silico toxicity analysis revealed that intermediates namely dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone dihydroxy benzoic acid and trihydroxy benzene exhibited mutagenicity and carcinogenicity the biodegradability of the electro transformed bpa solution tweaked to 0 459 further the electro transformed bpa products were degraded using acclimatized naphthalene degrading microbial consortia by 91 9 in 50 h employing partial packed bed reactor the toxic intermediates formed after electro oxidation were converted into aliphatic compounds such as maleyl acetate malate fumarate acetopyruvate oxodipic acid by the bacterial enzyme system on the whole about 91 cod and 56 toc removal was obtained by this unified scheme it was also confirmed that the final effluent exhibited zero toxicity and doesn t pose estrogenic activity via in silico toxicity analysis keywords thermal cash receipts bisphenol a electro transformation partial packed bed reactor and in silico toxicity 1 introduction bisphenol a 4 4 propane 2 2 diyl diphenol xenobiotic estrogen mimicker roots metabolic dis regulation in mammals the worldwide production of bpa was estimated to be of 2 106 metric tons and its production is increasing until recent years 1 it has been widely used in the production of polycarbate plastics and expoy resins even though it has a 2 10 3 times of lower affinity on the estrogen receptor erα and erβ than estradiol 2 its estrogen correlated activity causes potential negative impact on physical neurological behavioral and reproductive development 3 4 its toxic effect is highly pronounced even at lower concentrations of 1 10 0 mg l bpa is regularly used in the manufacture of thermal cash receipts as color developers due to its availability efficacy and low cost 5 the primary exposure routes of bpa from thermal cash receipts to environment were via consumer use and largely by recycling these are generally transformed into various recycled paper products containing bpa the value added sludge generated during paper recycling also contains bpa which is used for agriculture activities 5 the recycling paper mill effluent entering the waste water treatment plants are not completely treated owing to the inefficiency of the most of the waste water treatment plants to degrade bpa and this has resulted in release of these contaminants into the aquatic water bodies along with the treated waste water 6 ever fascinating electrochemical oxidation technology has been researched for transformation mineralization of bio recalcitrant bpa via anodic oxidation anodes such as graphite 7 pt pbo2 ti 8 sno2 ti 9 sb sno2 ti bdd ti ruo2 ti 10 pbo2 sb2o2 sno2 ti ruo2 iro2 ti 11 co3o2 β pbo2 ti 12 have been studied for direct and indirect electrochemical oxidation of bpa emerging novel electrodes such as pbo2 ti ionic liquid electrode 13 n doped graphene aerogels 14 graphene doped carbon black gas electrode 15 multi walled carbon nano tube paste 16 and n doped reduced graphene oxide 17 electrode have been researched to enhance the performance of electrochemical oxidation towards bpa the electrochemical oxidation of bpa by graphite and noble electrodes results in formation of insoluble electro polymer over the electrode and substantially causes electrode deactivation 9 18 the mineralization of bpa to co2 can be achieved by employing high oxygen overpotential anodes such as bdd or ti sb sno2 at demanding higher current densities 10 added with the above mass transfer limitations of adsorbed oh radicals mandate the requirement of large area electrodes 19 the by products of direct oxidation mainly aromatic and quinone types are resistant to further degradation by electrochemical means 8 the indirect electro oxidation employing active chlorine process was also investigated for bpa the formation of low molecular weight chlorinated compounds such as halo acetic acids chloro alkanes and chloro phenols of bpa have been reported 20 21 these forms of chlorinated compounds are also resistant to electrochemical degradation and have increased estrogenic activity 22 these limitations of anodic oxidation hinder the complete mineralization of bpa at nominal electrolytic conditions eco friendly biodegradation of bpa has been investigated by employing microbes such as sphingomonas sp 23 achromobacter xylosoxidans 24 arthrobacter sp 25 cupriavidus basilensis jf1 26 bacillus sp 27 isolated from different sites activated sludge systems 28 membrane bioreactors 29 immobilized microbes 30 indigenous bacterial communities 31 algal bacterial system 32 aerobic granular sludge 33 and genetic manipulation 34 have been attempted to meet the low biodegradability as well as to enhance the bpa degradation rate of the strains recently a recombinant e coli exhibiting bpa binding peptide has been developed for adsorption and removal of bpa 35 36 however still the slow degradation kinetics insignificant bpa removal concerns over eco safety of the genetically modified organisms and increase in estrogenic activity after biodegradation limits the greener biological approach 37 38 in order to effectively depollute the bio recalcitrant bpa a unified mode of bpa degradation by indirect electrochemical oxidation i eo cum bio degradation has been attempted mendum et al 2011 and gehring et al 2004 have reported the existence of bpa in thermal cash receipts 39 40 to the light of the knowledge papers are not available insisting the mineralization of bpa from thermal cash receipts and this is the first paper to report on combined electro bio degradation of bpa specifically eluted from thermal cash receipts therefore this study was attempted in the view of curtailing the release of bpa during recycling of thermal cash receipts primarily chloride mediated electro oxidation was performed on bpa eluted from thermal cash receipts and the resulting electro transformed solution was subjected to biodegradation the mechanism of bpa degradation has been analyzed for the first time in integrated approach the surge in estrogenic activity of the bpa degradation products has been reported by many investigators 27 37 38 41 42 hence the assessment of acute toxicity of the degraded bpa by products is critical to ensure the eco friendliness of the degradation course in this study for the first time in silico toxicity and estrogenic activity of the degraded bpa by products have been initiated 2 materials and method 2 1 elution of bpa from thermal cash receipts the printed thermal cash receipts were collected from a local automatic telling machine center in karaikudi tamil nadu india for elution 1 g of thermal cash receipts were added to 1000 ml of distilled water at ph 11 kept under stirring for 24 h the mobility of unreacted free bpa molecules from thermal cash receipts to the supra alkaline solution was quantified using high performance liquid chromatography hplc analysis at different time intervals the

ruo2 iro2 coated dimensionally stable ti mesh 11 x 4 cm and uncoated ti mesh 11 x 4 cm was used as anode and cathode respectively the ti iro2 ruo2 tio2 electrode was prepared as described by parmila et al 2016 44 while the ti mesh was purchased from titan chennai india the electrodes were oriented perpendicularly to the electrochemical cell the anode and cathode potentials were measured during the experiments using saturated calomel electrode the eluted bpa from thermal cash receipts were made into 100 ppm and used for the electro oxidation experiments an ac dc power supply was used to apply required current between the electrodes the experiments were optimized at different current densities 5 20 40 60 and 80 ma cm 2 chloride concentration 4 9 17 25 and 34 mm and ph 2 5 7 9 and 11 the electrolysis was carried out under stirring at 100 rpm for mass transfer under optimized conditions the amount of bpa transformed chemical oxygen demand cod removed and biodegradability index bi was estimated at different time intervals during electrolysis the rate bpa transformation was calculated by hplc analysis 2 3 biodegradation 2 3 1 acclimatization of naphthalene degrading consortia for biodegradation of electrolyzed bpa the residual bio toxic active chlorine species present after i eo were removed via sunlight exposure 45 and aimed for biodegradation the naphthalene degrading consortia utilized for degradation of aromatic intermediates in textile effluent by priyadharshini et al 2016 were exploited in this work after acclimatization 46 the modified procedure of pramila et al 2015 was adopted for acclimatization of consortia in electrolyzed bpa e bpa an aliquots of 1 106 cfu ml 1 of naphthalene degrading consortia were inoculated into 25 e bpa solutions containing enrichment medium peptone 5 g l 1 nacl 5 g l 1 beef extract 1 5 g l 1 and yeast extract 1 5 g l 1 and cultured at 37 c and 120 rpm until the cells concentration reached an optical density od close to

foam was cut into 1 cm2 dimensions and autoclaved a known amount of pu foam was added to 25 e bpa solution containing enrichment medium aliquots of 1 106 cfu ml 1 of acclimatized bacterial consortia was inoculated into the pu foam containing medium and left for 10 days to ensure biofilm formation over the pu foam the amount of cells loaded into the pu foam was quantified by periodic serial dilution the field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem analysis was performed to visualize the biofilm formed on the pu foam the microbe laden active foam was then employed for degradation of e bpa solution the microbe active pu foam was added to 100 ml of e bpa and incubated at 37 c for 5 days and the cod of the solution was checked periodically 2 3 4 partial packed bed reactor for biodegradation of e bpa a partial packed bed reactor was designed to ensure the efficient mineralization of e bpa employing bacterial consortia the pu foam was used as biofilm carrier acrylic based home made cylindrical packed bed reactor was used for the studies the dimensions of the reactor are of 52 mm external diameter and 260 mm length with a total capacity of 450 ml the reactor has an outlet and inlet where the both ends were connected to reservoir the recirculation of the e bpa was ensured with the help of peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 5 ml min 1 initially the reactor was filled with pu foam and enrichment medium containing 25 of e bpa and 3 of acclimatized bacterial consortia was passed into the reactor and allowed to ensure biofilm formation for 10 days during the biofilm formation the enrichment media was changed periodically to ensure active growth of biofilm over the pu foam after which the enrichment media was discarded and the biofilm was adapted to increasing strengths of e bpa finally 1 l of 100 e bpa was filled into the reactor and biodegradation of e bpa was monitored in recirculation mode the cod of the solution was analyzed periodically 2 4

elution and characterization of bpa from thermal cash receipts under supra alkaline condition 42 mg of bpa was eluted from 1 g 25 42 cm2 of printed thermal cash receipts supporting information si table 1 this corresponds to 1 7 mg of bpa present per cm2 of the thermal cash receipts the reported quantity of bpa in 1 g of thermal receipts from literature is of about 9 21 mg g 1 50 51 the 42 mg g 1 of bpa reported in this study is quite higher as the amount of bpa present in the thermal cash receipts varies depending on its intended use and manufacturer the uv vis spectra of the eluted solution exhibited two characteristic peaks around 276 and 225 nm similar to that of commercial bpa the absorption peaks corresponds to π π transition of the phenol moiety and indicates the presence of bisphenol in the eluted solution fig 1 a the congener of bisphenol was identified by gc ms analysis as bpa and it had a retention time of 37 68 with m z of 228 fig 1 b and si table 2 the physio chemical characteristics of the eluted solution containing bpa 100 mg l 1 is given in table 1 3 2 indirect electrochemical oxidation 3 2 1 optimization of nacl concentration the i eo was performed for 300 ml of eluted bpa 100 mg l 1 in diverse chloride concentrations of 4 9 17 25 and 34 mm the effect of chloride ion concentration on cod removal e bpa transformation and electrical energy consumption is shown in fig 2 a about 90 of bpa transformation was observed at all studied chloride ion concentration indicating that the minimal amount of chloride ions were sufficient for electro transformation of bpa however unsatisfactory cod reduction 27 5 was observed at 4 mm of cl ions at chloride ion concentrations of 9 and 17 mm the cod removal percentage was of 45 9 and 54 7 at concentrations of 25 and 34 mm the cod removal efficiency was insignificant it is understood that for 100 mg ml 1 of studied bpa concentration about 17 mm of chloride concentration was sufficient to achieve partial cod reduction above which it was insignificant increase in chloride concentration substantially decreased the electrochemical energy consumption the energy consumption was of 0 0175 kw h l 1 to achieve 55 of cod reduction employing 17 mm of chloride ions the optimized chloride concentration was selected for further studies 3 2 2 optimization of ph the i eo of eluted bpa was carried out under various ph 2 5 7 9 and 11 at constant chloride concentration of 17 mm and current density of 20 ma cm 2 for 2 h the effect of ph on cod removal and bpa transformation is shown in fig 2 b the 100 mg l 1 of eluted bpa exhibiting ph of 9 was prepared after dilution of the stock which had a ph of 11 the bpa transformation and cod removal was about 99 and 55 respectively in all studied ph the effect of ph on bpa transformation and cod removal was inconsequential thus the i eo was carried out without changing the actual ph of the eluted bpa with the concentration of 100 mg l 1 3 2 3 optimization of current density the experiment was conducted at various current densities such as 5 20 40 60 and 80 ma cm 2 at ph 9 with the chloride concentration of 17 mm for 2 h the effect of the current densities on cod removal and bpa transformation is shown in fig 2 c at current density of 5 ma cm 2 the cod removal was insignificant and only about 35 of bpa transformation was observed the cod removal percentage incremented with increase in current density upto 60 ma cm2 above which it turned out to be insignificant about 99 bpa transformation was observed from 20 to 80 ma cm 2 where the electrical power consumption increased from 5 ma cm 2to 80 ma cm 2 the percentage of bpa transformation rose from 5 ma cm 2 to 20 ma cm 2 after that it became inconsequential it is obvious that there is a complete transformation of bpa and partial removal of cod at 20 ma cm 2 was observed the electrical energy consumption for the optimized current density was 0 7kwh l 1 3 2 4 performance of i eo under optimized conditions under optimized conditions of chloride concentration 17 mm ph 9 and current density of 20 ma cm 2 the i eo was able to remove only 53 of cod in 60 min in initial 10 min of i eo the bi index of the solutions increased from 0 to 0 55 and then decreased to 0 in course of 240 min of i eo the possible transformation of non biodegradable bpa to readily biodegradable components increases the bod to 100 mg l 1 and the bi of the solution to 0 45 during 10 min the decrease in bi to 0 after 20 min is majorly due to the deprivation and degradation of biodegradable organic content by i eo as seen from the fig 2 d the bi falls after 10 min of i eo where the cod removal is only of 25 and the bi is of around 0 45 hence the electro oxidation process was carried out only for 10 min for further biodegradation the anodic potential and cathodic potential of the electrodes were of 1 2 v vs she and 1 0 v vs she the residual chlorine concentration was about 35 mg l 1 the table 1 lists out the physio chemical characteristics of the bpa solution after 10 min of i eo the eluted bpa appeared turbid with a whitish pink color pink color due to the presence of dyes in printed thermal cash receipts whereas after i eo the pinkish color disappeared due to the possible decolourization of dyes by ocl ions the toc reduction was only up to 30 the cellulose of 130 mg l 1 eluted along with bpa was not degraded during i eo and this contributes to the turbid appearance of the solution however the concentration of aox increased at 10 min of i eo to 64 5 mg l 1 which may be due to the formation chlorinated aromatic compounds 3 3 biodegradation the growth of bacterial consortia in eluted bpa and electrolyzed bpa is shown in fig 3 a in eluted bpa the cell od decreased after few hours of inoculation and reached a value of 0 1 in 120 h this shows that the bacterial consortia were not able to withstand the bpa toxicity and supports the non biodegradability of the eluted bpa solution in case of e bpa the cell od slowly increased from the initial inoculum od 0 3 and maintained a stationary state in the studied time of 120 h this evidences supports that the previous claim i e i eo increased the biodegradability of the bpa solution 3 3 1 batch mode of degradation the immobilization of bacterial consortia in the pu foam was visualized by fe sem studies fig 4 shows the images of non active foam and microbe active foam the biofilm of the naphthalene degrading bacterial consortia was developed over the foam in 10 days of incubation from the table 2 it is evident that about 3 7 108 colony forming units of bacteria were enumerated in 100 mg of pu foam at 10 days of incubation the percentage of cod removal by employing free cells as well immobilized active microbial foam is shown in fig 3 b the bacterial consortia removed cod in eluted bpa by only 37 in 120 h the free bacterial consortia were able to remove cod by 71 in 120 h however the microbe active foams were able to reduce cod by 80 in 100 h the cod removal via adsorption by foam accounted to 20 only from the results the increased amount of cod removal by microbe active foam was noticed it is because the foams provide micro environment for bacterial biofilm and it facilitates the adsorption of organic compounds over the foam this favours the degradation of electro transformed bpa products effectively the bacterial biofilm over the foam withstands the toxicity created by the chloride mediated electro oxidation compounds compared to free cells 3 3 2 partial packed bed reactor for degradation of e bpa the partial packed bed bioreactor employing pu foam as microbe carrier was designed to increase the cod removal efficiency of the bacterial consortia fig 5 the reservoir was continuously aerated to ensure sufficient oxygen supply to the bacterial cells the outlet of the reactor was re circulated throughout the study the e bpa adsorption by the non active foam accounted to 16 of cod reduction in 30 h fig 5b above which no significant cod reduction was observed this shows that the foam was saturated with e bpa within 30 h during initial run employing e bpa with microbe active foam about 60 cod removal was observed in 50 h upon consecutive cycle 2nd 3rd run the cod reduction increased to 80 and 91 9 respectively in 50 h the increase in cod reduction about 90 within 50 h upon consecutive cycle was due to the adaptability of the bacteria towards the e bpa environment the continuous aeration as well as micro environment provided by the pu foam favours rapid degradation of e bpa also the adsorption of aromatic compounds present in the i eo solution upon the foam also stipulates the degradation of i eo intermediates by the immobilized biofilm the cellulose present in the e bpa solution was reduced to 15 mg l 1 suggesting the bacterial utilization by cellulose enzyme complex the toc of the bio processed solution was of 24 57 mg l 1 the aox concentration also drastically reduced after bio process to 12 6 mg l 1 suggesting the conversion of chlorinated electro by products to non chlorinated products table 1 3 4 mechanism of bpa degradation by unified method 3 4 1 in indirect electro oxidation the anodic oxidation of eluted bpa in presence of chloride ions occurs majorly via ocl ions and partly by oh0 radicals the chloride ions are oxidized directly at anode surface to form chlorine which is hydrated to yield hypochlorous acid the hypochlorous acid dissociates at alkaline ph to generate ocl ions 52 these hypochlorite ions with an oxidizing potential of 0 89 v vs she reacts with bpa leading to its transformation 5 2 cl a n o d e o cl 2 2 e 6 c l 2 h 2 o h o c l h c l 7 2 h 2 o 4 e c a t h o d e r h 2 2 o h 8 h o c l p h 7 5 h o c l in case of active anodes employed the oxidation of water molecules leads to the formation of physisorbed hydroxyl radical 53 these m oh radicals also may react with bpa leading to its electro transformation the electrochemical oxidation pathway of bpa is proposed in fig 6 from gc ms analysis the retention time of the observed compounds and their m z is provided in table 3 the reaction of electro generated ocl ions on bpa primarily generated tetrachlorobisphenol a t1 tentative step which was transformed to dichloro 4 2 hydroxy propan 2 yl phenol t2 and tri chlorophenol t3 54 the dichloro 4 2 hydroxy propan 2 yl phenol undergoes dehydration to yield dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone d1 determined step rt 21 9 m z 203 9 the action of oh0 on bpa resulted in formation of 3 hydroxy 1 3 5 hexadiene t4 and 4 2 hydroxy propan 2 yl phenol t5 which further degraded to 4 hydroxy benzoic acid d2 rt 11 6 m z 281 as tms derivative 41 the oxidation of oh0 on 4 hydroxy benzoic acid yielded 2 hydroxy propanoic acid d3 rt 8 5 m z 235 6 as one of the final by products of electro oxidation the combined action of ocl ions and oh0 may also resulted in formation of dihydroxy benzoic acid d4 rt 26 1 m z 385 as tms derivative and trihydroxy benzene d5 rt 15 3 m z 341 as tms derivative 3 4 2 in biodegradation the intermediates formed after electro oxidation was metabolized to aliphatic organic compound which contributes to cod reduction the elucidated biodegradation pathway for electro transformed bpa intermediates is sketched in fig 7 whereas the m z and retention time of the determined compound observed in gc ms is shown in table 4 the intermediates were metabolized by the sequential action of oxidative enzymes mono and di oxygenases expressed by the bacterial consortia the dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone was transformed to dichlorophenol 55 which is hydroxylated by the hydroxylase enzyme to dichloro catechol t1 tentative step it was acted by dioxygenase to produce dichloro muconic acid t2 via ortho cleavage and is further transformed by series of enzymes to chloro maleyl acetate d1 determined step rt 9 8 and m z 191 1 56 the trichloro phenol was converted to chloro hydroxy quinol t3 by the action of momo oxygenases which was then acted upon by dioxygenase to form chloro maleyl acetate d1 rt 9 8 and m z 191 1 the chloro maleyl acetate formed from the metabolism of dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone and trichlorophenol was converted to maleyl acetate d2 rt 13 8 and m z 159 by the removal of chloride ions via dehalogenase enzyme 56 this is implicated in reduction of aox concentration from 4 5 to 12 6 mg l 1 after biodegradation the hydroxyl benzoic acid was converted to oxoadipic acid d3 rt 11 5 and m z 17 by the catalysis of mono and di oxygenases via oxo adipate pathway present in the bacteria consortia 57 the dihydroxy benzoic acid was converted to maleyl pyurate t3 by the catalysis of di oxygenase the maleyl pyruvate was isomerized to form fumaryl pyruvate which was transformed into malate d4 rt 14 3 and m z 117 and fumarate d5 rt 8 0 and m z 135 by hydroxylases 58 the trihydroxy benzene was hydroxylated to form tetra hydroxy benzene d6 rt 11 7 and m z 145 1 which was cleaved by dioxygenase to form di hydroxy hexadiene diolic acid d7 rt 9 7 and m z 174 which was further cleaved to yield aceto pyruvate d8 rt 12 8 and m z 131 these aliphatic compounds such as maleyl acetate oxoadipic acid malate fumarate and aceto pyruvate enter into tca cycle and get converted into co2 this results in reduction of cod from 217 5 to 24 mg l 1 table 1 the concentration of cellulose reduced from 130 mg l 1 to 1 5 mg l 1 due the utilization of cellulose by the bacteria consortia and so the final solution appeared colourless 3 5 insilico analysis the insilico toxicity and estrogenic analysis were performed only for the products determined after i eo it was not performed for the determined final products formed by biodegradation as it generally enters into tca cycle for bacterial catabolic processes and were converted to co2 3 5 1 insilico toxicity analysis the insilico toxicity analysis performed for determined products after electro oxidation for different toxicity parameters by toxtree analaysis is given in table 5 the oral toxicity predicted by carmer rules was high for initial bpa dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone and for tri hydroxy benzene the 4 hydroxy benzoic acid dihydroxy benzoic acid exhibited low level oral toxicity the bpa were estimated as less inert compounds i e not reactive but are slightly more toxic than baseline toxicity by verhaar scheme the other intermediates were not possible to be classified by this scheme the dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone dihydroxy benzoic acid and tri hydroxy benzene exhibited alerts for in vitro mutagenicity by ames test the dihydroxy benzoic acid and trihydroxy benzene exhibited carcinogenicity in rat few compounds namely dihydroxy benzoic acid and tri hydroxy benzene exhibited skin irritation the in silico biodegradability assay predicted the bpa and dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone as persistent compounds while other intermediates being easily biodegradable apart from bpa the other compounds exhibited low risk for herg inhibition this shows that the few products of electro oxidation namely dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone trihydroxy benzene and dihydroxy benzoic acid exhibited toxicity and this suggests that the i eo employed must be complimented with the biological process to generate non toxic effluent 3 5 2 insilico estrogenicity the in silico estrogenicity of the products formed after electro oxidation were evaluated by hex docking suite and is shown in fig 8 and table 6 the h bond interaction with the estrogen receptor was evidenced in bpa dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone 4 hydroxy benzoic acid dihydroxy benzoic acid and trihydroxy benzene the e value of the estrogen estrogen receptor complex is of 859 and the e value for bpa estrogen receptor complex is of 625 the electrooxidized products complexed with estrogen receptor displayed lesser e value from the table 6 it is clear that only bpa had estrogenic activity and other eo products doesn t have any estrogen like activity the bpa docked with estrogen receptor with 2 h bond at leu549 and ser 527 with a bond length of 2 01 and 2 80 in α and β helix of the receptor the docking of bpa estrogen receptor was exactly in the active site where estrogen binds and hence it attributes estrogenicity the other eo products also displayed h bond interaction with the estrogen receptor however the residues involved in h bonding and the active sites were different from that of the bpa hence the eluted bpa alone displayed estrogen like h bond interaction it is clear that the determined electro oxidized product doesn t exhibit any estrogen like activity 4 conclusion the degradation of bpa eluted from thermal cash receipts was investigated in an eco friendly approach about 1 7 mg of bpa was eluted from 1 cm2 of thermal cash receipts under optimized i eo conditions 17 mm of chloride ph 9 current density 20 ma cm2 99 of bpa was electro transformed and only 25 cod reduction was observed the bi increased from 0 0 to 0 45 the end products of i eo include dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone 4 hydroxy benzoic acid 2 hydroxy propanoic acid dihydroxy benzoic acid and trihydroxy benzene the active microbial foam employed in partial packed bed bioreactor was more effective in reducing the cod above 90 the eluted bpa and the electro transformed dichloro 2 hydroxy acetophenone alone exhibited toxicity estrogenic activity was not visualized for the i eo products the formed toxic i eo products were metabolized by bacterial consortia to co2 the final compounds of bacterial degradation were the precursors of tca cycle those were non toxic as well as don t pose estrogenic activity about 91 9 cod and 56 toc reduction were observed during combined eo and bio process table 1 this strongly suggests that the unified mode of electro cum bio degradation is highly efficient in mineralizing the potent estrogen mimicker bpa acknowledgments priyadharshini aravind

of 0 0001 1 2 5 7 determination of ph of zero point charge the ph at which the surface of the hydrogel becomes electrically neutral is the ph of zero point charge phzpc the gg cl go hydrogel phzpc was examined to determine the behavior of surface charge while changing ph solution to determine the phzpc 10 ml 0 01 n nacl solution were taken in six different erlenmeyer flasks the initial ph of the solutions was adjusted to 3 5 7 9 and 11 using a 0 1 n solution of hcl naoh subsequently the hydrogel was added in the solution of each flask and it was stirred at room temperature for 5 h then hydrogel was separated from the suspensions by centrifuge and the supernatants were used for measuring final ph then initial ph vs final ph was plotted to find the phzpc of hydrogel 2 6 experimental setup dye and heavy metal removal studies were carried out using prepared agg go hydrogel with 30 ml of for cu ii solution rhodamine b rhb methylene blue mb and malachite green mg dye solutions and was shaken at constant rate at room temperature using a mechanical shaker mg rhb mb and cu ii solution samples were taken for the analysis of concentration at predetermined time intervals uv vis spectrometer ultraviolet visible spectrometer perkin elmer lambda usa was used to measure the concentration of mg rhb and mb dye solutions and the absorbance were measured at 624 554 663 nm respectively the concentration of cu ii ion solutions before and after adsorption was measured using atomic adsorption spectrometer aas perkin elmer a analyst 100 the removal efficiency of the mg rhb

hydrogel are depicted in fig 4 a a characteristic broad band around 3100 3580 cm 1 and a peak at 1656 cm 1 corresponds to oh stretching and bending mode of gg respectively the peaks at 2920 cm 1 1446 cm 1and 1153 cm 1 are due to stretching and bending vibration of ch and coc stretching vibrations respectively which is supported by literature 58 60 narrowing of band around 3500 cm 1 was observed in agg go ftir spectra this indicate the substitution of nh2 functional group to the oh group in the structure of agg go hydrogel further a peak around 1046 cm 1 can be ascribed to cn stretching vibration of aliphatic amine which confirm the modification of gg and it is in agreement with literature 55 57 in addition to this a new peak at 1425 cm 1 was observed this may be due to the formation of boc in the crosslinked hydrogel network 61 all these changes provide the evidence regarding nature of crosslink and interaction present in the agg go hydrogel 3 2 x ray diffraction patterns fig 4b illustrates the xrd patterns of dried agg and dried agg go hydrogel in agg hydrogel broad diffraction peak at 21 36 was noticed which corresponds to its amorphous structure for agg go hydrogel a broadness and shift was observed from little to higher angle 2θ 23 9 in xrd pattern and go diffraction peak 2θ 10 6 was emerged representing that go dispersed randomly within the hydrogel 62 63 the crystalline size of the agg and agg go were calculated using eq 3 and the estimated mean crystallite sizes was found to be 4 33 and 5 61 nm respectively 3 3 sem analysis sem micrographs of guar gum gg hydrogel graphene oxide agg go hydrogel and after adsorption of inorganic and organic pollutants onto hydrogel are depicted in fig 5 a e respectively guar gum hydrogel has a discrete structure in form of nodules flakes fig 5a 57 the go exhibits nanosheet like structure as shown in fig 5b and it has a multi layered structure arranged in disordered manner in addition it has a crumpled sheet like structure due to exfoliation and restacking process 64 the surface morphology of agg go hydrogel showed remarkable changes the porous 3 d network structure of hydrogels spreaded in an irregular manner on rough surface was observed surface with significant pore spaces was predicted in agg go which is in contrast with gg which increases permeability of pollutants as well as their easier movement throughout the cross linked network of hydrogel and also resulting in an increase in adsorption capacity and usage of hydrogel the porous structures provide fluid diffusion in the polymeric network which explains the good swelling capacity of the hydrogel enhanced crosslinking interactions and stabilized the network structures are due to the presence of go in the hydrogel the surface after the removal of dyes were devoid of any porous networks since they were masked by the adsorbed cu ii and mg as shown in fig 5 d e respectively 3 4 swelling property the swelling capacity of the hydrogels was studied and results are shown in fig 6 both gg hydrogel and agg go hydrogel attained their equilibrium at 50 and 40 h respectively the maximum sr was obtained for gg hydrogel the decrease in swelling ratio of agg go hydrogel was ascribed to the crosslinking of go and gg in hydrogel and other interaction boc and intermolecular hydrogel bonding etc which also restrained the interactions between the hydrogel and the water resulting in lower sr after hydrogel formation 65 3 5 rheological properties the relationship between storage modulus g and loss modulus g can reflect the change of viscosity and elasticity between a weak hydrogel and strong hydrogel 66 in fig 7 the calculated g and g moduli are plotted as a function of the applied strain in the agg go hydrogel for the sample between 1 5 strain a linear viscoelastic lvr region was observed which attributed to the existence of a balance between the rates of structural breakdown and rebuilding in this region the g values is higher than the g values suggesting that the material have higher elastic behavior at the lower shear stress values g decreases while g increase and then decreases intersection of g and g curves was observed it is called crossover point also called critical stress rc and at this point the hydrogel was collapsed and structure cannot be retrieve for the prepared hydrogel higher rc value 1 7 pa was observed and hydrogel network is more stable in between 1 3 strain the frequency sweep test was performed between 1 10 hz at room temperature for the prepared hydrogels is shown in fig 8 a from the graph it was observed the elastic modulus is always higher than the viscous modulus for the whole frequency region as a result hydrogel shows a weak gel behavior and obtain a broad peak for the loss modulus which is more pronounced for the prepared hydrogel 46 67 from the graph it is clear that the prepared hydrogel is stable and does not collapse up to applied frequency of 10 hz 3 6 surface area and porosity analysis adsorption characterization for agg go hydrogel was determined using bet at 77 4 k and a relative pressure p po range of 0 0001 1 the nitrogen adsorption increased at high relative pressures which indicated that the operating conditions could influence the adsorption process the bjh barrett joyner halenda method was used to determine the pore size distribution of the hydrogel the measured bet surface area of the hydrogel is 1 467 m2 g and its pore size is 1 75 nm the pore size distribution curve for the hydrogel shows a pore size distribution in the micropore 2 nm and mesopore regime 2 50 nm the sample analyzed exhibited pore size range between 1 7 and 30 nm but the pores were mostly distributed in the mesoporous regime fig 8 c 3 7 mechanism of dye removal ph of zero point charge phzpc from the above characterizations it was concluded that the prepared hydrogel has high surface area and highly cross linked structure which was proved by reduction in swelling property the overview of the plausible mechanism involved during the preparation of hydrogel was demonstrated in fig 9 a it showed that diol functionality of gg agg and go entailed in cross linking using borax through covalent bonding which provide stability of hydrogel network in addition hydrogen bonding interactions between go gg further stabilize the hydrogel network the resulting new functionality attained in this study also indicated the compatibility of these polymers photographs of 1 gg solution without borax 2 blended solution of agg go solution without borax and 3 gelling nature of agg go with hydrogel was shown in fig 9b moreover the prepared hydrogel consist of plenty of oh and cooh groups on the fringe apart from crosslinking which was confirmed from ftir data in alkaline medium due to proton abstraction these groups are ionised to o and coo respectively these negatively charged groups present in the hydrogel adsorb the cationic pollutants such as mg mb and rhb dye molecule positively charged dyes and cu ii ion by electrostatic interactions fig 9d the surface charge present in hydrogel plays an important role in removal application and it is depend on the phzpc value of the adsorbent consequently the phzpc of the agg go hydrogel was determined by the plotting graph between initial ph vs final ph of the solution fig 9c the cross point obtained at ph 9 1 corresponds to be the phzpc value of the agg go hydrogel and the adsorption of cations on the hydrogel would be favorable in an alkaline medium the boron atom in the crosslinker borax also has a partial negative charge which aids in the adsorption of the cationic dye and metal ion the adsorption capacity of agg go hydrogel was calculated by using eq 4 and maximum removal for mg rhb mb and cu ii was found to be 230 56 50 1 227 and 288 3 mg g respectively the adsorption capacity of developed hydrogel was compared with reported material 32 68 71 and are listed in table 1 literally it can be stated that agg go hydrogel is a good candidate for the removal of inorganic and organic pollutants 3 8 influence of various parameters 3 8 1 effect of initial concentration the effect of initial concentrations of mg rhb mb and cu ii were investigated by using hydrogel to solutions with different mg rhb mb and cu ii concentrations such as 10 50 ppm for rhb and 50 250 ppm for mg mb and cu ii respectively and results were shown in fig 10 a b the removal efficiency decreased by increasing the initial concentration of mg rhb mb and cu ii the reason for the sharp decrease with the increase in initial concentration of mg rhb mb and cu ii is that for a fixed dose of hydrogel the total available adsorption sites are limited which become saturated at a higher concentration 3 8 2 effect of contact time the removal capacity of agg go hydrogel for mg rhb mb and cu ii was determined by varying the contact time in the range of 20 120 min at constant concentration 50 ppm for mg mb and cu ii and 10 ppm for rhb respectively under neutral medium at rt as shown in fig 10 c the hydrogel reached saturation at 80 100 100 and 40 min for mg rhb mb and cu ii respectively and thereafter remained almost constant the agg go hydrogel was found to be suitable for the adsorption of pollutants onto its network 3 8 3 effect of ph the effect of ph was determined at five different ph levels such as 3 5 7 9 and 11 the removal capacity of the agg go hydrogel towards mg rhb mb and cu ii could be influenced much by the ph as shown in fig 10d the removal capacity of mg rhb mb and cu ii was enhanced with the increasing ph value the presence of cooh and oh groups in hydrogel influenced the adsorption capability at lower ph the h in the solution tended to integrate with the coo on the hydrogel which hindered the adsorption at higher ph the surface of the hydrogel was negatively charged due to proton abstraction cooh and oh groups in hydrogel are ionised to o and coo the produced ions had electrostatic interactions with positively charged cationic molecules resulting to increase in the adsorption capacity of the agg go hydrogel 3 9 reusability of agg go hydrogel a material should requires a good reusability apart from its high adsorption capacity as seen from fig 11 upto three cycles the prepared agg go hydrogel retained its high adsorption capacity in comparison with the first cycle which reveled material has a good reusabiity for rhb mg mb and cu ii adsorption from the above result prepared agg go hydrogels can be used effective adsorbent for the removal of pollutants 4 conclusions the 3 d hydrogel based on guar gum and grapheme oxide agg go were prepared via simple process using borax the properties of developed agg go hydrogel was characterized well and investigated the efficiency to remove mg rhb mb and cu ii from aqueous solution the structural morphology studies by sem revealed that the prepared material has porous 3 d network structure distributed in a random manner with a rough surface in of agg go hydrogel the crosslinked agg go hydrogel restrained its interactions between the hydrogel and water which resulted in decrease in the swelling capacity this shows that the prepared hydrogel has highly cross linked structure further it is supported by ftir and xrd maximum removal efficiency of mg rhb mb and cu ii was 98 74 90 and 88 achieved at 80 100 100 and 40 min respectively the optimum ph for maximum removal was basic medium the prepared hydrogel was regenerated and reused upto 3 cylces hence the prepared hydrogel has promising application in the field of adsorption due to their eco friendly biodegradable economy and good durability moreover the preparation process is easy and it is anticipated producing commercially conflicts of interest to the best of our knowledge there is no conflict of interest acknowledgement the authors thank the authorities of gandhigram rural institute for the encouragement

setup dye and heavy metal removal studies were carried out using prepared agg go hydrogel with 30 ml of for cu ii solution rhodamine b rhb methylene blue mb and malachite green mg dye solutions and was shaken at constant rate at room temperature using a mechanical shaker mg rhb mb and cu ii solution samples were taken for the analysis of concentration at predetermined time intervals uv vis spectrometer ultraviolet visible spectrometer perkin elmer lambda usa was used to measure the concentration of mg rhb and mb dye solutions and the absorbance were measured at 624 554 663 nm respectively the concentration of cu ii ion solutions before and after adsorption was measured using atomic adsorption spectrometer aas perkin elmer a analyst 100 the removal efficiency of the mg rhb

hydrogel are depicted in fig 4 a a characteristic broad band around 3100 3580 cm 1 and a peak at 1656 cm 1 corresponds to oh stretching and bending mode of gg respectively the peaks at 2920 cm 1 1446 cm 1and 1153 cm 1 are due to stretching and bending vibration of ch and coc stretching vibrations respectively which is supported by literature 58 60 narrowing of band around 3500 cm 1 was observed in agg go ftir spectra this indicate the substitution of nh2 functional group to the oh group in the structure of agg go hydrogel further a peak around 1046 cm 1 can be ascribed to cn stretching vibration of aliphatic amine which confirm the modification of gg and it is in agreement with literature 55 57 in addition to this a new peak at 1425 cm 1 was observed this may be due to the formation of boc in the crosslinked hydrogel network 61 all these changes provide the evidence regarding nature of crosslink and interaction present in the agg go hydrogel 3 2 x ray diffraction patterns fig 4b illustrates the xrd patterns of dried agg and dried agg go hydrogel in agg hydrogel broad diffraction peak at 21 36 was noticed which corresponds to its amorphous structure for agg go hydrogel a broadness and shift was observed from little to higher angle 2θ 23 9 in xrd pattern and go diffraction peak 2θ 10 6 was emerged representing that go dispersed randomly within the hydrogel 62 63 the crystalline size of the agg and agg go were calculated using eq 3 and the estimated mean crystallite sizes was found to be 4 33 and 5 61 nm respectively 3 3 sem analysis sem micrographs of guar gum gg hydrogel graphene oxide agg go hydrogel and after adsorption of inorganic and organic pollutants onto hydrogel are depicted in fig 5 a e respectively guar gum hydrogel has a discrete structure in form of nodules flakes fig 5a 57 the go exhibits nanosheet like structure as shown in fig 5b and it has a multi layered structure arranged in disordered manner in addition it has a crumpled sheet like structure due to exfoliation and restacking process 64 the surface morphology of agg go hydrogel showed remarkable changes the porous 3 d network structure of hydrogels spreaded in an irregular manner on rough surface was observed surface with significant pore spaces was predicted in agg go which is in contrast with gg which increases permeability of pollutants as well as their easier movement throughout the cross linked network of hydrogel and also resulting in an increase in adsorption capacity and usage of hydrogel the porous structures provide fluid diffusion in the polymeric network which explains the good swelling capacity of the hydrogel enhanced crosslinking interactions and stabilized the network structures are due to the presence of go in the hydrogel the surface after the removal of dyes were devoid of any porous networks since they were masked by the adsorbed cu ii and mg as shown in fig 5 d e respectively 3 4 swelling property the swelling capacity of the hydrogels was studied and results are shown in fig 6 both gg hydrogel and agg go hydrogel attained their equilibrium at 50 and 40 h respectively the maximum sr was obtained for gg hydrogel the decrease in swelling ratio of agg go hydrogel was ascribed to the crosslinking of go and gg in hydrogel and other interaction boc and intermolecular hydrogel bonding etc which also restrained the interactions between the hydrogel and the water resulting in lower sr after hydrogel formation 65 3 5 rheological properties the relationship between storage modulus g and loss modulus g can reflect the change of viscosity and elasticity between a weak hydrogel and strong hydrogel 66 in fig 7 the calculated g and g moduli are plotted as a function of the applied strain in the agg go hydrogel for the sample between 1 5 strain a linear viscoelastic lvr region was observed which attributed to the existence of a balance between the rates of structural breakdown and rebuilding in this region the g values is higher than the g values suggesting that the material have higher elastic behavior at the lower shear stress values g decreases while g increase and then decreases intersection of g and g curves was observed it is called crossover point also called critical stress rc and at this point the hydrogel was collapsed and structure cannot be retrieve for the prepared hydrogel higher rc value 1 7 pa was observed and hydrogel network is more stable in between 1 3 strain the frequency sweep test was performed between 1 10 hz at room temperature for the prepared hydrogels is shown in fig 8 a from the graph it was observed the elastic modulus is always higher than the viscous modulus for the whole frequency region as a result hydrogel shows a weak gel behavior and obtain a broad peak for the loss modulus which is more pronounced for the prepared hydrogel 46 67 from the graph it is clear that the prepared hydrogel is stable and does not collapse up to applied frequency of 10 hz 3 6 surface area and porosity analysis adsorption characterization for agg go hydrogel was determined using bet at 77 4 k and a relative pressure p po range of 0 0001 1 the nitrogen adsorption increased at high relative pressures which indicated that the operating conditions could influence the adsorption process the bjh barrett joyner halenda method was used to determine the pore size distribution of the hydrogel the measured bet surface area of the hydrogel is 1 467 m2 g and its pore size is 1 75 nm the pore size distribution curve for the hydrogel shows a pore size distribution in the micropore 2 nm and mesopore regime 2 50 nm the sample analyzed exhibited pore size range between 1 7 and 30 nm but the pores were mostly distributed in the mesoporous regime fig 8 c 3 7 mechanism of dye removal ph of zero point charge phzpc from the above characterizations it was concluded that the prepared hydrogel has high surface area and highly cross linked structure which was proved by reduction in swelling property the overview of the plausible mechanism involved during the preparation of hydrogel was demonstrated in fig 9 a it showed that diol functionality of gg agg and go entailed in cross linking using borax through covalent bonding which provide stability of hydrogel network in addition hydrogen bonding interactions between go gg further stabilize the hydrogel network the resulting new functionality attained in this study also indicated the compatibility of these polymers photographs of 1 gg solution without borax 2 blended solution of agg go solution without borax and 3 gelling nature of agg go with hydrogel was shown in fig 9b moreover the prepared hydrogel consist of plenty of oh and cooh groups on the fringe apart from crosslinking which was confirmed from ftir data in alkaline medium due to proton abstraction these groups are ionised to o and coo respectively these negatively charged groups present in the hydrogel adsorb the cationic pollutants such as mg mb and rhb dye molecule positively charged dyes and cu ii ion by electrostatic interactions fig 9d the surface charge present in hydrogel plays an important role in removal application and it is depend on the phzpc value of the adsorbent consequently the phzpc of the agg go hydrogel was determined by the plotting graph between initial ph vs final ph of the solution fig 9c the cross point obtained at ph 9 1 corresponds to be the phzpc value of the agg go hydrogel and the adsorption of cations on the hydrogel would be favorable in an alkaline medium the boron atom in the crosslinker borax also has a partial negative charge which aids in the adsorption of the cationic dye and metal ion the adsorption capacity of agg go hydrogel was calculated by using eq 4 and maximum removal for mg rhb mb and cu ii was found to be 230 56 50 1 227 and 288 3 mg g respectively the adsorption capacity of developed hydrogel was compared with reported material 32 68 71 and are listed in table 1 literally it can be stated that agg go hydrogel is a good candidate for the removal of inorganic and organic pollutants 3 8 influence of various parameters 3 8 1 effect of initial concentration the effect of initial concentrations of mg rhb mb and cu ii were investigated by using hydrogel to solutions with different mg rhb mb and cu ii concentrations such as 10 50 ppm for rhb and 50 250 ppm for mg mb and cu ii respectively and results were shown in fig 10 a b the removal efficiency decreased by increasing the initial concentration of mg rhb mb and cu ii the reason for the sharp decrease with the increase in initial concentration of mg rhb mb and cu ii is that for a fixed dose of hydrogel the total available adsorption sites are limited which become saturated at a higher concentration 3 8 2 effect of contact time the removal capacity of agg go hydrogel for mg rhb mb and cu ii was determined by varying the contact time in the range of 20 120 min at constant concentration 50 ppm for mg mb and cu ii and 10 ppm for rhb respectively under neutral medium at rt as shown in fig 10 c the hydrogel reached saturation at 80 100 100 and 40 min for mg rhb mb and cu ii respectively and thereafter remained almost constant the agg go hydrogel was found to be suitable for the adsorption of pollutants onto its network 3 8 3 effect of ph the effect of ph was determined at five different ph levels such as 3 5 7 9 and 11 the removal capacity of the agg go hydrogel towards mg rhb mb and cu ii could be influenced much by the ph as shown in fig 10d the removal capacity of mg rhb mb and cu ii was enhanced with the increasing ph value the presence of cooh and oh groups in hydrogel influenced the adsorption capability at lower ph the h in the solution tended to integrate with the coo on the hydrogel which hindered the adsorption at higher ph the surface of the hydrogel was negatively charged due to proton abstraction cooh and oh groups in hydrogel are ionised to o and coo the produced ions had electrostatic interactions with positively charged cationic molecules resulting to increase in the adsorption capacity of the agg go hydrogel 3 9 reusability of agg go hydrogel a material should requires a good reusability apart from its high adsorption capacity as seen from fig 11 upto three cycles the prepared agg go hydrogel retained its high adsorption capacity in comparison with the first cycle which reveled material has a good reusabiity for rhb mg mb and cu ii adsorption from the above result prepared agg go hydrogels can be used effective adsorbent for the removal of pollutants 4 conclusions the 3 d hydrogel based on guar gum and grapheme oxide agg go were prepared via simple process using borax the properties of developed agg go hydrogel was characterized well and investigated the efficiency to remove mg rhb mb and cu ii from aqueous solution the structural morphology studies by sem revealed that the prepared material has porous 3 d network structure distributed in a random manner with a rough surface in of agg go hydrogel the crosslinked agg go hydrogel restrained its interactions between the hydrogel and water which resulted in decrease in the swelling capacity this shows that the prepared hydrogel has highly cross linked structure further it is supported by ftir and xrd maximum removal efficiency of mg rhb mb and cu ii was 98 74 90 and 88 achieved at 80 100 100 and 40 min respectively the optimum ph for maximum removal was basic medium the prepared hydrogel was regenerated and reused upto 3 cylces hence the prepared hydrogel has promising application in the field of adsorption due to their eco friendly biodegradable economy and good durability moreover the preparation process is easy and it is anticipated producing commercially conflicts of interest to the best of our knowledge there is no conflict of interest acknowledgement the authors thank the authorities of gandhigram rural institute for the encouragement

keywords diclofenac heterogeneous electro fenton single walled carbon nanotubes h2o2 kinetic 1 introduction in recent years the occurrence and stability of drug compounds and their derivatives in aquatic environments have been recognized and considered as an emerging issue due to their effect on human health and aquatic ecosystems 1 2 diclofenac is a type of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid that is mainly used as an analgesic anti rheumatic and anti inflammatory drug 3 based on intercontinental marketing services ims health data the global consumption of dcf is estimated to be 1443 58 ton y 1 4 due to the extensive use and inadequate removal of this drug by the conventional wastewater treatment process only 20 30 removal efficiency dcf has been detected in surface and underground water in the concentration ranges from ng l to μg l 4 7 long term exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of dcf and its combination with disinfectants and other contaminants can lead to serious effects on human health and aquatic life 7 8 therefore studies on effective removal of dcf from aqueous solutions are important conventional methods for the removal of nsaids from aqueous solutions include the biological processes coagulation flocculation adsorption filtration and flotation 9 previous studies reported that these processes have mainly disadvantages such as low efficiency secondary pollutant production and expensiveness 10 in contrast the advanced oxidation processes aops based on the production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals oh have high efficiency in the mineralization of toxic and harmful compounds 11 12 these processes involve the chemical photochemical and electrochemical methods for the chemical degradation of organic pollutants 13 among the aops fenton reaction with h2o2 and transitional metals especially ferrous ion has been evaluated in numerous studies due to the simplicity of the operation low cost materials and high degradation efficiency 14 15 however this method has disadvantages such as the production of large amounts of iron sludge low stability of h2o2 and high consumption rate of fenton reagent 14 16 in recent years ef process has been considered as a promising technology to eliminate the problems described above 17 the electro fenton process is an advanced indirect electrochemical oxidation process that produces oh by the reaction of electro generated h2o2 with fe2 ion eq 1 18 this process compared to the fenton process has high efficiency high rate of fe2 ion regeneration on the surface of the cathode and in situ production of h2o2 eq 2 however some disadvantages such as need for acidic ph and production of high amounts of iron sludge after the neutralization stage in ef process have not been solved 16 17 recently researchers have suggested the use of a solid catalyst containing iron to eradicate these problems various types of catalysts such as activated carbon 19 zeolite 20 bentonite 21 sludge 22 and spiolote 23 have been used to provide a catalyst based on heterogeneous iron compared to these catalysts single wall carbon nanotubes swcnts have high chemical and mechanical stability characteristics high electrical conductivity and good electrochemical performance 24 the unique electronics characteristics of these particles have been effectively considered in the electrochemical process as a method for development of the electron transfer reaction 25 in addition swcnts have a high specific surface area with high potential to absorb the contaminants and develop direct and indirect

elemental analysis was carried out by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem coupled with energy dispersive spectrometer eds and transmission electron microscopy tem the chemical oxygen demand cod was determined using uv vis spectrophotometer based on standard methods the concentration of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was determined by titration of potassium permanganate kmno4 for this titration 4 ml of 4 m sulphuric acid was added to 100 ml of the work solution a 0 025 m potassium permanganate solution was used as the titrant and added to the work solution until the appearance of purple colour the quantitative analysis of dcf and its intermediate products was performed by gc ms before analysis in order to extract and concentrate the analytes the samples were pretreated by the dispersive liquid liquid microextraction dllme method for dllme the solution ph was adjusted to 1 using concentrated hydrochloric acid and then 1 ml of acetone containing 80 μl chloroform was added to the 5 ml of the solution the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm and the deposited phase was extracted and dried using nitrogen gas 30 the dried sample was derivatized with 20 μl n methyl n trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide mstfa and finally the 2 μl samples were injected into the gc ms system equipped with the db 5 column the gc was operated at a column temperature of 120 c for 4 min and then increased to 300 c at a temperature ramp of 20 c min to explain the kinetic of dcf removal the obtained experimental data in this research were fitted to pseudo first order kinetics eq 3 where k is the pseudo first order rate constant c0 and c are the initial dcf concentration mg l and its concentration at time t respectively 3 ln c 0 c kt 3 results and discussion 3 1 the characteristics of mswcnts catalyst fig 1 shows the xrd pattern of the mswcnts catalyst according to the figure the peaks of 2ɵ 26 06 and 44 62 indicate the structure of swcnts while the peaks of 2ɵ 51 91 and 37 79 represent the fe3o4 loading on swcnts the results inside of fig 1 confirm the magnetic properties of swcnts containing fe3o4 nanoparticles the morphology of the mswcnt catalyst synthesized is obtained by the sem analysis and is shown in fig 2 as can be seen iron oxide nanoparticles have successfully coated onto the surface of swcnt the eds analysis confirmed the results of xrd and sem and showed the presence of carbon oxygen and iron at the surface of the swcnt moreover the tem image fig 3 showed the distribution of fe3o4 nanoparticles in the form of black spots on the surface and inside the swcnt 3 2 characteristics of ti ruo2 fig 4 shows the sem micrograph of ruo2 coated on the ti plate according to this figure the anode surface has a cracked mud structure which is common in the dimensionally stable anodes dsa as a result of the sintering process 31 according to bai et al 32 the cracked mud structure exhibits the large specific surface area of an anode which can provide countless active sites for increasing electro catalyst activity the eds spectrum confirms the presence of ti ru and o in the surface layer of ruo2 coated on the ti bed the xrd pattern in fig 5 shows that under the dipping process the rutile type of ruo2 is formed on the surface of the ti 3 3 effect of initial ph the initial ph plays an important role in the formation of reactive oxygen species ross and the micro electrolysis process of mswcnts in the heterogeneous ef process the initial ph in the range of 4 10 without further control was investigated for dcf removal in this study this studied range of ph was selected to reduce the precipitation effect on the efficiency of dcf removal pérez estrada et al 33 and bae et al 34 reported that dcf solubility is strongly influenced by the ph of the solution and dcf may be precipitated at ph 4 due to the pka value of dcf fig 6 a shows the effect of the solution ph on the removal efficiency of the heterogeneous ef process based on mswcnts according to the figure the removal efficiency increased with decreasing the ph so that the maximum dcf removal efficiency was at ph values of 4 and 5 and the reaction time of 120 min the results of the kinetic analysis showed that dcf removal efficiency increases with decreasing the ph table 1 this can be related to the production of the high amount of oh through the reaction 1 due to the faster production of h2o2 by swcnts and graphite felt and the leaching of iron ions from mswcnts micro electrolysis at ph 4 and 5 35 in addition the ph value lower than the neutral values easily controls the evolution of oxygen to increase the overall current efficiency for direct and indirect oxidation of contaminants on the anode 36 similar results were observed by hou et al 37 for the removal of total organic carbon from a wastewater increasing the efficiency in acidic ph may also be due to the adsorption regeneration of the particle electrode and the degradation of the contaminant on it nidheesh et al 18 reported that the reaction of adsorbed pollutant and h2o2 on the surface of the catalyst in addition to regenerating of the active site lead to the production of intermediate products bounab et al 19 developed a desorption process for an activated carbon containing iron catalyst after 90 min of electrolysis and found that the concentration of contaminants was close to 1 of its initial concentration yue et al 38 examined the removal of azo dye by the fepmo12o40 catalyzed electrochemical process and reported that in the acidic state h was adsorbed onto the surface sites of the catalyst and this surface was recovered through the sequential removal of intermediate species hence the removal efficiency of pollutant increases at ph greater than 5 decreasing in the removal efficiency may be due to the decomposition of h2o2 into o2 and h2o and reduction in the oxidation potential of oh from e0 2 8 v to e14 1 96 39 40 rostamizadeh et al 41 studied the azo dye degradation by ef process with the fe zsm 5 nanocatalyst and found that the removal efficiency of the dye was reduced from 95 at ph 3 10 at ph 7 due to the low oxidation potential of oh and the instability of h2o2 these results also are in accordance with the results of rosales et al 39 for decolourization by ef process based on fe alginate gel beads in order to confirm the effect of initial ph on the dcf removal efficiency the concentration of h2o2 at electrolysis time of 120 min was monitored and the results are shown in fig 6 b it can be seen that by increasing the ph from 4 to 10 the amount of h2o2 production decreases this may be due to a decrease in the concentration of proton in solution 42 the results of fig 6 b also show that the concentration of h2o2 was decreased only 2 mg l when the ph raised from 4 to 5 this behaviour may be related to the fact that the ph effect on the decomposition of h2o2 is attenuated due to its continuous production by swcnts hou et al 37 reported that the removal efficiency of toc was decreased slightly by increasing the ph from 3 to 7 5 the authors explained this fact on the basis of continuous h2o2 electrochemical production by activated carbon containing iron shen et al 43 reported that cnts in an acidic and neutral environment by adsorbing o2 led to the continuous production of h2o2 by its electrochemical reduction regarding the above results and the neutral ph of the wastewater generated from the industries ph 5 was selected as the optimum ph for subsequent experiments of the heterogeneous ef process 3 4 effect of current density in order to investigate the effect of current density on the performance of the heterogeneous ef process the experiments were carried out at a current density of 5 10 15 20 and 30 ma cm2 and the results are shown in fig 7 a the dcf removal efficiency was increased from 84 to 98 5 by increasing the current density from 5 ma cm2 to 20 ma cm2 after 120 min of electrolysis time the results of the kinetic analysis showed the same trends in dcf removal efficiency the constant kinetic rate was increased from 0 0135 min 1 to 0 0296 min 1 when the current density increased from 5 ma cm2 to 20 ma cm2 table 1 this may be due to the faster production of h2o2 eq 2 and faster reduction of ferrous ions at the cathode surface eq 4 at a higher current density which led to further production of oh 44 the greater dcf molecules were adsorbed to the electrode by increasing the current density therefore the collision between oh and dcf molecules increases in addition at a proper current density the particles are polarized into the form of microelectrodes that can increase the oxidation and electro sorption process 45 similar results have been obtained by hammouda et al 46 for the degradation of malodorous compounds from aqueous solutions li et al 47 investigated the use of the tio2 sio2 gac particles to increase the electro catalytic removal of orange 7 dye in a three dimensional reactor and found that by increasing the current density the dye removal efficiency increases due to the polarization of the particles to multiple microelectrodes fig 7 a also shows that by increasing the current density from 20 ma cm2 to 30 ma cm2 the efficiency of heterogeneous ef process decreases these results were confirmed with the constant rate of reaction reported in table 1 this may be related to the presence of parasitic electrochemical reactions such as reducing o2 to form h2o instead of h2o2 on graphite felt eq 5 and oxidation of water to o2 instead of oh on ti ruo2 eq 6 48 iranpour et al 28 obtained the same results and showed that by increasing the current density the efficiency of the removal of dye decreases nideesh et al 11 also showed that by increasing the voltage from 10 v to 12 v the efficiency of the fe3o4 catalyzed ef process decreases 4 f e 3 e f e 2 5 o 2 4 h 4 e h 2 o 6 ti r u o 2 2 h 2 o t i r u o 2 o 2 4 h 4 e to confirm the effect of current density on dcf removal h2o2 concentration was monitored during the oxidation without the presence of contaminant and the results are shown in fig 7 b according to the figure by an increase in the current density from 5 ma cm2 to 20 ma cm2 the production rate of h2o2 rises from 19 8 mg l to 35 8 mg l this is related to the production of h2o2 through the reaction between o2 and h2o on the surface of both graphite felt and mswcnts a further increase in the current density from 20 ma cm2 to 30 ma cm2 led to decreasing the h2o2 production through h2o2 decomposition into h2o similar results were observed by lei et al 49 for the degradation of the dye by ef using activated carbon fibre cathode based on these considerations 20 ma cm2 was selected as the optimum current density to obtain a highest dcf removal efficiency a high production rate of h2o2 and relatively low energy consumption 3 5 the effect of the initial concentration of mswcnts the effect of the initial concentration of mswcnts on the efficiency of dcf removal by the heterogeneous ef process is shown in fig 8 a it can be seen that the dcf removal efficiency was increased when the initial catalyst concentration increased from 5 mg l to 80 mg l but the efficiency of the heterogeneous ef process was significantly reduced by further increase of the catalyst concentration the results of the kinetic analysis showed the same trends in dcf elimination efficiency the constant rate of kinetic was increased from 0 0122 min 1 to 0 0304 min 1 with the catalyst concentration increase from 5 mg l to 80 mg l however k slowly decreased to 0 0181 min 1 when the initial concentration was increased to 100 mg l an increase in the catalyst concentration is indicative of an increase in the amount of ferrous ion released from the catalyst surface which leads to improving oh production through reaction 1 and better degradation of dcf however a further increase of the catalyst reduces the efficiency of dcf removal due to consumption of oh by additional ferrous ion 50 additionally the active sites on the surface of graphite felt are occupied by ferric ions which leads to a decrease in the number of active sites on the graphite surface to produce h2o2 11 zhang et al 35 reported that by increasing the catalyst concentration the efficiency 2 4 dichlorophenol removal was initially increased then it was decreased by further catalyst increase ozcan et al 48 examined the electro catalytic degradation of enoxacin by ef process catalyzed by kaolin magnetic and reported that the removal efficiency increases by increasing the catalyst concentration from 0 1 g to 0 3 g due to the more production of oh but it significantly decreases by further increase of catalyst to confirm the effect of the initial concentration of the catalyst on dcf removal the h2o2 concentration was monitored during the electro oxidation process and the results are shown in fig 8 b when the initial concentration of catalyst increases from 5 mg l to 80 mg l the concentration of h2o2 produced increases from 20 1 mg l to 34 5 mg l this may be due to the unique features of swcnts to absorb o2 and its electrochemical reduction to h2o2 shen et al 43 studied the methylene blue electrochemical degradation on the basis of the particle electrode composite of carbon nanotube and fe3o4 and found that carbon nanotubes by absorbing o2 and improving the charge transfer lead to produce more reactive species such as h2o2 and oh with increasing the catalyst concentration the amount of h2o2 produced decreases from 34 5 mg l to 30 8 mg l according to these results 80 mg l catalyst was selected as an optimum concentration for the heterogeneous ef system and subsequent experiments 3 6 effect of initial concentration of dcf the effect of the initial concentration of dcf on the efficiency of the heterogeneous ef process was studied at six concentrations of 2 5 10 15 20 and 30 mg l as shown in fig 9 a by increasing the initial concentration from 2 mg l to 30 mg l the removal efficiency was reduced from 99 8 81 at 120 min of electrolysis time these results were confirmed with the constant reaction rate shown in fig 9 b and table 1 according to these results the constant rate of kinetic was decreased from 0 0463 min 1 to 0 0124 min 1 with the dcf initial concentration increase from 2 mg l to 30 mg l the decrease in the removal rate is due to the reduction of the concentration of oxidants such as oh compared to dcf molecules shen et al 10 and eshaghzadeh et al 51 observed the same results in the three dimensional and heterogeneous ef reactors panizza and oturan 44 also reported that by increasing the initial concentrations of contaminants the amount of dye degradation is decreased due to the competition of dye molecules and intermediate products formed during the process with oh fig 9 a also shows that during the electrolysis of 120 min the efficiency of the heterogeneous ef process at dcf concentrations of 2 5 and 10 mg l is similar this is due to the high availability of dcf molecules to oh during the ef process similar results were obtained by pourzamani et al 29 for dcf degradation by electro oxidation 3 7 effect of air flow rate the effect of airflow rate on dcf removal efficiency is shown in fig 10 a as can be seen by increasing the air flow rate from 0 to 1 ml min the dcf removal efficiency raises from 69 to 98 9 at an electrolysis time of 120 min the results of the kinetic analysis showed that the dcf removal rate was increased by increasing airflow table 1 increasing the removal efficiency in the flow rate of 1 ml min is due to the production of high values of h2o2 by the cathode electrode and swcnts as well as the increasing of oh production through reaction 1 fixed efficiency at high values of 1 ml min may be related to the high h2o2 production and its competition with the substrate for reaction with oh these results are in good agreement with yue et al 52 and lue et al 53 to confirm the effect of airflow rate on dcf removal the h2o2 concentration was monitored at electrolysis time of 120 min and the results are shown in fig 10 b according to this figure by increasing the air flow rate from 0 to 1 ml min the concentration of h2o2 was increased and then the amount of production remained constant by its increasing to the values higher than 1 ml min this may be due to the unique features of swcnts and graphite felt for absorbing o2 and its rapid reduction to h2o2 considering these results and reducing the energy consumption the air of 1 ml min as input into the system was considered for further experiments 3 8 electro catalytic performance of the heterogeneous ef based on mswcnts to investigate the performance of the heterogeneous ef process based on mswcnts to remove the dcf and cod a comparison was made between different systems such as two dimensional electrochemical 2de homogeneous ef and three dimensional electrochemical 3de fig 11 a and b show the efficiency of the removal of dcf and cod by various processes for the adsorption process by mswcnts only 18 7 of dcf removal was achieved at 120 min which indicates an inadequate efficiency of adsorption experiments by the catalyst the limitation of the adsorption capacity of mswcnts may be due to its low concentration in aqueous solution when the 2de system was used after 120 min the dcf and cod removal efficiency was achieved to be 52 1 and 35 5 respectively this relatively low removal efficiency can be related to the production of oh on the surface of ti ruo2 anode by the anode oxidation 54 however the removal of dcf and cod by the homogeneous ef process occurs more and faster than the 2de process this may be due to oh production by the reaction between h2o2 produced from the cathode surface with fe2 eq 1 compared to these processes the swcnts based 3d process showed a dcf removal efficiency of 72 5 and cod removal efficiency of 52 2 at a reaction time of 120 min and ph 5 this high efficiency may be due to the synergistic effect of the adsorption process and 2de as well as the formation of multiple microelectrodes in the solution by adding the particle electrode and an electrostatic induction the particles are converted to the form of a micro electrolysis with an opposite charge on both ends hence the electrochemical reactions occur on both the main and particle electrode surfaces and thus the pollutant removal efficiency increases 10 in sharp contrast the dcf and cod electro catalytic removal efficiency by the heterogeneous ef was 97 8 and 71 12 respectively the high degradation rate of the heterogeneous ef process can be related to the synergistic effect of the homogeneous ef and 3d processes similar results were observed by liu et al 55 for the treatment of dye wastewater by ef system based on a composite of nickel foam and ferrous ion fig 11 c shows the results of the regression analysis performed for the results of different electro catalytic degradation processes in agreement with the dcf and cod degradation efficiency the constant rate 0 0284 min 1 of the heterogeneous ef system was much higher than the swcnts based 3d system 0 0098 min 1 homogeneous ef 0 0064 min 1 and 2de 0 0058 min 1 this remarkable increase in the dcf removal is due to the synergistic effect between iron ions and swcnts in the heterogeneous ef system these results are in good agreement with liu et al 56 in addition to the dcf degradation the amount of h2o2 accumulation was determined in various electro catalytic degradation systems as shown in fig 11 d a small amount of h2o2 was detected for the homogeneous 2de and ef processes in contrast the h2o2 concentration in the 3d system based on swcnts reached the 50 12 mg l and high h2o2 accumulation in this system was due to the fact that swcnts can generate h2o2 eq 2 by absorbing o2 and reducing its electrochemical when iron is loaded into the 3d system based on swcnts the amount of produced h2o2 is much lower than the 3de process this fact shows that the iron on the catalyst and leached into the solution acts as a catalyst for the decomposition of h2o2 into oh all of these results show the benefits of the heterogeneous ef process in the removal of dcf cod and production of ross in comparison with other electro catalytic processes 3 9 stability and reusability of the mswcnts catalyst for practical applications the catalyst stability and reusability of the heterogeneous ef process are important therefore the stability and reusability of mswcnts were studied at ph of 5 current density of 20 ma cm2 mswcnts concentration of 80 mg l dcf concentration of 10 mg l and air flow rate of 1 l min according to fig 12 a slight difference was observed after 5 consecutive cycles compared to the first oxidation cycle which indicates the stability and reusability of the mswcnts catalyst after 10 cycles the dcf removal efficiency was decreased from 97 8 78 11 while the cod removal efficiency was decreased from 71 12 53 11 this reduction in efficiency in these long cycles is due to the leaching of iron into solution and the adsorption of intermediate products on the catalyst surface these results indicate that mswcnts is a suitable candidate for dcf electro oxidation degradation in 5 consecutive cycles in order to validate the results of stability xrd and ft ir analysis was used for the catalyst regenerated after the fifth run the xrd pattern fig 12 b and the ft ir spectrum fig 12 c showed a similar structure and phases of mswcnts before and after the electro oxidation process the purity of the mswcnts after the fifth run of the cycle was confirmed by the eds as shown in fig 12 d these results indicate that the heterogeneous catalyst of mswcnts has good stability and reusability for the electrochemical degradation of dcf 3 10 analysis of the intermediate products and the possible pathway of dcf degradation to better understand the dcf degradation mechanism by the heterogeneous ef process based on mswcnts the intermediate products were identified by gcms table 2 summarizes the characteristics of products identified from the dcf oxidation based on these intermediate identified the reaction pathways of a b and c are proposed and shown in fig 13 on the pathway a the dcf molecules can be degraded to 1 2 6 dichlorophenyl 1 3 dihydro 2h indol 2 one by the reaction of intramolecular cyclization and water removal which has a good agreement with zhao et al 57 in the b pathway by the decarboxylation and oh attack to the dcf molecules the 2 chlorophenazine intermediate is formed ziylan et al 58 reported the same dcf degradation pathway direct degradation of dcf pathway c and its intermediates pathways b and c by cleavage of the c n bond by oh attack causes to form the 2 3 dichlorobenzene and 2 4 dichlorophenol as the final by product these detected final by products were very similar to the by products identified in other studies 29 3 11 the mechanism of degradation of heterogeneous ef process in electro oxidation processes the organic pollutants are degraded through ross therefore determining the dominant species and their effect on pollutants are important in determining the mechanism of the electro oxidation process to evaluate the reactive species dcf degradation behaviour was observed in the presence and absence of tba scavenger and chloroform as shown in fig 14 the dcf removal efficiency was 97 8 in absence of scavenger however it was decreased to 57 9 by adding the tert butyl alcohol tba as the oh scavenger meanwhile the addition of chloroform as an o2 scavenger to ef system has a small effect on the efficiency of dcf removal based on this it can be concluded that dcf removal in the studied conditions is mainly due to oh similar results about the effect of tba scavenger during ef degradation of dye 55 and antibiotic 48 have been reported based on the above results and other studies a possible mechanism for the degradation of dcf in the heterogeneous ef process based on mswcnts was proposed as shown in fig 15 o2 was initially adsorbed onto the graphite felt surface and then h2o2 was electro generated on the cathode by reducing the o2 at the same time according to the results of fig 11 d h2o2 was produced by electrochemical reduction of the o2 on the mswcnts surface these h2o2 values were decomposed by the haber weiss mechanism 59 to produce oh on the surface of the catalyst and in the solution by ferrous ion in this process the ferrous ion reduction through the direct electro reduction of the ferric ion on the surface of the cathode and the particle electrode can be occurred 10 60 61 eventually dcf was degraded into the intermediate products shown in table 2 by generated oh on the other hand according to the results of fig 11 a and other studies 10 35 54 62 the dcf can be degraded by direct oxidation using the ti ruo2 anode 4 conclusion in this study a new heterogeneous ef system using synthesized mswcnts was utilized to remove the dcf and to produce the h2o2 the results showed that the heterogeneous ef system has a high efficiency in degradation of dcf and electrochemical production of h2o2 under the optimum conditions of 20 ma cm2 current density ph of 5 10 mg l dcf 1 ml min air flow and 80 mg l mswcnts compared to other electro catalytic degradation systems this increase in efficiency is related to the presence of mswcnts as a particle electrode for the electrochemical production of h2o2 and also as a heterogeneous catalyst for catalytic decomposition of h2o2 into oh the mswcnts electro catalytic stability more than 5 cycles showed an excellent reusability capacity for long term electro catalytic degradation of dcf based on the study of trapping experiments it was clarified that oh is the main oxidant in the heterogeneous ef system a potential mechanism and dcf degradation path were proposed based on ross and the identified intermediates finally these results confirmed the high potential of the heterogeneous ef system based on the mswcnts as an effective and promising process to overcome the drawbacks of the homogeneous ef process in the treatment of dcf containing aqueous solutions acknowledgement we are grateful for the financial support provided by the

fenton ef process using magnetic single walled carbon nanotubes mswcnts as a new catalyst the effect of parameters including initial ph current density initial catalyst concentration the initial concentration of dcf and air flow rate on the efficiency of dcf removal and electrochemical production of h2o2 were studied a removal efficiency of 97 8 for dcf and 71 12 for cod was obtained at an initial ph of 5 current density of 20 ma cm2 mswcnts concentration of 80 mg l dcf concentration of 10 mg l air flow rate of 1 ml min and reaction time of 120 min regarding the removal of dcf and cod and production of h2o2 the heterogeneous ef process with mswcnts catalyst showed higher activity and efficiency than other electro catalytic degradation systems the stability tests of mswcnts after 5 time application confirmed its performance potential for long term degradation of dcf in aqueous solutions intermediate products such as 2 3 dichlorobenzene and 2 4 dichlorophenol were identified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms based on the identification of reactive species and the intermediate products a possible mechanism of removal and degradation pathways for dcf was suggested keywords diclofenac heterogeneous electro fenton single walled carbon nanotubes h2o2 kinetic 1 introduction in recent years the occurrence and stability of drug compounds and their derivatives in aquatic environments have been recognized and considered as an emerging issue due to their effect on human health and aquatic ecosystems 1 2 diclofenac is a type of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid that is mainly used as an analgesic anti rheumatic and anti inflammatory drug 3 based on intercontinental marketing services ims health data the global consumption of dcf is estimated to be 1443 58 ton y 1 4 due to the extensive use and inadequate removal of this drug by the conventional wastewater treatment process only 20 30 removal efficiency dcf has been detected in surface and underground water in the concentration ranges from ng l to μg l 4 7 long term exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of dcf and its combination with disinfectants and other contaminants can lead to serious effects on human health and aquatic life 7 8 therefore studies on effective removal of dcf from aqueous solutions are important conventional methods for the removal of nsaids from aqueous solutions include the biological processes coagulation flocculation adsorption filtration and flotation 9 previous studies reported that these processes have mainly disadvantages such as low efficiency secondary pollutant production and expensiveness 10 in contrast the advanced oxidation processes aops based on the production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals oh have high efficiency in the mineralization of toxic and harmful compounds 11 12 these processes involve the chemical photochemical and electrochemical methods for the chemical degradation of organic pollutants 13 among the aops fenton reaction with h2o2 and transitional metals especially ferrous ion has been evaluated in numerous studies due to the simplicity of the operation low cost materials and high degradation efficiency 14 15 however this method has disadvantages such as the production of large amounts of iron sludge low stability of h2o2 and high consumption rate of fenton reagent 14 16 in recent years ef process has been considered as a promising technology to eliminate the problems described above 17 the electro fenton process is an advanced indirect electrochemical oxidation process that produces oh by the reaction of electro generated h2o2 with fe2 ion eq 1 18 this process compared to the fenton process has high efficiency high rate of fe2 ion regeneration on the surface of the cathode and in situ production of h2o2 eq 2 however some disadvantages such as need for acidic ph and production of high amounts of iron sludge after the neutralization stage in ef process have not been solved 16 17 recently researchers have suggested the use of a solid catalyst containing iron to eradicate these problems various types of catalysts such as activated carbon 19 zeolite 20 bentonite 21 sludge 22 and spiolote 23 have been used to provide a catalyst based on heterogeneous iron compared to these catalysts single wall carbon nanotubes swcnts have high chemical and mechanical stability characteristics high electrical conductivity and good electrochemical performance 24 the unique electronics characteristics of these particles have been effectively considered in the electrochemical process as a method for development of the electron transfer reaction 25 in addition swcnts have a high specific surface area with high potential to absorb the contaminants and develop direct and indirect electrolytic oxidation processes 26 according to previous studies swcnts have also a potential of catalyst replacement for both anode and cathode electrodes in fuel cells and photo electrochemical cells 26 27 1 h 2 o 2 f e 2 o h o h f e 3 2 o 2 2 h 2 e 2 h 2 o 2 in the present study dcf oxidation was performed using a heterogeneous ef process with mswcnts the effect of important parameters such

degradation pathway was proposed in addition the electro catalytic performance of the heterogeneous ef process was studied in comparison with the other electro catalytic degradation systems 2 material and methods 2 1 material diclofenac sodium salt dcf c14h10cl2nnao2 cas no 15307 79 6 mw 318 13 g mol was purchased from sigma aldrich single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts purity 96 internal diameter

from the merck co germany all chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification 2 2 catalyst synthesis the greater purification of swcnts was performed by keeping it in concentrated nitric acid at 50 c for 6 h after removing the impurities 1 g swcnts was added into 100 ml of a solution containing 0 42 g fecl2 4h2o and 0 62 g fecl3 6h2o then the ph of the solution was adjusted to ph 10 11 using 1 m naoh the solution was heated at 95 100 c and stored for 2 h under stirring and nitrogen gas after these steps solids were separated by a magnetic field and then washed with distilled water and ethanol finally the product was dried under vacuum 28 2 3 preparation of ti ruo2 pre purification of titanium ti plate was performed according to the method proposed by pourzamani et al 29 the ti plate was polished with a 320 grit paper strip and then immersed in a 10 boiling oxalic acid solution the pre purified ti plate was dipped in a coating solution of 0 1 m rucl3 in ethanol to obtain a suitable catalyst the above method was repeated by 20 cycles and the ti plate was baked at 450 c for 10 min during each cycle and for 2 h during the final cycle 2 4 experimental methods diclofenac electrochemical degradation experiments were performed in a 500 ml reactor ti ruo2 and graphite felt were used as anode and cathode respectively the distance between the anode and cathode was 1 cm 0 05 m sodium sulfate was used as a supporting electrolyte and the ph of the solution was adjusted to desired level with 0 01 m h2so4 or naoh dc power supply was used to supply the required electrical energy and the experiments were carried out under a constant current all experiments of the electro oxidation process were performed under an air flow rate to provide oxygen for continuous h2o2 production the solution was continuously mixed at 250 rpm using a magnetic stirrer to maintain uniformity in the concentration of electrolyte solution the effects of initial ph 4 10 current density 5 30 ma cm2 catalyst concentration 5 100 mg l initial concentration of dcf 2 30 mg l and air flow rate 0 2 l min were investigated on the dcf removal efficiency the aqueous solution of 10 ml was used at various times 0 120 min for dcf analysis the stability and reusability of the catalyst were tested via repeated dcf degradation under the optimum conditions 2 5 analytical methods the phase identification and analysis of the crystalline structure of the samples were performed by x ray powder diffraction model pw1730 philips co netherlands the morphology and elemental analysis was carried out by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem coupled with energy dispersive spectrometer eds and transmission electron microscopy tem the chemical oxygen demand cod was determined using uv vis spectrophotometer based on standard methods the concentration of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was determined by titration of potassium permanganate kmno4 for this titration 4 ml of 4 m sulphuric acid was added to 100 ml of the work solution a 0 025 m potassium permanganate solution was used as the titrant and added to the work solution until the appearance of purple colour the quantitative analysis of dcf and its intermediate products was performed by gc ms before analysis in order to extract and concentrate the analytes the samples were pretreated by the dispersive liquid liquid microextraction dllme method for dllme the solution ph was adjusted to 1 using concentrated hydrochloric acid and then 1 ml of acetone containing 80 μl chloroform was added to the 5 ml of the solution the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm and the deposited phase was extracted and dried using nitrogen gas 30 the dried sample was derivatized with 20 μl n methyl n trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide mstfa and finally the 2 μl samples were injected into the gc ms system equipped with the db 5 column the gc was operated at a column temperature of 120 c for 4 min and then increased to 300 c at a temperature ramp of 20 c min to explain the kinetic of dcf removal the obtained experimental data in this research were fitted to pseudo first order kinetics eq 3 where k is the pseudo first order rate constant c0 and c are the initial dcf concentration mg l and its concentration at time t respectively 3 ln c 0 c kt 3 results and discussion 3 1 the characteristics of mswcnts catalyst fig 1 shows the xrd pattern of the mswcnts catalyst according to the figure the peaks of 2ɵ 26 06 and 44 62 indicate the structure of swcnts while the peaks of 2ɵ 51 91 and 37 79 represent the fe3o4 loading on swcnts the results inside of fig 1 confirm the magnetic properties of swcnts containing fe3o4 nanoparticles the morphology of the mswcnt catalyst synthesized is obtained by the sem analysis and is shown in fig 2 as can be seen iron oxide nanoparticles have successfully coated onto the surface of swcnt the eds analysis confirmed the results of xrd and sem and showed the presence of carbon oxygen and iron at the surface of the swcnt moreover the tem image fig 3 showed the distribution of fe3o4 nanoparticles in the form of black spots on the surface and inside the swcnt 3 2 characteristics of ti ruo2 fig 4 shows the sem micrograph of ruo2 coated on the ti plate according to this figure the anode surface has a cracked mud structure which is common in the dimensionally stable anodes dsa as a result of the sintering process 31 according to bai et al 32 the cracked mud structure exhibits the large specific surface area of an anode which can provide countless active sites for increasing electro catalyst activity the eds spectrum confirms the presence of ti ru and o in the surface layer of ruo2 coated on the ti bed the xrd pattern in fig 5 shows that under the dipping process the rutile type of ruo2 is formed on the surface of the ti 3 3 effect of initial ph the initial ph plays an important role in the formation of reactive oxygen species ross and the micro electrolysis process of mswcnts in the heterogeneous ef process the initial ph in the range of 4 10 without further control was investigated for dcf removal in this study this studied range of ph was selected to reduce the precipitation effect on the efficiency of dcf removal pérez estrada et al 33 and bae et al 34 reported that dcf solubility is strongly influenced by the ph of the solution and dcf may be precipitated at ph 4 due to the pka value of dcf fig 6 a shows the effect of the solution ph on the removal efficiency of the heterogeneous ef process based on mswcnts according to the figure the removal efficiency increased with decreasing the ph so that the maximum dcf removal efficiency was at ph values of 4 and 5 and the reaction time of 120 min the results of the kinetic analysis showed that dcf removal efficiency increases with decreasing the ph table 1 this can be related to the production of the high amount of oh through the reaction 1 due to the faster production of h2o2 by swcnts and graphite felt and the leaching of iron ions from mswcnts micro electrolysis at ph 4 and 5 35 in addition the ph value lower than the neutral values easily controls the evolution of oxygen to increase the overall current efficiency for direct and indirect oxidation of contaminants on the anode 36 similar results were observed by hou et al 37 for the removal of total organic carbon from a wastewater increasing the efficiency in acidic ph may also be due to the adsorption regeneration of the particle electrode and the degradation of the contaminant on it nidheesh et al 18 reported that the reaction of adsorbed pollutant and h2o2 on the surface of the catalyst in addition to regenerating of the active site lead to the production of intermediate products bounab et al 19 developed a desorption process for an activated carbon containing iron catalyst after 90 min of electrolysis and found that the concentration of contaminants was close to 1 of its initial concentration yue et al 38 examined the removal of azo dye by the fepmo12o40 catalyzed electrochemical process and reported that in the acidic state h was adsorbed onto the surface sites of the catalyst and this surface was recovered through the sequential removal of intermediate species hence the removal efficiency of pollutant increases at ph greater than 5 decreasing in the removal efficiency may be due to the decomposition of h2o2 into o2 and h2o and reduction in the oxidation potential of oh from e0 2 8 v to e14 1 96 39 40 rostamizadeh et al 41 studied the azo dye degradation by ef process with the fe zsm 5 nanocatalyst and found that the removal efficiency of the dye was reduced from 95 at ph 3 10 at ph 7 due to the low oxidation potential of oh and the instability of h2o2 these results also are in accordance with the results of rosales et al 39 for decolourization by ef process based on fe alginate gel beads in order to confirm the effect of initial ph on the dcf removal efficiency the concentration of h2o2 at electrolysis time of 120 min was monitored and the results are shown in fig 6 b it can be seen that by increasing the ph from 4 to 10 the amount of h2o2 production decreases this may be due to a decrease in the concentration of proton in solution 42 the results of fig 6 b also show that the concentration of h2o2 was decreased only 2 mg l when the ph raised from 4 to 5 this behaviour may be related to the fact that the ph effect on the decomposition of h2o2 is attenuated due to its continuous production by swcnts hou et al 37 reported that the removal efficiency of toc was decreased slightly by increasing the ph from 3 to 7 5 the authors explained this fact on the basis of continuous h2o2 electrochemical production by activated carbon containing iron shen et al 43 reported that cnts in an acidic and neutral environment by adsorbing o2 led to the continuous production of h2o2 by its electrochemical reduction regarding the above results and the neutral ph of the wastewater generated from the industries ph 5 was selected as the optimum ph for subsequent experiments of the heterogeneous ef process 3 4 effect of current density in order to investigate the effect of current density on the performance of the heterogeneous ef process the experiments were carried out at a current density of 5 10 15 20 and 30 ma cm2 and the results are shown in fig 7 a the dcf removal efficiency was increased from 84 to 98 5 by increasing the current density from 5 ma cm2 to 20 ma cm2 after 120 min of electrolysis time the results of the kinetic analysis showed the same trends in dcf removal efficiency the constant kinetic rate was increased from 0 0135 min 1 to 0 0296 min 1 when the current density increased from 5 ma cm2 to 20 ma cm2 table 1 this may be due to the faster production of h2o2 eq 2 and faster reduction of ferrous ions at the cathode surface eq 4 at a higher current density which led to further production of oh 44 the greater dcf molecules were adsorbed to the electrode by increasing the current density therefore the collision between oh and dcf molecules increases in addition at a proper current density the particles are polarized into the form of microelectrodes that can increase the oxidation and electro sorption process 45 similar results have been obtained by hammouda et al 46 for the degradation of malodorous compounds from aqueous solutions li et al 47 investigated the use of the tio2 sio2 gac particles to increase the electro catalytic removal of orange 7 dye in a three dimensional reactor and found that by increasing the current density the dye removal efficiency increases due to the polarization of the particles to multiple microelectrodes fig 7 a also shows that by increasing the current density from 20 ma cm2 to 30 ma cm2 the efficiency of heterogeneous ef process decreases these results were confirmed with the constant rate of reaction reported in table 1 this may be related to the presence of parasitic electrochemical reactions such as reducing o2 to form h2o instead of h2o2 on graphite felt eq 5 and oxidation of water to o2 instead of oh on ti ruo2 eq 6 48 iranpour et al 28 obtained the same results and showed that by increasing the current density the efficiency of the removal of dye decreases nideesh et al 11 also showed that by increasing the voltage from 10 v to 12 v the efficiency of the fe3o4 catalyzed ef process decreases 4 f e 3 e f e 2 5 o 2 4 h 4 e h 2 o 6 ti r u o 2 2 h 2 o t i r u o 2 o 2 4 h 4 e to confirm the effect of current density on dcf removal h2o2 concentration was monitored during the oxidation without the presence of contaminant and the results are shown in fig 7 b according to the figure by an increase in the current density from 5 ma cm2 to 20 ma cm2 the production rate of h2o2 rises from 19 8 mg l to 35 8 mg l this is related to the production of h2o2 through the reaction between o2 and h2o on the surface of both graphite felt and mswcnts a further increase in the current density from 20 ma cm2 to 30 ma cm2 led to decreasing the h2o2 production through h2o2 decomposition into h2o similar results were observed by lei et al 49 for the degradation of the dye by ef using activated carbon fibre cathode based on these considerations 20 ma cm2 was selected as the optimum current density to obtain a highest dcf removal efficiency a high production rate of h2o2 and relatively low energy consumption 3 5 the effect of the initial concentration of mswcnts the effect of the initial concentration of mswcnts on the efficiency of dcf removal by the heterogeneous ef process is shown in fig 8 a it can be seen that the dcf removal efficiency was increased when the initial catalyst concentration increased from 5 mg l to 80 mg l but the efficiency of the heterogeneous ef process was significantly reduced by further increase of the catalyst concentration the results of the kinetic analysis showed the same trends in dcf elimination efficiency the constant rate of kinetic was increased from 0 0122 min 1 to 0 0304 min 1 with the catalyst concentration increase from 5 mg l to 80 mg l however k slowly decreased to 0 0181 min 1 when the initial concentration was increased to 100 mg l an increase in the catalyst concentration is indicative of an increase in the amount of ferrous ion released from the catalyst surface which leads to improving oh production through reaction 1 and better degradation of dcf however a further increase of the catalyst reduces the efficiency of dcf removal due to consumption of oh by additional ferrous ion 50 additionally the active sites on the surface of graphite felt are occupied by ferric ions which leads to a decrease in the number of active sites on the graphite surface to produce h2o2 11 zhang et al 35 reported that by increasing the catalyst concentration the efficiency 2 4 dichlorophenol removal was initially increased then it was decreased by further catalyst increase ozcan et al 48 examined the electro catalytic degradation of enoxacin by ef process catalyzed by kaolin magnetic and reported that the removal efficiency increases by increasing the catalyst concentration from 0 1 g to 0 3 g due to the more production of oh but it significantly decreases by further increase of catalyst to confirm the effect of the initial concentration of the catalyst on dcf removal the h2o2 concentration was monitored during the electro oxidation process and the results are shown in fig 8 b when the initial concentration of catalyst increases from 5 mg l to 80 mg l the concentration of h2o2 produced increases from 20 1 mg l to 34 5 mg l this may be due to the unique features of swcnts to absorb o2 and its electrochemical reduction to h2o2 shen et al 43 studied the methylene blue electrochemical degradation on the basis of the particle electrode composite of carbon nanotube and fe3o4 and found that carbon nanotubes by absorbing o2 and improving the charge transfer lead to produce more reactive species such as h2o2 and oh with increasing the catalyst concentration the amount of h2o2 produced decreases from 34 5 mg l to 30 8 mg l according to these results 80 mg l catalyst was selected as an optimum concentration for the heterogeneous ef system and subsequent experiments 3 6 effect of initial concentration of dcf the effect of the initial concentration of dcf on the efficiency of the heterogeneous ef process was studied at six concentrations of 2 5 10 15 20 and 30 mg l as shown in fig 9 a by increasing the initial concentration from 2 mg l to 30 mg l the removal efficiency was reduced from 99 8 81 at 120 min of electrolysis time these results were confirmed with the constant reaction rate shown in fig 9 b and table 1 according to these results the constant rate of kinetic was decreased from 0 0463 min 1 to 0 0124 min 1 with the dcf initial concentration increase from 2 mg l to 30 mg l the decrease in the removal rate is due to the reduction of the concentration of oxidants such as oh compared to dcf molecules shen et al 10 and eshaghzadeh et al 51 observed the same results in the three dimensional and heterogeneous ef reactors panizza and oturan 44 also reported that by increasing the initial concentrations of contaminants the amount of dye degradation is decreased due to the competition of dye molecules and intermediate products formed during the process with oh fig 9 a also shows that during the electrolysis of 120 min the efficiency of the heterogeneous ef process at dcf concentrations of 2 5 and 10 mg l is similar this is due to the high availability of dcf molecules to oh during the ef process similar results were obtained by pourzamani et al 29 for dcf degradation by electro oxidation 3 7 effect of air flow rate the effect of airflow rate on dcf removal efficiency is shown in fig 10 a as can be seen by increasing the air flow rate from 0 to 1 ml min the dcf removal efficiency raises from 69 to 98 9 at an electrolysis time of 120 min the results of the kinetic analysis showed that the dcf removal rate was increased by increasing airflow table 1 increasing the removal efficiency in the flow rate of 1 ml min is due to the production of high values of h2o2 by the cathode electrode and swcnts as well as the increasing of oh production through reaction 1 fixed efficiency at high values of 1 ml min may be related to the high h2o2 production and its competition with the substrate for reaction with oh these results are in good agreement with yue et al 52 and lue et al 53 to confirm the effect of airflow rate on dcf removal the h2o2 concentration was monitored at electrolysis time of 120 min and the results are shown in fig 10 b according to this figure by increasing the air flow rate from 0 to 1 ml min the concentration of h2o2 was increased and then the amount of production remained constant by its increasing to the values higher than 1 ml min this may be due to the unique features of swcnts and graphite felt for absorbing o2 and its rapid reduction to h2o2 considering these results and reducing the energy consumption the air of 1 ml min as input into the system was considered for further experiments 3 8 electro catalytic performance of the heterogeneous ef based on mswcnts to investigate the performance of the heterogeneous ef process based on mswcnts to remove the dcf and cod a comparison was made between different systems such as two dimensional electrochemical 2de homogeneous ef and three dimensional electrochemical 3de fig 11 a and b show the efficiency of the removal of dcf and cod by various processes for the adsorption process by mswcnts only 18 7 of dcf removal was achieved at 120 min which indicates an inadequate efficiency of adsorption experiments by the catalyst the limitation of the adsorption capacity of mswcnts may be due to its low concentration in aqueous solution when the 2de system was used after 120 min the dcf and cod removal efficiency was achieved to be 52 1 and 35 5 respectively this relatively low removal efficiency can be related to the production of oh on the surface of ti ruo2 anode by the anode oxidation 54 however the removal of dcf and cod by the homogeneous ef process occurs more and faster than the 2de process this may be due to oh production by the reaction between h2o2 produced from the cathode surface with fe2 eq 1 compared to these processes the swcnts based 3d process showed a dcf removal efficiency of 72 5 and cod removal efficiency of 52 2 at a reaction time of 120 min and ph 5 this high efficiency may be due to the synergistic effect of the adsorption process and 2de as well as the formation of multiple microelectrodes in the solution by adding the particle electrode and an electrostatic induction the particles are converted to the form of a micro electrolysis with an opposite charge on both ends hence the electrochemical reactions occur on both the main and particle electrode surfaces and thus the pollutant removal efficiency increases 10 in sharp contrast the dcf and cod electro catalytic removal efficiency by the heterogeneous ef was 97 8 and 71 12 respectively the high degradation rate of the heterogeneous ef process can be related to the synergistic effect of the homogeneous ef and 3d processes similar results were observed by liu et al 55 for the treatment of dye wastewater by ef system based on a composite of nickel foam and ferrous ion fig 11 c shows the results of the regression analysis performed for the results of different electro catalytic degradation processes in agreement with the dcf and cod degradation efficiency the constant rate 0 0284 min 1 of the heterogeneous ef system was much higher than the swcnts based 3d system 0 0098 min 1 homogeneous ef 0 0064 min 1 and 2de 0 0058 min 1 this remarkable increase in the dcf removal is due to the synergistic effect between iron ions and swcnts in the heterogeneous ef system these results are in good agreement with liu et al 56 in addition to the dcf degradation the amount of h2o2 accumulation was determined in various electro catalytic degradation systems as shown in fig 11 d a small amount of h2o2 was detected for the homogeneous 2de and ef processes in contrast the h2o2 concentration in the 3d system based on swcnts reached the 50 12 mg l and high h2o2 accumulation in this system was due to the fact that swcnts can generate h2o2 eq 2 by absorbing o2 and reducing its electrochemical when iron is loaded into the 3d system based on swcnts the amount of produced h2o2 is much lower than the 3de process this fact shows that the iron on the catalyst and leached into the solution acts as a catalyst for the decomposition of h2o2 into oh all of these results show the benefits of the heterogeneous ef process in the removal of dcf cod and production of ross in comparison with other electro catalytic processes 3 9 stability and reusability of the mswcnts catalyst for practical applications the catalyst stability and reusability of the heterogeneous ef process are important therefore the stability and reusability of mswcnts were studied at ph of 5 current density of 20 ma cm2 mswcnts concentration of 80 mg l dcf concentration of 10 mg l and air flow rate of 1 l min according to fig 12 a slight difference was observed after 5 consecutive cycles compared to the first oxidation cycle which indicates the stability and reusability of the mswcnts catalyst after 10 cycles the dcf removal efficiency was decreased from 97 8 78 11 while the cod removal efficiency was decreased from 71 12 53 11 this reduction in efficiency in these long cycles is due to the leaching of iron into solution and the adsorption of intermediate products on the catalyst surface these results indicate that mswcnts is a suitable candidate for dcf electro oxidation degradation in 5 consecutive cycles in order to validate the results of stability xrd and ft ir analysis was used for the catalyst regenerated after the fifth run the xrd pattern fig 12 b and the ft ir spectrum fig 12 c showed a similar structure and phases of mswcnts before and after the electro oxidation process the purity of the mswcnts after the fifth run of the cycle was confirmed by the eds as shown in fig 12 d these results indicate that the heterogeneous catalyst of mswcnts has good stability and reusability for the electrochemical degradation of dcf 3 10 analysis of the intermediate products and the possible pathway of dcf degradation to better understand the dcf degradation mechanism by the heterogeneous ef process based on mswcnts the intermediate products were identified by gcms table 2 summarizes the characteristics of products identified from the dcf oxidation based on these intermediate identified the reaction pathways of a b and c are proposed and shown in fig 13 on the pathway a the dcf molecules can be degraded to 1 2 6 dichlorophenyl 1 3 dihydro 2h indol 2 one by the reaction of intramolecular cyclization and water removal which has a good agreement with zhao et al 57 in the b pathway by the decarboxylation and oh attack to the dcf molecules the 2 chlorophenazine intermediate is formed ziylan et al 58 reported the same dcf degradation pathway direct degradation of dcf pathway c and its intermediates pathways b and c by cleavage of the c n bond by oh attack causes to form the 2 3 dichlorobenzene and 2 4 dichlorophenol as the final by product these detected final by products were very similar to the by products identified in other studies 29 3 11 the mechanism of degradation of heterogeneous ef process in electro oxidation processes the organic pollutants are degraded through ross therefore determining the dominant species and their effect on pollutants are important in determining the mechanism of the electro oxidation process to evaluate the reactive species dcf degradation behaviour was observed in the presence and absence of tba scavenger and chloroform as shown in fig 14 the dcf removal efficiency was 97 8 in absence of scavenger however it was decreased to 57 9 by adding the tert butyl alcohol tba as the oh scavenger meanwhile the addition of chloroform as an o2 scavenger to ef system has a small effect on the efficiency of dcf removal based on this it can be concluded that dcf removal in the studied conditions is mainly due to oh similar results about the effect of tba scavenger during ef degradation of dye 55 and antibiotic 48 have been reported based on the above results and other studies a possible mechanism for the degradation of dcf in the heterogeneous ef process based on mswcnts was proposed as shown in fig 15 o2 was initially adsorbed onto the graphite felt surface and then h2o2 was electro generated on the cathode by reducing the o2 at the same time according to the results of fig 11 d h2o2 was produced by electrochemical reduction of the o2 on the mswcnts surface these h2o2 values were decomposed by the haber weiss mechanism 59 to produce oh on the surface of the catalyst and in the solution by ferrous ion in this process the ferrous ion reduction through the direct electro reduction of the ferric ion on the surface of the cathode and the particle electrode can be occurred 10 60 61 eventually dcf was degraded into the intermediate products shown in table 2 by generated oh on the other hand according to the results of fig 11 a and other studies 10 35 54 62 the dcf can be degraded by direct oxidation using the ti ruo2 anode 4 conclusion in this study a new heterogeneous ef system using synthesized mswcnts was utilized to remove the dcf and to produce the h2o2 the results showed that the heterogeneous ef system has a high efficiency in degradation of dcf and electrochemical production of h2o2 under the optimum conditions of 20 ma cm2 current density ph of 5 10 mg l dcf 1 ml min air flow and 80 mg l mswcnts compared to other electro catalytic degradation systems this increase in efficiency is related to the presence of mswcnts as a particle electrode for the electrochemical production of h2o2 and also as a heterogeneous catalyst for catalytic decomposition of h2o2 into oh the mswcnts electro catalytic stability more than 5 cycles showed an excellent reusability capacity for long term electro catalytic degradation of dcf based on the study of trapping experiments it was clarified that oh is the main oxidant in the heterogeneous ef system a potential mechanism and dcf degradation path were proposed based on ross and the identified intermediates finally these results confirmed the high potential of the heterogeneous ef system based on the mswcnts as an effective and promising process to overcome the drawbacks of the homogeneous ef process in the treatment of dcf containing aqueous solutions acknowledgement we are grateful for the financial support provided by the

14343,the partial nitrification anammox pn a process can remove nitrogen from wastewater by converting approximately half of the ammonium to nitrite by ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob followed by converting the remaining ammonium and nitrite to n2 by anammox bacteria both the mbbr and ifas processes can achieve the pn a process in a single stage reactor under appropriate operation in this study steady state simulation using sumo was conducted to investigate the effects of key parameters do and cod n ratio on the pn a process in both mbbr and ifas results showed that mbbr and ifas achieved about 90 total nitrogen removal by pn a process with energy efficient aeration and low cod n ratios when treating domestic wastewater ifas achieved optimal nitrogen removal with lower do concentration whereas mbbr showed better nitrogen removal at low cod n ratio biomass concentration and process rates indicated that partial nitrification occurred throughout the biofilm of mbbr but

nitritation anammox pn a has been demonstrated to be promising for better nutrient removal with minimum operating cost for wastewater treatment plants wwtps 1 the pn a process consists of partial ammonia nitrification and the anaerobic oxidation of ammonia with nitrite anammox these two steps are mainly performed by two groups of organisms ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anaerobic ammonium oxidizers aao in aerobic and anoxic environment respectively 2 compared to traditional nitrification denitrification pn a process generally reduces up to 60 of aeration consumption and up to 100 of organic carbon demand providing demonstrated long term operational cost savings for wwtps 3 other benefits of the pn a process include decreased sludge production and greenhouse gases n2o and co2 emissions which constitute a major cost and environmental concern for wwtps 4 5 when the pn a process was first implemented it was achieved separately in two different reactors e g sharon type reactors for better control of operating conditions 6 recently research and practice focus have shifted to single stage reactor setting 7 8 it was reported that a single stage reactor can achieve the pn a process under appropriate aeration 9 since the multi layers structure of biofilms can provide different redox environment for aob and aao growth currently single reactors mainly include the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr and the integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas which are increasingly implemented for nitrogen removal enhancement especially for pn a process 10 11 mbbr consists of an aeration tank with carriers for biofilm growth combining the advantages of both activated sludge process and biofilm reactors 12 in a mbbr aob which perform partial nitrification exist on the exterior of the biofilm whereas aao stay deeper in the biofilm to conduct anammox ifas is a hybrid process relying on both biofilm and suspended activated sludge in which aob preferentially grow in activated sludge and aao are prone to grow in the biofilm 13 14 mbbr and ifas are efficient alternatives for organic carbon and nitrogen removal combining the advantages of both activated sludge process and a biofilm reactor two main challenges face the successful implementation of the pn a process these include the suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in the partial nitritation process and the promotion of aob and aao retention in the anammox process 1 5 when it comes to mbbr and ifas the dissolved oxygen do and carbon to nitrogen cod n ratio have been identified as key factors to control biomass aob nob and aao concentration and achieve effective pn a process malovanyy et al 15 studied the effect of cod n ratio on ifas and mbbr for nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater by pn a process they reported that soluble cod scod nh4 n ratio decreased from 1 8 to 1 3 nitrogen removal efficiency of ifas decreased by 30 while still maintaining 150 higher removal rate than that of mbbr additionally aob nob activity in the ifas remained relatively stable during whole operation period in another study by yang et al 11 high nitrogen removal efficiency 82 was achieved at cod n ratio of 1 3 in the ifas system and they found that residual ammonium can significantly influence the stability of pn a these investigations demonstrated that cod n ratio is a key factor in achieving long term stability operation of pn a process reduced consumption and lower organic carbon demand by pn a can reduce costs in wastewater treatment 4 aeration control is another operational difficulty for pn a process on the one hand partial nitrification is achieved by favouring the growth of aob over nob which is affected by do concentration 16 on the other hand the aeration should allow for simultaneous partial nitritation and anammox it could be concluded that shortcut nitrogen removal by mbbr and ifas could meet target removal efficiency however the effect of cod n ratio and aeration control were revealed as the main operational difficulties pilot investigations for process optimization are expensive and limited for mechanism exploration modeling provides a useful tool for researchers and engineers to design analyze and optimize the wastewater treatment processes reactors with biofilm and suspended activated sludge can be simulated using common plant simulators however mass transfer between liquid phase and biofilm attachment and detachment of biofilm and biokinetics make the simulation complex to calibrate and achieve 17 an original calibration protocol was proposed to predict the mass variation and biomass concentration of biofilm and suspended activated sludge 17 however few simulations studied the biokinetic differences between biofilm and suspended activated sludge because most of commercial simulators do not allow assigning different biokinetic parameter values to suspended activated sludge and biofilm this further limits the accurate simulation of reactors with both biofilm and suspended activated sludge such as the ifas system a new approach implemented in sumo dynamita france makes it possible to separately set the monod switching terms 18 in addition carriers are also allowed to move between the bioreactor system in this model 18 therefore sumo provides a potential to compare the pn a process in ifas and mbbr system by mathematical simulation in this study the pn a process in mbbr and ifas is simulated for the first time using sumo in order to review and further investigate the operating conditions and their influence on the process performance the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the operating considerations of pn a in ifas and mbbr systems by mathematical simulation 2 compare the pn a performance in ifas and mbbr such a simulation could provide a new approach to study pn a process in ifas and mbbr systems the results of this study are expected to inform process designers and plant operators regarding mbbr and ifas treatment process design and operation optimization 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbbr and ifas model set up the biotechnology for nitrogen removal by mbbr and ifas through the pn a process was simulated using the process model simulator sumo by dynamita nyons france the road map of simulation is shown in fig 1 which includes three main steps 1 identifying the model scope and aligning it with the study objectives 2 setting up a representative treatment process layout in sumo and collecting data necessary for running the planned simulations and 3 model running and results analysis ifas and mbbr were developed as the key element in each flowsheet fig 2 shows the configuration of mbbr and ifas systems for pn a process simulation both systems consist of a primary treatment unit a bioreactor unit and a clarifier unit air flow rates and cod n ratios were set as the variables to investigate their effects on the performance of pn a process the simulations were run 17 times and 19 times for the air flow rates and cod n ratio respectively results analysis focused on the impact of the two investigated variables on the treatment performance and biomass composition in mbbr and ifas to compare the pn a process in the mbbr and ifas the kinetics of aob nob and aao were set as the default values built in sumo which is developed for two step nitrification denitrification process in the sumo model the default maximum specific growth rates of aob nob and aao are 0 85 d 1 0 65 d 1 and 0 1 d 1 respectively and the default oxygen half saturation of aob nob and aao were 0 5 g o2 m3 0 5 g o2 m3 and 0 4 g o2 m3 respectively the effect of temperature was taken into account in the model through the arrhenius law the biofilm was defined by its mean thickness 30 μm and was separated into three completely mixed layers in addition a mass transfer boundary layer was considered with a boundary layer thickness of 3 μm the biofilm model used in the simulation is the basic mbbr and ifas module in sumo a biofilm reactor model usually consists of 1 process kinetic and stoichiometric model 2 biofilm model and 3 bulk liquid hydrodynamic model 19 in terms of biological nitrogen transformation a conceptual model was used as shown in fig 3 the model consists of the following transformations a hydrolysis of particulate organic nitrogen pon to dissolved organic nitrogen don b ammonification of don to ammonia c nitratation of ammonia to nitrite by ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob d nitrification of nitrite by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob e denitrification of nitrate to nitrogen gas f anammox of nitrite and ammonia to nitrogen gas by autotrophic anammox bacteria aao g nitrogen utilization for biosynthesis and h decay of bacterial biomass to organic nitrogen compounds fig 3 in addition sumo allows biofilm carriers to transfer between bioreactors therefore it was assumed that there would be no loss of the biofilm carrier another modification in sumo is that the half saturation values in suspended phase and biofilm phase can be set separately 2 2 data source characteristics of influent wastewater were selected based on domestic wastewater 20 a selected set of fractionation information are shown in table 1 which are default value in the sumo model the values of operating parameters used for the model were obtained from recent literatures on pn a process using mbbr and ifas reactors table 2 according to previous research on pn a process the hydraulic retention time hrt for ifas and mbbr ranged from 7 to 24 h and 13 8 98 4 h respectively in this research 24 h was set as the hrt and similarly 30 days as the solids retention time srt to meet the requirements of both mbbr and ifas the default sumo kinetic and stoichiometric parameters were used in the simulation key parameters are shown in table 3 2 3 simulation and analysis after the configuration of mbbr and ifas model different steady state simulations were developed to estimate the impacts of varying operating conditions including do concentration and cod n ratio on pn a process performance in both mbbr and ifas other operating parameters remained as default values output data was analyzed from three different aspects treatment performance nitrogen and cod removal biomass concentration and biological process rates the biomass includes ordinary heterotrophic organism oho aob nob and aao simulation results were compared to literature results to provide recommendations on the operating considerations of pn a in mbbr and ifas systems 3 results and discussion pn a was successfully developed in the modeled mbbr and ifas treatment systems both mbbr and ifas showed different properties at varying do concentrations and cod n ratios within a certain range of do and cod n ratio both mbbr and ifas can achieve high nitrogen removal efficiencies in the following sections biomass concentration and process rates were analyzed to further understand the pn a process in mbbr and ifas systems 3 1 effect of do on pn a in the mbbr and ifas the do concentration in the mbbr and ifas is determined by air flow rate for the pn a process it is crucial to control air flow rate not only to inhibit nob growth caused by high do concentration but also in order to oxidize about a half of the existing ammonia into nitrite 21 steady state simulation was used to assess the impact of a range of air flow rates 4000 19 000 m3 h on the performance of the pn a process in mbbr and ifas 3 1 1 treatment performance treatment performance of cod and nitrogen was analyzed under different air flow rates it could be observed from fig 4 that the effluent cod in mbbr and ifas was below 50 mg l at steady stage resulting in a high cod removal efficiency 90 no significant effect of air flow rate on cod removal was observed in both mbbr and ifas the low air flow rate did not deteriorate the treatment of cod even when the corresponding do decreased to 0 4 mg l similar results were reported by previous research on mbbr and ifas canziani et al 16 investigated the effect of do concentration on mbbr treating landfill leachate and found when do concentration was as low as 0 2 0 5 mg l mbbr can still achieve relatively high cod removal efficiency in terms of ifas malovanyy et al 15 studied mainstream wastewater treatment in ifas by pn a process the effluent cod was relatively stable at different do set points 0 7 1 5 mg l it could be concluded that low do concentration may not be the limiting factor for cod removal in mbbr and ifas treating domestic wastewater however the nitrogen removal was significantly affected by air flow rate at low air flow rates both mbbr and ifas showed low nitrogen removal performance for mbbr peak nh4 n removal 99 9 and tn removal 88 9 occurred at the air flow rate of 18 000 m3 h and it started to decrease when air flow rate kept increasing therefore an air flow rate of 18 000 m3 h do 1 21 mg l seems to be optimal for mbbr to remove ammonia and total nitrogen this do value was consistent with results observed in previous research on mbbr via pn a process 9 15 22 in a single stage deammonification mbbr anammox activity was promoted when do set point ranged from 1 0 1 3 mg l 22 in addition malovanyy et al 15 reported that the operation of mbbr at low do concentration 1 1 1 7 mg l benefited the pn a process even at low temperature condition do was set at 1 1 1 7 mg l in order to stimulate the aob activity while inhibit nob growth simultaneously 9 previous research also reported that the do concentration was about 2 mg l to successfully establish simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd process in mbbr 23 this demonstrated that the nitrogen removal by pn a process in mbbr requires a lower do concentration resulting in lower energy consumption compared to mbbr ifas can achieve a higher nitrogen removal at lower air flow rates when air flow rate was 16 000 m3 h the tn and ammonia removal peaked to 91 7 and 99 9 respectively different from mbbr the activated sludge from the sludge recirculation is additionally used in ifas which means carrier fixed biofilms and activated sludge are combined in the same reaction tank volume the extra suspended sludge in the ifas can play a significant role in removing more nitrogen at lower air flow rates ifas was reported to operate under a low do concentration of 0 3 0 5 mg l and can still achieve an average nitrogen removal efficiency of 85 24 indicating low aeration requirements in another research ifas was used to treat real sewage and it was found that all the chambers were aerated to provide microaerobic conditions under which the do concentrations ranged from 0 15 to 0 36 mg l 11 this demonstrated a lower aeration requirement by ifas compared to mbbr through simulation the carbon and nitrogen conversion at different biofilm layers can be studied which is hard to investigate by experiments in the model built in sumo the biofilm in mbbr and ifas was set into three layers top middle and bottom layer each considered as perfectly mixed reactors three biofilm layers provide different redox environments including anaerobic anoxic and anaerobic condition which dictate the dominant biological and chemical processes 25 26 this provides the potential for two steps of pn a process built in one stage biofilm mbbr and ifas system under proper operating conditions in this study do concentration in the top biofilm layer of mbbr was much higher than that in the middle and bottom layers table 4 therefore partial nitrification was expected to take place predominantly in the top layer whereas anammox occurs in the middle and bottom layer this can be indicated by oxygen uptake rates our which will be discussed in section 3 1 2 different from mbbr the do concentration in the biofilm of ifas is extremely low thus partial nitrification is more likely to take place in the suspended activated sludge in ifas while attached biofilms provide anoxic environment for anammox this phenomenon was proved using molecular analysis by zhang et al 24 they found aob were more abundant in the activated sludge while anammox bacteria were primarily located in the biofilm according to simulation results higher air flow rates resulted in more generation of nitrite in both mbbr and ifas promoting partial nitrification meantime more nitrate was also produced under high air flow rate condition which inhibited partial nitrification and anammox when air flow rate reached 20 000 m3 h nitrate concentration was over 250 mg l and 100 mg l in the ifas and mbbr respectively resulting in low nitrogen removal efficiency therefore sufficient aeration is needed to provide dissolved oxygen for partial nitrification whereas excess aeration will in turn negatively affect the anammox process additionally it was calculated that the reduction of nh4 n was higher than the total production of no2 ˉ n and no3 ˉ n which could be an evidence that anammox occurred in the mbbr and ifas data not shown 3 1 2 the effect of air flow rate on biomass two main processes are included in pn a process which are performed by different microorganisms fig 5 shows the biomass concentration in the three biofilm layers of mbbr and ifas compared to aob nob and aao the concentration of oho was much higher in both mbbr and ifas in the biological process related to carbon cycle oho is responsible for cod removal 8 stable oho concentration indicated a small impact of air flow rate on cod treatment which is consistent with the high cod removal efficiency reported in section 3 1 1 additionally the oho were predominantly observed in the middle layer of biofilms in mbbr and ifas fig 5 a the oxidation of ammonia is the first step in pn a process different from traditional nitrification denitrification process only a half of ammonia is required to be oxidized to nitrite by aob in pn a process 27 in this case the aob concentration should be maintained at a proper level from fig 5 b it was found that aob concentration continuously increased with air flow rate in both reactors the total aob concentration in mbbr biofilm was higher than that in ifas biofilm this is consistent with the phenomenon that partial nitrification predominantly occurred throughout the biofilm of mbbr whereas for ifas it was restricted to the suspended activated sludge on the one hand the growth of aob should be promoted to ensure ammonia oxidization on the other hand it is also crucial to inhibit the growth of nob to prevent excess nitrite oxidization by comparison the concentration of nob was much lower than aob and aao in the biofilm of mbbr and ifas the lowest nob was observed at the flowrate of 18 000 m3 h and 16 000 m3 h in mbbr and ifas respectively under this condition the nitrogen removal performance was also at the highest level guisasola et al 28 pointed out that aob has higher affinity for do than nob the oxygen saturation coefficients of monod kinetics for nitritation by aob and nitration by nob were reported to be 0 3 mg l and 1 1 mg l respectively therefore nob activity was inhibited under relatively low do condition and undesired nitratation process was further suppressed aao is responsible for the anammox in the system which is the second step of pn a process contrary to the distribution of aob and nob aao dominated the middle and bottom layer of biofilm in mbbr and ifas fig 5 d this is because the growth of aao requires anoxic anaerobic environment which can be provided by the middle and bottom layer of biofilm when air flow rate was 16 000 m3 h in ifas aao concentration achieved the highest level companied with high concentration of aob resulting in the best anammox performance however aao started to decrease when aeration was above 16 000 m3 h and 17 000 m3 h in ifas and mbbr respectively this proved that excess aeration deteriorated the anammox process the higher concentration of aao was observed in ifas which was consistent with the better nitrogen removal ability by ifas than mbbr previous research on the pn a process reported that aao preferred to grow in the biofilm whereas aob and nob preferentially grow in the suspended activated sludge because of the less oxygen transfer limitation 24 29 which may explain that ifas with both biofilm and suspended activated sludge achieved better nitrogen removal efficiency this separate distribution of aao and aob could enhance operational stability and increase the nitrogen removal rate in the pn a process oxygen is mainly consumed by oho aob and nob thus the oxygen uptake rate our can indicate the rate of reactions implemented by different bacteria it can be seen in fig 6 that the oxygen uptake rate increased with air flow rate in the top and middle layers of mbbr however in the ifas the oxygen uptake rate was much lower and relatively stable this is another indication that nitrification which is an oxygen consuming process by aob and nob occurred throughout the biofilm of mbbr while mainly in the suspended activated sludge of ifas 3 2 effects of cod n on pn a in the mbbr and ifas traditional biological processes are economical to treat nitrogen polluted wastewater however they are not effective on raw wastewater with low cod n ratio due to a shortage of carbon sources for denitrification 30 the presence of organic matter either high cod concentrations or high cod n ratio was reported to affect the pn a process adversely 31 compared to conventional nitrification denitrification and snd pn a process presents a lower carbon consumption therefore the influent cod n ratio becomes a concern when conducting the pn a process it was reported that one stage pn a systems were mainly operated with influent cod n ratios below 0 5 g cod g n 32 through the simulation the effects of cod n ratios on pn a process in both mbbr and ifas were studied the cod concentration was set from 100 to 1000 mg l while nitrogen concentration was maintained at a constant level the corresponding cod n ratios ranged from 0 14 to 1 43 3 2 1 treatment performance fig 7 shows the impact of cod n ratio on the nitrogen and cod removal efficiency of pn a process in mbbr and ifas under identical operating condition the cod removal by mbbr and ifas was slightly increased when cod n ratio increased from 0 14 to 1 43 therefore cod n ratio was not the limiting factor in removing cod within the given range greater impact of cod n ratio on tn and ammonia removal was observed in ifas than mbbr in general both mbbr and ifas can achieve relatively high nitrogen treatment performance even at low cod n ratios when cod n ratio was lower than 0 93 the mbbr showed better nitrogen removal performance than ifas whereas opposite results were found at higher cod n ratios when cod n ratio was over 1 15 the tn and ammonia removal by ifas still slightly decreased tn and ammonia removal efficiency was not suppressed with cod n ratios while the abundance of aao decreased indicating that influent organic carbon inhibited anammox growth this is because at high influent cod condition it is difficult for anammox bacteria as autotrophs to compete with denitrifying bacteria as heterotrophs however with the suspended biomass fraction ifas presented a better performance on nitrogen removal than mbbr at high cod n ratios conditions few studies have investigated the effects of cod n ratios on pn a process in mbbr and ifas systems however studies on other biofilm or suspended sludge systems such as sbr sequence biological reactors and mbr membrane bioreactor can provide insights on these effects the influence of varying cod n ratios 0 0 5 on single stage pn a process was investigated in a sbr system 8 the results of three phases experiments indicated that stable nitrogen removal was achieved at cod n ratio of 0 4 which is consistent with the results obtained in this study another study of pn a process in sbr reactors reported that nitrogen removal increased when the cod n ratio increased from 1 1 to 1 5 which was attributed to the increase of aao however the growth rate of aao was inhibited when the cod n ratio reached to 2 5 7 in terms of biofilm systems chen et al 33 found when cod n ratios increased from 0 5 to 0 75 an obvious reduction of the nitrogen removal efficiency from 79 to below 52 was observed one study reported that the suppressing threshold of cod n ratio for completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite canon in a mbr system was 1 7 indicating the feasibility of pn a for treating low cod n wastewater 34 additionally hubaux et al 35 studied the impact of coexistence of biofilm and flocs on performance of pn a process in granular sludge reactors and observed high nitrogen removal efficiency at cod n ratio of 1 33 according to simulation results the production of no3 ˉ n decrease with cod n ratios in both mbbr and ifas indicating that the activity of aob and nob was limited miao et al 36 also found the effluent nitrate immediately decreased when the influent c n ratio was higher than 1 5 in a pn a system in this study a higher no3 ˉ n concentration was observed in ifas than mbbr under low cod n ratios 0 93 this was consistent with the above results that mbbr achieved a better nitrogen removal efficiency under low cod n ratios since low nitrate concentration could be an indicator of successful pn a process however an opposite trend was observed regarding the no2 ˉ n concentration in the ifas and mbbr the increasing cod n ratio resulted in lower concentration of no2 ˉ n in ifas whereas no2 ˉ n in the mbbr increased in addition the no2 ˉ n concentration was the highest in the top layer followed by that in the middle and bottom layers in both mbbr and ifas which indicated that partial nitrification took place on the surface of the biofilm the lower concentration of nh4 n in the mbbr also indicated that it had a better treatment performance than ifas under low cod n conditions 3 2 2 the effects of cod n on biomass from fig 8 the concentration of oho increased with cod n ratios whereas concentrations of aob nob and aao exhibited an opposite trend the concentration of aob in the middle layer of mbbr and ifas decreased with the increase of cod n similar trends of nob and aao concentration were also observed when the cod n ratio increases over a certain level in ifas the nitrogen removal decreases because the activity of autotrophic bacteria aob nob and aao is suppressed by organic carbon 31 32 several studies also demonstrated decreasing anammox and aob activities associated with high cod n ratios 31 the increasing oho concentration in both ifas and mbbr indicated the suppression of aao by oho under high cod n conditions overall this demonstrated that cod n ratio has significant effects on the pn a process and it is suggested to keep it within the optimal range to achieve high nitrogen removal 4 conclusions in order to achieve a stable pn a process in mbbr and ifas sufficient aeration is needed to provide dissolved oxygen for partial nitrification whereas excess aeration will in turn negatively affect the anammox process ifas can achieve higher nitrogen removal with lower air flow rate than mbbr partial nitrification occurs predominantly throughout the biofilm in mbbr whereas in ifas it is restricted to the suspended activated sludge pn a process in mbbr and ifas can remove nitrogen at relatively low cod n ratios compared to traditional process simulation results by sumo are consistent with experimental results obtained from previous research acknowledgements the authors would like to express their gratitude

14343,the partial nitrification anammox pn a process can remove nitrogen from wastewater by converting approximately half of the ammonium to nitrite by ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob followed by converting the remaining ammonium and nitrite to n2 by anammox bacteria both the mbbr and ifas processes can achieve the pn a process in a single stage reactor under appropriate operation in this study steady state simulation using sumo was conducted to investigate the effects of key parameters do and cod n ratio on the pn a process in both mbbr and ifas results showed that mbbr and ifas achieved about 90 total nitrogen removal by pn a process with energy efficient aeration and low cod n ratios when treating domestic wastewater ifas achieved optimal nitrogen removal with lower do concentration whereas mbbr showed better nitrogen removal at low cod n ratio biomass concentration and process rates indicated that partial nitrification occurred throughout the biofilm of mbbr but

nitritation anammox pn a has been demonstrated to be promising for better nutrient removal with minimum operating cost for wastewater treatment plants wwtps 1 the pn a process consists of partial ammonia nitrification and the anaerobic oxidation of ammonia with nitrite anammox these two steps are mainly performed by two groups of organisms ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anaerobic ammonium oxidizers aao in aerobic and anoxic environment respectively 2 compared to traditional nitrification denitrification pn a process generally reduces up to 60 of aeration consumption and up to 100 of organic carbon demand providing demonstrated long term operational cost savings for wwtps 3 other benefits of the pn a process include decreased sludge production and greenhouse gases n2o and co2 emissions which constitute a major cost and environmental concern for wwtps 4 5 when the pn a process was first implemented it was achieved separately in two different reactors e g sharon type reactors for better control of operating conditions 6 recently research and practice focus have shifted to single stage reactor setting 7 8 it was reported that a single stage reactor can achieve the pn a process under appropriate aeration 9 since the multi layers structure of biofilms can provide different redox environment for aob and aao growth currently single reactors mainly include the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr and the integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas which are increasingly implemented for nitrogen removal enhancement especially for pn a process 10 11 mbbr consists of an aeration tank with carriers for biofilm growth combining the advantages of both activated sludge process and biofilm reactors 12 in a mbbr aob which perform partial nitrification exist on the exterior of the biofilm whereas aao stay deeper in the biofilm to conduct anammox ifas is a hybrid process relying on both biofilm and suspended activated sludge in which aob preferentially grow in activated sludge and aao are prone to grow in the biofilm 13 14 mbbr and ifas are efficient alternatives for organic carbon and nitrogen removal combining the advantages of both activated sludge process and a biofilm reactor two main challenges face the successful implementation of the pn a process these include the suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in the partial nitritation process and the promotion of aob and aao retention in the anammox process 1 5 when it comes to mbbr and ifas the dissolved oxygen do and carbon to nitrogen cod n ratio have been identified as key factors to control biomass aob nob and aao concentration and achieve effective pn a process malovanyy et al 15 studied the effect of cod n ratio on ifas and mbbr for nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater by pn a process they reported that soluble cod scod nh4 n ratio decreased from 1 8 to 1 3 nitrogen removal efficiency of ifas decreased by 30 while still maintaining 150 higher removal rate than that of mbbr additionally aob nob activity in the ifas remained relatively stable during whole operation period in another study by yang et al 11 high nitrogen removal efficiency 82 was achieved at cod n ratio of 1 3 in the ifas system and they found that residual ammonium can significantly influence the stability of pn a these investigations demonstrated that cod n ratio is a key factor in achieving long term stability operation of pn a process reduced consumption and lower organic carbon demand by pn a can reduce costs in wastewater treatment 4 aeration control is another operational difficulty for pn a process on the one hand partial nitrification is achieved by favouring the growth of aob over nob which is affected by do concentration 16 on the other hand the aeration should allow for simultaneous partial nitritation and anammox it could be concluded that shortcut nitrogen removal by mbbr and ifas could meet target removal efficiency however the effect of cod n ratio and aeration control were revealed as the main operational difficulties pilot investigations for process optimization are expensive and limited for mechanism exploration modeling provides a useful tool for researchers and engineers to design analyze and optimize the wastewater treatment processes reactors with biofilm and suspended activated sludge can be simulated using common plant simulators however mass transfer between liquid phase and biofilm attachment and detachment of biofilm and biokinetics make the simulation complex to calibrate and achieve 17 an original calibration protocol was proposed to predict the mass variation and biomass concentration of biofilm and suspended activated sludge 17 however few simulations studied the biokinetic differences between biofilm and suspended activated sludge because most of commercial simulators do not allow assigning different biokinetic parameter values to suspended activated sludge and biofilm this further limits the accurate simulation of reactors with both biofilm and suspended activated sludge such as the ifas system a new approach implemented in sumo dynamita france makes it possible to separately set the monod switching terms 18 in addition carriers are also allowed to move between the bioreactor system in this model 18 therefore sumo provides a potential to compare the pn a process in ifas and mbbr system by mathematical simulation in this study the pn a process in mbbr and ifas is simulated for the first time using sumo in order to review and further investigate the operating conditions and their influence on the process performance the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the operating considerations of pn a in ifas and mbbr systems by mathematical simulation 2 compare the pn a performance in ifas and mbbr such a simulation could provide a new approach to study pn a process in ifas and mbbr systems the results of this study are expected to inform process designers and plant operators regarding mbbr and ifas treatment process design and operation optimization 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbbr and ifas model set up the biotechnology for nitrogen removal by mbbr and ifas through the pn a process was simulated using the process model simulator sumo by dynamita nyons france the road map of simulation is shown in fig 1 which includes three main steps 1 identifying the model scope and aligning it with the study objectives 2 setting up a representative treatment process layout in sumo and collecting data necessary for running the planned simulations and 3 model running and results analysis ifas and mbbr were developed as the key element in each flowsheet fig 2 shows the configuration of mbbr and ifas systems for pn a process simulation both systems consist of a primary treatment unit a bioreactor unit and a clarifier unit air flow rates and cod n ratios were set as the variables to investigate their effects on the performance of pn a process the simulations were run 17 times and 19 times for the air flow rates and cod n ratio respectively results analysis focused on the impact of the two investigated variables on the treatment performance and biomass composition in mbbr and ifas to compare the pn a process in the mbbr and ifas the kinetics of aob nob and aao were set as the default values built in sumo which is developed for two step nitrification denitrification process in the sumo model the default maximum specific growth rates of aob nob and aao are 0 85 d 1 0 65 d 1 and 0 1 d 1 respectively and the default oxygen half saturation of aob nob and aao were 0 5 g o2 m3 0 5 g o2 m3 and 0 4 g o2 m3 respectively the effect of temperature was taken into account in the model through the arrhenius law the biofilm was defined by its mean thickness 30 μm and was separated into three completely mixed layers in addition a mass transfer boundary layer was considered with a boundary layer thickness of 3 μm the biofilm model used in the simulation is the basic mbbr and ifas module in sumo a biofilm reactor model usually consists of 1 process kinetic and stoichiometric model 2 biofilm model and 3 bulk liquid hydrodynamic model 19 in terms of biological nitrogen transformation a conceptual model was used as shown in fig 3 the model consists of the following transformations a hydrolysis of particulate organic nitrogen pon to dissolved organic nitrogen don b ammonification of don to ammonia c nitratation of ammonia to nitrite by ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob d nitrification of nitrite by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob e denitrification of nitrate to nitrogen gas f anammox of nitrite and ammonia to nitrogen gas by autotrophic anammox bacteria aao g nitrogen utilization for biosynthesis and h decay of bacterial biomass to organic nitrogen compounds fig 3 in addition sumo allows biofilm carriers to transfer between bioreactors therefore it was assumed that there would be no loss of the biofilm carrier another modification in sumo is that the half saturation values in suspended phase and biofilm phase can be set separately 2 2 data source characteristics of influent wastewater were selected based on domestic wastewater 20 a selected set of fractionation information are shown in table 1 which are default value in the sumo model the values of operating parameters used for the model were obtained from recent literatures on pn a process using mbbr and ifas reactors table 2 according to previous research on pn a process the hydraulic retention time hrt for ifas and mbbr ranged from 7 to 24 h and 13 8 98 4 h respectively in this research 24 h was set as the hrt and similarly 30 days as the solids retention time srt to meet the requirements of both mbbr and ifas the default sumo kinetic and stoichiometric parameters were used in the simulation key parameters are shown in table 3 2 3 simulation and analysis after the configuration of mbbr and ifas model different steady state simulations were developed to estimate the impacts of varying operating conditions including do concentration and cod n ratio on pn a process performance in both mbbr and ifas other operating parameters remained as default values output data was analyzed from three different aspects treatment performance nitrogen and cod removal biomass concentration and biological process rates the biomass includes ordinary heterotrophic organism oho aob nob and aao simulation results were compared to literature results to provide recommendations on the operating considerations of pn a in mbbr and ifas systems 3 results and discussion pn a was successfully developed in the modeled mbbr and ifas treatment systems both mbbr and ifas showed different properties at varying do concentrations and cod n ratios within a certain range of do and cod n ratio both mbbr and ifas can achieve high nitrogen removal efficiencies in the following sections biomass concentration and process rates were analyzed to further understand the pn a process in mbbr and ifas systems 3 1 effect of do on pn a in the mbbr and ifas the do concentration in the mbbr and ifas is determined by air flow rate for the pn a process it is crucial to control air flow rate not only to inhibit nob growth caused by high do concentration but also in order to oxidize about a half of the existing ammonia into nitrite 21 steady state simulation was used to assess the impact of a range of air flow rates 4000 19 000 m3 h on the performance of the pn a process in mbbr and ifas 3 1 1 treatment performance treatment performance of cod and nitrogen was analyzed under different air flow rates it could be observed from fig 4 that the effluent cod in mbbr and ifas was below 50 mg l at steady stage resulting in a high cod removal efficiency 90 no significant effect of air flow rate on cod removal was observed in both mbbr and ifas the low air flow rate did not deteriorate the treatment of cod even when the corresponding do decreased to 0 4 mg l similar results were reported by previous research on mbbr and ifas canziani et al 16 investigated the effect of do concentration on mbbr treating landfill leachate and found when do concentration was as low as 0 2 0 5 mg l mbbr can still achieve relatively high cod removal efficiency in terms of ifas malovanyy et al 15 studied mainstream wastewater treatment in ifas by pn a process the effluent cod was relatively stable at different do set points 0 7 1 5 mg l it could be concluded that low do concentration may not be the limiting factor for cod removal in mbbr and ifas treating domestic wastewater however the nitrogen removal was significantly affected by air flow rate at low air flow rates both mbbr and ifas showed low nitrogen removal performance for mbbr peak nh4 n removal 99 9 and tn removal 88 9 occurred at the air flow rate of 18 000 m3 h and it started to decrease when air flow rate kept increasing therefore an air flow rate of 18 000 m3 h do 1 21 mg l seems to be optimal for mbbr to remove ammonia and total nitrogen this do value was consistent with results observed in previous research on mbbr via pn a process 9 15 22 in a single stage deammonification mbbr anammox activity was promoted when do set point ranged from 1 0 1 3 mg l 22 in addition malovanyy et al 15 reported that the operation of mbbr at low do concentration 1 1 1 7 mg l benefited the pn a process even at low temperature condition do was set at 1 1 1 7 mg l in order to stimulate the aob activity while inhibit nob growth simultaneously 9 previous research also reported that the do concentration was about 2 mg l to successfully establish simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd process in mbbr 23 this demonstrated that the nitrogen removal by pn a process in mbbr requires a lower do concentration resulting in lower energy consumption compared to mbbr ifas can achieve a higher nitrogen removal at lower air flow rates when air flow rate was 16 000 m3 h the tn and ammonia removal peaked to 91 7 and 99 9 respectively different from mbbr the activated sludge from the sludge recirculation is additionally used in ifas which means carrier fixed biofilms and activated sludge are combined in the same reaction tank volume the extra suspended sludge in the ifas can play a significant role in removing more nitrogen at lower air flow rates ifas was reported to operate under a low do concentration of 0 3 0 5 mg l and can still achieve an average nitrogen removal efficiency of 85 24 indicating low aeration requirements in another research ifas was used to treat real sewage and it was found that all the chambers were aerated to provide microaerobic conditions under which the do concentrations ranged from 0 15 to 0 36 mg l 11 this demonstrated a lower aeration requirement by ifas compared to mbbr through simulation the carbon and nitrogen conversion at different biofilm layers can be studied which is hard to investigate by experiments in the model built in sumo the biofilm in mbbr and ifas was set into three layers top middle and bottom layer each considered as perfectly mixed reactors three biofilm layers provide different redox environments including anaerobic anoxic and anaerobic condition which dictate the dominant biological and chemical processes 25 26 this provides the potential for two steps of pn a

oxygen for partial nitrification whereas excess aeration will in turn negatively affect the anammox process additionally it was calculated that the reduction of nh4 n was higher than the total production of no2 ˉ n and no3 ˉ n which could be an evidence that anammox occurred in the mbbr and ifas data not shown 3 1 2 the effect of air flow rate on biomass two main processes are included in

ratio due to a shortage of carbon sources for denitrification 30 the presence of organic matter either high cod concentrations or high cod n ratio was reported to affect the pn a process adversely 31 compared to conventional nitrification denitrification and snd pn a process presents a lower carbon consumption therefore the influent cod n ratio becomes a concern when conducting the pn a process it was reported that one stage pn a systems were mainly operated with influent cod n ratios below 0 5 g cod g n 32 through the simulation the effects of cod n ratios on pn a process in both mbbr and ifas were studied the cod concentration was set from 100 to 1000 mg l while nitrogen concentration was maintained at a constant level the corresponding cod n ratios ranged from 0 14 to 1 43 3 2 1 treatment performance fig 7 shows the impact of cod n ratio on the nitrogen and cod removal efficiency of pn a process in mbbr and ifas under identical operating condition the cod removal by mbbr and ifas was slightly increased when cod n ratio increased from 0 14 to 1 43 therefore cod n ratio was not the limiting factor in removing cod within the given range greater impact of cod n ratio on tn and ammonia removal was observed in ifas than mbbr in general both mbbr and ifas can achieve relatively high nitrogen treatment performance even at low cod n ratios when cod n ratio was lower than 0 93 the mbbr showed better nitrogen removal performance than ifas whereas opposite results were found at higher cod n ratios when cod n ratio was over 1 15 the tn and ammonia removal by ifas still slightly decreased tn and ammonia removal efficiency was not suppressed with cod n ratios while the abundance of aao decreased indicating that influent organic carbon inhibited anammox growth this is because at high influent cod condition it is difficult for anammox bacteria as autotrophs to compete with denitrifying bacteria as heterotrophs however with the suspended biomass fraction ifas presented a better performance on nitrogen removal than mbbr at high cod n ratios conditions few studies have investigated the effects of cod n ratios on pn a process in mbbr and ifas systems however studies on other biofilm or suspended sludge systems such as sbr sequence biological reactors and mbr membrane bioreactor can provide insights on these effects the influence of varying cod n ratios 0 0 5 on single stage pn a process was investigated in a sbr system 8 the results of three phases experiments indicated that stable nitrogen removal was achieved at cod n ratio of 0 4 which is consistent with the results obtained in this study another study of pn a process in sbr reactors reported that nitrogen removal increased when the cod n ratio increased from 1 1 to 1 5 which was attributed to the increase of aao however the growth rate of aao was inhibited when the cod n ratio reached to 2 5 7 in terms of biofilm systems chen et al 33 found when cod n ratios increased from 0 5 to 0 75 an obvious reduction of the nitrogen removal efficiency from 79 to below 52 was observed one study reported that the suppressing threshold of cod n ratio for completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite canon in a mbr system was 1 7 indicating the feasibility of pn a for treating low cod n wastewater 34 additionally hubaux et al 35 studied the impact of coexistence of biofilm and flocs on performance of pn a process in granular sludge reactors and observed high nitrogen removal efficiency at cod n ratio of 1 33 according to simulation results the production of no3 ˉ n decrease with cod n ratios in both mbbr and ifas indicating that the activity of aob and nob was limited miao et al 36 also found the effluent nitrate immediately decreased when the influent c n ratio was higher than 1 5 in a pn a system in this study a higher no3 ˉ n concentration was observed in ifas than mbbr under low cod n ratios 0 93 this was consistent with the above results that mbbr achieved a better nitrogen removal efficiency under low cod n ratios since low nitrate concentration could be an indicator of successful pn a process however an opposite trend was observed regarding the no2 ˉ n concentration in the ifas and mbbr the increasing cod n ratio resulted in lower concentration of no2 ˉ n in ifas whereas no2 ˉ n in the mbbr increased in addition the no2 ˉ n concentration was the highest in the top layer followed by that in the middle and bottom layers in both mbbr and ifas which indicated that partial nitrification took place on the surface of the biofilm the lower concentration of nh4 n in the mbbr also indicated that it had a better treatment performance than ifas under low cod n conditions 3 2 2 the effects of cod n on biomass from fig 8 the concentration of oho increased with cod n ratios whereas concentrations of aob nob and aao exhibited an opposite trend the concentration of aob in the middle layer of mbbr and ifas decreased with the increase of cod n similar trends of nob and aao concentration were also observed when the cod n ratio increases over a certain level in ifas the nitrogen removal decreases because the activity of autotrophic bacteria aob nob and aao is suppressed by organic carbon 31 32 several studies also demonstrated decreasing anammox and aob activities associated with high cod n ratios 31 the increasing oho concentration in both ifas and mbbr indicated the suppression of aao by oho under high cod n conditions overall this demonstrated that cod n ratio has significant effects on the pn a process and it is suggested to keep it within the optimal range to achieve high nitrogen removal 4 conclusions in order to achieve a stable pn a process in mbbr and ifas sufficient aeration is needed to provide dissolved oxygen for partial nitrification whereas excess aeration will in turn negatively affect the anammox process ifas can achieve higher nitrogen removal with lower air flow rate than mbbr partial nitrification occurs predominantly throughout the biofilm in mbbr whereas in ifas it is restricted to the suspended activated sludge pn a process in mbbr and ifas can remove nitrogen at relatively low cod n ratios compared to traditional process simulation results by sumo are consistent with experimental results obtained from previous research acknowledgements the authors would like to express their gratitude

14344,fruit and vegetable wastes fvw generated in a wholesale market and mixed sewage sludge mss from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp are heterogeneous residues that may suffer important seasonal changes we study the influence of those possible changes on the co digestion of both residues all the experiments were conducted under mesophilic conditions for samples corresponding to four different seasons with a total feeding volume of 0 250 l d 1 and a constant hydraulic retention time 20 d with six different fvw mss percentage volumetric relations pvr 0 100 20 80 40 60 60 40 80 20 and 100 0 the biogas and methane production rates increased with the volumetric percentage of fvw in the feed for instance as the pvr changed from 0 100 to 100 0 the increase of the biogas production was 10 fold in the summer season and 4 fold for the winter season regarding the biogas and methane specific production rates slight improvements can be observed with respect to the use of mss alone but remains almost constant for the pvrs between 40 60 and 100 0 this indicates that the main reason for the biogas production improvement is the larger concentration of vs in the fvw the digester remained under stable conditions even for the largest organic loading rate olr studied 5 8 g l 1 d 1 regardless the variations between seasons therefore management of both residues together at the

plant keywords wastewater treatment plants anaerobic co digestion fruit and vegetable waste mixed sewage sludge seasonality 1 introduction the global generation of sewage sludge has grown annually along with the increase of the population and of the wastewater treatment plants wwtps among the most used management solutions for this sludge are landfill disposal and incineration 1 both options are expensive and not compatible with the concept of a circular economy 2 indeed the treatment and disposal of sludge can represent up to 50 of the operating costs of a wwtp 3 in addition about 3 of global electricity consumption and 5 of global greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries are related with municipal wastewater treatment 4 the sewage sludge is characterized as a liquid waste more than 95 water that contains a wide diversity of suspended or dissolved materials nutrients heavy metals pathogens and organic pollutants 1 5 therefore an adequate treatment is necessary before disposal 6 and the increase in the production of other wastes generated close to the wwtp is an opportunity to develop overall management solutions more friendly with the environment the increase of the world population together with the per capita consumption growth has come with a large increase of fruits and vegetables production reaching by 2011 almost 1728 million tons world production 7 spain is the leading fruit and vegetable exporter in the european union and one of the top exporters in the world after china and the us 8 fruit and vegetable wastes fvws are not only generated during the production but also large amounts of waste are produced during the distribution chain 9 with a total loss of more than 30 10 11 fvw undergoes a fast degradation in the presence of microorganisms that can result in serious environmental problems in the short term besides the product losses the generation of fvw increases the operation expenses 12 it was estimated that more than 80 of fvw were either dumped or transported to landfill sites and incineration plants 13 wholesale markets generate a considerable quantity of fvw that can be largely and easily collected presenting an excellent opportunity for the development of more efficient management technologies as indicated above fvw pose a high moisture content and easily biodegradable organic matter 7 9 the typical composition of this organic fraction is approximately 75 of sugars and hemicellulose easy to biodegrade and 10 of cellulose and 5 of lignin 14 15 the biodegradation of these residues after landfill deposition cause the generation of leachates and greenhouse gas emissions whereas the large moisture content can cause unstable combustion during incineration 16 similar problems are found for mss consequently fvw and mss are affronting more restrictive legislation with respect to landfill disposal of the biodegradable fraction 17 the european union has different directives concerning waste management being the most relevant the directive 2008 98 ec on integrated prevention and control of pollutants among the techniques suitable for the treatment of organic wastes we find the anaerobic digestion ad because it allows the optimization and management of methane production with a significant reduction in the release of greenhouse gas emissions and foul odours while allowing the recovery of nutrients and other materials for soil amendments 1 2 depending on the specific organic waste some drawbacks may arise 14 17 18 when dealing with highly biodegradable wastes the main problem is the generation of large amounts of vfa that may cause a rapid acidification which may hinder or finish the methanogenic activity 12 19 20 this problem could be avoided for instance lowering the organic loading rate olr but with an obvious economic disadvantage 10 the anaerobic digestion of sludge has been universally used as one of the most suitable methods for the treatment of sewage sludge the operation of wwtp digesters is usually not optimized to obtain a maximum biogas production because the main target is the sludge stabilization this stabilization may be achieved using physico chemical pretreatments 21 or more frequently using olrs lower than 1 kgvs m3 d 1 2 6 and long retention times 20 30 days 2 22 in addition sewage sludge is characterized by its low c n ratio and its high ph buffer capacity 2 18 it is not unusual that wwtp digesters are designed with larger volumes than required 2 23 an interesting option to take advantage of this extra capacity is the co digestion of mss with substrates with complementary characteristics this is the case of fvws 2 24 that are easily biodegradable and present a large concentration of organic matter with low alkalinity values 18 22 this kind of co digestion presents also an improved nutrient balance and c n ratio mitigation of inhibitory effects due to toxic substances by dilution and an improved methane production 15 25 therefore important ecological technological and economic benefits can be obtained 18 because it allows the recovery of energy and materials while sharing waste treatment facilities and thus reducing investment and exploitation costs co digestion allows to treat larger amounts of waste in large scale centralized facilities with plants that would not require expensive changes 26 27 large facilities of municipal wwtps are usually close to wholesale markets where important amounts of fvws are produced therefore the possible use of co digestion of these wastes could represent an important reduction of expenses related to the management of fvws and enhances biogas production in the wwtp 28 usually a co substrate digester is designed to work with the maximum olr that allows a good yield and quality in biogas 1 15 25 nevertheless a wwtp digester have other targets that should be met the main operating variables relevant for the stabilization efficiency should be maintained including the operating temperature large hrt and reactor stability in order to study the feasibility of such co digestion the influence of the seasonal variability of fvw and mss should be studied the optimal conditions for proper functioning of a digester may change since the variation of the composition of fvw and mss affects the olr and the stability of the process 14 in this paper we have studied the influence of this variability for the mss of the main wwtp and the fvws of the wholesale market of malaga a mediterranean city with a population of more than 500 000 inhabitants that increases sharply during the summer months due to tourism four series of experiments were run each one using wastes representing one of the four consecutive seasons in each series we have kept the hydraulic retention time hrt constant similar to the one used in the wwtp and changed the fvw mss percentage volumetric relation pvr the increase of this pvr implies an increase in olr we have studied the reactor performance in terms of biogas production and quality and stability of the digester even when an important number of studies have focused on the co digestion of different substrates to the best of our knowledge this is the first one that studies the importance of the seasonal variations of the fvw and mss over the stability and performance of the digester in addition most of the published studies present an optimization of the reactor without maintaining the hrt required at the wwtp to ensure the sludge stabilization 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates and inoculum as mentioned previously two substrates were used for this study fruit and vegetable wastes fvws and mixed sewage sludge mss both were sampled at each of the four different seasons and the nomenclature used and the colors associated in the figures are presented in table 1 in each sampling session about 25 kg of fvw were collected fresh from rejections from the fruit and vegetable wholesale market of malaga spain which produces around 10 tm of fvw daily the inventory for each season is presented in table 2 in the same morning after sampling fvw were chopped into smaller pieces grinded and shredded using a hand blender in order to reduce the particles size then stored in 350 g bags in the freezer at 20 c until use freezing could be considered a pretreatment that may increase the biodegradability of the samples 29 but it is also the most used way to allow the reproducibility of the samples the inoculum and the mss were obtained from the same wwtp this wwtp treats a mean daily volume of 165 000 m3 of waste water with almost no industrial origin the basic operation is as follows after grit removal the primary sludge is separated by 10 rectangular settlers the aqueous stream goes to a group of 5 activated sludge digesters with about 4 h of hrt the activated sludge is separated downstream by a group of 10 rectangular secondary settlers a large fraction of this sludge is recirculated to the activated sludge reactor the remainder is mixed with a similar flow coming from the primary settler 1 1 3 in terms of ts to obtain what is known as mixed sewage sludge mss that is fed to the anaerobic digester mss was collected the next day of the sampling at the wholesale market immediately after collection mss was homogenized bottled in plastic vials of 170 ml and stored at 20 c until use looking for the reproducibility of the properties of the two wastes the same procedure was carried out every day the day before the feed the necessary number of vials were moved to the fridge the mixture was prepared only some minutes before the feed the mixtures and the two residues present a density quite similar to that of water so the properties of the mixtures are easy to obtain from the properties of each residue and are presented as table 3 of the supplementary data article 30 the inoculum for the digester was obtained at the same wwtp and the same day as the mss from the effluent of the mesophilic anaerobic digester operating at 35 1 c with hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 days a new inoculum was used for the series of experiments for each season of the year the main characteristics of the inoculum fvw and mss are given in the results section tables 3 and 4 2 2 reactor design and operational conditions all experiments were carried out in a digester biostat e which has a working volume of 5 l and an additional head space of 1 4 l it was operated with a 20 day hydraulic retention time it worked as a stirred reactor with a continuous agitation of 100 rpm and under mesophilic conditions 35 c besides the digester is equipped with two electrodes for the continuous measure of the ph and redox potential values the schematic experimental device can be found elsewhere 31 and a picture can be found as fig 1 of the supplementary data article 30 for each series of experiments each season upon arrival of the inoculum to the laboratory 5 l were loaded into the lab digester to maintain a strict anaerobic condition the o2 in the digester was previously evacuated using a n2 stream for about 30 min afterwards the n2 stream was ceased and the biogas recovery system was connected temperature and agitation were set at the target values and the monitoring of ph and redox potential values was started the reactor was maintained at these conditions without any feed for 72 h before starting the experiments to ensure the anaerobic conditions and that the biogas evolution from the digester before starting up was negligible the reactor was fed following a withdrawal feed method which consists in the extraction of a volume 250 ml of sludge from the reactor and then introducing the same volume of substrate using a syringe every 24 h all relevant parameters were followed during this 24 h period for each series of experiments six fvwn mssn percentage volumetric relations pvr were tested 0 100 20 80 40 60 60 40 80 20 and 100 0 therefore an increase of the olr takes place as the fvwn mssn pvr increases each experimental condition was repeated for 10 days before moving to the next fvwn mssn pvr thus the total duration for each season series was 60 days 2 3 analytical methods total solids ts and volatile solids vs were measured according to the standard methods 32 partial and total alkalinities pa and ta were determined following the titration procedure 33 the ph end points for pa and ta titration were 5 75 and 4 30 respectively the intermediate alkalinity ia was obtained from the difference between ta and pa the statistical study of the evolution of these parameters was performed using the kendall s tau and the spearman s rho coefficients both parameters evaluate to what extent a correlation is monotonous and also indicate if the correlation would be increasing or decreasing monotone the removal of vs was estimated by the following equation 34 v s r e m o v a l v s i n l e t v s d i g e s t a t e v s i n l e t 100 the biogas production was measured by a volume displacement method and its composition was determined by gas chromatography perkin elmer autosystem with a thermal conductivity detector and a supelco column 15 ft 1 8 60 80 carboxen 1000 the oven injector and detector temperatures were 180 180 and 220 c respectively helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 ml min the elemental composition of the ts c h n s o was determined for the inoculum fvwn and mssn by a perkin elmer chnso 2400 apparatus all the analyses were triplicated 3 results and discussion 3 1 feedstock and sewage sludge characteristics as pointed out before each seasonal series used a new inoculum the composition is given in table 3 as can be seen all of them had a ph value slightly above 7 and an important partial alkalinity indicating a high buffering capacity this is important to prevent the negative effect of low ph values that can be produced by the accumulation of vfa which commonly occurs during the anaerobic digestion of fvw it can also be observed that there are no significant differences throughout the different seasons of the year except perhaps for the s2 inoculum that presents a c n ratio relatively lower than the other three also the inoculum of the s4 series presents values of ts and vs lower than the other samples the waste composition is very important for the performance of the anaerobic degradation of any waste and this composition may present seasonal variations that could affect the biodegradability and the biogas and methane production rates a preliminary observation of the wastes produced at the wholesale market of malaga indicate that the presence of fruits is quite variable fruit rejections represent about 1 3 of the fvw in s3 and s4 about 1 2 for s1 and 2 3 for s2 the main properties of each residue are presented in table 4 together with the mean value for the inoculum the tables provided in the supplementary data article 30 give more details of the characterization of the inoculum and residues as can be seen the ph values of the mssn are close to neutrality and very similar to each other on the other hand the ph values of the fvwn are acidic regardless of the types of fruits and vegetables waste and vary from 3 5 to 4 8 the values of the c n ratio are very similar in all fvwn with an average of 24 while the values for the four mss samples are also similar and about 7 generally a c n ratio between 20 and 30 would be considered as the optimum condition for ad 35 also the values of ts and vs for the two wastes are quite different with a higher content for fvwn than for mssn all fvwn have approximately the same ts and vs content although the s3 series has slightly higher values vs represent about 94 of the ts indicating a high potential of organic transformation of fvwn during the anaerobic processes regarding the ts and vs for mssn it can be seen that the values are also similar except for mss3 that presents a higher value with respect to the total and partial alkalinity values since the fvwn have acid ph values only the ta for fvw4 could be obtained it can be observed that the mssn have lower ta and pa values than the inoculum in summary mssn and fvwn have significantly different characteristics while the seasonal variations are moderate therefore as long as the flow rate fed to the digester remains constant as the fvw mss pvr increases in the mixture the vs increases too and that yields also an increase in the olr 3 2 process performance the target of this research is to study the performance of a digester working with two wastes fvw and mss produced in large quantities throughout the year the seasonal variations in the composition are likely to be relevant so we study the evolution of the main parameters of interest for the anaerobic co digestion for the different seasons of the year the study was carried out working with the same hydraulic retention time same volumetric flow at different fvw mss pvrs and therefore with different olr values which is one of the most important variables for ad fig 1 shows the variation of the olr of the different fvwn mssn pvrs explored as can be seen for s3 the values of the olr fed are larger than for the other three series in agreement with the larger vs content of the fvw3 and mss3 it is also clear that a very important increase of the olr takes place as the fvw mss pvr increases for all the seasons being the final olr 100 fvw with respect to the initial 100 mss 330 for s3 and 860 for s1 of course this increase in the olr should be reflected in the biogas and methane production rates the mean value of the fraction of the carbon fed to the digester that is recovered as biogas is presented as fig 6 of the supplementary data article 30 it can be seen that this value is almost 50 when only mss is fed the trend of the four seasons is quite similar as the relative amount of fvw increases the carbon recovered as biogas increases up to values between 65 and 85 that are reached for a fvw mss pvr of 40 60 and remains close to those values for the larger amounts of fvw fed figs 2 and 3 show the biogas and methane production rates volume of biogas and methane produced each day per unit volume of sludge in the reactor for the different fvwn mssn series while the error bars represent two standard deviations of the 10 experiments 10 consecutive days the results obtained for each of the 60 consecutive days for each series are also shown as figs 2 and 3 in the supplementary data article 30 the results indicate that the digester is capable of treating all fvwn mssn pvrs of all seasons of the year using the same operational conditions it is also clear that there is an improvement in the biogas and methane production rates when compared to the mono digestion of mssn as can be seen for each season there is a linear relationship between the biogas and methane production rates and the fvwn mssn pvr fed into the digester the small size of the error bars reflects the stability of the digester the most important difference between seasons is observed for s3 corresponding to the winter samples this was also observed for the vs content table 4 with higher values for both residues for this season these higher values are relatively more important for the mss3 and it is probably due to a poorer performance of the activated sludge reactors that are working at lower temperature with approximately the same residence time also the primary sludge is likely to present larger vs concentration in winter altogether these results indicate that there is a close relationship between the vs and the biogas production and quality nevertheless there are also some changes in the system behavior related with the seasonal variations that can t be directly predicted from this variable although the stability will be discussed in more detail later it can be observed that the digester remains with acceptable stability even for the largest pvr of fvwn mssn 100 0 ganesh et al 36 reported that the maximum olr that can be fed for fvw for similar conditions was about 3 6 gvs l 1d 1 in this study the values of the olr for some of the experimental conditions are higher up to a maximum of 5 8 gvs l 1d 1 for fvw3 mss3 100 0 the review of bouallagui et al 14 indicates that the maximum olr for this type of residues is between 1 gvs l 1d 1 and 6 8 gvs l 1d 1 so our value falls within that region the stability at such a high olrs is probably related to the fact that even when only fvw is fed the waste is still a wide mixture of fruits and vegetables that show some kind of synergistic behavior 12 37 another of the most important parameters for comparing the anaerobic digestion of different wastes under the same experimental conditions is the specific methane production smp fig 4 shows the smp for all the 240 days essayed the solid line represents the mean value 0 363 l gvs 1 of these 240 results additional information is provided in table 5 and in fig 4 of the supplementary data article 30 the results are consistent with the values presented in the literature under mesophilic conditions 7 12 17 36 as can be seen all the experiments performed without fvw fall below the mean value line in addition those experiments for the same season performed with at least 40 fvwn present small changes this is not surprising since for all these experiments the vs of each season are quite similar in their composition since most of them are from the same fvw origin for instance for those experiments performed with 40 fvw between 69 and 85 of the olr is coming from the fvw depending on the season therefore even when the total olr increases significantly as the percentage of fvw increases the composition of the vs is almost constant this is consistent with the trend observed for the carbon recovered as biogas mentioned previously thus it may be concluded that fvw does not only provide a larger vs concentration but also this substrate allows the achievement of a higher smp this effect is probably related to the high concentration of simple carbohydrates in fruits and vegetables which are readily degradable 23 in addition the aerobic degradation yields not only a decrease in the vs concentration but also the vs that remains is less profitable for the anaerobic microorganisms some seasonal differences in the smp can be observed the mean value for the 60 days for each season is s1 0 333 l gvs 1 s2 0 390 l gvs 1 s3 0 383 l gvs 1 and s4 0 346 l gvs 1 thus some more smp is obtained for the cooler seasons fall and winter with respect to the mssn we have already pointed out that the activated sludge reactors are probably more efficient during the warmer seasons and this would yield not only a lower vs concentration in the mss but also the composition of these vs would be less profitable for the anaerobic consortium of microorganisms during these seasons to some extent this also occurs with the primary sludge regarding the fvwn one possible explanation would be that the demand of fruits and vegetables during the warm seasons is not as energy rich as during the cooler seasons when more calories are demanded in our diets in any case one should be aware that also for this parameter appreciable differences can be expected from the seasonal variations of the feed results for the 240 experimental days for the methane concentration in the biogas are presented in fig 5 the average methane concentration values as a function of the presence of fvw in the sludge for each season can also be found as fig 5 of supplementary data article 30 this parameter is one of the most important indicators of the biogas quality as can be seen almost all the results fall between 50 and 67 in agreement with those observed in the literature 10 20 23 once again seasonal variations can be observed but this time these are not observed for the experiments performed only with mss for which the methane concentration is very stable at values close to 65 for the four seasons this is so even when important seasonal variations are observed between the different mssn for the biogas and the methane productions instead as the amount of fvw in the feed increases the seasonal influence gets more evident and the largest differences are observed between the summer s1 and the fall s2 seasons in the first case the ch4 concentration decreases from about 65 to 50 as the fvw1 increases to 40 of the waste volume fed and then remains approximately constant at 50 as the fraction of fvw1 increases to 100 in the second case the concentration remains almost constant no matter the fraction of fvw2 fed to the digester the efficiency in the removal of volatile solids from the residues is another relevant parameter for the performance of the process the results for the 240 days are presented on fig 6 as can be seen the general trend is similar for the 4 series but once again relevant seasonal variations are observed as could be expected the vs fed as fvw are more easily biodegradable and therefore the removal efficiency is more important as the fvw mss pvr increases for almost all the experiments performed with at least 40 of the volume feed coming from the fvw the vs removal is between 70 and 87 on the other hand for those experiments performed with only mss the vs removal is approximately between 25 and 55 indicating that this substrate is not easily biodegradable 14 thus the main seasonal differences are seen for the mssn and among them the most important are between s1 summer 25 and s3 winter 55 this is in agreement with the previous observations while discussing fig 4 where we indicated that probably the aerobic reactors are obtaining a very good biodegradation efficiency during the warmer seasons while this efficiency is not as good during the winter the differences found between seasons when working only with a feedstock of fvw are relatively much smaller it can be observed that the best removals are observed for s1 and s2 summer and fall while the lower removals are seen for winter s3 and spring s4 explanation for these results is more difficult but are probably related with the fraction of materials difficult to biodegrade such as lignin present in the fvws which may present some important seasonal variations with respect to the results obtained for the co digestion of both substrates we find important changes of the seasonal behaviour for the lower fvw pvr for instance we find that for fvwn mssn of 20 80 and 40 60 summer s1 results are among those with best removal efficiencies while for the same season the results for mss were presenting the minimum removal this is not unexpected since for the summer results the fraction of vs fed that has fvw origin is higher precisely because the vs concentration of mss1 is very low thus for fvwn mssn pvr of 20 80 the fraction of vs from fvw origin is 68 3 while the mean value for the four seasons is 58 3 therefore even when the vs removal for mss1 is quite low the results for this parameter for the same season are among the best for a feed fvw1 mss1 with a pvr as low as 20 80 3 3 process stability the ph value of the digester is a very important variable since the microbial population responsible of anaerobic digestion is sensitive to this variable and the optimal value is around neutrality therefore an adequate ph value is essential for the stability of the digester and should be monitored during the anaerobic process the ph values at the end of the 24 h period of all the 240 experimental days fall between 6 9 and 7 3 thus the ph remain at values very close to neutrality for all the experiments regardless of the season or of the fvwn mssn pvr used most of the values are in the region of 7 0 7 1 so it is difficult to find any tendency nor obtain any meaningful plot only a very slight tendency can be observed which may indicate that as the presence of fvw in the feed increases the ph value at the end of the experiment is slightly more acidic nevertheless these variations within each series are below two decimal points of the ph value except for the s3 winter series for which the variations between the first values of the series and those obtained at the end change from 7 3 to 6 9 this is probably related with the ph value of the fvwn which is between 4 79 and 3 50 with the lower value obtained for fvw3 in any case if the stability of the digester is to be evaluated based only on the ph variations at the end of each 24 h period during the 240 experimental days it should be concluded that the system remains very stable and within the optimum range described in the literature for methanogenic bacteria 38 39 nevertheless it is also well known that there are different ph buffering processes that as long as remain active may hide the possible instabilities but on the long term on the depletion of the buffering capacity serious problems to the digester performance may arise some other parameters are discussed below that may act as an early warning for these depletion of these ph buffers the most used are the total ta partial pa and intermediate ia alkalinities that were defined in the analytical methods section of this paper the values for the first two parameters for the samples obtained from the digester at the end of each 24 h period are presented in fig 7 the first conclusion that can be obtained from the figure is that also these parameters remain quite stable except again for the s3 winter series for the other three series the total alkalinity remains relatively close to 4 g l 1 while the partial alkalinity remains between 2 and 3 g l 1 since the intermediate alkalinity is obtained as the difference between the total and partial alkalinity this value also remains constant at about 1 5 g l 1 for all the series except for s3 we have pointed out that the value of the partial alkalinity may be associated with the concentration of substances with ph buffering properties able to hold the ph values close to neutrality when acid substances are released thus more important than the actual concentration is the evolution of the parameters as the digester remains at a certain working condition it could be expected that as the fraction of fvw increases the corresponding increase of olr and of the biodegradability of the substrate may produce an increase of the volatile fatty acids and a decrease of the values of the partial alkalinity this would be indicating that the buffer capacity active at ph values close to neutrality is being depleted in other words the depletion of the partial alkalinity would be indicating that the ph value for the thriving conditions for the methanogenic bacteria is under risk therefore the evolution of this parameter along time is what is really acting as early warning some other parameters are used as early warning tools 33 40 for instance the ratios of intermediate to partial alkalinity ia pa or intermediate to total alkalinity are among the most recommended since their evolution is considered more sensitive to the depletion of the buffering capacity in the region of optimum ph values for anaerobic digestion of course the stability of the ph at values close to the neutrality require a large value of the pa and that most of the ta is corresponding to this pa i e that the ia is lower than the pa in other words the lower the value of the ia pa ratio the better for the stability of the digester therefore as early warning tools it is important that both parameters pa and ia pa remain constant with time the decrease of the pa or the increase of the ia pa values would be indicating that the digester is losing stability of course an increase in the pa or a decrease in the ia pa ratio would mean that the digester is more able to stand an increase in the generation of acids without important changes in the ph value and therefore to maintain the optimum conditions for the anaerobic digestion analogously a low value of the ia ta is indicating a good stability of the digester the values obtained for these ratios for the 240 experimental days are represented on fig 8 for the ia ta a value not higher than 0 3 0 4 has been recommended 41 and the results obtained are meeting reasonably those recommendations the experimental values of the ia are affected by the experimental errors of the pa and ta determination and this causes that our ia pa ratio presents relatively important oscillations throughout the 60 experimental results of each series nevertheless the evolution of the ia pa ratio during the 60 experimental days of each series can be evaluated statistically using the correlation coefficients known as kendall s τ or spearman s ρ both coefficients would yield a value of 1 when one variable is a perfect increasing monotone function of the other of 1 when the relation is a perfect decreasing monotone function and of 0 when the variables are perfectly independent table 6 presents the values obtained for the τ and ρ coefficients for each series for the ia pa ratio vs time as can be seen all of them yield quite small negative values thus it may be concluded that there is a very small correlation between the ia pa ratio and the experimental day of each series and therefore both coefficients are indicating that this ratio is not changing with time in other words it is not changing with the increase of the fvw concentration if any change is taking place this is in the direction of a negative correlation in summary the statistical analysis is indicating that the ia pa ratio is not changing or is decreasing as the fvw concentration increases in the feed therefore the digester remains quite stable during the four series also from the ia pa ratio point of view as pointed out previously only the winter series s3 shows a different trend with an initial increase of pa and ta during the first 20 days and then a decrease during the last 15 days once again the importance of the seasonal variability of the substrates is clear although it is difficult to try to find out the reasons for this evolution from the previous results we saw that mss3 presents a larger vs concentration and a more biodegradable organic matter with respect to other seasons so it is possible that the increase of the pa and ta alkalinities are associated with this kind of organic matter that makes the mss3 sample different with respect to the other three series in any case even when changes are observed among the different seasons the digester remains quite stable for all of them 4 conclusion the co digestion of fvw and mss is a very interesting management solution for these wastes in this manuscript all the experiments were obtained using the same hrt of 20 d a flow rate of 250 ml d and a working volume of 5 l each experimental condition was repeated for 10 d and the stability of the digester was studied following the evolution of some alkalinity parameters using the correlation coefficients known as kendall s τ or spearman s ρ the results obtained reflect that seasonality affects slightly the physical chemical characteristics of both substrates also some changes are observed in the system evolution for the different seasons studied nevertheless the co digestion of fvw and mss presents relatively similar values for the four seasons in all the cases it is observed that the larger the fvw mss pvr the larger are the biogas and methane production rates the experiments were performed at the same volumetric flow so the increase of the fvw mss pvr resulted in an increase of the olr that is the main responsible of the increase of the methane and biogas production rates nevertheless also the specific methane production increases slightly with the fvw concentration for the lower fvw mss pvrs the statistical study of the parameters used for the stability assessment indicates that the system remains stable for all the pvrs explored nevertheless before scaling up it is recommended the use of experimental times of at least two or three hrts in order to ascertain the digester stability especially for the pvrs of 80 20 and

14344,fruit and vegetable wastes fvw generated in a wholesale market and mixed sewage sludge mss from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp are heterogeneous residues that may suffer important seasonal changes we study the influence of those possible changes on the co digestion of both residues all the experiments were conducted under mesophilic conditions for samples corresponding to four different seasons with a total feeding volume of 0 250 l d 1 and a constant hydraulic retention time 20 d with six different fvw mss percentage volumetric relations pvr 0 100 20 80 40 60 60 40 80 20 and 100 0 the biogas and methane production rates increased with the volumetric percentage of fvw in the feed for instance as the pvr changed from 0 100 to 100 0 the increase of the biogas production was 10 fold in the summer season and 4 fold for the winter season regarding the biogas and methane specific production rates slight improvements can be observed with respect to the use of mss alone but remains almost constant for the pvrs between 40 60 and 100 0 this indicates that the main reason for the biogas production improvement is the larger concentration of vs in the fvw the digester remained under stable conditions even for the largest organic loading rate olr studied 5 8 g l 1 d 1 regardless the variations between seasons therefore management of both residues together at the

plant keywords wastewater treatment plants anaerobic co digestion fruit and vegetable waste mixed sewage sludge seasonality 1 introduction the global generation of sewage sludge has grown annually along with the increase of the population and of the wastewater treatment plants wwtps among the most used management solutions for this sludge are landfill disposal and incineration 1 both options are expensive and not compatible with the concept of a circular economy 2 indeed the treatment and disposal of sludge can represent up to 50 of the operating costs of a wwtp 3 in addition about 3 of global electricity consumption and 5 of global greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries are related with municipal wastewater treatment 4 the sewage sludge is characterized as a liquid waste more than 95 water that contains a wide diversity of suspended or dissolved materials nutrients heavy metals pathogens and organic pollutants 1 5 therefore an adequate treatment is necessary before disposal 6 and the increase in the production of other wastes generated close to the wwtp is an opportunity to develop overall management solutions more friendly with the environment the increase of the world population together with the per capita consumption growth has come with a large increase of fruits and vegetables production reaching by 2011 almost 1728 million tons world production 7 spain is the leading fruit and vegetable exporter in the european union and one of the top exporters in the world after china and the us 8 fruit and vegetable wastes fvws are not only generated during the production but also large amounts of waste are produced during the distribution chain 9 with a total loss of more than 30 10 11 fvw undergoes a fast degradation in the presence of microorganisms that can result in serious environmental problems in the short term besides the product losses the generation of fvw increases the operation expenses 12 it was estimated that more than 80 of fvw were either dumped or transported to landfill sites and incineration plants 13 wholesale markets generate a considerable quantity of fvw that can be largely and easily collected presenting an excellent opportunity for the development of more efficient management technologies as indicated above fvw pose a high moisture content and easily biodegradable organic matter 7 9 the typical composition of this organic fraction is approximately 75 of sugars and hemicellulose easy to biodegrade and 10 of cellulose and 5 of lignin 14 15 the biodegradation of these residues after landfill deposition cause the generation of leachates and greenhouse gas emissions whereas the large moisture content can cause unstable combustion during incineration 16 similar problems are found for mss consequently fvw and mss are affronting more restrictive legislation with respect to landfill disposal of the biodegradable fraction 17 the european union has different directives concerning waste management being the most relevant the directive 2008 98 ec on integrated prevention and control of pollutants among the techniques suitable for the treatment of organic wastes we find the anaerobic digestion ad because it allows the optimization and management of methane production with a significant reduction in the release of greenhouse gas emissions and foul odours while allowing the recovery of nutrients and other materials for soil amendments 1 2 depending on the specific organic waste some drawbacks may arise 14 17 18 when dealing with highly biodegradable wastes the main problem is the generation of large amounts of vfa that may cause a rapid acidification which may hinder or finish the methanogenic activity 12 19 20 this problem could be avoided for instance lowering the organic loading rate olr but with an obvious economic disadvantage 10 the anaerobic digestion of sludge has been universally used as one of the most suitable methods for the treatment of sewage sludge the operation of wwtp digesters is usually not optimized to obtain a maximum biogas production because the main target is the sludge stabilization this stabilization may be achieved using physico chemical pretreatments 21 or more frequently using olrs lower than 1 kgvs m3 d 1 2 6 and long retention times 20 30 days 2 22 in addition sewage sludge is characterized by its low c n ratio and its high ph buffer capacity 2 18 it is not unusual that wwtp digesters are designed with larger volumes than required 2 23 an interesting option to take advantage of this extra capacity is the co digestion of mss with substrates with complementary characteristics this is the case of fvws 2 24 that are easily biodegradable and present a large concentration of organic matter with low alkalinity values 18 22 this kind of co digestion presents also an improved nutrient balance and c n ratio mitigation of inhibitory effects due to toxic substances by dilution and an improved methane production 15 25 therefore important ecological technological and economic benefits can be obtained 18 because it allows the recovery of energy and materials while sharing waste treatment facilities and thus reducing investment and exploitation costs co digestion allows to treat larger amounts of waste in large scale centralized facilities with plants that would not require expensive changes 26 27 large facilities of municipal wwtps are usually close to wholesale markets where important amounts of fvws are produced therefore the possible use of co digestion of these wastes could represent an important reduction of expenses related to the management of fvws and enhances biogas production in the wwtp 28 usually a co substrate digester is designed to work with the maximum olr that allows a good yield and quality in biogas 1 15 25 nevertheless a wwtp digester have other targets that should be met the main operating variables relevant for the stabilization efficiency should be maintained including the operating temperature large hrt and reactor stability in order to study the feasibility of such co digestion the influence of the seasonal variability of fvw and mss should be studied the optimal conditions for proper functioning of a digester may change since the variation of the composition of fvw and mss affects the olr and the stability of the process 14 in this paper we have studied the influence of this variability for the mss of the main wwtp and the fvws of the wholesale market of malaga a mediterranean city with a population of more than 500 000 inhabitants that increases sharply during the summer months due to tourism four series of experiments were run each one using wastes representing one of the four consecutive seasons in each series we have kept the hydraulic retention time hrt constant similar to the one used in the wwtp and changed the fvw mss percentage volumetric relation pvr the increase of this pvr implies an increase in olr we have studied the reactor performance in terms of biogas production and quality and stability of the digester even when an important number of studies have focused on the co digestion of different substrates to the best of our knowledge this is the first one that studies the importance of the seasonal variations of the fvw and mss over the stability and performance of the digester in addition most of the published studies present an optimization of the reactor without maintaining the hrt required at the wwtp to ensure the sludge stabilization 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates and inoculum as mentioned previously two substrates were used for this study fruit and vegetable wastes fvws and mixed sewage sludge mss both were sampled at each of the four different seasons and the nomenclature used and the colors associated in the figures are presented in table 1 in each sampling session about 25 kg of fvw were collected fresh from rejections from the fruit and vegetable wholesale market of malaga spain which produces around 10 tm of fvw daily the inventory for each season is presented in table 2 in the same morning after sampling fvw were chopped into smaller pieces grinded and shredded using a hand blender in order to reduce the particles size then stored in 350 g bags in the freezer at 20 c until use freezing could be considered a pretreatment that may increase the biodegradability of the samples 29 but it is also the most used way to allow the reproducibility of the samples the inoculum and the mss were obtained from the same wwtp this wwtp treats a mean daily volume of 165 000 m3 of waste water with almost no industrial origin the basic operation is as follows after grit removal the primary sludge is separated by 10 rectangular settlers the aqueous stream goes to a group of 5 activated sludge digesters with about 4 h of hrt the activated sludge is separated downstream by a group of 10 rectangular secondary settlers a large fraction of this sludge is recirculated to the activated sludge reactor the remainder is mixed with a similar flow coming from the primary settler 1 1 3 in terms of ts to obtain what is known as mixed sewage sludge mss that is fed to the anaerobic digester mss was collected the next day of the sampling at the wholesale market immediately after collection mss was homogenized bottled in plastic vials of 170 ml and stored at 20 c until use looking for the reproducibility of the properties of the two wastes the same procedure was carried out every day the day before the feed the necessary number of vials were moved to the fridge the mixture was prepared only some minutes before the feed the mixtures and the two residues present a density quite similar to that of water so the properties of the mixtures are easy to obtain from the properties of each residue and are presented as table 3 of the supplementary data article 30 the inoculum for the digester was obtained at the same wwtp and the same day as the mss from the effluent of the mesophilic anaerobic digester operating at 35 1 c with hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 days a new inoculum was used for the series of experiments for each season of the year the main characteristics of the inoculum fvw and mss are given in the results section tables 3 and 4 2 2 reactor design and operational conditions all experiments were carried out in a digester biostat e which has a working volume of 5 l and an additional head space of 1 4 l it was operated with a 20 day hydraulic retention time it worked as a stirred reactor with a continuous agitation of 100 rpm and under mesophilic conditions 35 c besides the digester is equipped with two electrodes for the continuous measure of the ph and redox potential values the schematic experimental device can be found elsewhere 31 and a picture can be found as fig 1 of the supplementary data article 30 for each series of experiments each season upon arrival of the inoculum to the laboratory 5 l were loaded into the lab digester to maintain a strict anaerobic condition the o2 in the digester was previously evacuated using a n2 stream for about 30 min afterwards the n2 stream was ceased and the biogas recovery system was connected temperature and agitation were set at the target values and the monitoring of ph and redox potential values was started the reactor was maintained at these conditions without any feed for 72 h before starting the experiments to ensure the anaerobic conditions and that the biogas evolution from the digester before starting up was negligible the reactor was fed following a withdrawal feed method which consists in the extraction of a volume 250 ml of sludge from the reactor and then introducing the same volume of substrate using a syringe every 24 h all relevant parameters were followed during this 24 h period for each series of experiments six fvwn mssn percentage volumetric relations pvr were tested 0 100 20 80 40 60 60 40 80 20 and 100 0 therefore an increase of the olr takes place as the fvwn mssn pvr increases each experimental condition was repeated for 10 days before moving to the next fvwn mssn pvr thus the total duration for each season series was 60 days 2 3 analytical methods total solids ts and volatile solids vs were measured according to the standard methods 32 partial and total alkalinities pa and ta were determined following the titration procedure 33 the ph end points for pa and ta titration were 5 75 and 4 30 respectively the intermediate alkalinity ia was obtained from the difference between ta and pa the statistical study of the evolution of these parameters was performed using the kendall s tau and the spearman s rho coefficients both parameters evaluate to what extent a correlation is monotonous and also indicate if the correlation would be increasing or decreasing monotone the removal of vs was estimated by the following equation 34 v s r e m o v a l v s i n l e t v s d i g e s t a t e v s i n l e t 100 the biogas production was measured by a volume displacement method and its composition was determined by gas chromatography perkin elmer autosystem with a thermal conductivity detector and a supelco column 15 ft 1 8 60 80 carboxen 1000 the oven injector and detector temperatures were 180 180 and 220 c respectively helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 ml min the elemental composition of the ts c h n s o was determined for the inoculum fvwn and mssn by a perkin elmer chnso 2400 apparatus all the analyses were triplicated 3 results and discussion 3 1 feedstock and sewage sludge characteristics as pointed out before each seasonal series used a new inoculum the composition is given in table 3 as can be seen all of them had a ph value slightly above 7 and an important partial alkalinity indicating a high buffering capacity this is important to prevent the negative effect of low ph values that can be produced by the accumulation of vfa which commonly occurs during the anaerobic digestion of fvw it can also be observed that there are no significant differences throughout the different seasons of the year except perhaps for the s2 inoculum that presents a c n ratio relatively lower than the other three also the inoculum of the s4 series presents values of ts and vs lower than the other samples the waste composition is very important for the performance of the anaerobic degradation of any waste and this composition may present seasonal variations that could affect the biodegradability and the biogas and methane production rates a preliminary observation of the wastes produced at the wholesale market of malaga indicate that the presence of fruits is quite variable fruit rejections represent about 1 3 of the fvw in s3 and s4 about 1 2 for s1 and 2 3 for s2 the main properties of each residue are presented in table 4 together with the mean value for the inoculum the tables provided in the supplementary data article 30 give more details of the characterization of the inoculum and residues as can be seen the ph values of the mssn are close to neutrality and very similar to each other on the other hand the ph values of the fvwn are acidic regardless of the types of fruits and vegetables waste and vary from 3 5 to 4 8 the values of the c n ratio are very similar in all fvwn with an average of 24 while the values for the four mss samples are also similar and about 7 generally a c n ratio between 20 and 30 would be considered as the optimum condition for ad 35 also the values of ts and vs for the two wastes are quite different with a higher content for fvwn than for mssn all fvwn have approximately the same ts and vs content although the s3 series has slightly higher values vs represent about 94 of the ts indicating a high potential of organic transformation of fvwn during the anaerobic processes regarding the ts and vs for mssn it can be seen that the values are also similar except for mss3 that presents a higher value with respect to the total and partial alkalinity values since the fvwn have acid ph values only the ta for fvw4 could be obtained it can be observed that the mssn have lower ta and pa values than the inoculum in summary mssn and fvwn have significantly different characteristics while the seasonal variations are moderate therefore as long as the flow rate fed to the digester remains constant as the fvw mss pvr increases in the mixture the vs increases too and that yields also an increase in the olr 3 2 process performance the target of this research is to study the performance of a digester working with two wastes fvw and mss produced in large quantities throughout the year the seasonal variations in the composition are likely to be relevant so we study the evolution of the main parameters of interest for the anaerobic co digestion for the different seasons of the year the study was carried out working with the same hydraulic retention time same volumetric flow at different fvw mss pvrs and therefore with different olr values which is one of the most important variables for ad fig 1 shows the variation of the olr of the different fvwn mssn pvrs explored as can be seen for s3 the values of the olr fed are larger than for the other three series in agreement with the larger vs content of the fvw3 and mss3 it is also clear that a very important increase of the olr takes place as the fvw mss pvr increases for all the seasons being the final olr 100 fvw with respect to the initial 100 mss 330 for s3 and 860 for s1 of course this increase in the olr should be reflected in the biogas and methane production rates the mean value of the fraction of the carbon fed to the digester that is recovered as biogas is presented as fig 6 of the supplementary data article 30 it can be seen that this value is almost 50 when only mss is fed the trend of the four seasons is quite similar as the relative amount of fvw increases the carbon recovered as biogas increases up to values between 65 and 85 that are reached for a fvw mss pvr of 40 60 and remains close to those values for the larger amounts of fvw fed figs 2 and 3 show the biogas and methane production rates volume of biogas and methane produced each day per unit volume of sludge in the reactor for the different fvwn mssn series while the error bars represent two standard deviations of the 10 experiments 10 consecutive days the results obtained for each of the 60 consecutive days for each series are also shown as figs 2 and 3 in the supplementary data article 30 the results indicate that the digester is capable of treating all fvwn mssn pvrs of all seasons of the year using the same operational conditions it is also clear that there is an improvement in the biogas and methane production rates when compared to the mono digestion of mssn as can be seen for each season there is a linear relationship between the biogas and methane production rates and the fvwn mssn pvr fed into the digester the small size of the error bars reflects the stability of the digester the most important difference between seasons is observed for s3 corresponding to the winter samples this was also observed for the vs content table 4 with higher values for both residues for this season these higher values are relatively more important for the mss3 and it is probably due to a poorer performance of the activated sludge reactors that are working at lower temperature with approximately the same residence time also the primary sludge is likely to present larger vs concentration in winter altogether these results indicate that there is a close relationship between the vs and the biogas production and quality nevertheless there are also some changes in the system behavior related with the seasonal variations that can t be directly predicted from this variable although the stability will be discussed in more detail later it can be observed that the digester remains with acceptable stability even for the largest pvr of fvwn mssn 100 0 ganesh et al 36 reported that the maximum olr that can be fed for fvw for similar conditions was about 3 6 gvs l 1d 1 in this study the values of the olr for some of the experimental conditions are higher up to a maximum of 5 8 gvs l 1d 1 for fvw3 mss3 100 0 the review of bouallagui et al 14 indicates that the maximum olr for this type of residues is between 1 gvs l 1d 1 and 6 8 gvs l 1d 1 so our value falls within that region the stability at such a high olrs is probably related to the fact that even when only fvw is fed the waste is still a wide mixture of fruits and vegetables that show some kind of synergistic behavior 12 37 another of the most important parameters for comparing the anaerobic digestion of different wastes under the same experimental conditions is the specific methane production smp fig 4 shows the smp for all the 240 days essayed the solid line represents the mean value 0 363 l gvs 1 of these 240 results additional information is provided in table 5 and in fig 4 of the supplementary data article 30 the results are consistent with the values presented in the literature under mesophilic conditions 7 12 17 36 as can be seen all the experiments performed without fvw fall below the mean value line in addition those experiments for the same season performed with at least 40 fvwn present small changes this is not surprising since for all these experiments the vs of each season are quite similar in their composition since most of them are from the same fvw origin for instance for those experiments performed with 40 fvw between 69 and 85 of the olr is coming from the fvw depending on the season therefore even when the total olr increases significantly as the percentage of fvw increases the composition of the vs is almost constant this is consistent with the trend observed for the carbon recovered as biogas mentioned previously thus it may be concluded that fvw does not only provide a larger vs concentration but also this substrate allows the achievement of a higher smp this effect is probably related to the high concentration of simple carbohydrates in fruits and vegetables which are readily degradable 23 in addition the aerobic degradation yields not only a decrease in the vs concentration but also the vs that remains is less profitable for the anaerobic microorganisms some seasonal differences in the smp can be observed the mean value for the 60 days for each season is s1 0 333 l gvs 1 s2 0 390 l gvs 1 s3 0 383 l gvs 1 and s4 0 346 l gvs 1 thus some more smp is obtained for the cooler seasons fall and winter with respect to the mssn we have already pointed out that the activated sludge reactors are probably more efficient during the warmer seasons and this would yield not only a lower vs concentration in the mss but also the composition of these vs would be less profitable for the anaerobic consortium of microorganisms during these seasons to some extent this also occurs with the primary sludge regarding the fvwn one possible explanation would be that the demand of fruits and vegetables during the warm seasons is not as energy rich as during the cooler seasons when more calories are demanded in our diets in any case one should be aware that also for this parameter appreciable differences can be expected from the seasonal variations of the feed results for the 240 experimental days for the methane concentration in the biogas are presented in fig 5 the average methane concentration values as a function of the presence of fvw in the sludge for each season can also be found as fig 5 of supplementary data article 30 this parameter is one of the most important indicators of the biogas quality as can be seen almost all the results fall between 50 and 67 in agreement with those observed in the literature 10 20 23 once again seasonal variations can be observed but this time these are not observed for the experiments performed only with mss for which the methane concentration is very stable at values close to 65 for the four seasons this is so even when important seasonal variations are observed between the different mssn for the biogas and the methane productions instead as the amount of fvw in the feed increases the seasonal influence gets more evident and the largest differences are observed between the summer s1 and the fall s2 seasons in the first case the ch4 concentration decreases from about 65 to 50 as the fvw1 increases to 40 of the waste volume fed and then remains approximately constant at 50 as the fraction of fvw1 increases to 100 in the second case the concentration remains almost constant no matter the fraction of fvw2 fed to the digester the efficiency in the removal of volatile solids from the residues is another relevant parameter for the performance of the process the results for the 240 days are presented on fig 6 as can be seen the general trend is similar for the 4 series but once again relevant seasonal variations are observed as could be expected the vs fed as fvw are more easily biodegradable and therefore the removal efficiency is more important as the fvw mss pvr increases for almost all the experiments performed with at least 40 of the volume feed coming from the fvw the vs removal is between 70 and 87 on the other hand for those experiments performed with only mss the vs removal is approximately between 25 and 55 indicating that this substrate is not easily biodegradable 14 thus the main seasonal differences are seen for the mssn and among them the most important are between s1 summer 25 and s3 winter 55 this is in agreement with the previous observations while discussing fig 4 where we indicated that probably the aerobic reactors are obtaining a very good biodegradation efficiency during the warmer seasons while this efficiency is not as good during the winter the differences found between seasons when working only with a feedstock of fvw are relatively much smaller it can be observed that the best removals are observed for s1 and s2 summer and fall while the lower removals are seen for winter s3 and spring s4 explanation for these results is more difficult but are probably related with the fraction of materials difficult to biodegrade such as lignin present in the fvws which may present some important seasonal variations with respect to the results obtained for the co digestion of both substrates we find important changes of the seasonal behaviour for the lower fvw pvr for instance we find that for fvwn mssn of 20 80 and 40 60 summer s1 results are among those with best removal efficiencies while for the same season the results for mss were presenting the minimum removal this is not unexpected since for the summer results the fraction of vs fed that has fvw origin is higher precisely because the vs concentration of mss1 is very low thus for fvwn mssn pvr of 20 80 the fraction of vs from fvw origin is 68 3 while the mean value for the four seasons is 58 3 therefore even when the vs removal for mss1 is quite low the results for this parameter for the same season are among the best for a feed fvw1 mss1 with a pvr as low as 20 80 3 3 process stability the ph value of the digester is a very important variable since the microbial population responsible of anaerobic digestion is sensitive to this variable and the optimal value is around neutrality therefore an adequate ph value is essential for the stability of the digester and should be monitored during the anaerobic process the ph values at the end of the 24 h period of all the 240 experimental days fall between 6 9 and 7 3 thus the ph remain at values very close to neutrality for all the experiments regardless of the season or of the fvwn mssn pvr used most of the values are in the region of 7 0 7 1 so it is difficult to find any tendency nor obtain any meaningful plot only a very slight tendency can be observed which may indicate that as the presence of fvw in the feed increases the ph value at the end of the experiment is slightly more acidic nevertheless these variations within each series are below two decimal points of the ph value except for the s3 winter series for which the variations between the first values of the series and those obtained at the end change from 7 3 to 6 9 this is probably related with the ph value of the fvwn which is between 4 79 and 3 50 with the lower value obtained for fvw3 in any case if the stability of the digester is to be evaluated based only on the ph variations at the end of each 24 h period during the 240 experimental days it should be concluded that the system remains very stable and within the optimum range described in the literature for methanogenic bacteria 38 39 nevertheless it is also well known that there are different ph buffering processes that as long as remain active may hide the possible instabilities but on the long term on the depletion of the buffering capacity serious problems to the digester performance may arise some other parameters are discussed below that may act as an early warning for these depletion of these ph buffers the most used are the total ta partial pa and intermediate ia alkalinities that were defined in the analytical methods section of this paper the values for the first two parameters for the samples obtained from the digester at the end of each 24 h period are presented in fig 7 the first conclusion that can be obtained from the figure is that also these parameters remain quite stable except again for the s3 winter series for the other three series the total alkalinity remains relatively close to 4 g l 1 while the partial alkalinity remains between 2 and 3 g l 1 since the intermediate alkalinity is obtained as the difference between the total and partial alkalinity this value also remains constant at about 1 5 g l 1 for all the series except for s3 we have pointed out that the value of the partial alkalinity may be associated with the concentration of substances with ph buffering properties able to hold the ph values close to neutrality when acid substances are released thus more important than the actual concentration is the evolution of the parameters as the digester remains at a certain working condition it could be expected that as the fraction of fvw increases the corresponding increase of olr and of the biodegradability of the substrate may produce an increase of the volatile fatty acids and a decrease of the values of the partial alkalinity this would be indicating that the buffer capacity active at ph values close to neutrality is being depleted in other words the depletion of the partial alkalinity would be indicating that the ph value for the thriving conditions for the methanogenic bacteria is under risk therefore the evolution of this parameter along time is what is really acting as early warning some other parameters are used as early warning tools 33 40 for instance the ratios of intermediate to partial alkalinity ia pa or intermediate to total alkalinity are among the most recommended since their evolution is considered more sensitive to the depletion of the buffering capacity in the region of optimum ph values for anaerobic digestion of course the stability of the ph at values close to the neutrality require a large value of the pa and that most of the ta is corresponding to this pa i e that the ia is lower than the pa in other words the lower the value of the ia pa ratio the better for the stability of the digester therefore as early warning tools it is important that both parameters pa and ia pa remain constant with time the decrease of the pa or the increase of the ia pa values would be indicating that the digester is losing stability of course an increase in the pa or a decrease in the ia pa ratio would mean that the digester is more able to stand an increase in the generation of acids without important changes in the ph value and therefore to maintain the optimum conditions for the anaerobic digestion analogously a low value of the ia ta is indicating a good stability of the digester the values obtained for these ratios for the 240 experimental days are represented on fig 8 for the ia ta a value not higher than 0 3 0 4 has been recommended 41 and the results obtained are meeting reasonably those recommendations the experimental values of the ia are affected by the experimental errors of the pa and ta determination and this causes that our ia pa ratio presents relatively important oscillations throughout the 60 experimental results of each series nevertheless the evolution of the ia pa ratio during the 60 experimental days of each series can be evaluated statistically using the correlation coefficients known as kendall s τ or spearman s ρ both coefficients would yield a value of 1 when one variable is a perfect increasing monotone function of the other of 1 when the relation is a perfect decreasing monotone function and of 0 when the variables are perfectly independent table 6 presents the values obtained for the τ and ρ coefficients for each series for the ia pa ratio vs time as can be seen all of them yield quite small negative values thus it may be concluded that there is a very small correlation between the ia pa ratio and the experimental day of each series and therefore both coefficients are indicating that this ratio is not changing with time in other words it is not changing with the increase of the fvw concentration if any change is taking place this is in the direction of a negative correlation in summary the statistical analysis is indicating that the ia pa ratio is not changing or is decreasing as the fvw concentration increases in the feed therefore the digester remains quite stable during the four series also from the ia pa ratio point of view as pointed out previously only the winter series s3 shows a different trend with an initial increase of pa and ta during the first 20 days and then a decrease during the last 15 days once again the importance of the seasonal variability of the substrates is clear although it is difficult to try to find out the reasons for this evolution from the previous results we saw that mss3 presents a larger vs concentration and a more biodegradable organic matter with respect to other seasons so it is possible that the increase of the pa and ta alkalinities are associated with this kind of organic matter that makes the mss3 sample different with respect to the other three series in any case even when changes are observed among the different seasons the digester remains quite stable for all of them 4 conclusion the co digestion of fvw and mss is a very interesting management solution for these wastes in this manuscript all the experiments were obtained using the same hrt of 20 d a flow rate of 250 ml d and a working volume of 5 l each experimental condition was repeated for 10 d and the stability of the digester was studied following the evolution of some alkalinity parameters using the correlation coefficients known as kendall s τ or spearman s ρ the results obtained reflect that seasonality affects slightly the physical chemical characteristics of both substrates also some changes are observed in the system evolution for the different seasons studied nevertheless the co digestion of fvw and mss presents relatively similar values for the four seasons in all the cases it is observed that the larger the fvw mss pvr the larger are the biogas and methane production rates the experiments were performed at the same volumetric flow so the increase of the fvw mss pvr resulted in an increase of the olr that is the main responsible of the increase of the methane and biogas production rates nevertheless also the specific methane production increases slightly with the fvw concentration for the lower fvw mss pvrs the statistical study of the parameters used for the stability assessment indicates that the system remains stable for all the pvrs explored nevertheless before scaling up it is recommended the use of experimental times of at least two or three hrts in order to ascertain the digester stability especially for the pvrs of 80 20 and
