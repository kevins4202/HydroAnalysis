19870,arsenic is a carcinogenic element that exists primarily as arsenate as v and arsenite as iii in the nature environment with as iii being more toxic and mobile of the two species in addition ferrihydrite which is widely distributed in soils and aquatic environments can catalyze the oxidation of mn ii and accelerate the formation of high valence mn which can significantly influence the speciation toxicity and mobility of as when these species co exist in this context we herein explored the mechanism of as iii oxidation in the presence of ferrihydrite and mn ii using a kinetic approach combined with multiple spectroscopic techniques including x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy in situ horizontal attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and in situ quick scanning x ray absorption spectroscopy our results indicate that efficient as iii oxidation by dissolved o2 occurs on the surface of ferrihydrite in the presence of aqueous mn ii compared with as iii oxidation in the presence of ferrihydrite and mn oxides i e mn oxides hydroxides the degree of as iii oxidation in the ferrihydrite mn ii system was significantly higher and the majority of generated as v was adsorbed on the mineral i e ferrihydrite surface furthermore as iii oxidation was enhanced upon increasing both the molar ratio of mn ii as iii and the solution ph the greater as iii oxidation by o2 in the ferrihydrite mn ii system was mainly attributed to the formation of a strong oxidant of the instantaneous intermediate mn iii species via mn ii oxidation under catalysis by the ferrihydrite surface moreover as iii oxidation occurred mainly on the ferrihydrite surface and was accompanied by the regeneration of mn ii thereby rendering it recyclable these results therefore provide new insights into the mechanism of as iii oxidation on the surfaces of fe oxides i e fe oxides hydroxides in the presence of aqueous mn ii as well as the new details regarding the electron transfer mechanisms between the as iii mn ii iii o2 species at the ferrihydrite surface and could lead to novel approaches for as iii contaminant remediation in the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords ferrihydrite catalytic oxidation mn ii oxidation as iii oxidation as v adsorption mn iii intermediate 1 introduction in the past few decades arsenic pollution has gradually become a global environmental problem especially in soil and aquatic environments mandal and suzuki 2002 nriagu 1990 since as cannot be degraded by chemical and biological pathways it easily accumulates in the food chain and through biogeochemical cycling thereby threatening both ecosystems and human health goswami et al 2012 goddington 1986 ferguson and gavis 1972 more specifically as iii is more toxic mobile and soluble than as v and so its removal or adsorption is more challenging deschamps et al 2003 goddington 1986 ferguson and gavis 1972 thus rendering it stable over the long term even in the presence of dissolved o2 tallman et al 1980 scott and morgan 1995 ren et al 2013 therefore the facile and efficient oxidation of as iii to as v is of key importance to reduce its toxicity and mobility voegelin and hug 2003 bhandari et al 2011 ren et al 2013 cerkez et al 2015 although as iii is stable in homogeneous systems metal oxides such as cuo and mnox can promote its oxidation both directly and indirectly pillewan et al 2011 goswami et al 2012 scott and morgan 1995 nesbitt et al 1998 manning et al 2002 zhu et al 2009 wu 2014 fischel et al 2015 however as iii oxidation does not usually occur on iron oxide surfaces except in the presence of light or fe ii amstaetter et al 2010 bhandari et al 2011 2012 xu et al 2013 nevertheless fe mn binary oxides have recently been synthesized and employed as highly efficient oxidants and adsorbents for both as iii and as v zhang et al 2014 in addition bai et al 2016 proposed biogenic fe mn oxides which can simultaneously oxidize and adsorb as iii these results indicate that the coexistence of fe and mn hydroxy oxides results in a significant synergistic effect for the oxidation and removal of as compared with either pure fe or mn hydroxy oxide systems mn ii is known to exist under acidic anaerobic and suboxic conditions which are common in groundwater deep sea sediments and in some environmental settings enriched with organic matter knocke et al 1991 junta and hochella 1994 barceloux 1999 homoncik et al 2010 sunda et al 1983 stone and morgan 1984 the oxidation of mn ii leads to the formation of mn iii iv oxides which determines the mobility and availability of as and other heavy metals post 1999 nelson et al 2002 tebo et al 2004 ren et al 2013 han et al 2016 in addition numerous studies have shown that widely distributed iron oxides with high surface activities can catalyze the oxidation of mn ii davies and morgan 1989 junta and hochella 1994 madden and hochella 2005 wang et al 2015 lan et al 2017 and so these species often associate closely with mn containing minerals in terrestrial and marine environments cornell and giovanoli 1987 tan et al 2000 which may make some effects on the fate of heavy metals indeed an electrochemical pathway for the catalytic oxidation of mn ii on the ferrihydrite surface was proposed in our recent work lan et al 2017 given that mn oxides derived from the catalytic oxidation of mn ii are active in the oxidation of as iii the latter process will occur in ferrihydrite mn ii systems in which mn oxides are formed through the fe oxide catalyzed oxidation of mn ii by o2 although the promoting role of mn ii on as iii oxidation has been reported ren et al 2013 han et al 2016 sun et al 1999 the underlying mechanism of the coupled mn ii and as iii oxidation reaction and the electron transfer pathway for as removal in the fe mn binary system remain unknown in addition the mn oxides formed via the oxidation of mn ii on fe oxides tend to be regarded as the active oxidants responsible for as iii oxidation ren et al 2013 han et al 2016 however an in situ determination of the intermediate products of mn ii oxidation has yet to be carried out thereby rendering this hypothesis still speculative thus we herein focus on the coupled oxidation of as iii and mn ii in the presence of ferrihydrite through examination of the interactions taking place between the fe oxide mn ii binary system and as iii in addition to examining the underlying reaction mechanisms involved kinetic experiments combined with in situ horizontal attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy hatr ftir and quick scanning x ray absorption spectroscopy q xas are employed to monitor the real time changes in as and mn speciation in addition to the number of mn oxide equivalents produced during as iii oxidation in the presence of ferrihydrite mn ii in addition the final mn ii oxidation products are identified by x ray diffraction xrd and mn k edge x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy xanes for detailed procedures please see the supplementary information si text s1 to explore the interaction taking place during as iii and mn ii oxidation on the ferrihydrite surface we aim to reveal the as iii oxidation mechanisms taking place in the ferrihydrite mn ii system with the purpose of developing a novel economical pathway to reduce the toxicity of as iii and to efficiently immobilize the generated as v 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of ferrihydrite 2lfh ferrihydrite was synthesized according to a method described by wang et al 2013 the cleaned ferrihydrite was then freeze dried ground passed through a 60 mesh sieve and stored at 4 c xrd analysis see below confirmed that the obtained product was present as a single pure phase fig s1 and the specific surface area was determined to be 292 m2 g 1 taken from 5 points using the brunauer emmett teller method all experiments described below were conducted in the absence of light to avoid the possible photochemical oxidation of mn ii and as iii 2 2 as iii oxidation in the presence and absence of ferrihydrite or mn ii under a range of conditions ferrihydrite 0 5 g was dispersed in deionized water 100 ml by sonication over 5 min in a 250 ml reaction vessel after which the desired quantities of mn ii and as iii solutions detailed preparation procedures for the as iii and mn ii stock solution are provided in the si text s2 were added to give a total reaction volume of 150 ml and final mn ii and as iii concentrations of 24 and 1 mm the reaction was then allowed to proceed at ph 7 and 25 c with an o2 flow rate of 0 15 m3 h 1 over 8 h under stirring using a potentiometric titration system metrohm 907 system a the apparatus employed in this experiment is shown in fig s2 during the reaction aliquots 3 0 ml of the suspension were sampled at the desired time intervals and filtered immediately using 0 22 μm membrane filters the obtained wet paste was then dried at 40 c in a vacuum drying oven and the filtrates were prepared for analysis of the mn ii concentration by atomic absorption spectrometry aas varian aas 240fs and for determination of the as v concentration using the molybdate blue colorimetric method with a detection limit of 20 μg l 1 lenoble et al 2003 dhar et al 2004 detailed analytical methods of as and mn speciation can be found in the si text s3 the quantity of oxidized as iii on the mineral surfaces i e the as v content generated on the mineral surfaces i e as v surface was obtained by instantly dissolving the dried sample 3 mg either in 1 m h2so4 3 ml or in a mixture of 1 m h2so4 3 ml and 10 mass ratio hydroxylamine hydrochloride 0 5 ml if there were any mn oxides produced on or existed with ferrihydrite mn oxide production was determined using the leucoberbelin blue lbb colorimetric method lan et al 2017 krumbein and altmann 1973 francis et al 2001 h2so4 and a solution of hydroxylamine hydrochloride were employed to dissolve the ferrihydrite and any existing or produced manganese oxides respectively in addition the as iii contents both in solution and on the mineral surfaces were determined by atomic fluorescence spectroscopy afs 9700 beijing haiguang instrument co ltd detailed measurement procedures can be found in the si text s3 furthermore pyrophosphate pp was added to a similar reaction system to determine the possible generation of mn iii during the reaction and specific details can be found in fig s12 the final products obtained from the ferrihydrite mn ii as iii systems were then washed with deionized water vacuum dried at 40 c and characterized by xrd furthermore three control experiments were conducted in the absence of ferrihydrite and or mn ii to examine the oxidation efficiency of as iii in the following systems 1 the as iii o2 system 2 the mn ii as iii o2 system and 3 the ferrihydrite as iii o2 system the control experiments indicated that the dissolution reaction did not cause significant as iii oxidation by ferrihydrite in the open system fig 1 b a 1 mm solution of as iii was also oxidized in ferrihydrite mn ii system in the presence of tert butyl alcohol tba dimethyl sulfoxide dmso or under a n2 atmosphere to replace o2 to examine the respective effects of tba dmso or n2 on as iii oxidation in the ferrihydrite mn ii system and to reveal the detailed mechanisms of as iii oxidation in system a to explore the role of mn ii in the as iii oxidation process the total mn iii iv oxides produced during the reaction were detected instantly using the method described by lan et al 2017 in this case the number of equivalents of the produced mn oxides was calculated from the number of moles of transferred electrons upon reduction to mn ii by lbb for example 1 mm mn iv oxides and 1 mm kmn vii o4 are equivalent to 2 and 5 mm mn iii oxides respectively in addition in situ hatr ftir spectroscopy was employed to measure the adsorption oxidation of as iii on the ferrihydrite surface both in the presence and absence of mn ii detailed methods and procedures are described in the si text s4 2 3 as iii oxidation in the presence of ferrihydrite and pre formed mn oxides to compare the differences in as iii oxidation in the mixture of ferrihydrite and mn oxides with that in the ferrihydrite mn ii system system a two comparable experiments were conducted using pre formed mn oxides i e system b and system c in the case of system b a 24 mm solution of mn ii was firstly oxidized in the presence of ferrihydrite 0 5 g at ph 7 with an o2 flow rate of 0 15 m3 h 1 over 8 h total reaction volume 150 ml and the final products were washed with deionized water and vacuum dried at 40 c to remove any residual mn ii the dried products were then dispersed in deionized water and mixed with an as iii solution to give an initial as iii concentration of 1 mm and a final volume of 150 ml subsequently the oxidation of as iii was allowed to proceed in this suspension at ph 7 for 8 h in the open system without extra o2 supply in contrast for system c a 1 mm solution of as iii was oxidized in a suspension containing 0 3 g birnessite and 0 5 g ferrihydrite at ph 7 for 8 h in the open system without extra o2 supply where the calculated initial mn concentration was 24 mm and the total volume was 150 ml the as v concentrations in solution were detected as described above for system b and system c it should also be noted that no additional o2 was employed either in system b or system c to avoid the possible significant catalytic oxidation process of mn ii as small quantities of mn ii will be generated during as iii oxidation by the pre formed mn oxides it would be expected that in the presence of additional o2 the catalytic re oxidation of mn ii would mask the contribution of ferrihydrite mn ii o2 and pre formed mn oxides upon as iii oxidation 2 4 as iii oxidation at different ph values and different molar ratios of mn ii as iii to explore the effects of both ph and the mn ii as iii molar ratio on as iii oxidation as iii oxidation experiments were performed in the presence of 0 5 g ferrihydrite mn ii at a range of ph values i e 12 mm mn ii and 1 mm as iii at ph 5 6 7 8 or 9 at ph 7 with different as iii concentrations i e 12 mm mn ii mn ii as iii molar ratio 3 6 12 or 24 and at ph 7 with different mn ii concentrations i e 1 mm as iii mn ii as iii molar ratio 1 2 6 12 or 24 at 25 c over 8 h with an o2 flow rate of 0 15 m3 h 1 the as v contents in solution and on the mineral surfaces were then determined using the method described above in addition the intermediate mn iii iv oxides produced during the reaction i e reaction systems containing 12 mm mn ii and 1 mm as iii at ph 5 7 8 and 9 were detected in real time mode finally the quantities of oxidation products produced from 12 mm mn ii in the ferrihydrite suspension in the absence of as iii at ph 5 7 8 and 9 were also measured to compare the extent of mn ii oxidation in the absence and presence of as iii 2 5 in situ quick as and mn k edge xas spectroscopy to explore the speciation changes of as iii and mn ii during the oxidation of 100 mg l 1 as iii in the presence of 0 5 g ferrihydrite and 24 mm mn ii with an o2 flow rate of 0 08 m3 h 1 in situ q xas was employed during the reaction the experimental procedures employed were close to those reported previously ginder vogel et al 2009 and are described as follows the mn and as k edge xas spectra were collected at 25 c at the 1w1b beamline of the beijing synchrotron radiation facility in fluorescence mode the suspension 150 ml was reacted in a 250 ml plastic beaker with a 10 60 mm slit sealed with kapton film close to the bottom upon commencement of the oxidation reaction the mn k edge xas or as k edge xas spectra were collected between 6 35 and 7 2 kev and between 11 85 and 11 95 kev respectively during the 8 h reaction the ph was maintained at ph 7 by titration of a 1 m naoh solution each individual scan duration was 301 ms and each spectrum was completed within 1 2 min the athena program was used for background removal and linear combination fittings lcf to quantify the speciation variations for mn and as ginder vogel et al 2009 2 6 xrd characterization all final products were analyzed by xrd using a bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer equipped with a lynxeye detector and using ni filtered cu kα radiation λ 0 15418 nm bruker axs gmbh karlsruhe germany the diffractometer was operated at a tube voltage of 40 kv and a tube current of 40 ma the xrd patterns were collected at a step size of 0 02 using a scan rate of 1 min 1 for the final products and 10 min 1 for the intermediate products 3 results and discussion 3 1 as iii oxidation in the ferrihydrite mn ii and ferrihydrite mn iii iv oxide systems the hatr ftir spectra of the interactions between as iii as v and the ferrihydrite surface are shown in figs s3a and s3b where the absorption band at 782 cm 1 corresponds to as iii fig s3a and those at 825 and 876 cm 1 are attributed to as v fig s3b in the case where as iii coexists with mn ii fig 1a the bands at 825 and 876 cm 1 gradually appear and become stronger with time indicating an increase in as iii oxidation on the ferrihydrite surface in contrast the intensity of the band at 782 cm 1 initially increases later decreasing as the reaction progresses thereby suggesting initial as iii adsorption followed by oxidation the percentages of the total produced as v in the different reaction systems over time were determined to obtain the dominant factors responsible for as iii oxidation fig 1b in the homogeneous system almost no as iii oxidation occurs even in the presence of both o2 and mn ii while in the presence of ferrihydrite trace amounts of as iii oxidation are observed likely due to the effect of light during sampling bhandari et al 2011 2012 however in the presence of both ferrihydrite and mn ii the as iii oxidation percentage gradually increases and reaches 100 within 8 h in contrast little as iii oxidation takes place under the equivalent conditions in a n2 atmosphere these results therefore indicate that the mineral ferrihydrite surface mn ii and o2 are all essential to promote as iii oxidation significantly in the absence of light a potential synergistic effect between these three components may therefore exist and contribute to the significant as iii oxidation this will be discussed in further detail below to further confirm the effects of mn ii on the oxidation of as iii in the presence of ferrihydrite system a system b and system c which contain pre existing mn oxides were examined for comparison as indicated in fig 2 a the initial extent of as iii oxidation i e total as v total as 0 240 min follows the order system c system b system a which could be attributed to the rapid direct oxidation of the pre existing mn iii iv oxides on as iii in system c and system b in comparison to the relatively lower initial rate of mn ii oxidation in system a fig 1c in contrast the final as iii oxidation percentages follow the order system a system c system b fig 2a after 420 min which indicates the stronger catalytic activity of mn ii on the oxidation of as iii in system a compared to the activities of the pre existing mn iii iv oxides in system c and system b furthermore the extent of as iii oxidation in system c is significantly higher than that of system b which may be attributed to the much stronger oxidizing capability of birnessite on as iii compared to the mn iii oxides formed through the catalytic oxidation of mn ii on ferrihydrite moreover the percentages of as v surface total as display a similar trend to those of the total as v content fig 2b while the as v solution total as percentages present the opposite trend i e system a system b system c fig 2c this indicates that both the as iii catalytic oxidation and as v immobilization capacities of the pre existing mn oxides in the presence of ferrihydrite i e system b and system c are lower than those of the 2lfh mn ii as iii system moreover the as v content in the solution of system c gradually decreases after an initial sharp increase fig 2c which is likely due to the direct oxidation of as iii by birnessite accompanied with an immediate release of large quantities of newly generated as v into solution at the beginning of the reaction and subsequent gradual adsorption of the released as v on the ferrihydrite surface these results therefore suggest that as iii oxidation in the 2lfh mn ii as iii system is not only a simple direct oxidation by the newly formed mn oxides originating from ferrihydrite catalyzed mn ii oxidation but that it displays apparently higher efficiencies of as iii oxidation and as v retention we therefore expect that as iii oxidation in the ferrihydrite mn ii system may follow a different reaction mechanism compared to the systems containing ferrihydrite and pre existing mn oxides 3 2 effect of as iii on the adsorption oxidation of mn ii on ferrihydrite to explore the role of mn ii in the as iii oxidation process the mn ii oxidation degree and mn ii removal extent from the solution were determined at different reaction intervals fig 1c and d in the absence of as iii the number of intermediate mn oxide equivalents increases gradually with reaction time which is consistent with the variation in percentages of the total as v produced via as iii oxidation in the 2lfh mn ii as iii system fig 1c suggesting that as iii oxidation may follow a similar oxidation pathway to that of mn ii in addition the removal of mn ii from the solution increases significantly in the absence of as iii fig 1d suggesting the formation of large quantities of mn oxides davies and morgan 1989 wang et al 2015 lan et al 2017 however in the presence of as iii the number of mn oxide equivalents almost remains constant at relatively low levels throughout the reaction fig 1c and little aqueous mn ii is removed fig 1d thereby indicating that as iii oxidation inhibits the formation of mn iii iv oxides and mn ii removal furthermore in the presence of as iii the xrd patterns of the final products also show few diffraction peaks corresponding to the mn iii iv oxides with the exception of some minor signals that could be attributed to hausmannite mn3o4 fig s4 in contrast in the absence of as iii large quantities of mn iii oxides including manganite γ mnooh feitknechtite β mnooh and groutite α mnooh were formed fig s4 moreover the minimal consumption of mn ii during as iii oxidation suggests that mn ii may mainly serve as an electron transfer mediator during its catalysis on the as iii oxidation process 3 3 effect of ph on as iii oxidation in the ferrihydrite mn ii system as shown in fig 3 the percentages of total as v total as fig 3a and as v surface total as fig 3b both increase upon increasing the ph from 5 to 9 which corresponds to an increase in mn ii oxidation degree with increasing ph wang et al 2015 more specifically at ph 8 and 9 as iii oxidation is rapid within the first 60 min and then almost approaches an reaction equilibrium however the quantities of as v produced in solution at all ph values are significantly lower than those on the ferrihydrite surface fig 3c in addition the percentages of as v solution total as at ph 5 are slightly higher than those at ph 6 7 and 8 fig 3c which may be due to the favorable formation of the ho radical at ph 5 xu et al 2013 moreover at ph 9 the percentages of as v solution total as are significantly higher than at other ph values and gradually increase with time we propose that the presence of higher quantities of residual as v in solution at ph 9 is likely due to three key points 1 the highest as iii oxidation is present at ph 9 which indicates that the greatest quantity of as v is left in solution 2 the formation of large quantities of mn iii iv oxides blocks the adsorption sites on the ferrihydrite surface thereby decreasing as v adsorption tani et al 2004 ren et al 2013 and 3 the adsorption of as v onto the mineral i e ferrihydrite surface is more unfavorable at high ph values compared to the adsorption of as iii dixit and hering 2003 which leads to the release of newly formed as v from the mineral surface into solution furthermore almost no mn ii removal was observed at ph 5 6 and 7 fig 3d indicating the formation of small quantities of mn oxides fig s5 in contrast at ph 8 mn ii removal increases gradually reaching 100 removal by the end of the reaction however no obvious diffraction peaks corresponding to mn oxides were observed by xrd fig s5 which is likely due to the formation of amorphous mn phases fig s6 moreover at ph 9 all mn ii was removed within 30 min fig 3d with buserite δ mno2 hydrated birnessite rather than mn iii oxides i e feitknechtite appearing in the final products fig s5 the number of equivalents of mn oxides observed at different ph values i e 5 7 9 both in the presence and in the absence of as iii reveals further details regarding the as iii oxidation process fig 4 interestingly all growth curves of the formed mn iii iv oxides derived from mn ii oxidation catalyzed by the ferrihydrite surface in the absence of as iii display a similar trend to those of the as iii oxidation percentages over a range of ph values figs 3a and 4a in addition at ph 5 neither mn ii nor as iii oxidation occurs figs 3a 4a and b suggesting that as iii oxidation may be inseparable from mn ii oxidation in contrast at ph 7 mn iii oxides such as groutite and manganite form in the absence of as iii while few mn oxides were observed in the presence of as iii fig 4a and c indicating that the formation of mn iii oxides is inhibited by as iii oxidation however at ph 9 although mn ii oxidation is suppressed by the presence of as iii large amounts of mn oxides still formed fig 4a and d fig 4d also shows that the suppression of mn oxide formation by as iii oxidation is observed mainly for the mn iii oxides i e feitknechtite as the mn iv oxides i e buserite were still observed in this case fig s7 furthermore based on the assumption that all formed mn oxides are mn iii oxides the number of equivalents of formed mn oxides at ph 9 exceeds the initial mn ii concentration of 12 mm at 60 min fig 4a thereby implying the formation of mn iv phases meanwhile the corresponding rapid as iii oxidation was almost complete at 60 min fig 3a which is consistent with the kinetics of mn ii oxidation fig 4a implying that the majority of as iii oxidation 76 occurred mainly during the initial 60 min of the reaction moreover the difference in mn oxide equivalents obtained from the different systems in the presence and absence of as iii at ph 9 remains relatively constant over time which may be ascribed to the decreasing amount of feitknechtite formed in the presence of as iii fig 4d therefore the as iii oxidation taking place in system a may mainly be associated with the newly formed mn iii species rather than with the mn iv oxides that are capable of directly oxidizing as iii 3 4 effect of the mn ii as iii molar ratio on as iii oxidation in the ferrihydrite mn ii system as shown in fig 5 a and fig s8a although the oxidation of as iii is enhanced upon increasing the mn ii concentration the content of as v formed in the solution is particularly low fig s8b this indicates that as iii oxidation occurs mainly on the ferrihydrite surface and that the formed as v is primarily adsorbed on the mineral surfaces in addition fig 5b and fig s9 suggest that as iii oxidation is enhanced upon decreasing the as iii concentration implying that as iii oxidation is promoted at higher mn ii as iii molar ratios indeed as shown in fig 5c a positive linear correlation is observed since as iii oxidation depends on the pre oxidation degree of mn ii on ferrihydrite fig 4 relatively high as iii concentrations would result in competition between the adsorption of as iii and mn ii on ferrihydrite thus affecting the initial degree of mn ii oxidation on the mineral surface and inhibiting the coupled as iii oxidation process 3 5 in situ quick as and mn k edge xas spectroscopy as shown in fig 6 the as xas spectra gradually shift to higher energies upon increasing the reaction time suggesting an increase in as v formation fig 6b in addition lcf fitting shows that the percentage of as v gradually increases to 35 after 8 h fig 6a which is consistent with the trend of mn ii oxidation in the absence of as iii fig 6c moreover the percentage of mn ii oxidized reaches 89 in the absence of as iii while only 10 oxidation was achieved in the presence of as iii fig 6c and d and fig s10 indicating that as iii oxidation significantly inhibits the formation of mn iii iv oxides and in particular the mn iii oxides these results therefore suggest that the mn iii species formed via the catalytic oxidation of mn ii on ferrihydrite may rapidly participate in as iii oxidation before crystallization of the mn iii oxides can take place 3 6 adsorption oxidation mechanisms of as iii in the presence of ferrihydrite and mn ii previous studies have indicated that ferrihydrite can promote mn ii oxidation and lead to the formation of various mn iii iv oxides wang et al 2015 which can directly oxidize as iii to as v zhu et al 2009 wu 2014 in this case the presence of mn ii significantly promotes as iii oxidation in the ferrihydrite suspension which exhibits a higher degree of as iii oxidation than systems containing mn iii iv oxides prior to as iii oxidation fig 2 although it was commonly believed that mn oxide minerals derived from mn ii oxidation under iron oxide catalysis are mainly responsible for as iii oxidation in the iron oxide as iii mn ii systems ren et al 2013 in our experiments we observed the formation of small quantities of mn oxides and in particular mn iii oxides through mn ii oxidation in the presence of as iii figs 1c d 4 and 6 in addition as the as adsorption capacity of iron oxides is larger than that of mn oxides zhang et al 2014 the mn oxides formed on the ferrihydrite surface may cover the adsorption sites ren et al 2012 2013 thereby reducing both as iii oxidation and as v adsorption this also accounts for the reduced as iii oxidation and additional as v present in the suspensions in system b and system c compared to system a fig 2c in contrast the quantity of as v produced in solution in the ferrihydrite mn ii system is negligible fig 2c and fig 3c due to the high adsorption capacity of ferrihydrite and the limited formation of mn oxides this differs from the systems containing pre existing mn oxides as the mn iii iv oxides would occupy the sorption sites thereby inhibiting as v adsorption and resulting in the release of adsorbed as v back into the solution moreover we found that the coexistence of ferrihydrite mn ii and o2 is essential to promote as iii oxidation figs 1 and 4 suggesting that the oxidation of as iii is indeed closely associated with the ferrihydrite catalyzed pre oxidation of mn ii in addition although as iii oxidation requires the participation of o2 as a potential terminal electron acceptor fig s11 the process of as iii oxidation via ho at ph 7 is negligible in the ferrihydrite mn ii o2 system fig s11 moreover as iii oxidation leads mainly to the disappearance of the newly formed mn iii oxides rather than mn iv oxides in the ferrihydrite mn ii systems figs 4 and 6 figs s4 and s7 this implies that the oxidation of as iii may be mainly driven by an instantaneous intermediate mn iii species with a strong oxidation ability formed via mn ii oxidation figs 1c d 3 4 and 6 as outlined in fig s12 in addition as iii oxidation by any newly formed mn iii iv oxides may also take place but this would be expected to play only a minor role in this reaction system furthermore density functional theory dft calculations also indicated that the electron transfer rate between mn iii and as iii is slower than that between mn iv and as iii and that the mn iv sites exhibit a stronger adsorption affinity than the mn iii sites for both as iii and as v zhu et al 2009 therefore the above mentioned mn iii species may lose its high reactivity following crystallization into mn iii oxides it has been proposed that the similar short lived highly reactive mn iii species can be formed through various pathways such as the reduction of mn vii in the permanganate bisulfite pm bs process sun et al 2015 2016 the oxidation of mn ii provided by fresh plant litter at sites of active decay keiluweit et al 2015 or the ligand stabilization of mn oxidation intermediates wang and giammar 2015 in this case we determined that the transient intermediate mn iii species is formed through catalytic mn ii oxidation on the ferrihydrite surface which is widely abundant in the environment the resulting mn iii species can rapidly oxidize as iii and regenerate mn ii simultaneously thereby maintaining the mn ii concentration relatively constant figs 1c and d 3 4 and 6 indeed particularly low quantities of mn iii oxides were detected during as iii oxidation figs 1c 4a and 6d figs s4 s5 and s7 as the generation of the intermediate mn iii species mainly depends on mn ii oxidation catalyzed by the mineral surface wang et al 2015 chernyshova et al 2011 junta and hochella 1994 lan et al 2017 it is apparent that as iii oxidation by the intermediate mn iii species also takes place mainly on the ferrihydrite surface fig s13a thereby leading to the adsorption of the majority of produced as v on the mineral surface in addition fig s13b shows that all as iii is gradually adsorbed on the ferrihydrite surface over 60 min during which time the degree of as iii oxidation slowly increases fig 1b subsequently the quantity of as iii present on the ferrihydrite surface gradually decreases fig s13b accompanied by a rapid increase in the total as v total as ratio in the suspension fig 1b indicating that as iii oxidation takes place mainly on the ferrihydrite surface additionally since as iii oxidation relies on the pre oxidation of mn ii the growth curve of the as iii oxidation percentage displays a comparable trend to that of mn iii iv oxide formation derived from the ferrihydrite catalyzed mn ii oxidation in the absence of as iii figs 1c 6a and 6c the above results regarding the oxidation of as iii in a ferrihydrite mn ii suspension indicate that this transformation can be split into two key processes fig 7 firstly mn ii is oxidized to produce the transient mn iii intermediate a type of meta stable mn iii species at the ferrihydrite surface reaction ① secondly the mn iii intermediate species rapidly oxidizes as iii to as v by receiving electrons from as iii reaction ② simultaneously regenerating mn ii reaction ③ and maintaining a relatively constant mn ii concentration throughout the reaction furthermore our results confirm that the oxidation reactions occur mainly on the ferrihydrite surface thus the majority of formed as v is adsorbed on the mineral surface and little as v is released into solution reaction ④ in addition electron transfer between the as iii mn ii iii o2 species at the ferrihydrite surface could be fulfilled and promoted by an electrochemical pathway via the conduction band of the bulk ferrihydrite in addition to the conventional two interfacial pathways lan et al 2017 as such a more significant enhancement in as iii oxidation by mn ii is observed in the presence of a semiconducting mineral i e ferrihydrite compared to that observed in the presence of an insulator such as amorphous al oh 3 fig s14 3 7 environmental significance ferrihydrite is widely distributed in suboxic environments including groundwater stagnant water soils i e gleys pseudogleys and paddy soils cornell and schwertmann 2003 where mn ii and as iii could potentially coexist with o2 our results detailed above therefore provide a fundamental understanding of the electron transfer pathway that likely takes place between the as iii mn ii o2 species at the ferrihydrite surface present in the natural environments we also found that the metastable ligand free mn iii species were generated from the ferrihydrite catalyzed mn ii oxidation system and could act as an active environmental oxidant to participate in various biogeochemical redox processes in the presence of the appropriate reductants such as as iii as such our clarification of the detailed electron transfer mechanisms between the as iii mn ii iii o2 species at the ferrihydrite surface could aid in the development of a novel approach to the simultaneous oxidation of as iii and immobilization of the generated as v thereby reducing the toxicity and mobility of as iii v in contaminated soils and water bodies in addition the regeneration of mn ii during as iii oxidation renders it recyclable thereby reducing its consumption and giving a more environmentally friendly process finally the promotion effect of cr iii oxidation was also observed in the presence of ferrihydrite and aqueous mn ii fig s15 indicating that this fe oxide mn ii system may play an essential and widespread role in the mediation of other environmental redox reactions which deserve further investigation we also expect that these results could offer a practical basis to deal with the combined pollution caused by multiple hazardous ions such as as iii cr iii and mn ii 4 conclusions we herein explored the mechanism of as iii oxidation by dissolved o2 in the presence of ferrihydrite and mn ii using a kinetic approach combined with a range of spectroscopic techniques we found that upon the oxidation of as iii immobilization of the newly generated as v occurred efficiently on the ferrihydrite surface in the presence of aqueous mn ii more specifically the ferrihydrite catalyzed pre oxidation of mn ii resulted in rapid as iii oxidation which was further enhanced at higher ph values and higher mn ii as iii molar ratios in the reaction systems we also demonstrated that the ligand free mn iii intermediate species formed through the oxidation of mn ii by o2 under ferrihydrite catalysis acted as the main reactive oxidant for as iii oxidation furthermore the regeneration of mn ii during as iii oxidation rendered it recyclable thereby reducing its consumption and minimizing the effects of reactive site blockage on the ferrihydrite surface these results therefore provide a better understanding of the mechanism of as iii oxidation on the surfaces of fe oxides in the presence of aqueous mn ii and also the detailed electron transfer mechanisms taking place between the as iii mn ii iii o2 species hence we expect that they will lead to the development of novel approaches for as iii contaminant remediation in the

19870,arsenic is a carcinogenic element that exists primarily as arsenate as v and arsenite as iii in the nature environment with as iii being more toxic and mobile of the two species in addition ferrihydrite which is widely distributed in soils and aquatic environments can catalyze the oxidation of mn ii and accelerate the formation of high valence mn which can significantly influence the speciation toxicity and mobility of as when these species co exist in this context we herein explored the mechanism of as iii oxidation in the presence of ferrihydrite and mn ii using a kinetic approach combined with multiple spectroscopic techniques including x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy in situ horizontal attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and in situ quick scanning x ray absorption spectroscopy our results indicate that efficient as iii oxidation by dissolved o2 occurs on the surface of ferrihydrite in the presence of aqueous mn ii compared with as iii oxidation in the presence of ferrihydrite and mn oxides i e mn oxides hydroxides the degree of as iii oxidation in the ferrihydrite mn ii system was significantly higher and the majority of generated as v was adsorbed on the mineral i e ferrihydrite surface furthermore as iii oxidation was enhanced upon increasing both the molar ratio of mn ii as iii and the solution ph the greater as iii oxidation by o2 in the ferrihydrite mn ii system was mainly attributed to the formation of a strong oxidant of the instantaneous intermediate mn iii species via mn ii oxidation under catalysis by the ferrihydrite surface moreover as iii oxidation occurred mainly on the ferrihydrite surface and was accompanied by the regeneration of mn ii thereby rendering it recyclable these results therefore provide new insights into the mechanism of as iii oxidation on the surfaces of fe oxides i e fe oxides hydroxides in the presence of aqueous mn ii as well as the new details regarding the electron transfer mechanisms between the as iii mn ii iii o2 species at the ferrihydrite surface and could lead to novel approaches for as iii contaminant remediation in the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords ferrihydrite catalytic oxidation mn ii oxidation as iii oxidation as v adsorption mn iii intermediate 1 introduction in the past few decades arsenic pollution has gradually become a global environmental problem especially in soil and aquatic environments mandal and suzuki 2002 nriagu 1990 since as cannot be degraded by chemical and biological pathways it easily accumulates in the food chain and through biogeochemical cycling thereby threatening both ecosystems and human health goswami et al 2012 goddington 1986 ferguson and gavis 1972 more specifically as iii is more toxic mobile and soluble than as v and so its removal or adsorption is more challenging deschamps et al 2003 goddington 1986 ferguson and gavis 1972 thus rendering it stable over the long term even in the presence of dissolved o2 tallman et al 1980 scott and morgan 1995 ren et al 2013 therefore the facile and efficient oxidation of as iii to as v is of key importance to reduce its toxicity and mobility voegelin and hug 2003 bhandari et al 2011 ren et al 2013 cerkez et al 2015 although as iii is stable in homogeneous systems metal oxides such as cuo and mnox can promote its oxidation both directly and indirectly pillewan et al 2011 goswami et al 2012 scott and morgan 1995 nesbitt et al 1998 manning et al 2002 zhu et al 2009 wu 2014 fischel et al 2015 however as iii oxidation does not usually occur on iron oxide surfaces except in the presence of light or fe ii amstaetter et al 2010 bhandari et al 2011 2012 xu et al 2013 nevertheless fe mn binary oxides have recently been synthesized and employed as highly efficient oxidants and adsorbents for both as iii and as v zhang et al 2014 in addition bai et al 2016 proposed biogenic fe mn oxides which can simultaneously oxidize and adsorb as iii these results indicate that the coexistence of fe and mn hydroxy oxides results in a significant synergistic effect for the oxidation and removal of as compared with either pure fe or mn hydroxy oxide systems mn ii is known to exist under acidic anaerobic and suboxic conditions which are common in groundwater deep sea sediments and in some environmental settings enriched with organic matter knocke et al 1991 junta and hochella 1994 barceloux 1999 homoncik et al 2010 sunda et al 1983 stone and morgan 1984 the oxidation of mn ii leads to the formation of mn iii iv oxides which determines the mobility and availability of as and other heavy metals post 1999 nelson et al 2002 tebo et al 2004 ren et al 2013 han et al 2016 in addition numerous studies have shown that widely distributed iron oxides with high surface activities can catalyze the oxidation of mn ii davies and morgan 1989 junta and hochella 1994 madden and hochella 2005 wang et al 2015 lan et al 2017 and so these species often associate closely with mn containing minerals in terrestrial and marine environments cornell and giovanoli 1987 tan et al 2000 which may make some effects on the fate of heavy metals indeed an electrochemical pathway for the catalytic oxidation of mn ii on the ferrihydrite surface was proposed in our recent work lan et al 2017 given that mn oxides derived from the catalytic oxidation of mn ii are active in the oxidation of as iii the latter process will occur in ferrihydrite mn ii systems in which mn oxides are formed through the fe oxide catalyzed oxidation of mn ii by o2 although the promoting role of mn ii on as iii oxidation has been reported ren et al 2013 han et al 2016 sun et al 1999 the underlying mechanism of the coupled mn ii and as iii oxidation reaction and the electron transfer pathway for as removal in the fe mn binary system remain unknown in addition the mn oxides formed via the oxidation of mn ii on fe oxides tend to be regarded as the active oxidants responsible for as iii oxidation ren et al 2013 han et al 2016 however an in situ determination of the intermediate products of mn ii oxidation has yet to be carried out thereby rendering this hypothesis still speculative thus we herein focus on the coupled oxidation of as iii and mn ii in the presence of ferrihydrite through examination of the interactions taking place between the fe oxide mn ii binary system and as iii in addition to examining the underlying reaction mechanisms involved kinetic experiments combined with in situ horizontal attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy hatr ftir and quick scanning x ray absorption spectroscopy q xas are employed to monitor the real time changes in as and mn speciation in addition to the number of mn oxide equivalents produced during as iii oxidation in the presence of ferrihydrite mn ii in addition the final mn ii oxidation products are identified by x ray diffraction xrd and mn k edge x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy xanes for detailed procedures please see the supplementary information si text s1 to explore the interaction taking place during as iii and mn ii oxidation on the ferrihydrite surface we aim to reveal the as iii oxidation mechanisms taking place in the ferrihydrite mn ii system with the purpose of developing a novel economical pathway to reduce the toxicity of as iii and to efficiently immobilize the generated as v 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of ferrihydrite 2lfh ferrihydrite was synthesized according to a method described by wang et al 2013 the cleaned ferrihydrite was then freeze dried ground passed through a 60 mesh sieve and stored at 4 c xrd analysis see below confirmed that the obtained product was present as a single pure phase fig s1 and the specific surface area was determined to be 292 m2 g 1 taken from 5 points using the brunauer emmett teller method all experiments described below were conducted in the absence of light to avoid the possible photochemical oxidation of mn ii and as iii 2 2 as iii oxidation in the presence and absence of ferrihydrite or mn ii under a range of conditions ferrihydrite 0 5 g was dispersed in deionized water 100 ml by sonication over 5 min in a 250 ml reaction vessel after which the desired quantities of mn ii and as iii solutions detailed preparation procedures for the as iii and mn ii stock solution are provided in the si text s2 were added to give a total reaction volume of 150 ml and final mn ii and as iii concentrations of 24 and 1 mm the reaction was then allowed to proceed at ph 7 and 25 c with an o2 flow rate of 0 15 m3 h 1 over 8 h under stirring using a potentiometric titration system metrohm 907 system a the apparatus employed in this experiment is shown in fig s2 during the reaction aliquots 3 0 ml of the suspension were sampled at the desired time intervals and filtered immediately using 0 22 μm membrane filters the obtained wet paste was then dried at 40 c in a vacuum drying oven and the filtrates were prepared for analysis of the mn ii concentration by atomic absorption spectrometry aas varian aas 240fs and for determination of the as v concentration using the molybdate blue colorimetric method with a detection limit of 20 μg l 1 lenoble et al 2003 dhar et al 2004 detailed analytical methods of as and mn speciation can be found in the si text s3 the quantity of oxidized as iii on the mineral surfaces i e the as v content generated on the mineral surfaces i e as v surface was obtained by instantly dissolving the dried sample 3 mg either in 1 m h2so4 3 ml or in a mixture of 1 m h2so4 3 ml and 10 mass ratio hydroxylamine hydrochloride 0 5 ml if there were any mn oxides produced on or existed with ferrihydrite mn oxide production was determined using the leucoberbelin blue lbb colorimetric method lan et al 2017 krumbein and altmann 1973 francis et al 2001 h2so4 and a solution of hydroxylamine hydrochloride were employed to dissolve the ferrihydrite and any existing or produced manganese oxides respectively in addition the as iii contents both in solution and on the mineral surfaces were determined by atomic fluorescence spectroscopy afs 9700 beijing haiguang instrument co ltd detailed measurement procedures can be found in the si text s3 furthermore pyrophosphate pp was added to a similar reaction system to determine the possible generation of mn iii during the reaction and specific details can be found in fig s12 the final products obtained from the ferrihydrite mn ii as iii systems were then washed with deionized water vacuum dried at 40 c and characterized by xrd furthermore three control experiments were conducted in the absence of ferrihydrite and or mn ii to examine the oxidation efficiency of as iii in the following systems 1 the as iii o2 system 2 the mn ii as iii o2 system and 3 the ferrihydrite as iii o2 system the control experiments indicated that the dissolution reaction did not cause significant as iii oxidation by ferrihydrite in the open system fig 1 b a 1 mm solution of as iii was also oxidized in ferrihydrite mn ii system in the presence of tert butyl alcohol tba dimethyl sulfoxide dmso or under a n2 atmosphere to replace o2 to examine the respective effects of tba dmso or n2 on as iii oxidation in the ferrihydrite mn ii system and to reveal the detailed mechanisms of as iii oxidation in system a to explore the role of mn ii in the as iii oxidation process the total mn iii iv oxides produced during the reaction were detected instantly using the method described by lan et al 2017 in this case the number of equivalents of the produced mn oxides was calculated from the number of moles of transferred electrons upon reduction to mn ii by lbb for example 1 mm mn iv oxides and 1 mm kmn vii o4 are equivalent to 2 and 5 mm mn iii oxides respectively in addition in situ hatr ftir spectroscopy was employed to measure the adsorption oxidation of as iii on the ferrihydrite surface both in the presence and absence of mn ii detailed methods and procedures are described in the si text s4 2 3 as iii oxidation in the presence of ferrihydrite and pre formed mn oxides to compare the differences in as iii oxidation in the mixture of ferrihydrite and mn oxides with that in the ferrihydrite mn ii system system a two comparable experiments were conducted using pre formed mn oxides i e system b and system c in the case of system b a 24 mm solution of mn ii was firstly oxidized in the presence of ferrihydrite 0 5 g at ph 7 with an o2 flow rate of 0 15 m3 h 1 over 8 h total reaction volume 150 ml and the final products were washed with deionized water and vacuum dried at 40 c to remove any residual mn ii the dried products were then dispersed in deionized water and mixed with an as iii solution to give an initial as iii concentration of 1 mm and a final volume of 150 ml subsequently the oxidation of as iii was allowed to proceed in this suspension at ph 7 for 8 h in the open system without extra o2 supply in contrast for system c a 1 mm solution of as iii was oxidized in a suspension containing 0 3 g birnessite and 0 5 g ferrihydrite at ph 7 for 8 h in the open system without extra o2 supply where the calculated initial mn concentration was 24 mm and the total volume was 150 ml the as v concentrations in solution were detected as described above for system b and system c it should also be noted that no additional o2 was employed either in system b or system c to avoid the possible significant catalytic oxidation process of mn ii as small quantities of mn ii will be generated during as iii oxidation by the pre formed mn oxides it would be expected that in the presence of additional o2 the catalytic re oxidation of mn ii would mask the contribution of ferrihydrite mn ii o2 and pre formed mn oxides upon as iii oxidation 2 4 as iii oxidation at different ph values and different molar ratios of mn ii as iii to explore the effects of both ph and the mn ii as iii molar ratio on as iii oxidation as iii oxidation experiments were performed in the presence of 0 5 g ferrihydrite mn ii at a range of ph values i e 12 mm mn ii and 1 mm as iii at ph 5 6 7 8 or 9 at ph 7 with different as iii concentrations i e 12 mm mn ii mn ii as iii molar ratio 3 6 12 or 24 and at ph 7 with different mn ii concentrations i e 1 mm as iii mn ii as iii molar ratio 1 2 6 12 or 24 at 25 c over 8 h with an o2 flow rate of 0 15 m3 h 1 the as v contents in solution and on the mineral surfaces were then determined using the method described above in addition the intermediate mn iii iv oxides produced during the reaction i e reaction systems containing 12 mm mn ii and 1 mm as iii at ph 5 7 8 and 9 were detected in real time mode finally the quantities of oxidation products produced from 12 mm mn ii in the ferrihydrite suspension in the absence of as iii at ph 5 7 8 and 9 were also measured to compare the extent of mn ii oxidation in the absence and presence of as iii 2 5 in situ quick as and mn k edge xas spectroscopy to explore the speciation changes of as iii and mn ii during the oxidation of 100 mg l 1 as iii in the presence of 0 5 g ferrihydrite and 24 mm mn ii with an o2 flow rate of 0 08 m3 h 1 in situ q xas was employed during the reaction the experimental procedures employed were close to those reported previously ginder vogel et al 2009 and are described as follows the mn and as k edge xas spectra were collected at 25 c at the 1w1b beamline of the beijing synchrotron radiation facility in fluorescence mode the suspension 150 ml was reacted in a 250 ml plastic beaker with a 10 60 mm slit sealed with kapton film close to the bottom upon commencement of the oxidation reaction the mn k edge xas or as k edge xas spectra were collected between 6 35 and 7 2 kev and between 11 85 and 11 95 kev respectively during the 8 h reaction the ph was maintained at ph 7 by titration of a 1 m naoh solution each individual scan duration was 301 ms and each spectrum was completed within 1 2 min the athena program was used for background removal and linear combination fittings lcf to quantify the speciation variations for mn and as ginder vogel et al 2009 2 6 xrd characterization all final products were analyzed by xrd using a bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer equipped with a lynxeye detector and using ni filtered cu kα radiation λ 0 15418 nm bruker axs gmbh karlsruhe germany the diffractometer was operated at a tube voltage of 40 kv and a tube current of 40 ma the xrd patterns were collected at a step size of 0 02 using a scan rate of 1 min 1 for the final products and 10 min 1 for the intermediate products 3 results and discussion 3 1 as iii oxidation in the ferrihydrite mn ii and ferrihydrite mn iii iv oxide systems the hatr ftir spectra of the interactions between as iii as v and the ferrihydrite surface are shown in figs s3a and s3b where the absorption band at 782 cm 1 corresponds to as iii fig s3a and those at 825 and 876 cm 1 are attributed to as v fig s3b in the case where as iii coexists with mn ii fig 1a the bands at 825 and 876 cm 1 gradually appear and become stronger with time indicating an increase in as iii oxidation on the ferrihydrite surface in contrast the intensity of the band at 782 cm 1 initially increases later decreasing as the reaction progresses thereby suggesting initial as iii adsorption followed by oxidation the percentages of the total produced as v in the different reaction systems over time were determined to obtain the dominant factors responsible for as iii oxidation fig 1b in the homogeneous system almost no as iii oxidation occurs even in the presence of both o2 and mn ii while in the presence of ferrihydrite trace amounts of as iii oxidation are observed likely due to the effect of light during sampling bhandari et al 2011 2012 however in the presence of both ferrihydrite and mn ii the as iii oxidation percentage gradually increases and reaches 100 within 8 h in contrast little as iii oxidation takes place under the equivalent conditions in a n2 atmosphere these results therefore indicate that the mineral ferrihydrite surface mn ii and o2 are all essential to promote as iii oxidation significantly in the absence of light a potential synergistic effect between these three components may therefore exist and contribute to the significant as iii oxidation this will be discussed in further detail below to further confirm the effects of mn ii on the oxidation of as iii in the presence of ferrihydrite system a system b and system c which contain pre existing mn oxides were examined for comparison as indicated in fig 2 a the initial extent of as iii oxidation i e total as v total as 0 240 min follows the order system c system b system a which could be attributed to the rapid direct oxidation of the pre existing mn iii iv oxides on as iii in system c and system b in comparison to the relatively lower initial rate of mn ii oxidation in system a fig 1c in contrast the final as iii oxidation percentages follow the order system a system c system b fig 2a after 420 min which indicates the stronger catalytic activity of mn ii on the oxidation of as iii in system a compared to the activities of the pre existing mn iii iv oxides in system c and system b furthermore the extent of as iii oxidation in system c is significantly higher than that of system b which may be attributed to the much stronger oxidizing capability of birnessite on as iii compared to the mn iii oxides formed through the catalytic oxidation of mn ii on ferrihydrite moreover the percentages of as v surface total as display a similar trend to those of the total as v content fig 2b while the as v solution total as percentages present the opposite trend i e system a system b system c fig 2c this indicates that both the as iii catalytic oxidation and as v immobilization capacities of the pre existing mn oxides in the presence of ferrihydrite i e system b and system c are lower than those of the 2lfh mn ii as iii system moreover the as v content in the solution of system c gradually decreases after an initial sharp increase fig 2c which is likely due to the direct oxidation of as iii by birnessite accompanied with an immediate release of large quantities of newly generated as v into solution at the beginning of the reaction and subsequent gradual adsorption of the released as v on the ferrihydrite surface these results therefore suggest that as iii oxidation in the 2lfh mn ii as iii system is not only a simple direct oxidation by the newly formed mn oxides originating from ferrihydrite catalyzed mn ii oxidation but that it displays apparently higher efficiencies of as iii oxidation and as v retention we therefore expect that as iii oxidation in the ferrihydrite mn ii system may follow a different reaction mechanism compared to the systems containing ferrihydrite and pre existing mn oxides 3 2 effect of as iii on the adsorption oxidation of mn ii on ferrihydrite to explore the role of mn ii in the as iii oxidation process the mn ii oxidation degree and mn ii removal extent from the solution were determined at different reaction intervals fig 1c and d in the absence of as iii the number of intermediate mn oxide equivalents increases gradually with reaction time which is consistent with the variation in percentages of the total as v produced via as iii oxidation in the 2lfh mn ii as iii system fig 1c suggesting that as iii oxidation may follow a similar oxidation pathway to that of mn ii in addition the removal of mn ii from the solution increases significantly in the absence of as iii fig 1d suggesting the formation of large quantities of mn oxides davies and morgan 1989 wang et al 2015 lan et al 2017 however in the presence of as iii the number of mn oxide equivalents almost remains constant at relatively low levels throughout the reaction fig 1c and little aqueous mn ii is removed fig 1d thereby indicating that as iii oxidation inhibits the formation of mn iii iv oxides and mn ii removal furthermore in the presence of as iii the xrd patterns of the final products also show few diffraction peaks corresponding to the mn iii iv oxides with the exception of some minor signals that could be attributed to hausmannite mn3o4 fig s4 in contrast in the absence of as iii large quantities of mn iii oxides including manganite γ mnooh feitknechtite β mnooh and groutite α mnooh were formed fig s4 moreover the minimal consumption of mn ii during as iii oxidation suggests that mn ii may mainly serve as an electron transfer mediator during its catalysis on the as iii oxidation process 3 3 effect of ph on as iii oxidation in the ferrihydrite mn ii system as shown in fig 3 the percentages of total as v total as fig 3a and as v surface total as fig 3b both increase upon increasing the ph from 5 to 9 which corresponds to an increase in mn ii oxidation degree with increasing ph wang et al 2015 more specifically at ph 8 and 9 as iii oxidation is rapid within the first 60 min and then almost approaches an reaction equilibrium however the quantities of as v produced in solution at all ph values are significantly lower than those on the ferrihydrite surface fig 3c in addition the percentages of as v solution total as at ph 5 are slightly higher than those at ph 6 7 and 8 fig 3c which may be due to the favorable formation of the ho radical at ph 5 xu et al 2013 moreover at ph 9 the percentages of as v solution total as are significantly higher than at other ph values and gradually increase with time we propose that the presence of higher quantities of residual as v in solution at ph 9 is likely due to three key points 1 the highest as iii oxidation is present at ph 9 which indicates that the greatest quantity of as v is left in solution 2 the formation of large quantities of mn iii iv oxides blocks the adsorption sites on the ferrihydrite surface thereby decreasing as v adsorption tani et al 2004 ren et al 2013 and 3 the adsorption of as v onto the mineral i e ferrihydrite surface is more unfavorable at high ph values compared to the adsorption of as iii dixit and hering 2003 which leads to the release of newly formed as v from the mineral surface into solution furthermore almost no mn ii removal was observed at ph 5 6 and 7 fig 3d indicating the formation of small quantities of mn oxides fig s5 in contrast at ph 8 mn ii removal increases gradually reaching 100 removal by the end of the reaction however no obvious diffraction peaks corresponding to mn oxides were observed by xrd fig s5 which is likely due to the formation of amorphous mn phases fig s6 moreover at ph 9 all mn ii was removed within 30 min fig 3d with buserite δ mno2 hydrated birnessite rather than mn iii oxides i e feitknechtite appearing in the final products fig s5 the number of equivalents of mn oxides observed at different ph values i e 5 7 9 both in the presence and in the absence of as iii reveals further details regarding the as iii oxidation process fig 4 interestingly all growth curves of the formed mn iii iv oxides derived from mn ii oxidation catalyzed by the ferrihydrite surface in the absence of as iii display a similar trend to those of the as iii oxidation percentages over a range of ph values figs 3a and 4a in addition at ph 5 neither mn ii nor as iii oxidation occurs figs 3a 4a and b suggesting that as iii oxidation may be inseparable from mn ii oxidation in contrast at ph 7 mn iii oxides such as groutite and manganite form in the absence of as iii while few mn oxides were observed in the presence of as iii fig 4a and c indicating that the formation of mn iii oxides is inhibited by as iii oxidation however at ph 9 although mn ii oxidation is suppressed by the presence of as iii large amounts of mn oxides still formed fig 4a and d fig 4d also shows that the suppression of mn oxide formation by as iii oxidation is observed mainly for the mn iii oxides i e feitknechtite as the mn iv oxides i e buserite were still observed in this case fig s7 furthermore based on the assumption that all formed mn oxides are mn iii oxides the number of equivalents of formed mn oxides at ph 9 exceeds the initial mn ii concentration of 12 mm at 60 min fig 4a thereby implying the formation of mn iv phases meanwhile the corresponding rapid as iii oxidation was almost complete at 60 min fig 3a which is consistent with the kinetics of mn ii oxidation fig 4a implying that the majority of as iii oxidation 76 occurred mainly during the initial 60 min of the reaction moreover the difference in mn oxide equivalents obtained from the different systems in the presence and absence of as iii at ph 9 remains relatively constant over time which may be ascribed to the decreasing amount of feitknechtite formed in the presence of as iii fig 4d therefore the as iii oxidation taking place in system a may mainly be associated with the newly formed mn iii species rather than with the mn iv oxides that are capable of directly oxidizing as iii 3 4 effect of the mn ii as iii molar ratio on as iii oxidation in the ferrihydrite mn ii system as shown in fig 5 a and fig s8a although the oxidation of as iii is enhanced upon increasing the mn ii concentration the content of as v formed in the solution is particularly low fig s8b this indicates that as iii oxidation occurs mainly on the ferrihydrite surface and that the formed as v is primarily adsorbed on the mineral surfaces in addition fig 5b and fig s9 suggest that as iii oxidation is enhanced upon decreasing the as iii concentration implying that as iii oxidation is promoted at higher mn ii as iii molar ratios indeed as shown in fig 5c a positive linear correlation is observed since as iii oxidation depends on the pre oxidation degree of mn ii on ferrihydrite fig 4 relatively high as iii concentrations would result in competition between the adsorption of as iii and mn ii on ferrihydrite thus affecting the initial degree of mn ii oxidation on the mineral surface and inhibiting the coupled as iii oxidation process 3 5 in situ quick as and mn k edge xas spectroscopy as shown in fig 6 the as xas spectra gradually shift to higher energies upon increasing the reaction time suggesting an increase in as v formation fig 6b in addition lcf fitting shows that the percentage of as v gradually increases to 35 after 8 h fig 6a which is consistent with the trend of mn ii oxidation in the absence of as iii fig 6c moreover the percentage of mn ii oxidized reaches 89 in the absence of as iii while only 10 oxidation was achieved in the presence of as iii fig 6c and d and fig s10 indicating that as iii oxidation significantly inhibits the formation of mn iii iv oxides and in particular the mn iii oxides these results therefore suggest that the mn iii species formed via the catalytic oxidation of mn ii on ferrihydrite may rapidly participate in as iii oxidation before crystallization of the mn iii oxides can take place 3 6 adsorption oxidation mechanisms of as iii in the presence of ferrihydrite and mn ii previous studies have indicated that ferrihydrite can promote mn ii oxidation and lead to the formation of various mn iii iv oxides wang et al 2015 which can directly oxidize as iii to as v zhu et al 2009 wu 2014 in this case the presence of mn ii significantly promotes as iii oxidation in the ferrihydrite suspension which exhibits a higher degree of as iii oxidation than systems containing mn iii iv oxides prior to as iii oxidation fig 2 although it was commonly believed that mn oxide minerals derived from mn ii oxidation under iron oxide catalysis are mainly responsible for as iii oxidation in the iron oxide as iii mn ii systems ren et al 2013 in our experiments we observed the formation of small quantities of mn oxides and in particular mn iii oxides through mn ii oxidation in the presence of as iii figs 1c d 4 and 6 in addition as the as adsorption capacity of iron oxides is larger than that of mn oxides zhang et al 2014 the mn oxides formed on the ferrihydrite surface may cover the adsorption sites ren et al 2012 2013 thereby reducing both as iii oxidation and as v adsorption this also accounts for the reduced as iii oxidation and additional as v present in the suspensions in system b and system c compared to system a fig 2c in contrast the quantity of as v produced in solution in the ferrihydrite mn ii system is negligible fig 2c and fig 3c due to the high adsorption capacity of ferrihydrite and the limited formation of mn oxides this differs from the systems containing pre existing mn oxides as the mn iii iv oxides would occupy the sorption sites thereby inhibiting as v adsorption and resulting in the release of adsorbed as v back into the solution moreover we found that the coexistence of ferrihydrite mn ii and o2 is essential to promote as iii oxidation figs 1 and 4 suggesting that the oxidation of as iii is indeed closely associated with the ferrihydrite catalyzed pre oxidation of mn ii in addition although as iii oxidation requires the participation of o2 as a potential terminal electron acceptor fig s11 the process of as iii oxidation via ho at ph 7 is negligible in the ferrihydrite mn ii o2 system fig s11 moreover as iii oxidation leads mainly to the disappearance of the newly formed mn iii oxides rather than mn iv oxides in the ferrihydrite mn ii systems figs 4 and 6 figs s4 and s7 this implies that the oxidation of as iii may be mainly driven by an instantaneous intermediate mn iii species with a strong oxidation ability formed via mn ii oxidation figs 1c d 3 4 and 6 as outlined in fig s12 in addition as iii oxidation by any newly formed mn iii iv oxides may also take place but this would be expected to play only a minor role in this reaction system furthermore density functional theory dft calculations also indicated that the electron transfer rate between mn iii and as iii is slower than that between mn iv and as iii and that the mn iv sites exhibit a stronger adsorption affinity than the mn iii sites for both as iii and as v zhu et al 2009 therefore the above mentioned mn iii species may lose its high reactivity following crystallization into mn iii oxides it has been proposed that the similar short lived highly reactive mn iii species can be formed through various pathways such as the reduction of mn vii in the permanganate bisulfite pm bs process sun et al 2015 2016 the oxidation of mn ii provided by fresh plant litter at sites of active decay keiluweit et al 2015 or the ligand stabilization of mn oxidation intermediates wang and giammar 2015 in this case we determined that the transient intermediate mn iii species is formed through catalytic mn ii oxidation on the ferrihydrite surface which is widely abundant in the environment the resulting mn iii species can rapidly oxidize as iii and regenerate mn ii simultaneously thereby maintaining the mn ii concentration relatively constant figs 1c and d 3 4 and 6 indeed particularly low quantities of mn iii oxides were detected during as iii oxidation figs 1c 4a and 6d figs s4 s5 and s7 as the generation of the intermediate mn iii species mainly depends on mn ii oxidation catalyzed by the mineral surface wang et al 2015 chernyshova et al 2011 junta and hochella 1994 lan et al 2017 it is apparent that as iii oxidation by the intermediate mn iii species also takes place mainly on the ferrihydrite surface fig s13a thereby leading to the adsorption of the majority of produced as v on the mineral surface in addition fig s13b shows that all as iii is gradually adsorbed on the ferrihydrite surface over 60 min during which time the degree of as iii oxidation slowly increases fig 1b subsequently the quantity of as iii present on the ferrihydrite surface gradually decreases fig s13b accompanied by a rapid increase in the total as v total as ratio in the suspension fig 1b indicating that as iii oxidation takes place mainly on the ferrihydrite surface additionally since as iii oxidation relies on the pre oxidation of mn ii the growth curve of the as iii oxidation percentage displays a comparable trend to that of mn iii iv oxide formation derived from the ferrihydrite catalyzed mn ii oxidation in the absence of as iii figs 1c 6a and 6c the above results regarding the oxidation of as iii in a ferrihydrite mn ii suspension indicate that this transformation can be split into two key processes fig 7 firstly mn ii is oxidized to produce the transient mn iii intermediate a type of meta stable mn iii species at the ferrihydrite surface reaction ① secondly the mn iii intermediate species rapidly oxidizes as iii to as v by receiving electrons from as iii reaction ② simultaneously regenerating mn ii reaction ③ and maintaining a relatively constant mn ii concentration throughout the reaction furthermore our results confirm that the oxidation reactions occur mainly on the ferrihydrite surface thus the majority of formed as v is adsorbed on the mineral surface and little as v is released into solution reaction ④ in addition electron transfer between the as iii mn ii iii o2 species at the ferrihydrite surface could be fulfilled and promoted by an electrochemical pathway via the conduction band of the bulk ferrihydrite in addition to the conventional two interfacial pathways lan et al 2017 as such a more significant enhancement in as iii oxidation by mn ii is observed in the presence of a semiconducting mineral i e ferrihydrite compared to that observed in the presence of an insulator such as amorphous al oh 3 fig s14 3 7 environmental significance ferrihydrite is widely distributed in suboxic environments including groundwater stagnant water soils i e gleys pseudogleys and paddy soils cornell and schwertmann 2003 where mn ii and as iii could potentially coexist with o2 our results detailed above therefore provide a fundamental understanding of the electron transfer pathway that likely takes place between the as iii mn ii o2 species at the ferrihydrite surface present in the natural environments we also found that the metastable ligand free mn iii species were generated from the ferrihydrite catalyzed mn ii oxidation system and could act as an active environmental oxidant to participate in various biogeochemical redox processes in the presence of the appropriate reductants such as as iii as such our clarification of the detailed electron transfer mechanisms between the as iii mn ii iii o2 species at the ferrihydrite surface could aid in the development of a novel approach to the simultaneous oxidation of as iii and immobilization of the generated as v thereby reducing the toxicity and mobility of as iii v in contaminated soils and water bodies in addition the regeneration of mn ii during as iii oxidation renders it recyclable thereby reducing its consumption and giving a more environmentally friendly process finally the promotion effect of cr iii oxidation was also observed in the presence of ferrihydrite and aqueous mn ii fig s15 indicating that this fe oxide mn ii system may play an essential and widespread role in the mediation of other environmental redox reactions which deserve further investigation we also expect that these results could offer a practical basis to deal with the combined pollution caused by multiple hazardous ions such as as iii cr iii and mn ii 4 conclusions we herein explored the mechanism of as iii oxidation by dissolved o2 in the presence of ferrihydrite and mn ii using a kinetic approach combined with a range of spectroscopic techniques we found that upon the oxidation of as iii immobilization of the newly generated as v occurred efficiently on the ferrihydrite surface in the presence of aqueous mn ii more specifically the ferrihydrite catalyzed pre oxidation of mn ii resulted in rapid as iii oxidation which was further enhanced at higher ph values and higher mn ii as iii molar ratios in the reaction systems we also demonstrated that the ligand free mn iii intermediate species formed through the oxidation of mn ii by o2 under ferrihydrite catalysis acted as the main reactive oxidant for as iii oxidation furthermore the regeneration of mn ii during as iii oxidation rendered it recyclable thereby reducing its consumption and minimizing the effects of reactive site blockage on the ferrihydrite surface these results therefore provide a better understanding of the mechanism of as iii oxidation on the surfaces of fe oxides in the presence of aqueous mn ii and also the detailed electron transfer mechanisms taking place between the as iii mn ii iii o2 species hence we expect that they will lead to the development of novel approaches for as iii contaminant remediation in the

19871,this study investigated the impact of coagulation flocculation treatment on metal form and bioavailability in municipal wastewater real humus effluent samples were separated into particulate colloidal and truly dissolved fractions before and after treatment with either ferric chloride fecl3 or the biopolymer floculan results revealed that both reagents effectively 48 eliminated cu pb and zn from the particulate fraction and removed cu and zn from the colloidal fraction in conjunction with colloidal organic carbon coc although organics in the truly dissolved fraction were resistant to removal floculan reduced cu in this fraction by 72 owing to the complexation of free cu ions to phenol and amino groups along the polymeric chains revealing an additional removal pathway in fact coc removed in the cf process by floculan was replaced with truly dissolved compounds input as a result of this reagents organic composition floculan therefore reduced the soluble concentration of cu and zn without changing the doc concentration thus reducing the bioavailability of these metals in treated effluent fecl3 did not reduce the bioavailability of target metals thus did not deliver any environmental benefit this work provides important information for the selection and development of high performance coagulants to improve metal removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords particle fractions colloids wastewater bioavailability coagulation 1 introduction metals including cu pb ni and zn are commonly found in wastewater with discharges of these metals influencing the chemistry and biology of receiving waters with potentially toxic implications jaishankar et al 2014 regulatory drivers therefore typically require concentrations of these metals to be reduced in the wastewater treatment process within the european union the water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec has specified bioavailability based standards for pb and ni which are classified as priority hazardous substances in the united kingdom uk bioavailability based standards have also been specified for cu and zn uktag 2008 which are classified as specific pollutants under the wfd the concentration of metal that is bioavailable cannot easily be measured directly and consequently a predictive tool known as a biotic ligand model blm is used to convert a dissolved phase metal concentration to an equivalent bioavailable metal concentration blms require site specific information on physico chemical characteristics as inputs including the dissolved phase metal concentration ph dissolved organic carbon doc and hardness di toro et al 2001 in the united states us the clean water act specifies criteria maximum concentrations cmc and criterion continuous concentrations ccc for heavy metals to protect human health and aquatic life in surface water and the us environmental protection agency epa has already authorised the use of a blm to determine water quality criteria for cu usepa 2017 whilst improving environmental relevance bioavailability based standards are nevertheless expected to significantly reduce acceptable metal concentrations at a range of locations within the uk peters et al 2009 this prospect has raised concern because wastewater treatment works wwtws are traditionally designed to address problems of carbon contamination and nutrient enrichment rather than for trace metal elimination and studies have shown that metal removal rates vary considerably at wwtws gardner et al 2013 in order to achieve removal rates to comply with more stringent discharge quality requirements the development of novel wastewater treatment technologies is urgently required to enhance metal removal a large body of previous work indicates the relevance of understanding metal form throughout wastewater treatment for the selection of suitable technologies chipasa 2003 karvelas et al 2003 santos and judd 2010 analysis of metal form traditionally involves separation with a 0 45 μm filter a soluble fraction passes through the filter whilst particulates are retained on the filter i e 0 45 μm metals such as cu and pb are known to have a high affinity for the particulate fraction and thus can be removed as part of the wastewater treatment process by physical separation choubert et al 2011 in contrast ni and zn predominantly exist within the soluble fraction which potentially requires expensive and energy intensive processes such as adsorption or ion exchange for effective removal faced with the expectation of more stringent regulation treatment technologies which can simultaneously remove particulate and soluble metal from wastewater at low treatment cost are desired by wwtw operators soluble components can be separated into two further size fractions namely a colloidal fraction which is composed of material found in the size range 1 kda to 0 45 μm and a truly dissolved fraction which contains constituents with a molecular weight mw 1 kda worms et al 2010 metal distribution within the soluble fraction is influenced by the presence of functional groups ligands that may complex metal ions it has been reported that the distribution of metals between colloidal and truly dissolved fractions is greatly influenced by the distribution of doc within these same fractions worms et al 2010 organics found in the truly dissolved size fraction include humic substances amino acids carbohydrates hydrated metal ions and synthetic ligands such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta imai et al 2002 shon et al 2006 conversely organic material in the colloidal fraction is predominantly composed of macromolecules including aminosugars polysaccharides and proteins jarusutthirak et al 2002 in a recent study hargreaves et al 2017 a large proportion of cu pb ni and zn was observed to reside in the colloidal fraction of effluent and calculated molar ratios of metals to organic carbon indicated that a large proportion of these metals may be adsorbed to colloidal material or complexed with macromolecules present in the colloidal size fraction such findings suggest that technologies capable of removing organic materials within the colloidal size fraction could reduce the concentration of target metals cu pb ni and zn in effluent discharges one such technology is coagulation flocculation cf a widely used technique for the treatment of industrial effluent coagulation involves combining insoluble particles and dissolved matter into larger aggregates through the addition of chemical reagents renault et al 2009 aggregates are bonded together by flocculation which consists of a stirring agitation procedure that encourages particles to agglomerate thus allowing their removal in subsequent sedimentation and filtration phases renault et al 2009 mechanisms through which particulate and colloidal materials are aggregated and thus removed can involve a combination of adsorption entrapment charge neutralisation and complexation processes alexander et al 2012 and are dependent on the reagent used chemical reagents frequently applied in the cf process are metal salts such as ferric chloride fecl3 which aggregate particles by charge neutralisation and sweep flocculation duan and gregory 2003 fecl3 is commonly used to remove phosphorus from sewage effluents and studies have shown this reagent can enhance the removal of metals from combined sewer overflow el samrani et al 2008 but few studies have investigated application for the treatment of municipal wastewater on a global scale however waste management systems are under change with producer responsibility and consumer accountability driving the development of sustainable and eco friendly management systems zaman 2013 an increase in the awareness of the detrimental consequences that metal salts may have to the environment such as increasing non target metal concentrations in treated wastewater and significant alterations to the ph of treated water renault et al 2009 vijayaraghavan et al 2011 has resulted in ongoing investigations into alternatives tanfloc a tannin based product with a trademark belonging to tanac brazil has attracted attention because of its renewability biodegradability and its capacity to eliminate metals beltrán heredia and sánchez martín 2009 for example zeta potential measurements have showed the cationic nature of tanfloc and given the polymeric structure of this coagulant mechanisms of charge neutralisation and inter particle bridging are suggested to be involved in the cf process hameed et al 2016 floculan is a commercially available product which is composed of up to 30 tanfloc and is therefore a practical treatment option studies investigating the application of this reagent to municipal wastewater are however limited it is also noted that there is a scarcity of studies that assess the impact of cf on metal form and bioavailability within the effluent matrix specific information on the fate of metals following cf is needed to assess the benefits of this treatment technology and to provide key information on coagulant selection for the treatment of municipal wastewater effluents furthermore understanding the relationship between metal speciation and cf may help develop high performance reagents for future application to improve metal removal in wastewater treatment the aim of this study was therefore to investigate the impact of cf on metal forms particulate colloidal and truly dissolved fractions and bioavailability in municipal wastewater the study set out to compare the effect of the biopolymer floculan on metal removal and to compare that with the conventional coagulant fecl3 to further characterise the properties of coagulants and flocs produced from the treatment fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and scanning electron microscopy sem were used 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials nitric acid hno3 sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl were all obtained from fisher scientific loughborough uk and were of reagent grade plastic and glassware was kept in a 2 v v hno3 solution between uses and were rinsed with ultrapure water prior to use floculan was obtained from lansdowne chemicals oxon uk ferric chloride fecl3 solution 40 was provided by darrant chemicals lincoln uk 2 2 wastewater samples humus effluent samples were taken from a wwtws in the uk which operated the trickling filter treatment type and which serves an urban catchment population contributors to the metal load entering the works include diffuse sources such as urban run off metals corroded from the domestic water supply infrastructure and leaching of metal from household plumbing samples were collected on 8 occasions over a five month study period from october 2016 february 2017 with at least one collection each month samples were collected in 5 l plastic containers which had previously been rinsed with 0 01 m hcl and ultrapure water 0 05 μs conductivity level samples were transported to and were kept in a refrigerated environment 4 c at cranfield university laboratories prior to analysis 2 3 coagulation flocculation experiments to replicate the cf process phipps and bird jar test apparatus richmond united states was used plastic beakers rinsed with 0 01 m hcl and ultrapure water were filled with 1 l of humus effluent placed on the floc illuminator and once the coagulant dose was added were agitated at a fixed intensity 100 rpm and duration 2 min the coagulant dose was fixed at the optimum level established in a previous study by the authors herein 0 25 mg l for floculan and 0 10 mg l for fecl3 hargreaves et al unpublished results once rapid mixing finished the fixed intensity and duration of slow mixing 30 rpm for 30 min was immediately established after slow mixing the beakers were removed from the floc illuminator and were positioned in a safe place for 30 min allowing for sedimentation after sedimentation the supernatant was extracted from about 25 mm below the surface with a syringe for the first 3 humus effluent samples collected jar tests were conducted in duplicate for the additional five samples collected jar tests were conducted in triplicate therefore a total of 42 jars were treated with either fecl3 or floculan i e 21 jars for each coagulant for each sample collected a minimum of 1 beaker was processed through the jar test procedure outlined above without the addition of a coagulant and was therefore treated by stirring only this was used as the experimental control 2 4 particle size fractionation particle size fractionation of the samples was conducted following a variation of the method described by barker and stuckey 1999 to obtain the soluble phase samples were filtered through 0 45 μm polyethersulfone membranes millipore livingston uk by vacuum filtration apha 2005 regenerated cellulose membranes 1 kda millipore livingston uk were used to fractionate the samples

repeated after each use truly dissolved fractionations were undertaken using an amicon 8400 stirred pressure cell millipore livingston uk filtration was driven by nitrogen gas at a pressure of 160 kpa to limit concentration polarisation an integrated bar stirrer was operated and a filtrate retentate ratio of 0 4 was adopted 2 5 analytical methods the ph measurements were conducted with a jenway

inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms using a nexion 350d system perkin elmer beaconsfield uk the limit of detection for all the metals was 0 01 μg l prior to icp ms analysis samples were digested with a cem mars microwave cem buckingham uk in order to determine the total concentration of the target metals sample blanks were processed through the preparation and analytical procedures phase distributions were calculated as follows particulate total soluble colloidal soluble truly dissolved in effluent bioavailable metal concentrations were estimated by using the metal bioavailability assessment tool m bat wfd uktag 2014 dried flocs obtained after the coagulation flocculation process were examined under a fei xl30 sfeg scanning electron microscope cambridge uk to reveal the morphology of flocs produced by fecl3 and floculan the infrared absorption spectrum of coagulants suspended solids in the humus effluent and flocs in the treated effluent were obtained with a jasco 4100 fourier transform infrared spectrometer dunmow uk to characterise the molecular structure these analyses characterised the differences in flocs formed to evaluate the mechanisms of metal removal with fecl3 and floculan 2 6 data analysis statistical analysis of the obtained data was completed with the software package minitab 17 one way anova tests were performed to assess the differences in metal concentrations between fractions after treatment with either fecl3 or floculan pearson s correlation coefficient tests were used to express the relationship between the concentrations of metals and doc using guidance from evans 1996 correlation strength was determined to be weak 0 2 0 39 moderate 0 4 0 59 or strong 0 59 both tests were conducted with a level of significance p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 humus effluent characteristics the concentrations of target metals as well as sanitary determinands in the humus effluent are shown in table 1 in humus effluent the abundance of target metals in terms of total concentration was zn cu ni pb see table 1 other investigators gardner et al 2013 have observed similar relative abundances and metal concentrations at wwtws elsewhere in the united kingdom 3 2 impact of coagulation flocculation on doc in the cf process fecl3 removed a sizeable amount of doc 42 from humus effluent conversely overall removal of doc with floculan was negligible 1 table 1 as indicated by no significant p 0 589 change in the overall doc concentration fig 1 nevertheless in both cases significant p 0 001 removal of colloidal organic carbon coc was observed with removal rates of 61 and 37 recorded for fecl3 and floculan respectively organic constituents in the colloidal size range are composed of macromolecules such as amino sugars polysaccharides and proteins jarusutthirak et al 2002 in cf co precipitation of macro molecular substances in the colloidal size fraction is favoured due to their large number and variety of functional groups which enhances attachment to precipitates haberkamp et al 2007 in addition constituents with higher mw can readily overcome electrostatic repulsion to become adsorbed wang et al 2015 removal of macromolecular particles in the cf process was therefore anticipated and has been observed elsewhere in the treatment of secondary effluent with fecl3 haberkamp et al 2007 the concentration of doc in the truly dissolved fraction was not significantly changed following treatment with fecl3 fig 1 other studies imai et al 2002 shon et al 2006 have identified that the truly dissolved fraction is composed of free metal ions and low mw organic constituents this study therefore supports the findings of others michael kordatou et al 2015 by revealing that low mw organics are removed to a minor extent in the cf process removal of doc from the truly dissolved fraction was also negligible in cf with floculan in fact an increase in the concentration of doc in this fraction was observed following treatment 1 3 6 1 mg l fig 1 and was likely to result from the organic substances present in this reagent 3 3 distribution of metals in humus effluent the distribution of target metals within the particulate 0 45 μm colloidal 1 kda 0 45 μm and truly dissolved 1 kda fractions in humus effluent the experimental control and effluent treated with either fecl3 or floculan are presented in fig 2 in humus effluent a sizable proportion of cu 47 pb 61 ni 37 and zn 33 was distributed in the particulate fraction fig 2 the distribution of metals in this fraction and trend recorded i e pb cu ni zn were similar to that observed by hargreaves et al 2017 soluble cu 46 pb 29 ni 36 and zn 46 were predominantly distributed in the colloidal size fraction of the humus effluent whilst for all target metals distribution in the truly dissolved fraction was relatively low fig 2 other studies gagnon et al 2014 hargreaves et al 2017 have reported similar distributions in effluent 3 4 impact of coagulation flocculation on metal size distribution 3 4 1 copper with an initial total concentration of 19 1 3 7 μg l table 1 good overall rates of removal were observed for cu in cf with either fecl3 53 or floculan 81 high removals have been reported elsewhere for fecl3 cu 81 el samrani et al 2008 and plant based biopolymers cu 90 beltrán heredia and sánchez martín 2009 the result was therefore in line with expectations for the particulate fraction high removals were observed fecl3 60 floculan 70 as indicated by significantly lower cu concentrations in effluent treated with fecl3 or floculan p 0 001 fig 2a in fact particulate cu concentrations were similar in the treated effluents fecl3 3 6 2 μg l floculan 2 0 8 μg l suspended particles adsorb to the surface of flocs which are aggregated and removed in the cf process renault et al 2009 in addition the removal of particulate cu in conjunction with suspended particles has been reported in a previous study at the site hargreaves et al 2017 hence removal of particulate cu in the cf process was anticipated an appreciable amount of cu was also removed from the colloidal size fraction when treated with fecl3 61 or floculan 88 as indicated by significantly lower concentrations p 0 001 compared with initial humus effluent values in fact strong correlations were observed between colloidal cu and coc concentrations fecl3 r 0 704 p 0 001 floculan r 0 715 p 0 001 in treated effluent which indicates that removal of cu occurred in conjunction with the elimination of organics from the colloidal size fraction organic constituents in the colloidal size range include proteins polysaccharides and amino sugars jarusutthirak et al 2002 such substances are highly reactive regarding metal complexation due to their polyfunctional character and large binding site density worms et al 2010 results from the present study therefore indicate that technologies capable of removing organic particles within the colloidal fraction are capable of reducing soluble cu concentrations in effluent despite fecl3 achieving a higher rate of removal for coc fig 1 a significantly lower cu concentration was observed in the colloidal fraction of effluent treated with floculan p 0 001 fig 2a it was anticipated that this may arise since floculan has the ability to remove organic materials with functional groups that cu readily complexes with in fact other studies hameed et al 2016 have revealed that tanfloc the active ingredient in floculan contains carbonyl and amino functional groups these are indicative of polysaccharides and proteins that can play a significant role in the complexation of cu in effluent michael kordatou et al 2015 furthermore polysaccharides are the dominant material of extracellular polymers produced by microorganisms during biological wastewater treatment wang and wu 2009 thus were anticipated to be a prominent colloidal organic constituent in the humus effluent in cf with fecl3 removal of cu from the truly dissolved fraction was negligible see fig 2a thus fecl3 did not affect the cu found within this fraction studies imai et al 2002 shon et al 2006 have revealed that the truly dissolved fraction is comprised of free metal ions and organic constituents including carbohydrates and amino acids which metals may adsorb to or complex with given that organic materials distributed in the truly dissolved fraction were revealed to be resistant to removal fig 1 negligible removal of metals associated to them can be expected nevertheless floculan reduced the concentration of cu in the truly dissolved fraction by 72 from 1 4 to 0 4 μg l fig 2a it was therefore assumed that a further removal mechanism was involved in cf with floculan floculan is a biopolymer composed of polymeric chains along which functional groups including phenolic and amino groups are found free cu ions have a high affinity for these functional groups lu and allen 2002 hamza et al 2017 so it was anticipated that in cf with floculan complexation of free cu ions with these functional groups occurred resulting in a lower cu concentration in the truly dissolved fraction after treatment fig 2a 3 4 2 lead and zinc sizeable amounts of pb and zn were removed from humus effluent in the cf process see table 1 such findings were expected as other researchers have reported that fecl3 johnson et al 2008 and biopolymers kazemipour et al 2008 were effective for the removal of pb and zn from synthetic wastewater the residual concentrations of pb and zn were comparable for fecl3 and floculan fig 2b and d respectively significant p 0 001 removal of pb occurred from the particulate fraction in cf with either fecl3 89 or floculan 83 fig 2b lead was predominantly distributed in the particulate fraction of humus effluent fig 2 and when in this form it is known to be removed in conjunction with suspended particles hargreaves et al 2017 hence such finding was in line with expectations in the case of zn the respective removals from the particulate fraction for fecl3 and floculan were 42 and 35 fig 2d as indicated by significantly lower concentrations following treatment p 0 05 nonetheless zn removals were lower than those observed for cu fecl3 60 floculan 70 and pb fecl3 89 floculan 83 as a relatively low proportion of zn was distributed in the particulate fraction of humus effluent such trend in metal removal from the particulate fraction supports the findings of other studies at wwtws elsewhere karvelas et al 2003 as fig 2d shows a large proportion of zn in the colloidal size fraction was eliminated after cf with fecl3 48 and floculan 54 moderate correlations fecl3 r 0 461 p 0 035 floculan r 0 509 p 0 006 were observed between colloidal zn and coc concentrations indicating that as for cu zn was eliminated in conjunction with coc other studies louis et al 2014 constantino et al 2015 have indicated specific ultraviolet absorbance suva to be a poor predictor of zn complexation capacity which suggests that macromolecules distributed in the colloidal size fraction may be significant for the binding of zn ions in effluent nevertheless removal rates in the colloidal fraction were much lower for zn fecl3 48 floculan 54 compared with cu fecl3 61 floculan 88 this was anticipated to result from the adverse impact of alternate competing soluble metals at municipal wwtws effluent contains a large number of metallic species beyond those tested in this study for example ca and mg hence a highly competitive process occurs between metal ions and binding sites in effluent metal ions compete with each other for complex formation and thus stability constants provide information on adsorption equilibria turhanen et al 2015 the conditional stability constants for zn with dissolved organic matter were revealed to be lower than that of cu in effluent at municipal wwtws chaminda et al 2013 zinc may therefore be more readily displaced at the surface of binding sites by competing soluble metals and such behaviour has been supported by the findings of others for example zhao et al 1999 revealed that ca and mg may have a negative effect on the removal of zn via competitive sorption to binding sites on the surface of biomass in contrast it has been reported that even in the presence of high ca and mg concentrations cu may be capable of binding to complexing agents turhanen et al 2015 thus cu can readily outcompete other metals for binding sites on the surface of colloidal organic compounds which were removed in the cf process the difference between the concentration of colloidal pb in humus effluent 0 3 0 1 μg l and that observed in humus effluent treated with fecl3 0 2 0 1 μg l or floculan 0 1 0 1 μg l was negligible furthermore no significant change p 0 05 in the concentration of zn and pb in the truly dissolved fraction was observed fig 2b and d these findings indicate that fecl3 and floculan had little or no effect on the truly dissolved pb and zn 3 4 3 nickel the concentration of ni in the humus effluent was not reduced following treatment with either fecl3 or floculan see fig 4c ni is highly soluble in wastewater with a sizeable proportion 27 of ni distributed in the truly dissolved fraction of humus effluent fig 2c and because of its thermodynamic properties i e slow rate of reaction low stability constant its removal in the cf process is low especially compared with cu pb and zn see table 1 similar removal trends have been observed elsewhere in conventional wastewater treatment processes karvelas et al 2003 a substantial increase in the concentration of ni was observed in cf with fecl3 which was attributed to impurities in this reagent other studies buzier et al 2006 chys et al 2013 have reported that fecl3 contains substantial amounts of ni and contributes toward the presence of this metal in treated effluent in this study ni concentrations in the truly dissolved fraction were significantly increased by 72 p 0 001 after addition of fecl3 this is of concern as this fraction is considered the most bioavailable to aquatic life gagnon et al 2014 therefore when used in wastewater treatment fecl3 may pose a risk to receiving watercourse ecology 3 5 impact of coagulation flocculation on metal bioavailability the bioavailable concentrations of target metals in humus effluent the experimental control and effluent treated with either fecl3 or floculan are presented in fig 3 in order to calculate bioavailable metal concentrations blms account for the interaction of trace metals with doc which contains a variety of ligands that bind metal ions thereby reducing their ability to interact with organisms thus increasing the doc concentration significantly reduces the bioavailability of the metal at low metal doc ratios there is an excess of complexation capacity so that free metal ion activity is reduced doig and liber 2007 for example pernet coudrier et al 2008 reported that cu toxicity towards daphnia magna was reduced in the presence of dissolved organic matter derived from wastewater treated effluent more recently a study by constantino et al 2017 demonstrated that effluent derived doc offers a relatively greater complexation capacity per milligram of doc in comparison with doc obtained from natural sources as seen in fig 1 coc removed in the cf process by floculan was replaced with truly dissolved compounds as a result of the organic nature of this reagent floculan was therefore able to reduce the soluble concentration of cu 86 pb 56 and zn 45 without significantly p 0 589 reducing the concentration of doc in treated effluent fig 1 thus a significant reduction in the concentration of bioavailable cu p 0 001 pb p 0 001 and zn p 0 001 was observed fig 3a b and d respectively these findings indicate that floculan was capable of simultaneously reducing the concentration and bioavailability of these metals in treated effluent the environmental benefit of utilising floculan should therefore be considered in decision making on municipal wastewater treatment the bioavailable ni concentration was unchanged p 0 101 following treatment with floculan fig 3c in cf with fecl3 a sizeable amount of doc 42 was removed table 1 therefore despite the ability to remove modest amounts of soluble cu 51 pb 54 and zn 31 from effluent table 1 no significant reduction was observed in the bioavailable metal concentration following treatment as shown in fig 3 panels a b and d respectively p 0 05 these findings indicate that fecl3 had no environmental benefit with regards to the toxicity of metals in effluent furthermore an increase in the concentration of ni coupled with doc removal significantly increased the bioavailability of ni in effluent treated with fecl3 p 0 001 fig 3c based on these results cf with fecl3 may not be recommended for application in wastewater treatment for the removal of trace metals from municipal wastewater the ph of effluent is also a component input into blms nevertheless the difference in the ph of effluent treated with fecl3 and floculan was not substantial see table 1 and was therefore unlikely to have significantly influenced the bioavailability of the residual metal 3 6 characterisation of flocs 3 6 1 structural characteristics features observed in fig a1 were representative of fecl3 0 81 fdm library match score on the other hand the spectrum generated for floculan see fig 4 a showed bands representative of organic compounds peaks were assigned in accordance with their respective wavenumbers cm 1 as reported in literature a broad stretching peak around 3010 cm 1 was a combined effect of oh and nh groups hameed et al 2016 the occurrence of stretching vibrations over a broad range of frequencies indicated the presence of bonded oh bands of carboxylic acids and free hydroxyl groups gnanasambandam and proctor 2000 peaks at 1599 and 1458 cm 1 indicated the presence of asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of ionic carboxylic groups coo iqbal et al 2009 the aliphatic acid group vibration at 1227 cm 1 can be assigned to deformation vibration of co and stretching formation of oh groups of carboxylic acids and phenols guibaud et al 2003 the effect of bending of co group was shown at the peak 1092 cm 1 hameed et al 2016 it is well indicated from ftir spectrum of floculan that hydroxyl carboxyl and amino groups were present and such groups could be involved in coordination with metal ions fig 4 also includes the ftir spectra of suspended solids from the humus effluent and flocs produced after cf treatment the spectra of the suspended solids from humus effluent see fig 4b exhibited a broad band at 3254 cm 1 which represents oh functional groups and oh stretching of polymeric compounds major bands at the wavelengths 2979 and 2888 cm 1 correspond to ch bonds of aliphatic acids farinella et al 2007 the band at 1645 cm 1 corresponds to the cc stretching that is associated with cc bonds and coo asymmetric stretching s farinella et al 2007 the peak at 1387 cm 1 represents aliphatic group vibration and coo symmetric stretching pavia et al 1996 whilst the band at 1076 cm 1 is indicative of the co group farinella et al 2007 the ftir spectrum for flocs formed by floculan see fig 4c shared similar peak locations with the dried humus effluent suspension fig 4a with bands around 3254 2979 1387 and 1076 cm 1 observed in both spectra such findings indicate that the polymeric chains within this reagent were capable of bridging organic molecules present in humus effluent together incorporating them in flocs formed although floculan contributed to the spectrum introducing the peak which appeared at 1247 cm 1 carboxylic acids and phenols the spectrum overall appears representative of the material collected from the humus effluent this is not surprising given that floculan itself fig 4a has similar structural characteristics compared with the dried humus effluent suspension fig 4c conversely the ftir spectrum for flocs produced by fecl3 see fig 4d was strongly affected by this coagulant s chemistry reduced intensity of the peak around 2979 and 2888 cm 1 indicated suppression of non charged components in addition peaks at 3254 1645 and 1076 cm 1 shifted to 3232 1631 and 1007 cm 1 respectively these shifts may be attributed to adsorbed carbohydrates or polysaccharide like constituents gu et al 1994 this indicates that complexation between co functional groups of suspended humus effluent particles and the surface of ferric hydroxide precipitates occurred hence the removal of particles in a growing hydroxide precipitate known as sweep flocculation duan and gregory 2003 played an important role in the cf process with fecl3 3 6 2 morphological properties from the sem micrographs shown in fig 5 it is clear that the flocs produced after the treatment of humus effluent with either fecl3 fig 5a or floculan fig 5b were compact and clustered indicating the presence of aggregates formed through the cf of particles by these reagents in comparison flocs which were formed by floculan exhibited a more compact structure with a smoother surface as a result of the formation of larger denser and easier settling flocs these characteristics are typical of flocs produced in cf with biopolymers through interparticle bridging and are desirable for good settling and dewatering liao et al 2006 and the formation of a low volume of sludge other studies renault et al 2009 have revealed that salts hydrolyse rapidly when added to wastewater producing abundant sludge that is difficult to dehydrate hence explaining the visibly lower floc density observed for fecl3 in fig 5b 4 conclusions this study was one of the first of its kind to assess the influence of cf on metal size distribution and bioavailability the experimental findings herein indicate that cf with either fecl3 or floculan can simultaneously remove particulate and soluble metal from wastewater in the cf process both fecl3 and floculan removed cu and zn from the colloidal fraction in conjunction with the elimination of coc such findings indicate that technologies capable of removing organic materials within the colloidal fraction can reduce the concentration of cu and zn in effluent despite fecl3 achieving a higher rate of removal for coc a significantly lower cu concentration was observed in the colloidal fraction of effluent treated with floculan it was anticipated that floculan removed organic compounds such as polysaccharides and proteins with functional groups that cu readily complexes with furthermore floculan removed cu from the truly dissolved fraction through the complexation of cu ions with functional groups phenol and amino groups present in the polymeric chains this additional removal mechanism helped floculan outperformed fecl3 in the removal of soluble cu the bioavailability of metals in effluent was strongly influenced by the concentration of doc floculan was able to remove soluble cu pb and zn without reducing the concentration of doc thus was capable of simultaneously reducing the concentration and bioavailability of these metals in treated effluent floculan should therefore be considered for its environmental benefits in decision making on municipal wastewater treatment in cf with fecl3 a substantial amount of doc was removed therefore despite achieving modest rates of removal for cu pb and zn fecl3 did not reduce the bioavailability of target metals in treated effluent such findings suggest that failure to account for the effect of treatment technologies on doc may result in the application of a technique which reduces metal concentrations in effluent discharges but which does not deliver any environmental benefit the cf performance data and proposed mechanisms of metals removal i e sweep flocculation for fecl3 inter particle bridging for floculan were further

19871,this study investigated the impact of coagulation flocculation treatment on metal form and bioavailability in municipal wastewater real humus effluent samples were separated into particulate colloidal and truly dissolved fractions before and after treatment with either ferric chloride fecl3 or the biopolymer floculan results revealed that both reagents effectively 48 eliminated cu pb and zn from the particulate fraction and removed cu and zn from the colloidal fraction in conjunction with colloidal organic carbon coc although organics in the truly dissolved fraction were resistant to removal floculan reduced cu in this fraction by 72 owing to the complexation of free cu ions to phenol and amino groups along the polymeric chains revealing an additional removal pathway in fact coc removed in the cf process by floculan was replaced with truly dissolved compounds input as a result of this reagents organic composition floculan therefore reduced the soluble concentration of cu and zn without changing the doc concentration thus reducing the bioavailability of these metals in treated effluent fecl3 did not reduce the bioavailability of target metals thus did not deliver any environmental benefit this work provides important information for the selection and development of high performance coagulants to improve metal removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords particle fractions colloids wastewater bioavailability coagulation 1 introduction metals including cu pb ni and zn are commonly found in wastewater with discharges of these metals influencing the chemistry and biology of receiving waters with potentially toxic implications jaishankar et al 2014 regulatory drivers therefore typically require concentrations of these metals to be reduced in the wastewater treatment process within the european union the water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec has specified bioavailability based standards for pb and ni which are classified as priority hazardous substances in the united kingdom uk bioavailability based standards have also been specified for cu and zn uktag 2008 which are classified as specific pollutants under the wfd the concentration of metal that is bioavailable cannot easily be measured directly and consequently a predictive tool known as a biotic ligand model blm is used to convert a dissolved phase metal concentration to an equivalent bioavailable metal concentration blms require site specific information on physico chemical characteristics as inputs including the dissolved phase metal concentration ph dissolved organic carbon doc and hardness di toro et al 2001 in the united states us the clean water act specifies criteria maximum concentrations cmc and criterion continuous concentrations ccc for heavy metals to protect human health and aquatic life in surface water and the us environmental protection agency epa has already authorised the use of a blm to determine water quality criteria for cu usepa 2017 whilst improving environmental relevance bioavailability based standards are nevertheless expected to significantly reduce acceptable metal concentrations at a range of locations within the uk peters et al 2009 this prospect has raised concern because wastewater treatment works wwtws are traditionally designed to address problems of carbon contamination and nutrient enrichment rather than for trace metal elimination and studies have shown that metal removal rates vary considerably at wwtws gardner et al 2013 in order to achieve removal rates to comply with more stringent discharge quality requirements the development of novel wastewater treatment technologies is urgently required to enhance metal removal a large body of previous work indicates the relevance of understanding metal form throughout wastewater treatment for the selection of suitable technologies chipasa 2003 karvelas et al 2003 santos and judd 2010 analysis of metal form traditionally involves separation with a 0 45 μm filter a soluble fraction passes through the filter whilst particulates are retained on the filter i e 0 45 μm metals such as cu and pb are known to have a high affinity for the particulate fraction and thus can be removed as part of the wastewater treatment process by physical separation choubert et al 2011 in contrast ni and zn predominantly exist within the soluble fraction which potentially requires expensive and energy intensive processes such as adsorption or ion exchange for effective removal faced with the expectation of more stringent regulation treatment technologies which can simultaneously remove particulate and soluble metal from wastewater at low treatment cost are desired by wwtw operators soluble components can be separated into two further size fractions namely a colloidal fraction which is composed of material found in the size range 1 kda to 0 45 μm and a truly dissolved fraction which contains constituents with a molecular weight mw 1 kda worms et al 2010 metal distribution within the soluble fraction is influenced by the presence of functional groups ligands that may complex metal ions it has been reported that the distribution of metals between colloidal and truly dissolved fractions is greatly influenced by the distribution of doc within these same fractions worms et al 2010 organics found in the truly dissolved size fraction include humic substances amino acids carbohydrates hydrated metal ions and synthetic ligands such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta imai et al 2002 shon et al 2006 conversely organic material in the colloidal fraction is predominantly composed of macromolecules including aminosugars polysaccharides and proteins jarusutthirak et al 2002 in a recent study hargreaves et al 2017 a large proportion of cu pb ni and zn was observed to reside in the colloidal fraction of effluent and calculated molar ratios of metals to organic carbon indicated that a large proportion of these metals may be adsorbed to colloidal material or complexed with macromolecules present in the colloidal size fraction such findings suggest that technologies capable of removing organic materials within the colloidal size fraction could reduce the concentration of target metals cu pb ni and zn in effluent discharges one such technology is coagulation flocculation cf a widely used technique for the treatment of industrial effluent coagulation involves combining insoluble particles and dissolved matter into larger aggregates through the addition of chemical reagents renault et al 2009 aggregates are bonded together by flocculation which consists of a stirring agitation procedure that encourages particles to agglomerate thus allowing their removal in subsequent sedimentation and filtration phases renault et al 2009 mechanisms through which particulate and colloidal materials are aggregated and thus removed can involve a combination of adsorption entrapment charge neutralisation and complexation processes alexander et al 2012 and are dependent on the reagent used chemical reagents frequently applied in the cf process are metal salts such as ferric chloride fecl3 which aggregate particles by charge neutralisation and sweep flocculation duan and gregory 2003 fecl3 is commonly used to remove phosphorus from sewage effluents and studies have shown this reagent can enhance the removal of metals from combined sewer overflow el samrani et al 2008 but few studies have investigated application for the treatment of municipal wastewater on a global scale however waste management systems are under change with producer responsibility and consumer accountability driving the development of sustainable and eco friendly management systems zaman 2013 an increase in the awareness of the detrimental consequences that metal salts may have to the environment such as increasing non target metal concentrations in treated wastewater and significant alterations to the ph of treated water renault et al 2009 vijayaraghavan et al 2011 has resulted in ongoing investigations into alternatives tanfloc a tannin based product with a trademark belonging to tanac brazil has attracted attention because of its renewability biodegradability and its capacity to eliminate metals beltrán heredia and sánchez martín 2009 for example zeta potential measurements have showed the cationic nature of tanfloc and given the polymeric structure of this coagulant mechanisms of charge neutralisation and inter particle bridging are suggested to be involved in the cf process hameed et al 2016 floculan is a commercially available product which is composed of up to 30 tanfloc and is therefore a practical treatment option studies investigating the application of this reagent to municipal wastewater are however limited it is also noted that there is a scarcity of studies that assess the impact of cf on metal form and bioavailability within the effluent matrix specific information on the fate of metals following cf is needed to assess the benefits of this treatment technology and to provide key information on coagulant selection for the treatment of municipal wastewater effluents furthermore understanding the relationship between metal speciation and cf may help develop high performance reagents for future application to improve metal removal in wastewater treatment the aim of this study was therefore to investigate the impact of cf on metal forms particulate colloidal and truly dissolved fractions and bioavailability in municipal wastewater the study set out to compare the effect of the biopolymer floculan on metal removal and to compare that with the conventional coagulant fecl3 to further characterise the properties of coagulants and flocs produced from the treatment fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and scanning electron microscopy sem were used 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials nitric acid hno3 sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl were all obtained from fisher scientific loughborough uk and were of reagent grade plastic and glassware was kept in a 2 v v hno3 solution between uses and were rinsed with ultrapure water prior to use floculan was obtained from lansdowne chemicals oxon uk ferric chloride fecl3 solution 40 was provided by darrant chemicals lincoln uk 2 2 wastewater samples humus effluent samples were taken from a wwtws in the uk which operated the trickling filter treatment type and which serves an urban catchment population contributors to the metal load entering the works include diffuse sources such as urban run off metals corroded from the domestic water supply infrastructure and leaching of metal from household plumbing samples were collected on 8 occasions over a five month study period from october 2016 february 2017 with at least one collection each month samples were collected in 5 l plastic containers which had previously been rinsed with 0 01 m hcl and ultrapure water 0 05 μs conductivity level samples were transported to and were kept in a refrigerated environment 4 c at cranfield university laboratories prior to analysis 2 3 coagulation flocculation experiments to replicate the cf process phipps and bird jar test apparatus richmond united states was used plastic beakers rinsed with 0 01 m hcl and ultrapure water were filled with 1 l of humus effluent placed on the floc illuminator and once the coagulant dose was added were agitated at a fixed intensity 100 rpm and duration 2 min the coagulant dose was fixed at the optimum level established in a previous study by the authors herein 0 25 mg l for floculan and 0 10 mg l for fecl3 hargreaves et al unpublished results once rapid mixing finished the fixed intensity and duration of slow mixing 30 rpm for 30 min was immediately established after slow mixing the beakers were removed from the floc illuminator and were positioned in a safe place for 30 min allowing for sedimentation after sedimentation the supernatant was extracted from about 25 mm below the surface with a syringe for the first 3 humus effluent samples collected jar tests were conducted in duplicate for the additional five samples collected jar tests were conducted in triplicate therefore a total of 42 jars were treated with either fecl3 or floculan i e 21 jars for each coagulant for each sample collected a minimum of 1 beaker was processed through the jar test procedure outlined above without the addition of a coagulant and was therefore treated by stirring only this was used as the experimental control 2 4 particle size fractionation particle size fractionation of the samples was conducted following a variation of the method described by barker and stuckey 1999 to obtain the soluble phase samples were filtered through 0 45 μm polyethersulfone membranes millipore livingston uk by vacuum filtration apha 2005 regenerated cellulose membranes 1 kda millipore livingston uk were used to fractionate the samples

repeated after each use truly dissolved fractionations were undertaken using an amicon 8400 stirred pressure cell millipore livingston uk filtration was driven by nitrogen gas at a pressure of 160 kpa to limit concentration polarisation an integrated bar stirrer was operated and a filtrate retentate ratio of 0 4 was adopted 2 5 analytical methods the ph measurements were conducted with a jenway

using cell test kits fisher scientific leicestershire uk dissolved organic carbon doc content was determined using a toc v analyser shimadzu milton keynes uk target metals cu pb ni zn were measured by

were digested with a cem mars microwave cem buckingham uk in order to determine the total concentration of the target metals sample blanks were processed through the preparation and analytical procedures phase distributions were calculated as follows particulate total soluble colloidal soluble truly dissolved in effluent bioavailable metal concentrations were estimated by using the metal bioavailability assessment tool m bat wfd uktag 2014 dried flocs obtained after the coagulation flocculation process were examined under a fei xl30 sfeg scanning electron microscope cambridge uk to reveal the morphology of flocs produced by fecl3 and floculan the infrared absorption spectrum of coagulants suspended solids in the humus effluent and flocs in the treated effluent were obtained with a jasco 4100 fourier transform infrared spectrometer dunmow uk to characterise the molecular structure these analyses characterised the differences in flocs formed to evaluate the mechanisms of metal removal with fecl3 and floculan 2 6 data analysis statistical analysis of the obtained data was completed with the software package minitab 17 one way anova tests were performed to assess the differences in metal concentrations between fractions after treatment with either fecl3 or floculan pearson s correlation coefficient tests were used to express the relationship between the concentrations of metals and doc using guidance from evans 1996 correlation strength was determined to be weak 0 2 0 39 moderate 0 4 0 59 or strong 0 59 both tests were conducted with a level of significance p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 humus effluent characteristics the concentrations of target metals as well as sanitary determinands in the humus effluent are shown in table 1 in humus effluent the abundance of target metals in terms of total concentration was zn cu ni pb see table 1 other investigators gardner et al 2013 have observed similar relative abundances and metal concentrations at wwtws elsewhere in the united kingdom 3 2 impact of coagulation flocculation on doc in the cf process fecl3 removed a sizeable amount of doc 42 from humus effluent conversely overall removal of doc with floculan was negligible 1 table 1 as indicated by no significant p 0 589 change in the overall doc concentration fig 1 nevertheless in both cases significant p 0 001 removal of colloidal organic carbon coc was observed with removal rates of 61 and 37 recorded for fecl3 and floculan respectively organic constituents in the colloidal size range are composed of macromolecules such as amino sugars polysaccharides and proteins jarusutthirak et al 2002 in cf co precipitation of macro molecular substances in the colloidal size fraction is favoured due to their large number and variety of functional groups which enhances attachment to precipitates haberkamp et al 2007 in addition constituents with higher mw can readily overcome electrostatic repulsion to become adsorbed wang et al 2015 removal of macromolecular particles in the cf process was therefore anticipated and has been observed elsewhere in the treatment of secondary effluent with fecl3 haberkamp et al 2007 the concentration of doc in the truly dissolved fraction was not significantly changed following treatment with fecl3 fig 1 other studies imai et al 2002 shon et al 2006 have identified that the truly dissolved fraction is composed of free metal ions and low mw organic constituents this study therefore supports the findings of others michael kordatou et al 2015 by revealing that low mw organics are removed to a minor extent in the cf process removal of doc from the truly dissolved fraction was also negligible in cf with floculan in fact an increase in the concentration of doc in this fraction was observed following treatment 1 3 6 1 mg l fig 1 and was likely to result from the organic substances present in this reagent 3 3 distribution of metals in humus effluent the distribution of target metals within the particulate 0 45 μm colloidal 1 kda 0 45 μm and truly dissolved 1 kda fractions in humus effluent the experimental control and effluent treated with either fecl3 or floculan are presented in fig 2 in humus effluent a sizable proportion of cu 47 pb 61 ni 37 and zn 33 was distributed in the particulate fraction fig 2 the distribution of metals in this fraction and trend recorded i e pb cu ni zn were similar to that observed by hargreaves et al 2017 soluble cu 46 pb 29 ni 36 and zn 46 were predominantly distributed in the colloidal size fraction of the humus effluent whilst for all target metals distribution in the truly dissolved fraction was relatively low fig 2 other studies gagnon et al 2014 hargreaves et al 2017 have reported similar distributions in effluent 3 4 impact of coagulation flocculation on metal size distribution 3 4 1 copper with an initial total concentration of 19 1 3 7 μg l table 1 good overall rates of removal were observed for cu in cf with either fecl3 53 or floculan 81 high removals have been reported elsewhere for fecl3 cu 81 el samrani et al 2008 and plant based biopolymers cu 90 beltrán heredia and sánchez martín 2009 the result was therefore in line with expectations for the particulate fraction high removals were observed fecl3 60 floculan 70 as indicated by significantly lower cu concentrations in effluent treated with fecl3 or floculan p 0 001 fig 2a in fact particulate cu concentrations were similar in the treated effluents fecl3 3 6 2 μg l floculan 2 0 8 μg l suspended particles adsorb to the surface of flocs which are aggregated and removed in the cf process renault et al 2009 in addition the removal of particulate cu in conjunction with suspended particles has been reported in a previous study at the site hargreaves et al 2017 hence removal of particulate cu in the cf process was anticipated an appreciable amount of cu was also removed from the colloidal size fraction when treated with fecl3 61 or floculan 88 as indicated by significantly lower concentrations p 0 001 compared with initial humus effluent values in fact strong correlations were observed between colloidal cu and coc concentrations fecl3 r 0 704 p 0 001 floculan r 0 715 p 0 001 in treated effluent which indicates that removal of cu occurred in conjunction with the elimination of organics from the colloidal size fraction organic constituents in the colloidal size range include proteins polysaccharides and amino sugars jarusutthirak et al 2002 such substances are highly reactive regarding metal complexation due to their polyfunctional character and large binding site density worms et al 2010 results from the present study therefore indicate that technologies capable of removing organic particles within the colloidal fraction are capable of reducing soluble cu concentrations in effluent despite fecl3 achieving a higher rate of removal for coc fig 1 a significantly lower cu concentration was observed in the colloidal fraction of effluent treated with floculan p 0 001 fig 2a it was anticipated that this may arise since floculan has the ability to remove organic materials with functional groups that cu readily complexes with in fact other studies hameed et al 2016 have revealed that tanfloc the active ingredient in floculan contains carbonyl and amino functional groups these are indicative of polysaccharides and proteins that can play a significant role in the complexation of cu in effluent michael kordatou et al 2015 furthermore polysaccharides are the dominant material of extracellular polymers produced by microorganisms during biological wastewater treatment wang and wu 2009 thus were anticipated to be a prominent colloidal organic constituent in the humus effluent in cf with fecl3 removal of cu from the truly dissolved fraction was negligible see fig 2a thus fecl3 did not affect the cu found within this fraction studies imai et al 2002 shon et al 2006 have revealed that the truly dissolved fraction is comprised of free metal ions and organic constituents including carbohydrates and amino acids which metals may adsorb to or complex with given that organic materials distributed in the truly dissolved fraction were revealed to be resistant to removal fig 1 negligible removal of metals associated to them can be expected nevertheless floculan reduced the concentration of cu in the truly dissolved fraction by 72 from 1 4 to 0 4 μg l fig 2a it was therefore assumed that a further removal mechanism was involved in cf with floculan floculan is a biopolymer composed of polymeric chains along which functional groups including phenolic and amino groups are found free cu ions have a high affinity for these functional groups lu and allen 2002 hamza et al 2017 so it was anticipated that in cf with floculan complexation of free cu ions with these functional groups occurred resulting in a lower cu concentration in the truly dissolved fraction after treatment fig 2a 3 4 2 lead and zinc sizeable amounts of pb and zn were removed from humus effluent in the cf process see table 1 such findings were expected as other researchers have reported that fecl3 johnson et al 2008 and biopolymers kazemipour et al 2008 were effective for the removal of pb and zn from synthetic wastewater the residual concentrations of pb and zn were comparable for fecl3 and floculan fig 2b and d respectively significant p 0 001 removal of pb occurred from the particulate fraction in cf with either fecl3 89 or floculan 83 fig 2b lead was predominantly distributed in the particulate fraction of humus effluent fig 2 and when in this form it is known to be removed in conjunction with suspended particles hargreaves et al 2017 hence such finding was in line with expectations in the case of zn the respective removals from the particulate fraction for fecl3 and floculan were 42 and 35 fig 2d as indicated by significantly lower concentrations following treatment p 0 05 nonetheless zn removals were lower than those observed for cu fecl3 60 floculan 70 and pb fecl3 89 floculan 83 as a relatively low proportion of zn was distributed in the particulate fraction of humus effluent such trend in metal removal from the particulate fraction supports the findings of other studies at wwtws elsewhere karvelas et al 2003 as fig 2d shows a large proportion of zn in the colloidal size fraction was eliminated after cf with fecl3 48 and floculan 54 moderate correlations fecl3 r 0 461 p 0 035 floculan r 0 509 p 0 006 were observed between colloidal zn and coc concentrations indicating that as for cu zn was eliminated in conjunction with coc other studies louis et al 2014 constantino et al 2015 have indicated specific ultraviolet absorbance suva to be a poor predictor of zn complexation capacity which suggests that macromolecules distributed in the colloidal size fraction may be significant for the binding of zn ions in effluent nevertheless removal rates in the colloidal fraction were much lower for zn fecl3 48 floculan 54 compared with cu fecl3 61 floculan 88 this was anticipated to result from the adverse impact of alternate competing soluble metals at municipal wwtws effluent contains a large number of metallic species beyond those tested in this study for example ca and mg hence a highly competitive process occurs between metal ions and binding sites in effluent metal ions compete with each other for complex formation and thus stability constants provide information on adsorption equilibria turhanen et al 2015 the conditional stability constants for zn with dissolved organic matter were revealed to be lower than that of cu in effluent at municipal wwtws chaminda et al 2013 zinc may therefore be more readily displaced at the surface of binding sites by competing soluble metals and such behaviour has been supported by the findings of others for example zhao et al 1999 revealed that ca and mg may have a negative effect on the removal of zn via competitive sorption to binding sites on the surface of biomass in contrast it has been reported that even in the presence of high ca and mg concentrations cu may be capable of binding to complexing agents turhanen et al 2015 thus cu can readily outcompete other metals for binding sites on the surface of colloidal organic compounds which were removed in the cf process the difference between the concentration of colloidal pb in humus effluent 0 3 0 1 μg l and that observed in humus effluent treated with fecl3 0 2 0 1 μg l or floculan 0 1 0 1 μg l was negligible furthermore no significant change p 0 05 in the concentration of zn and pb in the truly dissolved fraction was observed fig 2b and d these findings indicate that fecl3 and floculan had little or no effect on the truly dissolved pb and zn 3 4 3 nickel the concentration of ni in the humus effluent was not reduced following treatment with either fecl3 or floculan see fig 4c ni is highly soluble in wastewater with a sizeable proportion 27 of ni distributed in the truly dissolved fraction of humus effluent fig 2c and because of its thermodynamic properties i e slow rate of reaction low stability constant its removal in the cf process is low especially compared with cu pb and zn see table 1 similar removal trends have been observed elsewhere in conventional wastewater treatment processes karvelas et al 2003 a substantial increase in the concentration of ni was observed in cf with fecl3 which was attributed to impurities in this reagent other studies buzier et al 2006 chys et al 2013 have reported that fecl3 contains substantial amounts of ni and contributes toward the presence of this metal in treated effluent in this study ni concentrations in the truly dissolved fraction were significantly increased by 72 p 0 001 after addition of fecl3 this is of concern as this fraction is considered the most bioavailable to aquatic life gagnon et al 2014 therefore when used in wastewater treatment fecl3 may pose a risk to receiving watercourse ecology 3 5 impact of coagulation flocculation on metal bioavailability the bioavailable concentrations of target metals in humus effluent the experimental control and effluent treated with either fecl3 or floculan are presented in fig 3 in order to calculate bioavailable metal concentrations blms account for the interaction of trace metals with doc which contains a variety of ligands that bind metal ions thereby reducing their ability to interact with organisms thus increasing the doc concentration significantly reduces the bioavailability of the metal at low metal doc ratios there is an excess of complexation capacity so that free metal ion activity is reduced doig and liber 2007 for example pernet coudrier et al 2008 reported that cu toxicity towards daphnia magna was reduced in the presence of dissolved organic matter derived from wastewater treated effluent more recently a study by constantino et al 2017 demonstrated that effluent derived doc offers a relatively greater complexation capacity per milligram of doc in comparison with doc obtained from natural sources as seen in fig 1 coc removed in the cf process by floculan was replaced with truly dissolved compounds as a result of the organic nature of this reagent floculan was therefore able to reduce the soluble concentration of cu 86 pb 56 and zn 45 without significantly p 0 589 reducing the concentration of doc in treated effluent fig 1 thus a significant reduction in the concentration of bioavailable cu p 0 001 pb p 0 001 and zn p 0 001 was observed fig 3a b and d respectively these findings indicate that floculan was capable of simultaneously reducing the concentration and bioavailability of these metals in treated effluent the environmental benefit of utilising floculan should therefore be considered in decision making on municipal wastewater treatment the bioavailable ni concentration was unchanged p 0 101 following treatment with floculan fig 3c in cf with fecl3 a sizeable amount of doc 42 was removed table 1 therefore despite the ability to remove modest amounts of soluble cu 51 pb 54 and zn 31 from effluent table 1 no significant reduction was observed in the bioavailable metal concentration following treatment as shown in fig 3 panels a b and d respectively p 0 05 these findings indicate that fecl3 had no environmental benefit with regards to the toxicity of metals in effluent furthermore an increase in the concentration of ni coupled with doc removal significantly increased the bioavailability of ni in effluent treated with fecl3 p 0 001 fig 3c based on these results cf with fecl3 may not be recommended for application in wastewater treatment for the removal of trace metals from municipal wastewater the ph of effluent is also a component input into blms nevertheless the difference in the ph of effluent treated with fecl3 and floculan was not substantial see table 1 and was therefore unlikely to have significantly influenced the bioavailability of the residual metal 3 6 characterisation of flocs 3 6 1 structural characteristics features observed in fig a1 were representative of fecl3 0 81 fdm library match score on the other hand the spectrum generated for floculan see fig 4 a showed bands representative of organic compounds peaks were assigned in accordance with their respective wavenumbers cm 1 as reported in literature a broad stretching peak around 3010 cm 1 was a combined effect of oh and nh groups hameed et al 2016 the occurrence of stretching vibrations over a broad range of frequencies indicated the presence of bonded oh bands of carboxylic acids and free hydroxyl groups gnanasambandam and proctor 2000 peaks at 1599 and 1458 cm 1 indicated the presence of asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of ionic carboxylic groups coo iqbal et al 2009 the aliphatic acid group vibration at 1227 cm 1 can be assigned to deformation vibration of co and stretching formation of oh groups of carboxylic acids and phenols guibaud et al 2003 the effect of bending of co group was shown at the peak 1092 cm 1 hameed et al 2016 it is well indicated from ftir spectrum of floculan that hydroxyl carboxyl and amino groups were present and such groups could be involved in coordination with metal ions fig 4 also includes the ftir spectra of suspended solids from the humus effluent and flocs produced after cf treatment the spectra of the suspended solids from humus effluent see fig 4b exhibited a broad band at 3254 cm 1 which represents oh functional groups and oh stretching of polymeric compounds major bands at the wavelengths 2979 and 2888 cm 1 correspond to ch bonds of aliphatic acids farinella et al 2007 the band at 1645 cm 1 corresponds to the cc stretching that is associated with cc bonds and coo asymmetric stretching s farinella et al 2007 the peak at 1387 cm 1 represents aliphatic group vibration and coo symmetric stretching pavia et al 1996 whilst the band at 1076 cm 1 is indicative of the co group farinella et al 2007 the ftir spectrum for flocs formed by floculan see fig 4c shared similar peak locations with the dried humus effluent suspension fig 4a with bands around 3254 2979 1387 and 1076 cm 1 observed in both spectra such findings indicate that the polymeric chains within this reagent were capable of bridging organic molecules present in humus effluent together incorporating them in flocs formed although floculan contributed to the spectrum introducing the peak which appeared at 1247 cm 1 carboxylic acids and phenols the spectrum overall appears representative of the material collected from the humus effluent this is not surprising given that floculan itself fig 4a has similar structural characteristics compared with the dried humus effluent suspension fig 4c conversely the ftir spectrum for flocs produced by fecl3 see fig 4d was strongly affected by this coagulant s chemistry reduced intensity of the peak around 2979 and 2888 cm 1 indicated suppression of non charged components in addition peaks at 3254 1645 and 1076 cm 1 shifted to 3232 1631 and 1007 cm 1 respectively these shifts may be attributed to adsorbed carbohydrates or polysaccharide like constituents gu et al 1994 this indicates that complexation between co functional groups of suspended humus effluent particles and the surface of ferric hydroxide precipitates occurred hence the removal of particles in a growing hydroxide precipitate known as sweep flocculation duan and gregory 2003 played an important role in the cf process with fecl3 3 6 2 morphological properties from the sem micrographs shown in fig 5 it is clear that the flocs produced after the treatment of humus effluent with either fecl3 fig 5a or floculan fig 5b were compact and clustered indicating the presence of aggregates formed through the cf of particles by these reagents in comparison flocs which were formed by floculan exhibited a more compact structure with a smoother surface as a result of the formation of larger denser and easier settling flocs these characteristics are typical of flocs produced in cf with biopolymers through interparticle bridging and are desirable for good settling and dewatering liao et al 2006 and the formation of a low volume of sludge other studies renault et al 2009 have revealed that salts hydrolyse rapidly when added to wastewater producing abundant sludge that is difficult to dehydrate hence explaining the visibly lower floc density observed for fecl3 in fig 5b 4 conclusions this study was one of the first of its kind to assess the influence of cf on metal size distribution and bioavailability the experimental findings herein indicate that cf with either fecl3 or floculan can simultaneously remove particulate and soluble metal from wastewater in the cf process both fecl3 and floculan removed cu and zn from the colloidal fraction in conjunction with the elimination of coc such findings indicate that technologies capable of removing organic materials within the colloidal fraction can reduce the concentration of cu and zn in effluent despite fecl3 achieving a higher rate of removal for coc a significantly lower cu concentration was observed in the colloidal fraction of effluent treated with floculan it was anticipated that floculan removed organic compounds such as polysaccharides and proteins with functional groups that cu readily complexes with furthermore floculan removed cu from the truly dissolved fraction through the complexation of cu ions with functional groups phenol and amino groups present in the polymeric chains this additional removal mechanism helped floculan outperformed fecl3 in the removal of soluble cu the bioavailability of metals in effluent was strongly influenced by the concentration of doc floculan was able to remove soluble cu pb and zn without reducing the concentration of doc thus was capable of simultaneously reducing the concentration and bioavailability of these metals in treated effluent floculan should therefore be considered for its environmental benefits in decision making on municipal wastewater treatment in cf with fecl3 a substantial amount of doc was removed therefore despite achieving modest rates of removal for cu pb and zn fecl3 did not reduce the bioavailability of target metals in treated effluent such findings suggest that failure to account for the effect of treatment technologies on doc may result in the application of a technique which reduces metal concentrations in effluent discharges but which does not deliver any environmental benefit the cf performance data and proposed mechanisms of metals removal i e sweep flocculation for fecl3 inter particle bridging for floculan were further

19872,this work reports the monitoring and assessment of naphthenic acids nas in oil sands process affected water ospw pleistocene channel aquifer groundwater plca and oil sands basal aquifer groundwater osba from an active oil sands development in alberta canada using ultra performance liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry uplc tof ms analysis with internal standard istd and external standard estd calibration methods and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms for compositional analysis plca was collected at 45 51 m depth and osba was collected at 67 144 m depth results of ox na concentrations follow an order as ospw osba plca indicating that occurrences of nas in osba were likely related to natural bitumen deposits instead of ospw liquid liquid extraction lle was applied to avoid the matrix effect for the estd method reduced lle efficiency accounted for the divergence of the istd and estd calibrated results for oxidized nas principle component analysis results of o2 and o4 species could be employed for differentiation of water types while classical nas with c13 15 and z 4 6 and aromatic o2 nas with c16 18 and z 14 16 could be measured as marker compounds to characterize water sources and potential temporal variations of samples respectively fticr ms results revealed that compositions of na species varied greatly among ospw plca and osba because of na transfer and transformation processes this work contributed to the understanding of the concentration and composition of nas in various types of water and provided a useful combination of analytical and statistical tools for monitoring studies in support of future safe discharge of treated ospw graphical abstract image 1 keywords environmental monitoring oil sands process affected water groundwater uplc tof ms fticr ms 1 introduction large volumes of oil sands process affected water ospw have been produced during the bitumen extraction process from the oil sands industry in the alberta oil sands region aosr of canada alberta energy regulator 2014 ospw is currently stored in tailings ponds for its reuse in the bitumen extraction process process cooling and material hydro transport as a part of the industry s reclamation plan ospw in tailings ponds will be treated and eventually be developed into terrestrial and or aquatic habitat upon mine closure allen 2008 there is also active research investigating the potential for safe discharge of treated ospw prior to mine closure to reduce the environmental footprint of tailings ponds martin 2015 shell canada ltd 2014 naphthenic acids nas are a complicated mixture of carboxylic acids found in ospw with the empirical formulae of cnh2n zox cnh2n zoxs and cnh2n z 1oxn where n is the carbon number 7 n 26 z is zero or an even negative integer 0 z 18 that specifies the hydrogen deficiency resulting from rings or unsaturated bonding formation and x represents the number of oxygen atoms typically 2 x 6 in the na molecules headley et al 2016 huang et al 2016a both acute and chronic toxicities of na species have been assessed towards organisms such as goldfish larval zebrafish pimephales promelas vibrio fischeri and the mammalian immune system he et al 2012 scarlett et al 2013 tollefsen et al 2012 wang et al 2013 recent studies via effects directed analysis indicated that the toxicity effects differ for individual na species hughes et al 2017b morandi et al 2015 yue et al 2015 although o2 na species were reported to be with highest toxicity over other na species the relative toxicity of other na species is not fully established and natural transformation process among different species remains unclear therefore it is essential to investigate entire nas as one of the metric to be used for water quality assessment and hazard risk assessment purposes in comprehensive environmental studies hughes et al 2017a kovalchik et al 2017 the time of flight mass spectrometry tof ms has been widely used to analyze ox nas in ospw and other waters with either an internal standard istd calibration method or an external standard estd curve calibration method ross et al 2012 sun et al 2014 given that different na compounds can display differences in sensitivity for mass spectrometry detection a full quantification method for nas is not available because of the lack of standard compounds for each na instead studies have attempted to establish a representative response factor for nas in order to perform semi quantification based on the assumption that nas are a class of single carboxylic acids with close properties e g pka and ionization efficiencies hindle et al 2013 huang et al 2015b for example the istd calibration method was reported previously with an istd compound myristic acid 1 13c for standard addition to the sample sun et al 2014 wang et al 2013 on the other hand the estd calibration method was also reported using a commercial na standard e g merichem na mixture standard to prepare an external calibration curve for quantification hindle et al 2013 ross et al 2012 in fact because all nas are being measured using the same curve the estd method actually uses the average response of na mixture standard to semi quantify all ospw nas in the sample in addition the estd method generally requires water samples to be pretreated e g liquid liquid extraction to remove the matrix for applying the external calibration curve to date direct comparison of two available methods has not been made in the same study in previous environmental monitoring study the levels of nas in ospw and in pore and surface river waters of the lower athabasca river surrounding the aosr area have been measured using liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry lc tof ms with the estd calibration method though only o2 and o3 species were determined ross et al 2012 in another study the profiles of acid extractable organics aeo have been investigated and compared for ospw and river water samples revealing that the differentiation of natural ospw sources was apparent through measurement of o2 o4 ion class ratios orbitrap ms and diagnostic ions of two families of suspected monoaromatic acids multidimensional gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry gc gc tof ms frank et al 2014 profiles of aeo have been further investigated using orbitrap ms gc gc tof ms and lc tof ms to assess the spatial and temporal variability of nas in ospw from different tailing ponds with observable spatial variations found frank et al 2016 in addition to tof ms and orbitrap ms fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms has recently been employed to characterize na species in ospw incubated in the presence of wetland plants ajaero et al 2017 although the fticr ms analysis is qualitative only headley et al 2016 instead of entire na complex the distribution of certain na compounds e g adamantane acids was analyzed using gc gc tof ms to represent short term temporal and pond scale spatial variation in the composition of ospw lengger et al 2015 in the current work ospw and groundwater samples were collected from an oil sands development of alberta at three time points samples were firstly analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry uplc tof ms with both the istd and estd calibration methods for quantitative analysis of ox nas the samples were then characterized using ultra high resolution fticr ms to provide compositional information of the nas including ox species and heteroatomic s and n species comparison of the istd and estd calibration methods and correlation of different instrumental analysis results were investigated to strengthen technical quality and significance of monitoring results for nas in the samples principle component analysis pca was applied to interrogate the quantification results of ox na compounds in samples that indicate the distinct sources of water and potential temporal variability the work presents a combination of analytical and statistical tools for semi quantitative and qualitative analysis of na species in different types of water samples 2 experimental 2 1 reagents and materials dichloromethane fisher scientific on was used for liquid liquid extraction lle of nas from samples h2so4 sigma aldrich on was used for solution ph adjustment the myristic acid 1 13c sigma aldrich on was used as an istd for instrumental analysis optima grade water methanol and acetonitrile fisher scientific on were used for the instrument analysis 2 2 sample collection and pretreatment samples were collected from three ospw and seven aquifer groundwater sites in shell canada limited s muskeg river mine started mining in 2003 and jackpine mines started in 2010 which are located 60 km north of fort mcmurray alberta see fig s1 in the supplementary material for sites map of samples samples were collected at three time points on june 16 17 august 18 19 and october 20 22 of 2015 resulting in 30 samples in total samples from three ospw sites 1 3 were surface water collected from the clear water zone of the muskeg river mine external tailings facility etf jackpine mine etf and the recycle water pond where the water is combined from both mine s etfs and then directed back into the extraction process with added fresh water seven groundwater sites were from different locations within two types of aquifers namely the oil sands basal aquifer groundwater osba 4 8 and the pleistocene channel aquifer groundwater plca 9 10 groundwater samples were collected with depth ranging from 45 m to 144 m table 1 including osba 67 144 m and plca 45 51 m the hydrostratigraphy of this region is comprised of three layers from soil surface to underground quaternary pleistocene channels and surficial sands cretaceous mcmurray formation and pre cretaceous bed rocks gosselin et al 2010 yasuda 2006 yasuda et al 2010 the pleistocene channel is comprised of coarse and poorly consolidated sand with high permeability the mcmurray formation is the source of oil sands and is virtually impermeable this layer is usually less than 75 m depth from soil surface yasuda 2006 the bedrock is devonian shales and carbonate rocks samples were collected in 1 l containers and stored at 4 c after arrival to the laboratory at the university of alberta centrifugation 4000 rpm 10 min was firstly used to remove the suspended particles from the samples each sample was then divided into two 100 ml working aliquots for duplicate liquid liquid extractions each of 100 ml sample was acidified to ph 2 0 using h2so4 1 8 m before extraction and then extracted using twice of 50 ml dichloromethane the organic layers were separated combined 100 ml in a beaker and evaporated to dryness under gentle air stream at room temperature in a fume hood each dried fraction was re dissolved using 2 5 ml dichloromethane and moved to a pre weighed test tube these fractions were dried again in a fume hood under a gentle air stream and re weighed to give the weights of dried fractions in table 1 transfer of the fractions from the beakers to test tubes was a necessary step because the beakers were too heavy to be weighed in high precision mode 0 01 mg 31 g of the balance mettler toledo on each of dried fractions was re dissolved into 1 ml 50 50 acetonitrile water and stored at 4 c prior to analysis 2 3 instrumental analysis water samples were measured using three analysis methods i uplc tof ms analysis of raw water samples no pretreatment using the istd calibration method ii uplc tof ms analysis of water samples with lle pretreatment using the estd curve calibration method iii fticr ms analysis of water samples with lle pretreatment two uplc tof ms methods were qualitative and semi quantitative while the fticr ms method was qualitative only the instrument operational conditions of uplc tof ms and fticr ms were shown in table s1 for the istd calibration method a 1 ml volume of each water sample was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min the injection solution was prepared with 500 μl of the supernatant 100 μl of 4 0 mg l 1 istd in methanol and 400 μl methanol to reach a final sample volume of 1 ml the samples were analyzed using uplc tof ms synapt g2 waters on with the tof analyzer in high resolution mode mass resolution 40 000 and the investigated mass range of 100 600 m z the chromatographic method was developed in previous reports for the separation of nas before entering tof ms huang et al 2015b 2016a the electrospray ionization source was operated in the negative mode to measure nas in the samples pereira et al 2013 data acquisition was controlled using masslynx waters on and data extraction from spectra was performed using targetlynx waters on one raw ospw sample has been used as the quality control sample to ensure the method stability this method was developed previously for semi quantification of nas based on the signal of a compound versus the signal of spiked istd huang et al 2015b wang et al 2013 for the estd calibration method a pre calibrated ospw extract environment and climate change canada saskatoon sk was used as standard for preparation of the estd calibration curve headley et al 2013 martin et al 2008 the ospw extract standard is comprised of classical oxidized and heteroatomic na species which are typically present in the composition of natural occurring nas from the oil sands region headley et al 2013 the curve was prepared as 5 10 25 50 75 100 mg l in 50 50 acetonitrile water because lle fractions were concentrated 100 times different dilution times were applied to different samples using 50 50 acetonitrile water based on each fraction weight table s2 to fit final concentrations into the linear range of the external calibration curve the instrumental analysis conditions were the same as the istd method except the quantification step was performed based on the external curve martin et al 2008 ross et al 2012 for the fticr ms method dried fractions were firstly dissolved in dichloromethane with a concentration of 1000 mg l and then diluted 500 times in isopropyl alcohol to give a final concentration of 2 mg l with 0 1 v v nh4oh added samples were analyzed by direct infusion to the electrospray ionization source in negative mode on a bruker 9 4 t apex qe fticr mass spectrometer bruker daltonics billerica ma usa at a flow rate of 2 μl min fticr ms analysis of nas was usually performed without lc to achieve ultrahigh mass resolution nyakas et al 2013 the myristic acid 1 13c was added 20 μg l as an internal standard to compensate for instrument fluctuation data were collected over the range of 145 2000 m z with an ion accumulation time in the external hexapole collision cell of 10 s prior to injection to the icr cell using side kick trapping time domain data sets 4m data points were summed 16 acquisitions to enhance the signal to noise ratio mass accuracy across the full mass range was less than 0 1 ppm rms and mass resolution in above conditions was 500 000 bruker daltonics data analysis v4 0 was used to process the raw data and the formulae of detected compounds were generated using its smart formula algorithm in order to compare samples from fticr ms measurements the measured intensity peak area of compounds were calibrated against the fraction weight and internal standard peak area equation 1 the former of which was used as a dilution factor and the latter of which was used to account for instrument fluctuation 1 c a l i b r a t e d i n t e n s i t y n a s p e a k a r e a n a s f r a c t i o n w e i g h t i n t e r n a l s t a n d a r d p e a k a r e a where nas represented certain ox s or n na species also the relative abundance for certain na species from fticr ms measurements was calculated based on the calibrated intensity 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of ox nas using uplc tof ms the original ph of ospw 7 8 8 5 was higher than the ph of groundwater 7 0 7 8 the estd method requires water samples to be pretreated with lle to remove the matrix for applying the external calibration curve the ph values of all samples were adjusted to 2 0 prior to lle to ensure almost all nas were present as neutral molecules 99 9 assuming pka 4 9 havre et al 2003 facilitating the lle extraction process from table 1 the average extracted mass from ospw samples 4 41 mg with n 18 extractions was much higher than that from the groundwater samples 1 16 mg with n 42 extractions indicating that the concentration of aeo is much higher in ospw than in groundwater repeatability of extractions was examined with the averaged relative standard deviation rsd of duplicate extractions calculated as 3 5 for ospw n 9 samples and 11 0 for groundwater n 21 samples the latter of which is higher because the extracted amount from groundwater was too low to be weighed more precisely these results indicated that the lle procedure was repeatable rsd 8 7 n 30 samples for pretreatment of ospw and groundwater samples fig 1 presents a comparison of concentration of o2 o6 na species in all samples with collection times as june august and october of 2015 using the istd calibration method full data reported in table s3 generally the sum ox concentration were measured in the order of ospw 40 68 mg l n 9 samples osba 12 33 mg l n 15 samples plca 0 77 mg l n 6 samples this is consistent with the order of extracted amounts in table 1 similar plots for the estd calibration results are shown in fig s2 full data in table s4 with the ox concentration measured in the order of ospw 33 27 mg l n 9 samples osba 10 75 mg l n 15 samples plca 1 37 mg l n 6 samples these results clearly show the reduction of ox concentration from surface ospw to osba then to plca although osba located in deeper underground than plca it is likely the osba closely interacted with natural oil sands deposits e g dissolving nas from contacting interface while the plca was less involved in this process in fig 1 istd method and fig s2 estd method the concentrations of nas in ospw and groundwater samples were relatively similar over three time points with slight variations averaged rsd 21 6 n 10 for the istd method and 9 7 n 10 for the estd method previously the temporal variability of ospw na concentration has been found to be non important within a period of 2 weeks frank et al 2016 similarly our results indicated the temporal variability of na concentration is slight within 4 months for ospw and groundwater revealing the persistent nature of nas therefore as a recommendation future investigation of na temporal variability should cover longer periods fig s3 presents a comparison of concentration of o2 o6 na species in all samples using the istd and estd calibration methods for groundwater samples the match of two measurement results for o2 o6 species was indicated by the overlapped data marks fig s3 however for ospw the two measured concentrations seemed to match for o2 and o3 species figs s3a and b in most of samples but the divergence increased for o4 o5 and o6 species figs s3c e ospw samples behaved differently from groundwater samples for two methods because ospw unlike groundwater contained much more organics in addition to nas and these organics may affect the lle process rsds from two measurement results were calculated to reveal this trend for ospw the averaged rsds n 9 ospw samples were calculated as 12 8 for o2 18 3 for o3 42 0 for o4 67 8 for o5 and 105 1 for o6 this trend indicated that the match of two measurement results gradually deceased along with the addition of o atom to the na molecules because the lle extraction percentage for ox nas in ospw decreased along with the increase of o atom number e g o4 o3 o2 huang et al 2016b overall results indicated that the istd and estd methods achieved matched results for measurements of ox in low matrix samples such as groundwater samples while for ospw with complicated matrix there was a reduction in the lle efficiency with addition of o atom to na molecules resulting in underestimated concentration for the analysis of oxidized nas x 2 using the estd method despite this apparent trend of reduction in extraction efficiency with oxidized na content the application of the results with regards to toxicity is expected to be sound due to the fact that toxicity is primarily linked with classical nas o2 morandi et al 2015 yue et al 2015 the istd and estd methods were both semi quantitative achieving a representative response for the determination of nas both the istd and estd methods have pros and cons that are important knowledge for environmental monitoring studies a commercial na mixture standard estd may vary from batch to batch headley et al 2009 adding concerns to the long term stability the istd compound is relatively stable for long term monitoring while on the other hand the istd method is not as robust as the estd curve method in the event of instrument fluctuation among sample batches because any fluctuation occurring to the single istd peak may result in enlarged quantification errors the monitoring of a control sample was helpful to ensure the long term repeatability for both methods the standard addition procedure for the istd method was capable of avoiding inherent matrix effects without the need of lle sample pretreatment which is however required for the estd method to remove the sample matrix the lle sample pretreatment inevitably induced experimental bias because of the reduced extraction efficiency of the oxidized nas in ospw while on the other hand in cases that the na concentration is too low to be detected in samples the lle pretreatment could function as pre enrichment that allows effective instrumental measurements in summary the comparison of two na quantification methods revealed the distinctive merits of either method and greatly strengthened the technical quality of current measurement results of ox in samples for treatment studies that usually aim to achieve treatment efficiency through analysis of one or two batches of samples the istd method may be a fast and convenient method given it has no requirement for sample pretreatment as for long term monitoring and characterization the estd method may be preferred for compositional analyses of the na classes as there is no need to subtract the contribution from components added as internal standards 3 2 pca analysis for source differentiation and marker compounds screening pca analysis was performed to differentiate water types and to find marker compounds that indicate the sources of water and temporal variations pca analysis is a statistical tool to cluster samples into groups and to extract the significant variables that caused the major differences between samples by mathematic transformations pca finds the first principal component pc 1 which explains the most variance in the original data the second component pc 2 explains the second largest variance and remaining components explain less variance jolliffe 2002 van den berg et al 2006 typically only the first two or three components are selected based on their significance individual samples are projected into the new plane formed by the pc 1 pc 2 and the distances from the samples to the pc axis are called scores the cosine of angle between markers and pcs are loadings which indicate the markers contributions to each pc variables with higher loadings describe major differences between samples while variables with lower loadings provide little information on the sample variability samples in the score plot are positively correlated to variables in the co located region in the loading plot and this relationship could be studied by interpreting both plots together in the current work the uplc tof ms quantification results either the istd or estd method of ox species 184 compounds per species with 7 n 26 and 0 z 18 16 compounds at n 7 8 and z 4 18 were excluded from the total of 200 compounds due to nothing has been detected in these spots were used as variables and combined into one data matrix of 184 variables 30 samples for each species which was analyzed individually using unscrambler x v10 2 camo software nj prior to pca analysis the log transformation was selected as the optimum data pre treatment method equation 2 since it recovers the highest original variance and offered best clustering results chen et al 2015 fraser et al 2013 2 x ij log x ij 1 where x i j is the value presents at ith row and jth column and x i j represents the result after pre treatment hotelling t2 test was applied to evaluate pca model reliability and any samples with statistics values greater than the critical value of 95 were considered as outliers and removed fig 2 presents the score plots for pca analysis of o2 o5 species based on concentrations achieved using the istd calibration method the concentration of o6 species was too low to be used for pca analysis three groups ospw osba and plca indicated with different colors were completely separated for o2 and o4 species in contrast to the o3 and o5 species to reveal sample details in fig 2 figs s4 s11 show score and loading plots with each sample labelled for o2 species loading plots fig s5 revealed that the variables bringing major difference x or y 0 2 were the compounds with c13 15 and z 4 6 and c16 18 and z 14 16 o2 species with c13 15 and z 4 6 comprised of mainly classical nas sun et al 2014 the level of which were utilized to distinguish the water types on pc 1 dimension fig s4 most interestingly o2 species with c16 18 and z 14 16 comprised of mainly aromatic o2 nas huang et al 2016a the level of which could be helpful to distinguish the temporal variations of samples on pc 2 dimension fig s4 it is worth noting certain na species may show temporal variations even though the concentration of total nas remains statistically constant this is probably because the aromatic nas may be partly degraded in short term huang et al 2015a for o4 species loading plots in fig s9 revealed that the variables bringing major difference were compounds with c13 16 and z 6 8 on pc 1 and c17 19 and z 6 8 on pc 2 thus the level of o4 species with c13 19 and z 6 8 could be used to differentiate the sample types similar pca analysis results were achieved using the results of estd method figs s12 s19 the pca results of o2 and o4 species can therefore be employed for water type differentiation and to assess the temporal variability of nas in water 3 3 compositional analysis using uplc tof ms and fticr ms in addition to na quantification the compositional analysis for nas is also important for the investigation of heterogeneity among different na species regarding their potential transfer and transformation processes in natural environment fig 3 shows the relative abundances of ox na species calculated using the istd and estd calibrated results respectively for the istd method fig 3a the averaged relative abundances were calculated as 49 5 o2 21 5 o3 22 0 o4 5 1 o5 1 9 o6 for ospw n 9 samples 69 3 o2 7 3 o3 19 6 o4 2 9 o5 0 8 o6 for osba n 15 samples and 54 6 o2 6 7 o3 19 7 o4 8 9 o5 10 1 o6 for plca n 6 samples reduced o2 and increased o3 abundance was observed in ospw versus osba plca p 0 01 this is because the exposure to ambient air and uv facilitated the transformation of o2 to o3 species for surface ospw wols and hofman caris 2012 also increased o5 o6 abundances were found for plca versus ospw osba p 0 01 likely due to higher solubility for o5 o6 than o2 o4 huang et al 2016b the relative abundances from the estd method fig 3b also follow similar trends compared with tof ms fticr ms with ultrahigh resolution was capable of providing heteroatomic na species information in addition to ox species fig 4 shows the relative abundances of each na species in respective ox s and n species and the ox s and n species in total nas via fticr ms analysis the relative abundances were calculated based on the calibrated intensity table s5 with plots in fig s21 in fig 4a the averaged relative abundances were calculated as 0 2 o1 45 8 o2 22 9 o3 28 2 o4 2 9 o5 0 1 o6 0

o2 p 0 01 and an increase of o3 p 0 01 were observed for ospw compared with osba plca in addition an increase of o5 o7 was found for plca versus ospw osba these observations are in accord with the trends shown in fig 3a illustrating the match of compositional results for both instrumental analyses for further examination of the composition of components measured for both instrumental analyses fig 5 illustrates the correlation of relative abundances of ox nas via fticr ms analysis versus uplc tof ms analysis with the istd and the estd methods fig 4a shows the results of fticr ms analysis versus uplc tof ms analysis with the istd method slope 0 93 r2 0 96 and fig 5b shows the results of fticr ms analysis versus uplc tof ms analysis with the estd method slope 0 89 r2 0 94 both curves have good correlations corroborating the match of compositional results for both instrumental analyses in fig 4b the average relative abundances were calculated as 0 5 os 33 2 o2s 52 2 o3s 13 4 o4s 0

decrease of s species p 0 01 was observed for plca compared with ospw osba the compositional variations of s and n species observed for the different water types may result from transformation processes the mechanism for which is not known and requires further investigation to explore the potential for fticr ms semi quantification of nas we have examined the correlation of calibrated intensity of ox species fticr ms versus semi quantification results from the istd or estd method uplc tof ms figs s21 and s22 the correlations of ox for the fticr ms method versus the istd method were

0 95 sum of ox in fig s22 all comparisons showed good correlations for o2 o3 o4 and sum of ox species r2 0 89 except the concentrations of o5 and o6 which were too low to achieve good correlations indicating the feasibility of fticr ms semi quantification of na species provided proper standards are developed in the future 4 conclusions this work analyzed na species in ospw osba and plca samples via uplc tof ms analysis with the istd and the estd methods and fticr ms compositional analysis the measured ox na concentrations follow an order as ospw osba plca indicating that osba was likely associated with natural oil sands deposits e g dissolving nas from contacting interface while the plca was less involved in this process although osba located in deeper underground than plca reduced lle efficiency accounted for the divergence of oxidized na results using the istd and estd methods comparison between the istd and estd methods revealed the distinctive merits of either method as important knowledge and strengthened the technical quality for quantification of ox species pca analysis utilizing the ox concentrations indicated that pca results of o2 and o4 species could be applied for water sources differentiation and o2 nas with c13 15 and z 4 6 and o2 nas with c16 18 and z 14 16 could be measured as potential marker compounds to characterize water types and their temporal variations respectively the fticr ms results revealed that the compositional variations of individual na species may occur heterogeneously among different water types because of nas transfer and transformation processes though the mechanism for such transformations are not known with recent advances regarding specific na species which drive toxicity this new knowledge could help target treatment for different water stream types i e ospw or groundwater from oil sands operations the current work also contributed to the understanding of the concentration and composition of nas in

19872,this work reports the monitoring and assessment of naphthenic acids nas in oil sands process affected water ospw pleistocene channel aquifer groundwater plca and oil sands basal aquifer groundwater osba from an active oil sands development in alberta canada using ultra performance liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry uplc tof ms analysis with internal standard istd and external standard estd calibration methods and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms for compositional analysis plca was collected at 45 51 m depth and osba was collected at 67 144 m depth results of ox na concentrations follow an order as ospw osba plca indicating that occurrences of nas in osba were likely related to natural bitumen deposits instead of ospw liquid liquid extraction lle was applied to avoid the matrix effect for the estd method reduced lle efficiency accounted for the divergence of the istd and estd calibrated results for oxidized nas principle component analysis results of o2 and o4 species could be employed for differentiation of water types while classical nas with c13 15 and z 4 6 and aromatic o2 nas with c16 18 and z 14 16 could be measured as marker compounds to characterize water sources and potential temporal variations of samples respectively fticr ms results revealed that compositions of na species varied greatly among ospw plca and osba because of na transfer and transformation processes this work contributed to the understanding of the concentration and composition of nas in various types of water and provided a useful combination of analytical and statistical tools for monitoring studies in support of future safe discharge of treated ospw graphical abstract image 1 keywords environmental monitoring oil sands process affected water groundwater uplc tof ms fticr ms 1 introduction large volumes of oil sands process affected water ospw have been produced during the bitumen extraction process from the oil sands industry in the alberta oil sands region aosr of canada alberta energy regulator 2014 ospw is currently stored in tailings ponds for its reuse in the bitumen extraction process process cooling and material hydro transport as a part of the industry s reclamation plan ospw in tailings ponds will be treated and eventually be developed into terrestrial and or aquatic habitat upon mine closure allen 2008 there is also active research investigating the potential for safe discharge of treated ospw prior to mine closure to reduce the environmental footprint of tailings ponds martin 2015 shell canada ltd 2014 naphthenic acids nas are a complicated mixture of carboxylic acids found in ospw with the empirical formulae of cnh2n zox cnh2n zoxs and cnh2n z 1oxn where n is the carbon number 7 n 26 z is zero or an even negative integer 0 z 18 that specifies the hydrogen deficiency resulting from rings or unsaturated bonding formation and x represents the number of oxygen atoms typically 2 x 6 in the na molecules headley et al 2016 huang et al 2016a both acute and chronic toxicities of na species have been assessed towards organisms such as goldfish larval zebrafish pimephales promelas vibrio fischeri and the mammalian immune system he et al 2012 scarlett et al 2013 tollefsen et al 2012 wang et al 2013 recent studies via effects directed analysis indicated that the toxicity effects differ for individual na species hughes et al 2017b morandi et al 2015 yue et al 2015 although o2 na species were reported to be with highest toxicity over other na species the relative toxicity of other na species is not fully established and natural transformation process among different species remains unclear therefore it is essential to investigate entire nas as one of the metric to be used for water quality assessment and hazard risk assessment purposes in comprehensive environmental studies hughes et al 2017a kovalchik et al 2017 the time of flight mass spectrometry tof ms has been widely used to analyze ox nas in ospw and other waters with either an internal standard istd calibration method or an external standard estd curve calibration method ross et al 2012 sun et al 2014 given that different na compounds can display differences in sensitivity for mass spectrometry detection a full quantification method for nas is not available because of the lack of standard compounds for each na instead studies have attempted to establish a representative response factor for nas in order to perform semi quantification based on the assumption that nas are a class of single carboxylic acids with close properties e g pka and ionization efficiencies hindle et al 2013 huang et al 2015b for example the istd calibration method was reported previously with an istd compound myristic acid 1 13c for standard addition to the sample sun et al 2014 wang et al 2013 on the other hand the estd calibration method was also reported using a commercial na standard e g merichem na mixture standard to prepare an external calibration curve for quantification hindle et al 2013 ross et al 2012 in fact because all nas are being measured using the same curve the estd method actually uses the average response of na mixture standard to semi quantify all ospw nas in the sample in addition the estd method generally requires water samples to be pretreated e g liquid liquid extraction to remove the matrix for applying the external calibration curve to date direct comparison of two available methods has not been made in the same study in previous environmental monitoring study the levels of nas in ospw and in pore and surface river waters of the lower athabasca river surrounding the aosr area have been measured using liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry lc tof ms with the estd calibration method though only o2 and o3 species were determined ross et al 2012 in another study the profiles of acid extractable organics aeo have been investigated and compared for ospw and river water samples revealing that the differentiation of natural ospw sources was apparent through measurement of o2 o4 ion class ratios orbitrap ms and diagnostic ions of two families of suspected monoaromatic acids multidimensional gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry gc gc tof ms frank et al 2014 profiles of aeo have been further investigated using orbitrap ms gc gc tof ms and lc tof ms to assess the spatial and temporal variability of nas in ospw from different tailing ponds with observable spatial variations found frank et al 2016 in addition to tof ms and orbitrap ms fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms has recently been employed to characterize na species in ospw incubated in the presence of wetland plants ajaero et al 2017 although the fticr ms analysis is qualitative only headley et al 2016 instead of entire na complex the distribution of certain na compounds e g adamantane acids was analyzed using gc gc tof ms to represent short term temporal and pond scale spatial variation in the composition of ospw lengger et al 2015 in the current work ospw and groundwater samples were collected from an oil sands development of alberta at three time points samples were firstly analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry uplc tof ms with both the istd and estd calibration methods for quantitative analysis of ox nas the samples were then characterized using ultra high resolution fticr ms to provide compositional information of the nas including ox species and heteroatomic s and n species comparison of the istd and estd calibration methods and correlation of different instrumental analysis results were investigated to strengthen technical quality and significance of monitoring results for nas in the samples principle component analysis pca was applied to interrogate the quantification results of ox na compounds in samples that indicate the distinct sources of water and potential temporal variability the work presents a combination of analytical and statistical tools for semi quantitative and qualitative analysis of na species in different types of water samples 2 experimental 2 1 reagents and materials dichloromethane fisher scientific on was used for liquid liquid extraction lle of nas from samples h2so4 sigma aldrich on was used for solution ph adjustment the myristic acid 1 13c sigma aldrich on was used as an istd for instrumental analysis optima grade water methanol and acetonitrile fisher scientific on were used for the instrument analysis 2 2 sample collection and pretreatment samples were collected from three ospw and seven aquifer groundwater sites in shell canada limited s muskeg river mine started mining in 2003 and jackpine mines started in 2010 which are located 60 km north of fort mcmurray alberta see fig s1 in the supplementary material for sites map of samples samples were collected at three time points on june 16 17 august 18 19 and october 20 22 of 2015 resulting in 30 samples in total samples from three ospw sites 1 3 were surface water collected from the clear water zone of the muskeg river mine external tailings facility etf jackpine mine etf and the recycle water pond where the water is combined from both mine s etfs and then directed back into the extraction process with added fresh water seven groundwater sites were from different locations within two types of aquifers namely the oil sands basal aquifer groundwater osba 4 8 and the pleistocene channel aquifer groundwater plca 9 10 groundwater samples were collected with depth ranging from 45 m to 144 m table 1 including osba 67 144 m and plca 45 51 m the hydrostratigraphy of this region is comprised of three layers from soil surface to underground quaternary pleistocene channels and surficial sands cretaceous mcmurray formation and pre cretaceous bed rocks gosselin et al 2010 yasuda 2006 yasuda et al 2010 the pleistocene channel is comprised of coarse and poorly consolidated sand with high permeability the mcmurray formation is the source of oil sands and is virtually impermeable this layer is usually less than 75 m depth from soil surface yasuda 2006 the bedrock is devonian shales and carbonate rocks samples were collected in 1 l containers and stored at 4 c after arrival to the laboratory at the university of alberta centrifugation 4000 rpm 10 min was firstly used to remove the suspended particles from the samples each sample was then divided into two 100 ml working aliquots for duplicate liquid liquid extractions each of 100 ml sample was acidified to ph 2 0 using h2so4 1 8 m before extraction and then extracted using twice of 50 ml dichloromethane the organic layers were separated combined 100 ml in a beaker and evaporated to dryness under gentle air stream at room temperature in a fume hood each dried fraction was re dissolved using 2 5 ml dichloromethane and moved to a pre weighed test tube these fractions were dried again in a fume hood under a gentle air stream and re weighed to give the weights of dried fractions in table 1 transfer of the fractions from the beakers to test tubes was a necessary step because the beakers were too heavy to be weighed in high precision mode 0 01 mg 31 g of the balance mettler toledo on each of dried fractions was re dissolved into 1 ml 50 50 acetonitrile water and stored at 4 c prior to analysis 2 3 instrumental analysis water samples were measured using three analysis methods i uplc tof ms analysis of raw water samples no pretreatment using the istd calibration method ii uplc tof ms analysis of water samples with lle pretreatment using the estd curve calibration method iii fticr ms analysis of water samples with lle pretreatment two uplc tof ms methods were qualitative and semi quantitative while the fticr ms method was qualitative only the instrument operational conditions of uplc tof ms and fticr ms were shown in table s1 for the istd calibration method a 1 ml volume of each water sample was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min the injection solution was prepared with 500 μl of the supernatant 100 μl of 4 0 mg l 1 istd in methanol and 400 μl methanol to reach a final sample volume of 1 ml the samples were analyzed using uplc tof ms synapt g2 waters on with the tof analyzer in high resolution mode mass resolution 40 000 and the investigated mass range of 100 600 m z the chromatographic method was developed in previous reports for the separation of nas before entering tof ms huang et al 2015b 2016a the electrospray ionization source was operated in the negative mode to measure nas in the samples pereira et al 2013 data acquisition was controlled using masslynx waters on and data extraction from spectra was performed using targetlynx waters on one raw ospw sample has been used as the quality control sample to ensure the method stability this method was developed previously for semi quantification of nas based on the signal of a compound versus the signal of spiked istd huang et al 2015b wang et al 2013 for the estd calibration method a pre calibrated ospw extract environment and climate change canada saskatoon sk was used as standard for preparation of the estd calibration curve headley et al 2013 martin et al 2008 the ospw extract standard is comprised of classical oxidized and heteroatomic na species which are typically present in the composition of natural occurring nas from the oil sands region headley et al 2013 the curve was prepared as 5 10 25 50 75 100 mg l in 50 50 acetonitrile water because lle fractions were concentrated 100 times different dilution times were applied to different samples using 50 50 acetonitrile water based on each fraction weight table s2 to fit final concentrations into the linear range of the external calibration curve the instrumental analysis conditions were the same as the istd method except the quantification step was performed based on the external curve martin et al 2008 ross et al 2012 for the fticr ms method dried fractions were firstly dissolved in dichloromethane with a concentration of 1000 mg l and then diluted 500 times in isopropyl alcohol to give a final concentration of 2 mg l with 0 1 v v nh4oh added samples were analyzed by direct infusion to the electrospray ionization source in negative mode on a bruker 9 4 t apex qe fticr mass spectrometer bruker daltonics billerica ma usa at a flow rate of 2 μl min fticr ms analysis of nas was usually performed without lc to achieve ultrahigh mass resolution nyakas et al 2013 the myristic acid 1 13c was added 20 μg l as an internal standard to compensate for instrument fluctuation data were collected over the range of 145 2000 m z with an ion accumulation time in the external hexapole collision cell of 10 s prior to injection to the icr cell using side kick trapping time domain data sets 4m data points were summed 16 acquisitions to enhance the signal to noise ratio mass accuracy across the full mass range was less than 0 1 ppm rms and mass resolution in above conditions was 500 000 bruker daltonics data analysis v4 0 was used to process the raw data and the formulae of detected compounds were generated using its smart formula algorithm in order to compare samples from fticr ms measurements the measured intensity peak area of compounds were calibrated against the fraction weight and internal standard peak area equation 1 the former of which was used as a dilution factor and the latter of which was used to account for instrument fluctuation 1 c a l i b r a t e d i n t e n s i t y n a s p e a k a r e a n a s f r a c t i o n w e i g h t i n t e r n a l s t a n d a r d p e a k a r e a where nas represented certain ox s or n na species also the relative abundance for certain na species from fticr ms measurements was calculated based on the calibrated intensity 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of ox nas using uplc tof ms the original ph of ospw 7 8 8 5 was higher than the ph of groundwater 7 0 7 8 the estd method requires water samples to be pretreated with lle to remove the matrix for applying the external calibration curve the ph values of all samples were adjusted to 2 0 prior to lle to ensure almost all nas were present as neutral molecules 99 9 assuming pka 4 9 havre et al 2003 facilitating the lle extraction process from table 1 the average extracted mass from ospw samples 4 41 mg with n 18 extractions was much higher than that from the groundwater samples 1 16 mg with n 42 extractions indicating that the concentration of aeo is much higher in ospw than in groundwater repeatability of extractions was examined with the averaged relative standard deviation rsd of duplicate extractions calculated as 3 5 for ospw n 9 samples and 11 0 for groundwater n 21 samples the latter of which is higher because the extracted amount from groundwater was too low to be weighed more precisely these results indicated that the lle procedure was repeatable rsd 8 7 n 30 samples for pretreatment of ospw and groundwater samples fig 1 presents a comparison of concentration of o2 o6 na species in all samples with collection times as june august and october of 2015 using the istd calibration method full data reported in table s3 generally the sum ox concentration were measured in the order of ospw 40 68 mg l n 9 samples osba 12 33 mg l n 15 samples plca 0 77 mg l n 6 samples this is consistent with the order of extracted amounts in table 1 similar plots for the estd calibration results are shown in fig s2 full data in table s4 with the ox concentration measured in the order of ospw 33 27 mg l n 9 samples osba 10 75 mg l n 15 samples plca 1 37 mg l n 6 samples these results clearly show the reduction of ox concentration from surface ospw to osba then to plca although osba located in deeper underground than plca it is likely the osba closely interacted with natural oil sands deposits e g dissolving nas from contacting interface while the plca was less involved in this process in fig 1 istd method and fig s2 estd method the concentrations of nas in ospw and groundwater samples were relatively similar over three time points with slight variations averaged rsd 21 6 n 10 for the istd method and 9 7 n 10 for the estd method previously the temporal variability of ospw na concentration has been found to be non important within a period of 2 weeks frank et al 2016 similarly our results indicated the temporal variability of na concentration is slight within 4 months for ospw and groundwater revealing the persistent nature of nas therefore as a recommendation future investigation of na temporal variability should cover longer periods fig s3 presents a comparison of concentration of o2 o6 na species in all samples using the istd and estd calibration methods for groundwater samples the match of two measurement results for o2 o6 species was indicated by the overlapped data marks fig s3 however for ospw the two measured concentrations seemed to match for o2 and o3 species figs s3a and b in most of samples but the divergence increased for o4 o5 and o6 species figs s3c e ospw samples behaved differently from groundwater samples for two methods because ospw unlike groundwater contained much more organics in addition to nas and these organics may affect the lle process rsds from two measurement results were calculated to reveal this trend for ospw the averaged rsds n 9 ospw samples were calculated as 12 8 for o2 18 3 for o3 42 0 for o4 67 8 for o5 and 105 1 for o6 this trend indicated that the match of two measurement results gradually deceased along with the addition of o atom to the na molecules because the lle extraction percentage for ox nas in ospw decreased along with the increase of o atom number e g o4 o3 o2 huang et al 2016b overall results indicated that the istd and estd methods achieved matched results for measurements of ox in low matrix samples such as groundwater samples while for ospw with complicated matrix there was a reduction in the lle efficiency with addition of o atom to na molecules resulting in underestimated concentration for the analysis of oxidized nas x 2 using the estd method despite this apparent trend of reduction in extraction efficiency with oxidized na content the application of the results with regards to toxicity is expected to be sound due to the fact that toxicity is primarily linked with classical nas o2 morandi et al 2015 yue et al 2015 the istd and estd methods were both semi quantitative achieving a representative response for the determination of nas both the istd and estd methods have pros and cons that are important knowledge for environmental monitoring studies a commercial na mixture standard estd may vary from batch to batch headley et al 2009 adding concerns to the long term stability the istd compound is relatively stable for long term monitoring while on the other hand the istd method is not as robust as the estd curve method in the event of instrument fluctuation among sample batches because any fluctuation occurring to the single istd peak may result in enlarged quantification errors the monitoring of a control sample was helpful to ensure the long term repeatability for both methods the standard addition procedure for the istd method was capable of avoiding inherent matrix effects without the need of lle sample pretreatment which is however required for the estd method to remove the sample matrix the lle sample pretreatment inevitably induced experimental bias because of the reduced extraction efficiency of the oxidized nas in ospw while on the other hand in cases that the na concentration is too low to be detected in samples the lle pretreatment could function as pre enrichment that allows effective instrumental measurements in summary the comparison of two na quantification methods revealed the distinctive merits of either method and greatly strengthened the technical quality of current measurement results of ox in samples for treatment studies that usually aim to achieve treatment efficiency through analysis of one or two batches of samples the istd method may be a fast and convenient method given it has no requirement for sample pretreatment as for long term monitoring and characterization the estd method may be preferred for compositional analyses of the na classes as there is no need to subtract the contribution from components added as internal standards 3 2 pca analysis for source differentiation and marker compounds screening pca analysis was performed to differentiate water types and to find marker compounds that indicate the sources of water and temporal variations pca analysis is a statistical tool to cluster samples into groups and to extract the significant variables that caused the major differences between samples by mathematic transformations pca finds the first principal component pc 1 which explains the most variance in the original data the second component pc 2 explains the second largest variance and remaining components explain less variance jolliffe 2002 van den berg et al 2006 typically only the first two or three components are selected based on their significance individual samples are projected into the new plane formed by the pc 1 pc 2 and the distances from the samples to the pc axis are called scores the cosine of angle between markers and pcs are loadings which indicate the markers contributions to each pc variables with higher loadings describe major differences between samples while variables with lower loadings provide little information on the sample variability samples in the score plot are positively correlated to variables in the co located region in the loading plot and this relationship could be studied by interpreting both plots together in the current work the uplc tof ms quantification results either the istd or estd method of ox species 184 compounds per species with 7 n 26 and 0 z 18 16 compounds at n 7 8 and z 4 18 were excluded from the total of 200 compounds due to nothing has been detected in these spots were used as variables and combined into one data matrix of 184 variables 30 samples for each species which was analyzed individually using unscrambler x v10 2 camo software nj prior to pca analysis the log transformation was selected as the optimum data pre treatment method equation 2 since it recovers the highest original variance and offered best clustering results chen et al 2015 fraser et al 2013 2 x ij log x ij 1 where x i j is the value presents at ith row and jth column and x i j represents the result after pre treatment hotelling t2 test was applied to evaluate pca model reliability and any samples with statistics values greater than the critical value of 95 were considered as outliers and removed fig 2 presents the score plots for pca analysis of o2 o5 species based on concentrations achieved using the istd calibration method the concentration of o6 species was too low to be used for pca analysis three groups ospw osba and plca indicated with different colors were completely separated for o2 and o4 species in contrast to the o3 and o5 species to reveal sample details in fig 2 figs s4 s11 show score and loading plots with each sample labelled for o2 species loading plots fig s5 revealed that the variables bringing major difference x or y 0 2 were the compounds with c13 15 and z 4 6 and c16 18 and z 14 16 o2 species with c13 15 and z 4 6 comprised of mainly classical nas sun et al 2014 the level of which were utilized to distinguish the water types on pc 1 dimension fig s4 most interestingly o2 species with c16 18 and z 14 16 comprised of mainly aromatic o2 nas huang et al 2016a the level of which could be helpful to distinguish the temporal variations of samples on pc 2 dimension fig s4 it is worth noting certain na species may show temporal variations even though the concentration of total nas remains statistically constant this is probably because the aromatic nas may be partly degraded in short term huang et al 2015a for o4 species loading plots in fig s9 revealed that the variables bringing major difference were compounds with c13 16 and z 6 8 on pc 1 and c17 19 and z 6 8 on pc 2 thus the level of o4 species with c13 19 and z 6 8 could be used to differentiate the sample types similar pca analysis results were achieved using the results of estd method figs s12 s19 the pca results of o2 and o4 species can therefore be employed for water type differentiation and to assess the temporal variability of nas in water 3 3 compositional analysis using uplc tof ms and fticr ms in addition to na quantification the compositional analysis for nas is also important for the investigation of heterogeneity among different na species regarding their potential transfer and transformation processes in natural environment fig 3 shows the relative abundances of ox na species calculated using the istd and estd calibrated results respectively for the istd method fig 3a the

10 1 o6 for plca n 6 samples reduced o2 and increased o3 abundance was observed in ospw versus osba plca p 0 01 this is because the exposure to ambient air and uv facilitated the transformation of o2 to o3 species for surface ospw wols and hofman caris 2012 also increased o5 o6 abundances were found for plca versus ospw osba p 0 01 likely due to higher solubility for o5 o6 than o2 o4 huang et al 2016b the relative abundances from the estd method fig 3b also follow similar trends compared with tof ms fticr ms with ultrahigh resolution was capable of providing heteroatomic na species

o2 p 0 01 and an increase of o3 p 0 01 were observed for ospw compared with osba plca in addition an increase of o5 o7 was found for plca versus ospw osba these observations are in accord with the trends shown in fig 3a illustrating the match of compositional results for both instrumental analyses for further examination of the composition of components measured for both instrumental analyses fig 5 illustrates the correlation of relative abundances of ox nas via fticr ms analysis versus uplc tof ms analysis with the istd and the estd methods fig 4a shows the results of fticr ms analysis

decrease of s species p 0 01 was observed for plca compared with ospw osba the compositional variations of s and n species observed for the different water types may result from transformation processes the mechanism for which is not known and requires further investigation to explore the potential for fticr ms semi quantification of nas we have examined the correlation of calibrated intensity of ox species fticr ms versus semi quantification results from the istd or estd method uplc tof ms figs s21 and s22 the correlations of ox for the fticr ms method versus the istd method were r2 as 0 93 o2 0 92 o3 0 89 o4 0 83 o5 0 06 o6 and 0 93 sum of ox in fig s21 the correlations of ox for the fticr ms method versus the estd method were r2 as 0 94 o2 0 95 o3 0 89 o4 0 77 o5 0 19 o6 and 0 95 sum of ox in fig s22 all comparisons showed good correlations for o2 o3 o4 and sum of ox species r2 0 89 except the concentrations of o5 and o6 which were too low to achieve good correlations indicating the feasibility of fticr ms semi quantification of na species provided proper standards are developed in the future 4 conclusions this work analyzed na species in ospw osba and plca samples via uplc tof ms analysis with the istd and the estd methods and fticr ms compositional analysis the measured ox na concentrations follow an order as ospw osba plca indicating that osba was likely associated with natural oil sands deposits e g dissolving nas from contacting interface while the plca was less involved in this process although osba located in deeper underground than plca reduced lle efficiency accounted for the divergence of oxidized na results using the istd and estd methods comparison between the istd and estd methods revealed the distinctive merits of either method as important knowledge and strengthened the technical quality for quantification of ox species pca analysis utilizing the ox concentrations indicated that pca results of o2 and o4 species could be applied for water sources differentiation and o2 nas with c13 15 and z 4 6 and o2 nas with c16 18 and z 14 16 could be measured as potential marker compounds to characterize water types and their temporal variations respectively the fticr ms results revealed that the compositional variations of individual na species may occur heterogeneously among different water types because of nas transfer and transformation processes though the mechanism for such transformations are not known with recent advances regarding specific na species which drive toxicity this new knowledge could help target treatment for different water stream types i e ospw or groundwater from oil sands operations the current work also contributed to the understanding of the concentration and composition of nas in various water samples from an active oil sands operation and provided a useful combination of analytical and statistical tools for future monitoring studies acknowledgements this research was

19873,energetic materials ems bound to propellant residues can contribute to environmental risk and public health concerns this work investigated how nitrocellulose a common binding material in propellants may control the release dynamics of nitroglycerin ng and 2 4 dinitrotoluene 2 4 dnt from propellant residues batch adsorption desorption experiments on nitrocellulose and re interpretation on results from past leaching studies involving propellant bound ems were conducted mechanistic modeling of adsorption desorption kinetics based on intra particle diffusion ipd predicted aqueous intrinsic diffusivities d iw to within a factor of 2 of expected values furthermore the ipd model was able to predict effective diffusivities d eff during the early leaching of ng from propellant residues to within a factor of 2 over a 3 log unit range prediction of leaching d eff s associated with fired residues was less successful probably due to the neglect of compositional and morphological heterogeneity within the residues close correlations were found between the early and late d eff s of residue bound ng and between the fast and slow domain rate constants for both ems suggesting that the late leaching kinetics of bound ems may be empirically assessed from the early kinetics this work illustrates that in addition to dissolution retarded diffusion through nitrocellulose matrix may also limit the overall release and transformation of residue bound ems in the field implications and limitations of the current study and the steps forward are also presented

comparable to that estimated for other contaminated groundwater sites in us national research council 2013 ems contamination is not unique to us as worldwide episodes of surface and subsurface contaminations have also been documented as a result of training disposal and storage activities linkov et al 2014 pichtel 2012 a number of studies have suggested that some common ems may be readily degraded or immobilized in natural environment or engineered systems fuller et al 2004 2005 reported that peat moss is effective in reducing the dissolved levels of tnt rdx and hmx significantly with some degree of mineralization observed more recently bordeleau et al 2014 reported the rapid and complete degradation of ng in the presence of soil derived particulate organic matter within a week these findings suggest that under favorable chemical environment natural attenuation may be a viable option for em impacted surface soils field sampling campaigns and investigations however suggested that the dispersed ems may linger on longer than expected by applying stable c h and n isotope analyses to ems impacted field soils wijker et al 2013 estimated decadal biodegradation half life for tnt 2 4 dnt and 2 6 dnt bausinger et al 2007 reported residual tnt 2 4 dnt and metabolites from the verdun battlefield at 1 10 mg kg levels despite they were deposited almost a hundred years ago these levels are comparable with those found at the firing points in live fire training ranges jenkins et al 2006 or that employed in laboratory desorption studies yamamoto et al 2004 these studies demonstrated that the dispersed ems can persist for many decades in the field despite their rapid degradation and disappearance in laboratory studies the discrepancy between em s long presence in the field and their short laboratory half lives needs to be reconciled for better experimental control many studies have used neat solutions or crystals of em compounds rather than taking munition residues collected from the fields in their studies these includes investigations on biodegradation christodoulatos et al 1997 halecky et al 2014 sorption clausen et al 2011 remediation strategies applications technologies bordeleau et al 2014 fuller et al 2005 2004 however evidence has suggested that the source of ems can affect the transport fate behavior of the ems percolation of ng through soils was considerably slower when fired propellant residues was used than with neat solution as the source clausen et al 2010 similarly the soil column breakthrough kinetics were parameterized differently when solid propellants were used as source dontsova et al 2009 in other words ems associated with munition residues may behave differently than those exist in the freely dissolved forms environmental fate of propellant bound ems also depends on the nature of the ems whether they are freely dissolved or bound recently we have demonstrated kuo et al 2017 that nitrocellulose a major binding matrix for energetic components in a variety of propellants clausen et al 2010 steinberger and drechsel 1969 taylor et al 2012 is almost 10 times more effective in sorbing ng and 2 4 dnt than soil organic carbon preliminary investigation also suggested that breakthrough kinetics of ems originated from propellant residues or particles in column studies can be better explained when sorptive binding of ems to nitrocellulose is considered kuo et al 2017 the analysis agreed with the drip and batch tests performed by taylor et al 2012 which showed that ng encased in propellant grains was released much slower than expected without considering binding to nitrocellulose these pieces of evidence together suggest that nitrocellulose may have a critical role in determining how fast bound propellant ems may be released into the environment earlier nitrocellulose diffusion findings have limited applicability as these studies worked with hourly timescale drechsel et al 1953 lewis 1978 lewis and roberts 1982 focused on elevated temperatures brodman et al 1975 or used organic co solvent winkler and starks 1988 a systematic investigation on the dynamics of em transport in and out of nitrocellulose is thus needed this study aims to explore the role of nitrocellulose in the leaching of residue bound ng and 2 4 dnt two commonly encountered propellant ems the uptake and desorption dynamics of ng and 2 4 dnt through military grade nitrocellulose matrix was investigated in model batch experiments at various conditions and analyzed using empirical and mechanistic kinetic models kinetic observations reported from other leaching studies were then re interpreted using the acquired kinetic characterization and understanding specifically three questions were examined i can the adsorption and desorption kinetics of ng and 2 4 dnt be modeled mechanistically based on their sorption isotherms and the system properties such as dissolved concentration and solid to water ratio ii can the leaching behavior of ems from propellant residues both fired and unfired be explained by the sorptive interaction between ems and nitrocellulose iii is it possible to relate desorption kinetics at later times to that in the early times raw manufactured nitrocellulose was preferred over propellant grains as it afforded better experimental control greater compositional homogeneity and shorter sorption desorption duration this study intends to explore these possibilities and questions using nitrocellulose rather than live fired particles as a model matrix compositional heterogeneity and variable combustion history of different residue particles make them difficult to be used in controlled laboratory setting 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals nitrocellulose 12 55 nitrogen and

concentrations 1 55 3 28 12 8 32 1 and 60 7 mg l for 384 h the 2 4 dnt experiment was conducted for a longer period because preliminary results suggested its kinetics may be slower 40 ml of the solutions were placed with 200 0 5 mg of nitrocellulose both ng and 2 4 dnt experiments were run in replicates with controls i e em but no nitrocellulose and blanks i e nitrocellulose but no em all glass vessels and their contents were vortexed for 15s and mixed end over end at 30 rpm rotary extractor lars lande whitmore lake mi two samples were withdrawn from the vessels at specific times 0 1 4 10 48 and 96 h for ng 0 48 96 192 and 384 h for 2 4 dnt and analyzed for ng and 2 4 dnt all vials were filled with solution or water to minimize evaporative loss to head space controls suggested that no noticeable loss of both ems occurred during the experiment as desorption kinetics was the primary focus influence of concentration variability on ng and r nc variability on 2 4 dnt were not investigated to minimize experimentation a summary of the experiment setup is available supplementary information s1 2 4 desorption kinetics of ng and 2 4 dnt from nitrocellulose desorption experiment was investigated on ng and 2 4 dnt the two compounds were loaded onto nitrocellulose at three initial concentrations 50 200 and 450 mg l for ng 20 50 and 160 mg l for 2 4 dnt in three volumes of solution i e 10 40 and 200 ml the higher concentrations of loading solutions were necessary to ensure that the aqueous phase concentrations during desorption were within the range of the sorption isotherms kuo et al 2017 prior to conducting the desorption experiment ng and 2 4 dnt had to be loaded onto the nitrocellulose matrix in the loading adsorption phase ng and 2 4 dnt were allowed to sorb onto nitrocellulose in 10 ml glass vials for 30 and 50 d respectively preliminary adsorption kinetic results suggested that adsorption equilibrium was established after 200 500 h for both compounds supplementary information s2 the longer 30 to 50 d incubation periods were selected to ensure true equilibrium was established prior to desorption experiments each vial contained 10 ml of ng or 2 4 dnt solutions and pre hydrated nitrocellulose 40 0 5 mg and 20 0 5 mg for ng and 2 4 dnt respectively the exact volume of solution added was determined gravimetrically each vial was vortexed for 15 s and then mixed end to end at a rate of 30 rpm for 720 1200 h 3 5 ml of the post equilibrium solution was transferred and processed for hplc analysis the nitrocellulose mass sorbed with ng or 2 4 dnt was then used for desorption experiment desorption kinetics was examined for both ng and 2 4 dnt for approximately 10 d the em loaded nitrocellulose mass was transferred to 10 40 or 200 ml glass vials jars residual solution transferred along with the nitrocellulose was gravimetrically determined by weighing and used in later calculations 10 40 or 200 ml of em free solution was introduced to the vials jars all vessels and their content were mixed end to end at 30 rpm all vials were filled with solution or water to minimize evaporative loss to head space controls suggested that no noticeable loss of both ems occurred during the experiment for 10 ml and 40 ml solutions duplicate vials jars were sacrificed at each sampling for 200 ml solution duplicates were run where 5 ml of samples was withdrawn from the same 200 ml jars at 0 1 4 8 48 and 200 h for both compounds all samples were filtered and analyzed by hplc a summary of the experiment setup is available supplementary information s1 2 5 hplc analysis ng and 2 4 dnt samples were processed and analyzed using a hplc based methodology previously developed in our laboratory gonzalez et al 2015 prior to hplc analysis samples were filtered to reduce injection of particulate matter into the column briefly the collected samples were drawn into a glass syringe and then filtered through a 0 45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf filter into borosilicate hplc vials care was taken to avoid cross sample contamination while removing particulate matter from the samples detailed procedure for the solution transfer and filtration is available in supplementary information s3 filtered aqueous samples of ng and 2 4 dnt were subsequently analyzed with an agilent 1200 series hplc uv unit with a zorbax sb c18 reverse phase column 4 6 50 mm 3 5 μm particle size a methanol water gradient program was run with methanol water volume ratio changed from 30 70 to 65 35 from 0 to 2 8 min and from 65 35 back to 30 70 from 2 8 to 3 2 min flowrate was set at 2 ml min and uv detector was operated at a single wavelength of 214 nm and 16 5 c the retention times for ng and 2 4 dnt were 2 89 and 3 29 min respectively standard solutions of ng and 2 4 dnt were prepared and used for calibration purpose 3 modelling of kinetic data adsorption and desorption kinetics were analyzed using the empirical first order kinetic model and the mechanistic intra particle diffusion ipd model the first order model supposes that the transient behavior of an adsorbate desorbate during adsorption and desorption in a batch system can be modeled as 1a ln c c o k t a d s o r p t i o n 1b ln c c c c d e s o k t d e s o r p t i o n where c o and c mg l and are the concentration at the initial time and time t respectively c des o and c mg l are the initial and equilibrium aqueous concentrations during desorption respectively t h is the time elapsed k h 1 is the first order adsorption or desorption rate constant in practice net ad de sorption rate decreases with time as the concentration gradient driving the process diminishes the first order model is thus more applicable to the early times when the backward desorption or adsorption rate is relatively small plotting experimental data along equation 1a or 1b suggests that two domains of distinctive slopes can be identified a fast domain 0 10 h and a slow domain 10 200 h the rate constants for the two domains k fast and k slow were obtained from linear regression applied to the data points in the respective domains c was estimated via mass balance based on nitrocellulose to water ratios using the sorption isotherms determined previously kuo et al 2017 table 1 3 1 intra particle diffusion model wetted nitrocellulose mass has the appearance of a lump of cotton and may be approximated as a spherical body with diameter a with this assumption the transient uptake of adsorbate by the nitrocellulose mass from a closed aqueous phase can be depicted as crank 1980 2a m t m 1 n 1 6 α 1 α 9 9 α α 2 q n 2 exp d e f f q n 2 t a 2 2b tan q n 3 q n 3 α q n 2 q n 0 2c α 1 r n c k d where m t and m are the sorbed adsorbate mass at time t and infinite time respectively α is a dimensionless ratio accounts for sorbent aqueous phase partitioning k d lwat kgnc and sorbent mass to water ratio r nc kgnc lwat d eff is the effective diffusivity within the sorbent cm2 s a is the radius of the sphere cm t is time s q n is the nth root for equation 2b d eff is typically determined by fitting experimental kinetic data and may be interpreted within presupposed mechanistic picture of the diffusion process the transport of ems through the nitrocellulose matrix was hypothesized to follow the intra particle diffusion model wu and gschwend 1988 1986 with d eff mathematically expressed as 3 d e f f d i w ϕ 2 1 ϕ ρ s k d ϕ d iw is the aqueous molecular diffusivity cm2 s ϕ is the sorbent porosity lwat ltot ρ s is the density of the dry fiber kg l k d is the nitrocellulose water partition coefficient l kg the ipd model i e equation 3 assumes that the partitioning of solute between the pore water and the fiber is instantaneous relative to the diffusion of the solute through the porous space it links kinetic observations to system and sorbent properties and provides a mechanistic account for solute transport exchange between the sorbent and the bulk aqueous environment at the microscopic level when modeling data with idp a time averaged k d over the course of de sorption was used to fit the data of a particular experiment the constant k d assumption was deemed reasonable as k d s varied by no more than 5 15 in all experiments over the entire time course ϕ and ρ s were estimated to be 0 81 lwat lbulk and 1 5 kg l respectively distribution of fiber dimensions or pore size as well as aggregation disaggregation dynamics were not considered the best fit d eff the sole fitting parameter in the modeling exercise was determined by minimizing the sum squares of errors between the observed and the simulated m t m i e equation 2a 4 results and discussion 4 1 sorption and desorption kinetics by the first order model analysis of sorption kinetic data using the first order model was generally satisfactory r 2 0 8 and the resulting rate constants are summarized in table 1 fig 1 showed that all ng and 2 4 dnt adsorption and desorption kinetic data could be fitted to a fast domain 0 10 h and a slow domain 10 100 h with r 2 ranging from 0 80 to 0 91 and 0 93 to 1 0 for k fast and k slow respectively for ng adsorption k fast approximately 10 30 times of k slow ng sorption was examined at various nitrocellulose to water ratios r nc and both k fast and k slow varied linearly with r nc fig 2 the observed dependence is consistent with the theoretical expectation that uptake rate increases with the sorbent concentration crank 1980 wu and gschwend 1988 for 2 4 dnt sorption only initial solute concentration c o was varied and k s showed no apparent dependence on c o table 1 supplementary information s4 desorption rate constants correlated weakly with r nc table 1 for ng the average k fast and k slow were found to be 0 053 0 023 h 1 and 0 0049 0 0021 h 1 respectively the desorption rate constants were higher for 2 4 dnt with k fast and k slow at 0 073 0 028 h 1 and 0 015 0 006 h 1 respectively the mean desorption k s were significantly higher than the mean adsorption k s for both compounds this difference was more prominent with 2 4 dnt k desorption s 4 6 k adsorption s than with ng k desorption s 2 3 k adsorption s and may be explained by the binding energy difference during sorption and desorption retardation in intra matrix transport will be the strongest as solutes were adsorbing onto the pristine nitrocellulose because of the non linear isotherms table 1 during desorption as a result of sorption nonlinearity the leaving molecules will initially experience less retardation as the energetically favorable binding sites have been occupied this interpretation is further supported by the 2 4 dnt isotherm n fr 0 668 being more non linear than the ng isotherm n fr 0 916 although as a smaller molecular 2 4 dnt can diffuse 10 faster than ng in water estimated aqueous diffusivities for 2 4 dnt and ng are 9 0 10 6 and 8 2 10 6 cm2 s respectively hayduk and laudie 1974 this likely results in minor contribution towards the kinetic difference between ng and 2 4 dnt comparison between desorption endpoints and expected equilibrium concentrations indicate that both ng and 2 4 dnt were close to equilibrium at the end of the desorption experiments expected equilibrium concentrations calculated from the sorption isotherms of ng and 2 4 dnt table 1 generally agreed well with the end point measurements to within 25 or 0 1 log unit fig 3 the close agreement between end measurements and equilibrium calculation suggests that equilibrium may be more or less established in the desorption experiments within 200 h this is also indirectly supported by the fact that both k fast and k slow are numerically greater in desorption than in adsorption for ng and 2 4 dnt table 1 this agreement provides consistency to the use of calculated desorption equilibrium i e c in the derivation of k fast s and k slow s 4 2 adsorption and desorption kinetics nitrocellulose vs soil previous sorption desorption studies on ems have focused mainly on soils or soil suspensions taylor et al 2012 reported a k of 0 011 0 032 h 1 and of 0 0076 0 015 h 1 for sorption of ng and 2 4 dnt respectively these were comparable to the k s observed here for ng 0 0018 0 025 h 1 and 2 4 dnt 0 0026 0 019 h 1 transformation rate constants k transform of ng and 2 4 dnt in various soils have also been reported brannon and pennington 2002 pennington et al 2006 1999 these were determined from the disappearance of dissolved compound in the presence of soils or sorbents brannon and myers 1997 and reflected the combined influence of sorption and degradation pennington et al 2006 k transform of 0 002 0 095 h 1 pennington et al 2002 and 0 0005 to 0 0021 h 1 pennington et al 1999 were reported for ng and 2 4 dnt respectively although not directly comparable the magnitudes of these transformation rate coefficients also suggested the sorption rate constants reported here were reasonable desorption of ng or 2 4 dnt from soil has been less investigated and comparable kinetic data have not been available 4 3 diffusivity of ems in nitrocellulose matrix sorption and desorption kinetics observed in this study could be explained well with the intra particle diffusion model as model and theory derived d iw s generally agreed with each other sample data fittings are shown in fig 4 and in supplementary information s5 the sorption derived d iw s for ng and 2 4 dnt were 7 0 1 0 10 6 and 21 9 6 10 6 cm2 s respectively these were approximately within a factor of 2 to the estimates from established correlations hayduk and laudie 1974 wilke and chang 1955 8 4 10 6 and 9 3 10 6 cm2 s for ng and 2 4 dnt respectively similarly the desorption derived d iw s for ng and 2 4 dnt were 4 1 1 5 10 6 and 11 4 2 10 5 cm2 s respectively the agreement was reasonable given d iw s were derived independently using known system physical chemical properties i e r nc porosity diameter k d 4 4 interpreting the release of ems from propellant particles the intra particular diffusion model may help interpret the release kinetics of ems from propellant particles reported in earlier studies taylor et al clausen et al 2010 taylor et al 2012 examined the release of ng from unfired and fired propellant grains in batch tests and drip tests on four different ammunitions the original work reported effective diffusivities fitted to the early 10 d data d eff 0 10d for the batch runs following the approach outlined in the original work taylor et al 2012 d eff 0 10d were likewise derived for the other batch drip tests fig 5 the intra particular model was then used to predict d eff 0 10d using only the experimental conditions and properties provided best fit d eff 0 10d s are included in supplementary information s6 experimental and predicted d eff 0 10d s matched well for all experiments involving unfired propellants fig 6 a with predictions within a factor of 2 of the observations this agreement is significant as d eff 0 10d spanned over 2 orders of magnitude and the predictions were made without any a posteriori adjustment fitting implicit assumptions in equation 3 were that d eff was independent of time ng concentration and spatial position and that solute loading and grain properties were uniform and homogeneous within the propellant particle these approximations no longer held true in the later period i e 50 to 100 d of taylor et al s experiments a rigorous treatment of the later period data would require a finite difference wu and gschwend 1988 or finite element pitt 2011 simulation wherein ng mass concentration pore structure and d eff are spatially discretized and time marched according to governing transport equations as such modeling is beyond the scope of this study analysis in the manner of fig 6a has not been extended to the later period kinetics however the model was less capable of predicting d eff 0 10d of ng from the fired propellants in fig 6a for fired propellants experimental d eff 0 10d s for fired propellants 0 76 3 2 10 14 cm2 s were considerably lower than those in unfired grains 10 13 10 11 cm2 s only 1 out of 4 experimental d eff 0 10d s was correctly predicted although the mis predicted values were within 1 log unit of the measured d eff 0 10d s phasic heterogeneity within the fired residue grains i e unburned nitrocellulose partially burned content and charred outer rim introduced greater degree of uncertainties in the modeling effort as compositional homogeneity was assumed an encouraging result was that the early and late d eff s are correlated fig 6b d eff end s i e effective diffusivities fitted to the data during the last 20 d and d eff 0 10d s are logarithmically correlated as log d eff end 0 79 log d eff 0 10d 2 96 r 2 0 96 the exact form of the correlation and the values of the fitting parameters are less important as they will be refined with more observations similarly k fast s and k slow s are also correlated for ng and 2 4 dnt during both adsorption and desorption fig 6c the important implication of fig 6b and c is that the behavior of bound ems long after their deposit may be assessed empirically through d eff 0 10d or k fast which appears to be mechanistically predictable fig 6a or easy to measure 5 conclusion evidence from this work suggested that the kinetics of diffusion through the nitrocellulose matrix may be central to understanding the release of ems from propellant grains although some ems in their dissolved forms can be degraded and even mineralized in engineering and natural systems bordeleau et al 2014 clausen et al 2011 fuller et al 2005 their desorption from the nitrocellulose binding matrix may be the key process that control the fate and persistence of propellant bound ems in the environment experimental investigations have also attributed slow dissolution and diffusion through nitrocellulose as possible causes of slow release of propellant bound ems dontsova et al 2009 2008 taylor et al 2012 our observations together with these earlier findings suggest that slow desorption through binding matrix can be an important mechanism pathway in explaining some of the observed slow dissipation of field ems bound to fired residues bausinger et al 2007 wijker et al 2013 timescales of the dissipation process can have significant regulatory and remediation implications for monitoring and managing em contaminated sites the release kinetics of propellant bounded ems may be predictable using the intra particle diffusion model given the fundamental sorbent and sorbate properties this was illustrated with the prediction of d eff 0 10d for ng from fresh propellants fig 6a further validation on the simple model to the later desorption release period through finite difference or finite element analyses is needed empirical correlation may also be developed to link up d eff in the later time to d eff 0 10d fig 6b offering a quick practical way for assessment and management purposes the leaching behavior from fired spent propellants is generally slower and harder to predict fig 6a and may require microscopic characterization of the heterogeneity within the residue particles electron microscopic images can show transport relevant morphological features e g cracks shapes of intact or sliced munition residues taylor et al 2012 elemental mapping of c and n kuo et al 2013 can reveal the presence of graphitized crusts and islands of unburned nitrocellulose within the fired munition grains these morphological characterizations may be used to construct predictive model for the leaching kinetics of ems from fired propellant residues based on the firing condition or the distance from firing point jenkins et al 2006 walsh et al 2012 such correlation or model would provide a better assessment on the transport potential or environmental hazard level associated with the residues bound propellant constituents results from this study merely provide benchmark behavior for residues bound ems under idealized laboratory condition future investigations on live fired propellant residues and ingeniously designed are needed it is possible that ems associated with fired residues may remain occluded for extended period of field weathering it is also worthwhile to investigate the role that sorption desorption plays in the environmental availability of other ems both well characterized and emerging ones from the binding materials in various fresh or spent munitions the uptake kinetics may also serve as reference in cleanup or remediation effort considering that sorptive cleanup methodology has been proposed fuller et al 2005 2004 acknowledgments we

19873,energetic materials ems bound to propellant residues can contribute to environmental risk and public health concerns this work investigated how nitrocellulose a common binding material in propellants may control the release dynamics of nitroglycerin ng and 2 4 dinitrotoluene 2 4 dnt from propellant residues batch adsorption desorption experiments on nitrocellulose and re interpretation on results from past leaching studies involving propellant bound ems were conducted mechanistic modeling of adsorption desorption kinetics based on intra particle diffusion ipd predicted aqueous intrinsic diffusivities d iw to within a factor of 2 of expected values furthermore the ipd model was able to predict effective diffusivities d eff during the early leaching of ng from propellant residues to within a factor of 2 over a 3 log unit range prediction of leaching d eff s associated with fired residues was less successful probably due to the neglect of compositional and morphological heterogeneity within the residues close correlations were found between the early and late d eff s of residue bound ng and between the fast and slow domain rate constants for both ems suggesting that the late leaching kinetics of bound ems may be empirically assessed from the early kinetics this work illustrates that in addition to dissolution retarded diffusion through nitrocellulose matrix may also limit the overall release and transformation of residue bound ems in the field implications and limitations of the current study and the steps forward are also presented

comparable to that estimated for other contaminated groundwater sites in us national research council 2013 ems contamination is not unique to us as worldwide episodes of surface and subsurface contaminations have also been documented as a result of training disposal and storage activities linkov et al 2014 pichtel 2012 a number of studies have suggested that some common ems may be readily degraded or immobilized in natural environment or engineered systems fuller et al 2004 2005 reported that peat moss is effective in reducing the dissolved levels of tnt rdx and hmx significantly with some degree of mineralization observed more recently bordeleau et al 2014 reported the rapid and complete degradation of ng in the presence of soil derived particulate organic matter within a week these findings suggest that under favorable chemical environment natural attenuation may be a viable option for em impacted surface soils field sampling campaigns and investigations however suggested that the dispersed ems may linger on longer than expected by applying stable c h and n isotope analyses to ems impacted field soils wijker et al 2013 estimated decadal biodegradation half life for tnt 2 4 dnt and 2 6 dnt bausinger et al 2007 reported residual tnt 2 4 dnt and metabolites from the verdun battlefield at 1 10 mg kg levels despite they were deposited almost a hundred years ago these levels are comparable with those found at the firing points in live fire training ranges jenkins et al 2006 or that employed in laboratory desorption studies yamamoto et al 2004 these studies demonstrated that the dispersed ems can persist for many decades in the field despite their rapid degradation and disappearance in laboratory studies the discrepancy between em s long presence in the field and their short laboratory half lives needs to be reconciled for better experimental control many studies have used neat solutions or crystals of em compounds rather than taking munition residues collected from the fields in their studies these includes investigations on biodegradation christodoulatos et al 1997 halecky et al 2014 sorption clausen et al 2011 remediation strategies applications technologies bordeleau et al 2014 fuller et al 2005 2004 however evidence has suggested that the source of ems can affect the transport fate behavior of the ems percolation of ng through soils was considerably slower when fired propellant residues was used than with neat solution as the source clausen et al 2010 similarly the soil column breakthrough kinetics were parameterized differently when solid propellants were used as source dontsova et al 2009 in other words ems associated with munition residues may behave differently than those exist in the freely dissolved forms environmental fate of propellant bound ems also depends on the nature of the ems whether they are freely dissolved or bound recently we have demonstrated kuo et al 2017 that nitrocellulose a major binding matrix for energetic components in a variety of propellants clausen et al 2010 steinberger and drechsel 1969 taylor et al 2012 is almost 10 times more effective in sorbing ng and 2 4 dnt than soil organic carbon preliminary investigation also suggested that breakthrough kinetics of ems originated from propellant residues or particles in column studies can be better explained when sorptive binding of ems to nitrocellulose is considered kuo et al 2017 the analysis agreed with the drip and batch tests performed by taylor et al 2012 which showed that ng encased in propellant grains was released much slower than expected without considering binding to nitrocellulose these pieces of evidence together suggest that nitrocellulose may have a critical role in determining how fast bound propellant ems may be released into the environment earlier nitrocellulose diffusion findings have limited applicability as these studies worked with hourly timescale drechsel et al 1953 lewis 1978 lewis and roberts 1982 focused on elevated temperatures brodman et al 1975 or used organic co solvent winkler and starks 1988 a systematic investigation on the dynamics of em transport in and out of nitrocellulose is thus needed this study aims to explore the role of nitrocellulose in the leaching of residue bound ng and 2 4 dnt two commonly encountered propellant ems the uptake and desorption dynamics of ng and 2 4 dnt through military grade nitrocellulose matrix was investigated in model batch experiments at various conditions and analyzed using empirical and mechanistic kinetic models kinetic observations reported from other leaching studies were then re interpreted using the acquired kinetic characterization and understanding specifically three questions were examined i can the adsorption and desorption kinetics of ng and 2 4 dnt be modeled mechanistically based on their sorption isotherms and the system properties such as dissolved concentration and solid to water ratio ii can the leaching behavior of ems from propellant residues both fired and unfired be explained by the sorptive interaction between ems and nitrocellulose iii is it possible to relate desorption kinetics at later times to that in the early times raw manufactured nitrocellulose was preferred over propellant grains as it afforded better experimental control greater compositional homogeneity and shorter sorption desorption duration this study intends to explore these possibilities and questions using nitrocellulose rather than live fired particles as a model matrix compositional heterogeneity and variable combustion history of different residue particles make them difficult to be used in controlled laboratory setting 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals nitrocellulose 12 55 nitrogen and

solutions i e tests controls and blanks and calibration standards contained 0 01 m nan3 as biocide glass vessels were used in the preparation and conducting of all experiments 2 2 characterization of

in number of pixels and then normalized to the number of pixels representing 1 mm pixel analysis suggested that the individual fibers had an average diameter of 48 8 μm n 15 and an average length of 410 190 μm n 30 hydration volume i e the volume of water required to fully hydrate a given mass of nitrocellulose was measured to be 2 80 gwat gnitrocellulose kuo et al 2017 2 3 sorption kinetics of ng and 2 4 dnt onto nitrocellulose sorption kinetics of ng and 2 4 dnt onto nitrocellulose were examined for ng kinetic experiments were conducted at five nitrocellulose to water ratios r nc 260 650 1430 2880 and 7010 mgnitrocellulose l for 240 h in glass vials or bottles with teflon lined screw on caps 70 ml of solution containing 17 4 mg l ng was added to each vessel masses of nitrocellulose 0

concentrations 1 55 3 28 12 8 32 1 and 60 7 mg l for 384 h the 2 4 dnt experiment was conducted for a longer period because preliminary results suggested its kinetics may be slower 40 ml of the solutions were placed with 200 0 5 mg of nitrocellulose both ng and 2 4 dnt experiments were run in replicates with controls i e em but no nitrocellulose and blanks i e nitrocellulose but no em all glass vessels and their contents were vortexed for 15s and mixed end over end at 30 rpm rotary extractor lars lande whitmore lake mi two samples were withdrawn from the vessels at specific times 0 1 4 10 48 and 96 h for ng 0 48 96 192 and 384 h for 2 4 dnt and analyzed for ng and 2 4 dnt all vials were filled with solution or water to minimize evaporative loss to head space controls suggested that no noticeable loss of both ems occurred during the experiment as desorption kinetics was the primary focus influence of concentration variability on ng and r nc variability on 2 4 dnt were not investigated to minimize experimentation a summary of the experiment setup is available supplementary information s1 2 4 desorption kinetics of ng and 2 4 dnt from nitrocellulose desorption experiment was investigated on ng and 2 4 dnt the two compounds were loaded onto nitrocellulose at three initial concentrations 50 200 and 450 mg l for ng 20 50 and 160 mg l for 2 4 dnt in three volumes of solution i e 10 40 and 200 ml the higher concentrations of loading solutions were necessary to ensure that the aqueous phase concentrations during desorption were within the range of the sorption isotherms kuo et al 2017 prior to conducting the desorption experiment ng and 2 4 dnt had to be loaded onto the nitrocellulose matrix in the loading adsorption phase ng and 2 4 dnt were allowed to sorb onto nitrocellulose in 10 ml glass vials for 30 and 50 d respectively preliminary adsorption kinetic results suggested that adsorption equilibrium was established after 200 500 h for both compounds supplementary information s2 the longer 30 to 50 d incubation periods were selected to ensure true equilibrium was established prior to desorption experiments each vial contained 10 ml of ng or 2 4 dnt solutions and pre hydrated nitrocellulose 40 0 5 mg and 20 0 5 mg for ng and 2 4 dnt respectively the exact volume of solution added was determined gravimetrically each vial was vortexed for 15 s and then mixed end to end at a rate of 30 rpm for 720 1200 h 3 5 ml of the post equilibrium solution was transferred and processed for hplc analysis the nitrocellulose mass sorbed with ng or 2 4 dnt was then used for desorption experiment desorption kinetics was examined for both ng and 2 4 dnt for approximately 10 d the em loaded nitrocellulose mass was transferred to 10 40 or 200 ml glass vials jars residual solution transferred along with the nitrocellulose was gravimetrically determined by weighing and used in later calculations 10 40 or 200 ml of em free solution was introduced to the vials jars all vessels and their content were mixed end to end at 30 rpm all vials were filled with solution or water to minimize evaporative loss to head space controls suggested that no noticeable loss of both ems occurred during the experiment for 10 ml and 40 ml solutions duplicate vials jars were sacrificed at each sampling for 200 ml solution duplicates were run where 5 ml of samples was withdrawn from the same 200 ml jars at 0 1 4 8 48 and 200 h for both compounds all samples were filtered and analyzed by hplc a summary of the experiment setup is available supplementary information s1 2 5 hplc analysis ng and 2 4 dnt samples were processed and analyzed using a hplc based methodology previously developed in our laboratory gonzalez et al 2015 prior to hplc analysis samples were filtered to reduce injection of particulate matter into the column briefly the collected samples were drawn into a glass syringe and then filtered through a 0 45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf filter into borosilicate hplc vials care was taken to avoid cross sample contamination while removing particulate matter from the samples detailed procedure for the solution transfer and filtration is available in supplementary information s3 filtered aqueous samples of ng and 2 4 dnt were subsequently analyzed with an agilent 1200 series hplc uv unit with a zorbax sb c18 reverse phase column 4 6 50 mm 3 5 μm particle size a methanol water gradient program was run with methanol water volume ratio changed from 30 70 to 65 35 from 0 to 2 8 min and from 65 35 back to 30 70 from 2 8 to 3 2 min flowrate was set at 2 ml min and uv detector was operated at a single wavelength of 214 nm and 16 5 c the retention times for ng and 2 4 dnt were 2 89 and 3 29 min respectively standard solutions of ng and 2 4 dnt were prepared and used for calibration purpose 3 modelling of kinetic data adsorption and desorption kinetics were analyzed using the empirical first order kinetic model and the mechanistic intra particle diffusion ipd model the first order model supposes that the transient behavior of an adsorbate desorbate during adsorption and desorption in a batch system can be modeled as 1a ln c c o k t a d s o r p t i o n 1b ln c c c c d e s o k t d e s o r p t i o n where c o and c mg l and are the concentration at the initial time and time t respectively c des o and c mg l are the initial and equilibrium aqueous concentrations during desorption respectively t h is the time elapsed k h 1 is the first order adsorption or desorption rate constant in practice net ad de sorption rate decreases with time as the concentration gradient driving the process diminishes the first order model is thus more applicable to the early times when the backward desorption or adsorption rate is relatively small plotting experimental data along equation 1a or 1b suggests that two domains of distinctive slopes can be identified a fast domain 0 10 h and a slow domain 10 200 h the rate constants for the two domains k fast and k slow were obtained from linear regression applied to the data points in the respective domains c was estimated via mass balance based on nitrocellulose to water ratios using the sorption isotherms determined previously kuo et al 2017 table 1 3 1 intra particle diffusion model wetted nitrocellulose mass has the appearance of a lump of cotton and may be approximated as a spherical body with diameter a with this assumption the transient uptake of adsorbate by the nitrocellulose mass from a closed aqueous phase can be depicted as crank 1980 2a m t m 1 n 1 6 α 1 α 9 9 α α 2 q n 2 exp d e f f q n 2 t a 2 2b tan q n 3 q n 3 α q n 2 q n 0 2c α 1 r n c k d where m t and m are the sorbed adsorbate mass at time t and infinite time respectively α is a dimensionless ratio accounts for sorbent aqueous phase partitioning k d lwat kgnc and sorbent mass to water ratio r nc kgnc lwat d eff is the effective diffusivity within the sorbent cm2 s a is the radius of the sphere cm t is time s q n is the nth root for equation 2b d eff is typically determined by fitting experimental kinetic data and may be interpreted within presupposed mechanistic picture of the diffusion process the transport of ems through the nitrocellulose matrix was hypothesized to follow the intra particle diffusion model wu and gschwend 1988 1986 with d eff mathematically expressed as 3 d e f f d i w ϕ 2 1 ϕ ρ s k d ϕ d iw is the aqueous molecular diffusivity cm2 s ϕ is the sorbent porosity lwat ltot ρ s is the density of the dry fiber kg l k d is the nitrocellulose water partition coefficient l kg the ipd model i e equation 3 assumes that the partitioning of solute between the pore water and the fiber is instantaneous relative to the diffusion of the solute through the porous space it links kinetic observations to system and sorbent properties and provides a mechanistic account for solute transport exchange between the sorbent and the bulk aqueous environment at the microscopic level when modeling data with idp a time averaged k d over the course of de sorption was used to fit the data of a particular experiment the constant k d assumption was deemed reasonable as k d s varied by no more than 5 15 in all experiments over the entire time course ϕ and ρ s were estimated to be 0 81 lwat lbulk and 1 5 kg l respectively distribution of fiber dimensions or pore size as well as aggregation disaggregation dynamics were not considered the best fit d eff the sole fitting parameter in the modeling exercise was determined by minimizing the sum squares of errors between the observed and the simulated m t m i e equation 2a 4 results and discussion 4 1 sorption and desorption kinetics by the first order model analysis of sorption kinetic data using the first order model was generally satisfactory r 2 0 8 and the resulting rate constants are summarized in table 1 fig 1 showed that all ng and 2 4 dnt adsorption and desorption kinetic data could be fitted to a fast domain 0 10 h and a slow domain 10 100 h with r 2 ranging from 0 80 to 0 91 and 0 93 to 1 0 for k fast and k slow respectively for ng adsorption k fast approximately 10 30 times of k slow ng sorption was examined at various nitrocellulose to water ratios r nc and both k fast and k slow varied linearly with r nc fig 2 the observed dependence is consistent with the theoretical expectation that uptake rate increases with the sorbent concentration crank 1980 wu and gschwend 1988 for 2 4 dnt sorption only initial solute concentration c o was varied and k s showed no apparent dependence on c o table 1 supplementary information s4 desorption rate constants correlated weakly with r nc table 1 for ng the average k fast and k slow were found to be 0 053 0 023 h 1 and 0 0049 0 0021 h 1 respectively the desorption rate constants were higher for 2 4 dnt with k fast and k slow at 0 073 0 028 h 1 and 0 015 0 006 h 1 respectively the mean desorption k s were significantly higher than the mean adsorption k s for both compounds this difference was more prominent with 2 4 dnt k desorption s 4 6 k adsorption s than with ng k desorption s 2 3 k adsorption s and may be explained by the binding energy difference during sorption and desorption retardation in intra matrix transport will be the strongest as solutes were adsorbing onto the pristine nitrocellulose because of the non linear isotherms table 1 during desorption as a result of sorption nonlinearity the leaving molecules will initially experience less retardation as the energetically favorable binding sites have been occupied this interpretation is further supported by the 2 4 dnt isotherm n fr 0 668 being more non linear than the ng isotherm n fr 0 916 although as a smaller molecular 2 4 dnt can diffuse 10 faster than ng in water estimated aqueous diffusivities for 2 4 dnt and ng are 9 0 10 6 and 8 2 10 6 cm2 s respectively hayduk and laudie 1974 this likely results in minor contribution towards the kinetic difference between ng and 2 4 dnt comparison between desorption endpoints and expected equilibrium concentrations indicate that both ng and 2 4 dnt were close to equilibrium at the end of the desorption experiments expected equilibrium concentrations calculated from the sorption isotherms of ng and 2 4 dnt table 1 generally agreed well with the end point measurements to within 25 or 0 1 log unit fig 3 the close agreement between end measurements and equilibrium calculation suggests that equilibrium may be more or less established in the desorption experiments within 200 h this is also indirectly supported by the fact that both k fast and k slow are numerically greater in desorption than in adsorption for ng and 2 4 dnt table 1 this agreement provides consistency to the use of calculated desorption equilibrium i e c in the derivation of k fast s and k slow s 4 2 adsorption and desorption kinetics nitrocellulose vs soil previous sorption desorption studies on ems have focused mainly on soils or soil suspensions taylor et al 2012 reported a k of 0 011 0 032 h 1 and of 0 0076 0 015 h 1 for sorption of ng and 2 4 dnt respectively these were comparable to the k s observed here for ng 0 0018 0 025 h 1 and 2 4 dnt 0 0026 0 019 h 1 transformation rate constants k transform of ng and 2 4 dnt in various soils have also been reported brannon and pennington 2002 pennington et al 2006 1999 these were determined from the disappearance of dissolved compound in the presence of soils or sorbents brannon and myers 1997 and reflected the combined influence of sorption and degradation pennington et al 2006 k transform of 0 002 0 095 h 1 pennington et al 2002 and 0 0005 to 0 0021 h 1 pennington et al 1999 were reported for ng and 2 4 dnt respectively although not directly comparable the magnitudes of these transformation rate coefficients also suggested the sorption rate constants reported here were reasonable desorption of ng or 2 4 dnt from soil has been less investigated and comparable kinetic data have not been available 4 3 diffusivity of ems in nitrocellulose matrix sorption and desorption kinetics observed in this study could be explained well with the intra particle diffusion model as model and theory derived d iw s generally agreed with each other sample data fittings are shown in fig 4 and in supplementary information s5 the sorption derived d iw s for ng and 2 4 dnt were 7 0 1 0 10 6 and 21 9 6 10 6 cm2 s respectively these were approximately within a factor of 2 to the estimates from established correlations hayduk and laudie 1974 wilke and chang 1955 8 4 10 6 and 9 3 10 6 cm2 s for ng and 2 4 dnt respectively similarly the desorption derived d iw s for ng and 2 4 dnt were 4 1 1 5 10 6 and 11 4 2 10 5 cm2 s respectively the agreement was reasonable given d iw s were derived independently using known system physical chemical properties i e r nc porosity diameter k d 4 4 interpreting the release of ems from propellant particles the intra particular diffusion model may help interpret the release kinetics of ems from propellant particles reported in earlier studies taylor et al clausen et al 2010 taylor et al 2012 examined the release of ng from unfired and fired propellant grains in batch tests and drip tests on four different ammunitions the original work reported effective diffusivities fitted to the early 10 d data d eff 0 10d for the batch runs following the approach outlined in the original work taylor et al 2012 d eff 0 10d were likewise derived for the other batch drip tests fig 5 the intra particular model was then used to predict d eff 0 10d using only the experimental conditions and properties provided best fit d eff 0 10d s are included in supplementary information s6 experimental and predicted d eff 0 10d s matched well for all experiments involving unfired propellants fig 6 a with predictions within a factor of 2 of the observations this agreement is significant as d eff 0 10d spanned over 2 orders of magnitude and the predictions were made without any a posteriori adjustment fitting implicit assumptions in equation 3 were that d eff was independent of time ng concentration and spatial position and that solute loading and grain properties were uniform and homogeneous within the propellant particle these approximations no longer held true in the later period i e 50 to 100 d of taylor et al s experiments a rigorous treatment of the later period data would require a finite difference wu and gschwend 1988 or finite element pitt 2011 simulation wherein ng mass concentration pore structure and d eff are spatially discretized and time marched according to governing transport equations as such modeling is beyond the scope of this study analysis in the manner of fig 6a has not been extended to the later period kinetics however the model was less capable of predicting d eff 0 10d of ng from the fired propellants in fig 6a for fired propellants experimental d eff 0 10d s for fired propellants 0 76 3 2 10 14 cm2 s were considerably lower than those in unfired grains 10 13 10 11 cm2 s only 1 out of 4 experimental d eff 0 10d s was correctly predicted although the mis predicted values were within 1 log unit of the measured d eff 0 10d s phasic heterogeneity within the fired residue grains i e unburned nitrocellulose partially burned content and charred outer rim introduced greater degree of uncertainties in the modeling effort as compositional homogeneity was assumed an encouraging result was that the early and late d eff s are correlated fig 6b d eff end s i e effective diffusivities fitted to the data during the last 20 d and d eff 0 10d s are logarithmically correlated as log d eff end 0 79 log d eff 0 10d 2 96 r 2 0 96 the exact form of the correlation and the values of the fitting parameters are less important as they will be refined with more observations similarly k fast s and k slow s are also correlated for ng and 2 4 dnt during both adsorption and desorption fig 6c the important implication of fig 6b and c is that the behavior of bound ems long after their deposit may be assessed empirically through d eff 0 10d or k fast which appears to be mechanistically predictable fig 6a or easy to measure 5 conclusion evidence from this work suggested that the kinetics of diffusion through the nitrocellulose matrix may be central to understanding the release of ems from propellant grains although some ems in their dissolved forms can be degraded and even mineralized in engineering and natural systems bordeleau et al 2014 clausen et al 2011 fuller et al 2005 their desorption from the nitrocellulose binding matrix may be the key process that control the fate and persistence of propellant bound ems in the environment experimental investigations have also attributed slow dissolution and diffusion through nitrocellulose as possible causes of slow release of propellant bound ems dontsova et al 2009 2008 taylor et al 2012 our observations together with these earlier findings suggest that slow desorption through binding matrix can be an important mechanism pathway in explaining some of the observed slow dissipation of field ems bound to fired residues bausinger et al 2007 wijker et al 2013 timescales of the dissipation process can have significant regulatory and remediation implications for monitoring and managing em contaminated sites the release kinetics of propellant bounded ems may be predictable using the intra particle diffusion model given the fundamental sorbent and sorbate properties this was illustrated with the prediction of d eff 0 10d for ng from fresh propellants fig 6a further validation on the simple model to the later desorption release period through finite difference or finite element analyses is needed empirical correlation may also be developed to link up d eff in the later time to d eff 0 10d fig 6b offering a quick practical way for assessment and management purposes the leaching behavior from fired spent propellants is generally slower and harder to predict fig 6a and may require microscopic characterization of the heterogeneity within the residue particles electron microscopic images can show transport relevant morphological features e g cracks shapes of intact or sliced munition residues taylor et al 2012 elemental mapping of c and n kuo et al 2013 can reveal the presence of graphitized crusts and islands of unburned nitrocellulose within the fired munition grains these morphological characterizations may be used to construct predictive model for the leaching kinetics of ems from fired propellant residues based on the firing condition or the distance from firing point jenkins et al 2006 walsh et al 2012 such correlation or model would provide a better assessment on the transport potential or environmental hazard level associated with the residues bound propellant constituents results from this study merely provide benchmark behavior for residues bound ems under idealized laboratory condition future investigations on live fired propellant residues and ingeniously designed are needed it is possible that ems associated with fired residues may remain occluded for extended period of field weathering it is also worthwhile to investigate the role that sorption desorption plays in the environmental availability of other ems both well characterized and emerging ones from the binding materials in various fresh or spent munitions the uptake kinetics may also serve as reference in cleanup or remediation effort considering that sorptive cleanup methodology has been proposed fuller et al 2005 2004 acknowledgments we

19874,the western mountain aquifer yarkon taninim of israel is one of the country s major water resources and partially flows through a karst system during late winter 2013 maintenance actions were performed on a central sewage pipe that caused sewage to leak into the creek located in the study area carbamazepine cbz was used as an indicator for the presence of sewage in the groundwater the research goal was to develop a mathematical model for quantifying flow and contaminant transport processes in the karst fractured porous unsaturated zone and groundwater system the model was used to simulate cbz transport during and after an observed sewage leakage event a quasi 3d dual permeability numerical model represents the vadose zone aquifer system by a series of 1d vertical flow and transport equations solved in a variably saturated zone and by 3d saturated flow and transport equation in groundwater the results of simulation showed that after the leakage stopped significant amounts of cbz were retained in the porous matrix of the unsaturated zone below the creek water redistribution and slow recharge during the dry summer season contributed to a continuous supply of cbz to the groundwater in the vicinity of the creek and hundreds of meters downstream graphical abstract image keywords carbamazepine karst aquifer dual permeability model vadose zone vulnerability 1 introduction sewage infiltration and pollution of groundwater is a worldwide problem all the more so in carbonate aquifers where preferential flow paths exist in order to better understand the potential threat from sewage pollution on vulnerable groundwater sources there is a need to predict and quantify sewage infiltration processes however the complicated nature of the interactions between the matrix and conduits geyer et al 2007 is the main obstacle to making predictions about sewage infiltration in flow and transport systems such as carbonate aquifers only a few contaminants found in wastewater which originate from anthropogenic use can also serve as good indicators for anthropogenically impacted water sources such as untreated treated sewage among those contaminants the micro contaminant carbamazepine cbz is both widely used and approved as a stable indicator for sewage contamination in groundwater clara et al 2004 fenz et al 2005 gasser et al 2010 moreover cbz s conservative nature has also been supported by sand column experiments where partition coefficients values kd were 0 21 5 32 l kg 1 scheytt et al 2005 rona et al 2014 developed a 3d flow and transport model to simulate groundwater contamination due to wastewater recharge using cbz and chloride as tracers furthermore gasser et al 2014 used a combination of chloride acesulfame and cbz to quantify the ratio between pristine water and effluent in karst area springs in the aforementioned study a good correlation was observed between carbamazepine and acesulfame abundances which the authors attributed to a single source for both contaminant and minimal retardation of the two contaminants in the karst aquifer despite evidence that cbz has been shown to sorb into the upper soil layers that are rich in organic matter on some level arye et al 2011 chefetz et al 2008 williams and mclain 2012 the overall transport of cbz is conservative even in soil aquifer treatment sat system sites arye et al 2011 as such cbz was found to be a suitable tracer for karst flow systems analysis the fate of cbz in karst systems has not been adequately studied hillebrand et al 2012a several studies of karst system springs have implied that cbz is persistent in aquifers given that cbz was detected in groundwater at background level concentrations doummar et al 2014 gasser et al 2014 10 3 ng l up to 30 ng l respectively manamsa et al 2015 showed a link between surface water maximum cbz concentrations and its maximum concentrations in a chalk aquifer in another study doummar et al 2014 presented cbz introduction into the system through fast flow pathways with a rapid flow component however hillebrand et al 2012b concluded that cbz was ineffective as an indicator in the studied karst system since it was only detected during the spring season at very low concentrations that did not exceed the method quantification limit the above studies indicate that cbz flow and transport in carbonate systems is highly affected from interactions between the matrix and the karst fracture conduits flow paths the major gap in current studies which limits the efficiency of evaluating cbz as a stable indicator in karst systems is that the cbz transport has yet to be studied with a model using the dual continuum approach dual continuum models integrate two or more different conceptual approaches macquarrie and mayer 2005 kurtzman et al 2016 such models may more accurately predict cbz s fate in carbonate flow systems since the mechanism of exchange between the matrix and the conduits may have a significant effect on the cbz transport the objective of this study was to develop and apply a dual permeability mathematical model for simulating water flow and cbz transport processes in karst fractured porous unsaturated zone and groundwater system the simulations were used to characterize the processes of cbz natural attenuation from the initial input concentration at the ground surface into the vadose zone and throughout the aquifer our hypothesis was that cbz can serve as an indicator for wastewater migration in the matrix and along conduits in the unsaturated zone and groundwater this paper details the flow and transport model used to describe sewage infiltration through a thick unsaturated zone and its dilution in the groundwater of a carbonate aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewage discharge event the study area is located on the sorek creek west of the city of jerusalem israel fig 1 at this site the sorek creek drains a catchment area of approximately 88 km2 2 05 km upstream a reservoir beit zait collects runoff water and limits downstream natural surface flow reservoir dam overflows take place every few rainy seasons during the spring season water is regularly released from the dam downstream the local geology of the study area is composed of the carbonate judea group fig 2 the groundwater level is deep ranging from tens of meters to a couple hundred meters the general flow direction is south west the characteristics of the thick unsaturated flow were described by dvory et al 2016 who revealed a relationship between precipitation groundwater recharge and groundwater level the current research examines an event which occurred in 2013 when sewage was discharged from a major sewage pipeline located along the sorek creek this pipeline collects sewage from west jerusalem and other local settlements and diverts it towards a treatment plant fig 1 as a result of maintenance actions between april 2nd and april 19th 2013 sewage was discharged on five separate occasions into the natural creek fig 1 fig 3 c in order to limit additional contamination a collection pipe was setup 2 45 km downstream of the discharge site five days later the stream was flushed with fresh water which was released from the beit zait dam reservoir a total of 28 125 m3 of sewage was released into the creek during this period of which 5553 m3 was collected by the collection pipe back to the sewage system while the rest infiltrated into the subsurface then 32 069 m3 of reservoir water flushed the stream bedrock and infiltrated into the subsurface infiltration volumes of both the sewage and the fresh water were used in the models to prescribe the boundary condition along the creek bed cbz was used as an indicator for identification and quantification of sewage entering the groundwater 2 2 sampling and monitoring in order to monitor the fate of the discharged sewage water sampling and hydrological monitoring of both surface water and groundwater was performed prior to the sewage discharge event samples were taken from the beit zait reservoir and directly from the sorek sewage pipeline groundwater sampling was carried out at the depth of 100 m below ground surface in the ek11 observation well fig 1 the local geology in the area of the observation well is characterized by an extensive conduit network that continues from the ground surface to the aquifer therefore the groundwater level has very fast response to infiltration events dvory et al 2016 groundwater samples were collected over a period of 310 days in total twenty three groundwater samples were taken the sampling interval varied between one and fifty six days the sampling interval was shorter during the expected tracer breakthrough time thus a high temporal resolution of the cbz tracer breakthrough curve btc was achieved a dual groundwater level and temperature data logger was installed in the ek11 observation well in the soreq creek to make measurements every 30 min solinst levelogger data on measured hourly precipitation and evaporation rates were obtained from the israel meteorological service ims tzuba station sewage and surface water runoff discharges were acquired from gauging stations fig 1 2 3 laboratory analysis cbz was analysed by gc ms according to the epa method 8270 d and by lc ms ms according to the epa method 1694 for both methods cbz was first extracted from natural samples by solid phase extraction spe using c18 empore high performance extraction disks aliquots of 1 μl of the final extracts were separated at agilent gas chromatograph 6890n db 5ms column of 0 25 30 m 1μ with ms detector 5973 analyte was quantified in full scan m z 44 450 0 4 s scan or selected ion monitoring sim mode using the ions 193 for quantification and 236 165 and 192 ions for confirmation the limit of quantification loq for gc ms analysis was 100 ng l for samples with cbz concentrations less than the gc ms method loq the analysis

models integrate different conceptual approaches macquarrie and mayer 2005 such as the use of two coupled richards equations gerke and van genuchten 1993 kordilla et al 2012 pruess et al 1999 the kinematics wave equation for the karst fractures and the richards equation for the porous matrix jarvis 1994 turbulent conduit flow cornaton and perrochet 2002 coupled with laminar matrix flow de rooij 2008 and combining the darcy buckingham law and the continuity equation nimmo 2010 the dual permeability approach for karst fractured porous medium is described by two overlapping continua representing highly conductive karst fractures conduits c and the low permeability matrix m the numerical model was implemented on the basis of a quasi 3d approach levy et al 2017 twarakavi et al 2008 yakirevich et al 1998 which represents the vadose zone aquifer system by solving a series of 1d equations in variably saturated zone and 3d saturated flow and transport equation in groundwater the 1d and 3d equations are coupled at the moving phreatic surface kuznetsov et al 2012 the horizontal flow for media in the vadose zone and horizontal flow in porous blocks were neglected the flow in high and low conductivity regions is described by two richards equations respectively 1 r c θ c t r c k c ψ c z e c m 2 1 r c θ m t z 1 r c k m ψ m z k m e c m where θ i is water content ψ i is the

otherwise the first condition in 3 means that flow from matrix to conduit can occur only if the matrix is fully saturated i e under conditions of the seepage face the first order transfer coefficient α m is calculated as gerke and van genuchten 1993 4 α m β a 2 γ w k a where β is a factor depending on the geometry of the blocks a represents the distance from the center of a fictitious matrix block to the karst fracture boundary γ w is an empirical coefficient and k a is the hydraulic conductivity evaluated as a function of the average pressure head between two regions retention curves of both conduit and porous matrix are calculated by the van genuchten 1980 equation 5 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n m ψ 0 m 1 1 n where s e θ θ r θ s θ r is the effective saturation θ s water content at

from the creek channel that was estimated by the difference in stream flow rate between stream gauges δ x l x y l y is the delta function and x l and y l are coordinates of creek location note that the one dimensional model of water flow in the unsaturated zone does not account for runoff water downstream yet local runoff is accounted for when calculated pressure head becomes positive on the ground surface flooding thus in the case of an intensive precipitation event in which calculated water flux through the matrix exceeds the matrix s ability to conduct water the total flux is redistributed between the matrix to the conduit following simple mass balance relations gerke and van genuchten 1993 the bottom of the aquifer is considered to be a no flow boundary for both conduit and matrix continua the northern and southern borders were prescribed as no flow boundary conditions because the hydraulic head equipotentials are perpendicular to these borders indicating groundwater flow lines parallel to them distribution of piezometric heads along the eastern and western border indicates the possibility of groundwater flow across these boundaries ground water flow enters at the eastern border and exits at the western border therefore at the eastern boundary the dirichlet boundary condition head boundary was assigned with water level changing in time we used observed transient water head in well ek4 at the western boundary the cauchy boundary condition was assigned prescribing the water flux through the boundary depending on water level outside the boundary and simulated water level inside the domain close to the boundary 12 n r c k c h ψ z c d ψ z h d if ψ 0 13 n r c k c h ψ z 0 if ψ 0 where c d is a conductance 1 m and h d is a regional groundwater level at some distance from the simulated location both are fitting parameters for the solute transport the concentration flux is prescribed at the boundaries where inflow occurs and there is zero concentration gradient otherwise the initial condition for water flow prescribed distribution of pressure heads in conduit and porous matrix domains they were obtained by running the model for a time period of 5 years prior to simulated leakage events starting from equilibrium conditions the initial condition for contaminant transport defines the distribution of cbz in the unsaturated zone and groundwater which is generally unknown except measured in the well ek11 possible initial condition scenarios will be discussed in section 3 2 2 4 2 numerical model setup the model equations were solved using method of finite differences we modified the modflow model harbaugh et al 2000 to couple it with 1d richards equations kuznetsov et al 2012 and to account for a double permeability approach the mt3d zheng and wang 1999 numerical code was applied to simulate solute transport and the groundwater modeling software gms 6 0 2002 was used for pre and post processing data the flow and transport problems were solved in two phases 1 simulating water flow in a large domain with well defined hydrogeological boundaries and using a coarse grid and 2 simulating water flow and cbz transport in a smaller domain and using refined grid fig 1 this was done to decrease simulation time and to increase accuracy of transport problem solution given the lack of central processing unit cpu memory the size of the large domain was 1600 1400 m in horizontal plane and it varied in vertical direction from 170 m to 445 m depending on altitude of ground surface and the aquifer bottom the horizontal uniform grid size was 20 20 m while the vertical grid was composed of 38 layers with size increasing from 0 0002l to 0 1l l x y is the aquifer thickness including the unsaturated zone the simulations in the large domain aimed at calibrating flow model with respect to the hydraulic parameters and the western lateral boundary condition the size of the small domain was 590 460 m in horizontal plane and it varied in vertical direction from 185 to 280 m depending on altitude of ground surface and the aquifer bottom the horizontal grid size was a uniform 10 10 m while the vertical grid was the same as for the large domain when solving equations for the small domain the transient boundary conditions were adopted from the solution in the large domain gms 6 0 tutorials vol 2 the simulations in the small domain aimed at calibrating the cbz transport model with respect to hydrodynamic dispersivities and the exchange rate parameter between matrix and conduit domains the basic assumption was that the hydraulic and solute transport parameters do not change with time and space in the simulation domains 2 4 3 model calibration and sensitivity analysis the flow component of the model was calibrated by trial and error to fit the simulated water level in ek11 to the observed ones in 2013 the following parameters were estimated the ratio of vertical to horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity k s k s horiz the conductance c d and the water level h d at the western boundary the rest of the parameters characterizing the vadose zone hydraulic properties were adopted from dvory et al 2016 who calibrated them using a 1d dual permeability model for several wells in the study area including ek11 table 1 the transport component of the model was calibrated using the pest software doherty 2004 by minimizing the least squared errors between the simulated and observed values of cbz concentrations in ek11 sampled from the depth of 100 m from the ground surface during 2013 the following parameters were determined longitudinal dispersivity a l ratios of transverse to longitudinal and ratios of vertical to longitudinal a t a l and a z a l exchange rate parameter η c and the distribution coefficient k d for cbz sorption the sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the effect of solute transport parameters on simulated concentration the analysis procedure included varying a single parameter from its best fit value at the calibrated model and comparing the root mean square errors rmse of the obtained simulation results to the calibrated model rmse s values 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater level and cbz concentration in ek11 sewage and runoff water infiltration had a direct effect on both groundwater level and quality fig 3 during january to february 2013 the groundwater level rose due to winter precipitations and a runoff event caused by beit zait dam overflow later during pipeline maintenance activities in april 2013 sewage was released five times into the creek causing infiltration of 12 m3 2 422 m3 4 802 m3 6 226 m3 and 9 111 m3 on each of those occasions excluding the first one with a small sewage volume groundwater response was documented rise of up to 9 3 m complete water level relaxation was not obtained between leakage events due to the short time intervals between their occurrences five days later when water was discharged from the reservoir and infiltrated along the creek an additional water level rise occurred to 16 6 m above the initial natural aquifer conditions during the dry season june to october 2013 a slow groundwater level decrease was observed in december 2013 groundwater level rose due to winter precipitations and a runoff event caused by beit zait dam overflow overall the above described hydrological monitoring represents a point to point source response mechanism which was also reflected by the cbz fate in the groundwater cbz concentration was initially measured in the ek11 observation well on july 4 2012 3 7 ng l another measurement prior to the pipeline maintenance actions occurred on february 15 2013 and on april 2 2013 7 ng l and 5 7 ng l respectively those values present base level cbz contamination within the groundwater near the creek groundwater samples were also taken from ek7 fig 1 an adjacent observation well on july 4 2012 where chemical analysis showed similar base level cbz concentration 4 3 ng l the reservoir water samples prior to the dam opening on february 15 2013 and on april 23 2013 had cbz concentrations of 38 ng l and 31 ng l respectively cbz concentration in sewage as measured on april 7 2013 was 955 ng l this value is slightly lower than the average cbz levels in the israeli wastewater utilities 1321 204 ng l gasser et al 2011 during the sewage discharge event three main cbz concentration peaks were documented in groundwater samples taken from ek11 21 0 ng l 25 9 ng l and 47 0 ng l respectively the first two peaks were related to the release of sewage and the third cbz concentration peak was linked to the later episode of the reservoir water discharge into the creek cbz concentration dropped between sewage leakages episodes to 12 2 ng l and 15 2 ng l respectively however measured levels did not reach the initial pre event concentration levels in addition the third cbz concentration peak was higher both in level and in duration implying that the dam water infiltration resulted in an effective flash of contaminant from the thick unsaturated zone during the summer cbz concentration decreased with groundwater level descent while an increase in concentration was observed up to 11 0 ng l due to resuming winter precipitation and runoff water infiltration after dam overflow in december 3 2 modeling results calibrating the flow model to the observed groundwater level in ek11 yielded good agreement between measured and observed groundwater levels calibrated model parameters are presented in table 1 the model simulates rapid water infiltration through fast flow paths conduits and quick groundwater response to either intensive precipitation or surface water discharge fig 3 the model predicts fairly well the water level fluctuation in january april and its rise and drop during sewage and reservoir water discharge into the creek yet relatively large differences were detected between the simulated and observed water levels the model described very well the decrease of water level to around 410 m during dry season may november and its subsequent rise to around 450 m in december as a response to rain precipitation and discharge of reservoir water into the creek the determination coefficient and the root mean square error were 0 91 and 3 26 m respectively fig 4 demonstrates the distribution of simulated groundwater level in the study area at different times before the discharge of the sewage and the reservoir water april 7 there was a relatively uniform groundwater flow in the south west direction after sewage water was discharged april 19 a groundwater mound was developed near the creek changing flow direction in its vicinity the gradient of piezometric head was higher in the south west direction compared to that in the north east direction therefore a faster spread of contaminants is expected towards south west by the end of dry season october 18 the water flow is quite similar to that before water discharge events in april temporal local groundwater mounding was observed in the area of the aquifer and was discussed in details by dvory et al 2016 the simulated 3d temporal groundwater mounding plays a major role in understanding the contamination transport mechanism in the unsaturated zone and the aquifer from early stages of the study it was known that there was background cbz pollution within the aquifer due to sewage systems failures yet the exact disposal of the sewage volumes were not measured tzipori 2013 therefore the distribution of cbz in the unsaturated zone and groundwater is unknown consequently two scenarios for initial conditions were considered 1 zero initial concentration zc scenario in the entire domain 2 background initial pollution bp scenario by prescribing the initial cbz distribution on 01 01 2013 as the final concentration distribution simulated on 31 12 2013 in the zc scenario the transport model was calibrated for the zc scenario and simulation was repeated with calibrated parameters for the bp scenario fig 5 illustrates the results of both the zc and bp scenarios to compare between simulated and observed cbz concentration in ek11 both simulated btcs discard smaller concentration fluctuations at the early stage of sewage water infiltration however correctly predict the major peak of the cbz concentration the zc scenario underestimates cbz concentration before sewage water release the occurrence of earlier pollution bp scenario yields better fit during the early stages of the simulation period later the cbz simulated levels remain higher than the measured concentration or the simulated concentration in the zc scenario better fit was obtained in bp scenario when the cbz concentration rose again due to precipitation in december the root mean square error rmse in bp scenario was 7 4 ng l which is a bit better than in the zc simulation with rmse 9 2 ng l calibrated model parameters for cbz transport are presented in table 2 the value of longitudinal dispersivity a l 6 44 m corresponds to its order of magnitude for field scale of a few hundred meters neuman 1990 the value of the distribution coefficient was 0 011 l kg which indicates low sorption of cbz this could possibly be attributed to the low organic matter content in the rock material in the study area while cbz occurs primarily in soil organic matter zhang et al 2010 when solving the inverse problem the objective function was not sensitive to changes in ratios of transversal and vertical dispersivities to longitudinal dispersivity 3 3 sensitivity analysis in order to examine the sensitivity of the transport model results to parameter variations parameters were varied within reasonable ranges around their calibrated values table 3 the sensitivity was assessed for the bp scenario because it is more realistic the quality of the resulting model fits was assessed by comparing the rmses between simulated and observed cbz concentration in ek11 and by visual comparison of the contaminant plume in the simulation domain the results of sensitivity analysis show that the model is mostly sensitive to changes in the solute exchange rate parameter η c and the conduit longitudinal dispersity a l and practically insensitive to changes in the vertical longitudinal ratio a z a l and the transverse longitudinal ratio a t a l variation in η c resulted in the largest changes in the cbz concentration a narrower or wider breakthrough curve is obtained by reducing η c by halving the original value or doubling it respectively fig 6 a additionally a decrease of η c yielded a higher cbz concentration before sewage release and of the cbz breakthrough peak decreasing η c also produced a larger spread of the contaminant in the aquifer in the direction of groundwater flow fig 7 and in the vertical section fig 8 in the calibrated model cbz concentration of 0 1 ng l about 0 01 of the cbz concentration in the sewage discharged onto the surface migrates 424 m downstream from the source at the creek multiplying the solute exchange rate parameter by 0 5 and by 2 0 enlarged the migration distance to over 430 m domain boundary or reduced it to 316 m respectively relative to the η c varying a l has smaller effect on the cbz concentration curve reducing the a l values slightly delays the breakthrough curve and enlarges the simulated cbz concentration fig 6b the reduction of this parameter also leads to a smaller spread of the contaminant both laterally and vertically enlarging the a l value produces a mirror behavior when comparing these results to the cbz 0 1 ng l concentration boundary in the calibrated model reveals a relatively small effect on the contamination distribution reducing the conduit longitudinal dispersity by half limits this boundary to 421 m and enlarging it by two expands this boundary to over 430 m domain boundary varying a z a l and a t a l values hardly influence the cbz concentration curve as can be seen in the rmse values this was because the concentration gradients in the direction perpendicular to flow were relatively small as can be seen in figs 7 and 8 3 4 cbz transport in karst fractured media the diffusion mechanism plays an important role in retaining the contaminant in low permeability zones the model also accounts for the advective exchange by water and solute between fractures and porous blocks which enhances the rate of diffusion and back diffusion processes shapiro 2001 found that the diffusion coefficient at the kilometer scale is at least 3 orders of magnitude greater than laboratory estimates of diffusion in crystalline rock indicating that diffusion into rock matrices is masked at the kilometer scale by advective mass exchange between fractures which have large contrasts in transmissivity the results of cbz transport simulations support the assumption that the contaminant is retained within the unsaturated zone by the end of the simulation period around 91 of the discharged cbz mass remained in the simulation domain 56 of which was in the unsaturated zone and 44 in the saturated zone 4 6 of modeled cbz concentrations were present in the conduits zones compared to 94 96 in porous matrix thus the contaminant stored in the unsaturated zone remains a significant potential source of groundwater pollution by back diffusion yang et al 2014 yet if there is no additional discharge of sewage from the surface the infiltration of precipitation and runoff water caused relatively low contaminant flush from the unsaturated porous matrix due to the low exchange rate discharge of water from the reservoir caused the groundwater mounding along the creek increasing piezometric gradient and enhances spread of pollution to extended distance consequently the pollution plume developed mainly towards south west fig 7 water redistribution and slow recharge during the dry summer season contributed to elevated cbz concentrations in the groundwater in the vicinity of the creek and tens of meters downstream the results of the sensitivity analysis show that cbz concentrations within the vadose and the saturated zones are highly affected by the solute exchange rate between the conduits and the porous matrix lower solute exchange rates result in lesser diffusion of contaminant into the matrix a greater mass of cbz reaching groundwater and a larger spread of cbz throughout the aquifer because the contaminant mass flux is mainly controlled by fast flow in fractures cbz concentrations alternate due to variations between fast and slow flow mechanism which was also reported by other researchers gasser et al 2014 who monitored six carbonate springs in northern israel reported higher cbz concentration levels during late winters 2010 to 2012 when fast flow existed due to precipitation infiltration doummar et al 2014 carried out a high resolution cbz breakthrough study in march 2011 at the jeita spring in lebanon in that study cbz concentration increase was monitored during precipitation events and was connected to flow through fast flow pathways with a rapid flow component later the authors showed that measurements of lower cbz concentration were related to old water flow into the system that stabilized the mass fluxes which remain constant in the spring water this study by doummar et al 2014 supports the proposed mechanism in which aquifer vulnerability rises during fast flow events when cbz remains in the conduits and propagates throughout the aquifer the site specific application of the model requires simplifications regarding input information it is desirable to estimate variations in model predictions due to the uncertainty of the inputs i e to assess uncertainty of prediction one major source of prediction uncertainty is the model parameters additionally model calibration by inverse solution is inherently ill posed and may lead to parameter equifinality beven and freer 2001 due to technical problems cbz concentration was only measured in one monitoring well in the current study an improved calibration can be achieved if measured concentration values of cbz from other monitoring sites can be used as inputs into the transport model on the other hand the sensitivity analysis shows that the model was sensitive to two parameters which reduce uncertainty longitudinal dispersivity and the rate of solute exchange between fracture and rock matrix another source of uncertainty is boundary conditions since the location of sinkholes along the creek was unknown in this study we assumed a uniform rate of sewage and water infiltration from the stream this led to a uniform front of contamination in the groundwater in real conditions spatial distribution of enhanced infiltration features can lead to faster migration of the contaminant in these locations estimating possible errors in our model predictions requires further independent research nevertheless the present study contributes to an improved understanding of wastewater contaminant transport in the vadose and saturated zones of carbonate aquifer 4 conclusion 1 a quasi 3d dual permeability mathematical model was applied to simulate the cbz transport in both the vadose and the saturated zones of karst aquifer results of simulations show that such an approach can be used to describe major mechanisms of flow and transport under considered conditions however the main limitation of the applied model is the assumption of only vertical flow in the unsaturated zone in places where the low permeability layers in the unsaturated zone extend significant distances conditions for developing perched water bodies and for essential lateral flow may limit use of quasi 3d approach 2 the results of the simulation show that after the sewage leakage stopped significant amounts of cbz were retained in the porous matrix of the unsaturated zone below the source zone water redistribution and slow recharge during the dry summer season contributed to elevated cbz concentrations in the groundwater in the vicinity of the creek and tens of meters downstream 3 during fast flow events the aquifer vulnerability increased due to low solute exchange rate lesser diffusion of contaminant into the matrix and a greater mass of cbz reaching the groundwater from the unsaturated zone as a result there was a larger spread of cbz throughout the aquifer acknowledgements the research was funded by the israeli water authority grant number 4500088042 the authors thank mr guy reshef

19874,the western mountain aquifer yarkon taninim of israel is one of the country s major water resources and partially flows through a karst system during late winter 2013 maintenance actions were performed on a central sewage pipe that caused sewage to leak into the creek located in the study area carbamazepine cbz was used as an indicator for the presence of sewage in the groundwater the research goal was to develop a mathematical model for quantifying flow and contaminant transport processes in the karst fractured porous unsaturated zone and groundwater system the model was used to simulate cbz transport during and after an observed sewage leakage event a quasi 3d dual permeability numerical model represents the vadose zone aquifer system by a series of 1d vertical flow and transport equations solved in a variably saturated zone and by 3d saturated flow and transport equation in groundwater the results of simulation showed that after the leakage stopped significant amounts of cbz were retained in the porous matrix of the unsaturated zone below the creek water redistribution and slow recharge during the dry summer season contributed to a continuous supply of cbz to the groundwater in the vicinity of the creek and hundreds of meters downstream graphical abstract image keywords carbamazepine karst aquifer dual permeability model vadose zone vulnerability 1 introduction sewage infiltration and pollution of groundwater is a worldwide problem all the more so in carbonate aquifers where preferential flow paths exist in order to better understand the potential threat from sewage pollution on vulnerable groundwater sources there is a need to predict and quantify sewage infiltration processes however the complicated nature of the interactions between the matrix and conduits geyer et al 2007 is the main obstacle to making predictions about sewage infiltration in flow and transport systems such as carbonate aquifers only a few contaminants found in wastewater which originate from anthropogenic use can also serve as good indicators for anthropogenically impacted water sources such as untreated treated sewage among those contaminants the micro contaminant carbamazepine cbz is both widely used and approved as a stable indicator for sewage contamination in groundwater clara et al 2004 fenz et al 2005 gasser et al 2010 moreover cbz s conservative nature has also been supported by sand column experiments where partition coefficients values kd were 0 21 5 32 l kg 1 scheytt et al 2005 rona et al 2014 developed a 3d flow and transport model to simulate groundwater contamination due to wastewater recharge using cbz and chloride as tracers furthermore gasser et al 2014 used a combination of chloride acesulfame and cbz to quantify the ratio between pristine water and effluent in karst area springs in the aforementioned study a good correlation was observed between carbamazepine and acesulfame abundances which the authors attributed to a single source for both contaminant and minimal retardation of the two contaminants in the karst aquifer despite evidence that cbz has been shown to sorb into the upper soil layers that are rich in organic matter on some level arye et al 2011 chefetz et al 2008 williams and mclain 2012 the overall transport of cbz is conservative even in soil aquifer treatment sat system sites arye et al 2011 as such cbz was found to be a suitable tracer for karst flow systems analysis the fate of cbz in karst systems has not been adequately studied hillebrand et al 2012a several studies of karst system springs have implied that cbz is persistent in aquifers given that cbz was detected in groundwater at background level concentrations doummar et al 2014 gasser et al 2014 10 3 ng l up to 30 ng l respectively manamsa et al 2015 showed a link between surface water maximum cbz concentrations and its maximum concentrations in a chalk aquifer in another study doummar et al 2014 presented cbz introduction into the system through fast flow pathways with a rapid flow component however hillebrand et al 2012b concluded that cbz was ineffective as an indicator in the studied karst system since it was only detected during the spring season at very low concentrations that did not exceed the method quantification limit the above studies indicate that cbz flow and transport in carbonate systems is highly affected from interactions between the matrix and the karst fracture conduits flow paths the major gap in current studies which limits the efficiency of evaluating cbz as a stable indicator in karst systems is that the cbz transport has yet to be studied with a model using the dual continuum approach dual continuum models integrate two or more different conceptual approaches macquarrie and mayer 2005 kurtzman et al 2016 such models may more accurately predict cbz s fate in carbonate flow systems since the mechanism of exchange between the matrix and the conduits may have a significant effect on the cbz transport the objective of this study was to develop and apply a dual permeability mathematical model for simulating water flow and cbz transport processes in karst fractured porous unsaturated zone and groundwater system the simulations were used to characterize the processes of cbz natural attenuation from the initial input concentration at the ground surface into the vadose zone and throughout the aquifer our hypothesis was that cbz can serve as an indicator for wastewater migration in the matrix and along conduits in the unsaturated zone and groundwater this paper details the flow and transport model used to describe sewage infiltration through a thick unsaturated zone and its dilution in the groundwater of a carbonate aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewage discharge event the study area is located on the sorek creek west of the city of jerusalem israel fig 1 at this site the sorek creek drains a catchment area of approximately 88 km2 2 05 km upstream a reservoir beit zait collects runoff water and limits downstream natural surface flow reservoir dam overflows take place every few rainy seasons during the spring season water is regularly released from the dam downstream the local geology of the study area is composed of the carbonate judea group fig 2 the groundwater level is deep ranging from tens of meters to a couple hundred meters the general flow direction is south west the characteristics of the thick unsaturated flow were described by dvory et al 2016 who revealed a relationship between precipitation groundwater recharge and groundwater level the current research examines an event which occurred in 2013 when sewage was discharged from a major sewage pipeline located along the sorek creek this pipeline collects sewage from west jerusalem and other local settlements and diverts it towards a treatment plant fig 1 as a result of maintenance actions between april 2nd and april 19th 2013 sewage was discharged on five separate occasions into the natural creek fig 1 fig 3 c in order to limit additional contamination a collection pipe was setup 2 45 km downstream of the discharge site five days later the stream was flushed with fresh water which was released from the beit zait dam reservoir a total of 28 125 m3 of sewage was released into the creek during this period of which 5553 m3 was collected by the collection pipe back to the sewage system while the rest infiltrated into the subsurface then 32 069 m3 of reservoir water flushed the stream bedrock and infiltrated into the subsurface infiltration volumes of both the sewage and the fresh water were used in the models to prescribe the boundary condition along the creek bed cbz was used as an indicator for identification and quantification of sewage entering the groundwater 2 2 sampling and monitoring in order to monitor the fate of the discharged sewage water sampling and hydrological monitoring of both surface water and groundwater was performed prior to the sewage discharge event samples were taken from the beit zait reservoir and directly from the sorek sewage pipeline groundwater sampling was carried out at the depth of 100 m below ground surface in the ek11 observation well fig 1 the local geology in the area of the observation well is characterized by an extensive conduit network that continues from the ground surface to the aquifer therefore the groundwater level has very fast response to infiltration events dvory et al 2016 groundwater samples were collected over a period of 310 days in total twenty three groundwater samples were taken the sampling interval varied between one and fifty six days the sampling interval was shorter during the expected tracer breakthrough time thus a high temporal resolution of the cbz tracer breakthrough curve btc was achieved a dual groundwater level and temperature data logger was installed in the ek11 observation well in the soreq creek to make measurements every 30 min solinst levelogger data on measured hourly precipitation and evaporation rates were obtained from the israel meteorological service ims tzuba station sewage and surface water runoff discharges were acquired from gauging stations fig 1 2 3 laboratory analysis cbz was analysed by gc ms according to the epa method 8270 d and by lc ms ms according to the epa method 1694 for both methods cbz was first extracted from natural samples by solid phase extraction spe using c18 empore high performance extraction disks aliquots of 1 μl of the final extracts were separated at agilent gas chromatograph 6890n db 5ms column of 0 25 30 m 1μ with ms detector 5973 analyte was quantified in full scan m z 44 450 0 4 s scan or selected ion monitoring sim mode using the ions 193 for quantification and 236 165 and 192 ions for confirmation the limit of quantification loq for gc ms analysis was 100 ng l for samples with cbz concentrations less than the gc ms method loq the analysis

rooij 2008 and combining the darcy buckingham law and the continuity equation nimmo 2010 the dual permeability approach for karst fractured porous medium is described by two overlapping continua representing highly conductive karst fractures conduits c and the low permeability matrix m the numerical model was implemented on the basis of a quasi 3d approach levy et al 2017 twarakavi et al 2008 yakirevich et al 1998 which represents the vadose zone aquifer system by solving a series of 1d equations in variably saturated zone and 3d saturated flow and transport equation in groundwater the 1d and 3d equations are coupled at the moving phreatic surface kuznetsov et al 2012 the horizontal flow for media in the vadose zone and horizontal flow in porous blocks were neglected the flow in high and low conductivity regions is described by two richards equations respectively 1 r c θ c t r c k c ψ c z e c m 2 1 r c θ m t z 1 r c k m ψ m z k m e c m where θ i is water content ψ i is the

to the karst fracture boundary γ w is an empirical coefficient and k a is the hydraulic conductivity evaluated as a function of the average pressure head between two regions retention curves of both conduit and porous matrix are calculated by the van genuchten 1980 equation 5 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n m ψ 0 m 1 1 n where s e θ θ r θ s θ r is the effective saturation θ s water content at

from the creek channel that was estimated by the difference in stream flow rate between stream gauges δ x l x y l y is the delta function and x l and y l are coordinates of creek location note that the one dimensional model of water flow in the unsaturated zone does not account for runoff water downstream yet local runoff is accounted for when calculated pressure head becomes positive on the ground surface flooding thus in the case of an intensive precipitation event in which calculated water flux through the matrix exceeds the matrix s ability to conduct water the total flux is redistributed between the matrix to the conduit following simple mass balance relations gerke and van genuchten 1993 the bottom of the aquifer is considered to be a no flow boundary for both conduit and matrix continua the northern and southern borders were prescribed as no flow boundary conditions because the hydraulic head equipotentials are perpendicular to these borders indicating groundwater flow lines parallel to them distribution of piezometric heads along the eastern and western border indicates the possibility of groundwater flow across these boundaries ground water flow enters at the eastern border and exits at the western border therefore at the eastern boundary the dirichlet boundary condition head boundary was assigned with water level changing in time we used observed transient water head in well ek4 at the western boundary the cauchy boundary condition was assigned prescribing the water flux through the boundary depending on water level outside the boundary and simulated water level inside the domain close to the boundary 12 n r c k c h ψ z c d ψ z h d if ψ 0 13 n r c k c h ψ z 0 if ψ 0 where c d is a conductance 1 m and h d is a regional groundwater level at some distance from the simulated location both are fitting parameters for the solute transport the concentration flux is prescribed at the boundaries where inflow occurs and there is zero concentration gradient otherwise the initial condition for water flow prescribed distribution of pressure heads in conduit and porous matrix domains they were obtained by running the model for a time period of 5 years prior to simulated leakage events starting from equilibrium conditions the initial condition for contaminant transport defines the distribution of cbz in the unsaturated zone and groundwater which is generally unknown except measured in the well ek11 possible initial condition scenarios will be discussed in section 3 2 2 4 2 numerical model setup the model equations were solved using method of finite differences we modified the modflow model harbaugh et al 2000 to couple it with 1d richards equations kuznetsov et al 2012 and to account for a double permeability approach the mt3d zheng and wang 1999 numerical code was applied to simulate solute transport and the groundwater modeling software gms 6 0 2002 was used for pre and post processing data the flow and transport problems were solved in two phases 1 simulating water flow in a large domain with well defined hydrogeological boundaries and using a coarse grid and 2 simulating water flow and cbz transport in a smaller domain and using refined grid fig 1 this was done to decrease simulation time and to increase accuracy of transport problem solution given the lack of central processing unit cpu memory the size of the large domain was 1600 1400 m in horizontal plane and it varied in vertical direction from 170 m to 445 m depending on altitude of ground surface and the aquifer bottom the horizontal uniform grid size was 20 20 m while the vertical grid was composed of 38 layers with size increasing from 0 0002l to 0 1l l x y is the aquifer thickness including the unsaturated zone the simulations in the large domain aimed at calibrating flow model with respect to the hydraulic parameters and the western lateral boundary condition the size of the small domain was 590 460 m in horizontal plane and it varied in vertical direction from 185 to 280 m depending on altitude of ground surface and the aquifer bottom the horizontal grid size was a uniform 10 10 m while the vertical grid was the same as for the large domain when solving equations for the small domain the transient boundary conditions were adopted from the solution in the large domain gms 6 0 tutorials vol 2 the simulations in the small domain aimed at calibrating the cbz transport model with respect to hydrodynamic dispersivities and the exchange rate parameter between matrix and conduit domains the basic assumption was that the hydraulic and solute transport parameters do not change with time and space in the simulation domains 2 4 3 model calibration and sensitivity analysis the flow component of the model was calibrated by trial and error to fit the simulated water level in ek11 to the observed ones in 2013 the following parameters were estimated the ratio of vertical to horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity k s k s horiz the conductance c d and the water level h d at the western boundary the rest of the parameters characterizing the vadose zone hydraulic properties were adopted from dvory et al 2016 who calibrated them using a 1d dual permeability model for several wells in the study area including ek11 table 1 the transport component of the model was calibrated using the pest software doherty 2004 by minimizing the least squared errors between the simulated and observed values of cbz concentrations in ek11 sampled from the depth of 100 m from the ground surface during 2013 the following parameters were determined longitudinal dispersivity a l ratios of transverse to longitudinal and ratios of vertical to longitudinal a t a l and a z a l exchange rate parameter η c and the distribution coefficient k d for cbz sorption the sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the effect of solute transport parameters on simulated concentration the analysis procedure included varying a single parameter from its best fit value at the calibrated model and comparing the root mean square errors rmse of the obtained simulation results to the calibrated model rmse s values 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater level and cbz concentration in ek11 sewage and runoff water infiltration had a direct effect on both groundwater level and quality fig 3 during january to february 2013 the groundwater level rose due to winter precipitations and a runoff event caused by beit zait dam overflow later during pipeline maintenance activities in april 2013 sewage was released five times into the creek causing infiltration of 12 m3 2 422 m3 4 802 m3 6 226 m3 and 9 111 m3 on each of those occasions excluding the first one with a small sewage volume groundwater response was documented rise of up to 9 3 m complete water level relaxation was not obtained between leakage events due to the short time intervals between their occurrences five days later when water was discharged from the reservoir and infiltrated along the creek an additional water level rise occurred to 16 6 m above the initial natural aquifer conditions during the dry season june to october 2013 a slow groundwater level decrease was observed in december 2013 groundwater level rose due to winter precipitations and a runoff event caused by beit zait dam overflow overall the above described hydrological monitoring represents a point to point source response mechanism which was also reflected by the cbz fate in the groundwater cbz concentration was initially measured in the ek11 observation well on july 4 2012 3 7 ng l another measurement prior to the pipeline maintenance actions occurred on february 15 2013 and on april 2 2013 7 ng l and 5 7 ng l respectively those values present base level cbz contamination within the groundwater near the creek groundwater samples were also taken from ek7 fig 1 an adjacent observation well on july 4 2012 where chemical analysis showed similar base level cbz concentration 4 3 ng l the reservoir water samples prior to the dam opening on february 15 2013 and on april 23 2013 had cbz concentrations of 38 ng l and 31 ng l respectively cbz concentration in sewage as measured on april 7 2013 was 955 ng l this value is slightly lower than the average cbz levels in the israeli wastewater utilities 1321 204 ng l gasser et al 2011 during the sewage discharge event three main cbz concentration peaks were documented in groundwater samples taken from ek11 21 0 ng l 25 9 ng l and 47 0 ng l respectively the first two peaks were related to the release of sewage and the third cbz concentration peak was linked to the later episode of the reservoir water discharge into the creek cbz concentration dropped between sewage leakages episodes to 12 2 ng l and 15 2 ng l respectively however measured levels did not reach the initial pre event concentration levels in addition the third cbz concentration peak was higher both in level and in duration implying that the dam water infiltration resulted in an effective flash of contaminant from the thick unsaturated zone during the summer cbz concentration decreased with groundwater level descent while an increase in concentration was observed up to 11 0 ng l due to resuming winter precipitation and runoff water infiltration after dam overflow in december 3 2 modeling results calibrating the flow model to the observed groundwater level in ek11 yielded good agreement between measured and observed groundwater levels calibrated model parameters are presented in table 1 the model simulates rapid water infiltration through fast flow paths conduits and quick groundwater response to either intensive precipitation or surface water discharge fig 3 the model predicts fairly well the water level fluctuation in january april and its rise and drop during sewage and reservoir water discharge into the creek yet relatively large differences were detected between the simulated and observed water levels the model described very well the decrease of water level to around 410 m during dry season may november and its subsequent rise to around 450 m in december as a response to rain precipitation and discharge of reservoir water into the creek the determination coefficient and the root mean square error were 0 91 and 3 26 m respectively fig 4 demonstrates the distribution of simulated groundwater level in the study area at different times before the discharge of the sewage and the reservoir water april 7 there was a relatively uniform groundwater flow in the south west direction after sewage water was discharged april 19 a groundwater mound was developed near the creek changing flow direction in its vicinity the gradient of piezometric head was higher in the south west direction compared to that in the north east direction therefore a faster spread of contaminants is expected towards south west by the end of dry season october 18 the water flow is quite similar to that before water discharge events in april temporal local groundwater mounding was observed in the area of the aquifer and was discussed in details by dvory et al 2016 the simulated 3d temporal groundwater mounding plays a major role in understanding the contamination transport mechanism in the unsaturated zone and the aquifer from early stages of the study it was known that there was background cbz pollution within the aquifer due to sewage systems failures yet the exact disposal of the sewage volumes were not measured tzipori 2013 therefore the distribution of cbz in the unsaturated zone and groundwater is unknown consequently two scenarios for initial conditions were considered 1 zero initial concentration zc scenario in the entire domain 2 background initial pollution bp scenario by prescribing the initial cbz distribution on 01 01 2013 as the final concentration distribution simulated on 31 12 2013 in the zc scenario the transport model was calibrated for the zc scenario and simulation was repeated with calibrated parameters for the bp scenario fig 5 illustrates the results of both the zc and bp scenarios to compare between simulated and observed cbz concentration in ek11 both simulated btcs discard smaller concentration fluctuations at the early stage of sewage water infiltration however correctly predict the major peak of the cbz concentration the zc scenario underestimates cbz concentration before sewage water release the occurrence of earlier pollution bp scenario yields better fit during the early stages of the simulation period later the cbz simulated levels remain higher than the measured concentration or the simulated concentration in the zc scenario better fit was obtained in bp scenario when the cbz concentration rose again due to precipitation in december the root mean square error rmse in bp scenario was 7 4 ng l which is a bit better than in the zc simulation with rmse 9 2 ng l calibrated model parameters for cbz transport are presented in table 2 the value of longitudinal dispersivity a l 6 44 m corresponds to its order of magnitude for field scale of a few hundred meters neuman 1990 the value of the distribution coefficient was 0 011 l kg which indicates low sorption of cbz this could possibly be attributed to the low organic matter content in the rock material in the study area while cbz occurs primarily in soil organic matter zhang et al 2010 when solving the inverse problem the objective function was not sensitive to changes in ratios of transversal and vertical dispersivities to longitudinal dispersivity 3 3 sensitivity analysis in order to examine the sensitivity of the transport model results to parameter variations parameters were varied within reasonable ranges around their calibrated values table 3 the sensitivity was assessed for the bp scenario because it is more realistic the quality of the resulting model fits was assessed by comparing the rmses between simulated and observed cbz concentration in ek11 and by visual comparison of the contaminant plume in the simulation domain the results of sensitivity analysis show that the model is mostly sensitive to changes in the solute exchange rate parameter η c and the conduit longitudinal dispersity a l and practically insensitive to changes in the vertical longitudinal ratio a z a l and the transverse longitudinal ratio a t a l variation in η c resulted in the largest changes in the cbz concentration a narrower or wider breakthrough curve is obtained by reducing η c by halving the original value or doubling it respectively fig 6 a additionally a decrease of η c yielded a higher cbz concentration before sewage release and of the cbz breakthrough peak decreasing η c also produced a larger spread of the contaminant in the aquifer in the direction of groundwater flow fig 7 and in the vertical section fig 8 in the calibrated model cbz concentration of 0 1 ng l about 0 01 of the cbz concentration in the sewage discharged onto the surface migrates 424 m downstream from the source at the creek multiplying the solute exchange rate parameter by 0 5 and by 2 0 enlarged the migration distance to over 430 m domain boundary or reduced it to 316 m respectively relative to the η c varying a l has smaller effect on the cbz concentration curve reducing the a l values slightly delays the breakthrough curve and enlarges the simulated cbz concentration fig 6b the reduction of this parameter also leads to a smaller spread of the contaminant both laterally and vertically enlarging the a l value produces a mirror behavior when comparing these results to the cbz 0 1 ng l concentration boundary in the calibrated model reveals a relatively small effect on the contamination distribution reducing the conduit longitudinal dispersity by half limits this boundary to 421 m and enlarging it by two expands this boundary to over 430 m domain boundary varying a z a l and a t a l values hardly influence the cbz concentration curve as can be seen in the rmse values this was because the concentration gradients in the direction perpendicular to flow were relatively small as can be seen in figs 7 and 8 3 4 cbz transport in karst fractured media the diffusion mechanism plays an important role in retaining the contaminant in low permeability zones the model also accounts for the advective exchange by water and solute between fractures and porous blocks which enhances the rate of diffusion and back diffusion processes shapiro 2001 found that the diffusion coefficient at the kilometer scale is at least 3 orders of magnitude greater than laboratory estimates of diffusion in crystalline rock indicating that diffusion into rock matrices is masked at the kilometer scale by advective mass exchange between fractures which have large contrasts in transmissivity the results of cbz transport simulations support the assumption that the contaminant is retained within the unsaturated zone by the end of the simulation period around 91 of the discharged cbz mass remained in the simulation domain 56 of which was in the unsaturated zone and 44 in the saturated zone 4 6 of modeled cbz concentrations were present in the conduits zones compared to 94 96 in porous matrix thus the contaminant stored in the unsaturated zone remains a significant potential source of groundwater pollution by back diffusion yang et al 2014 yet if there is no additional discharge of sewage from the surface the infiltration of precipitation and runoff water caused relatively low contaminant flush from the unsaturated porous matrix due to the low exchange rate discharge of water from the reservoir caused the groundwater mounding along the creek increasing piezometric gradient and enhances spread of pollution to extended distance consequently the pollution plume developed mainly towards south west fig 7 water redistribution and slow recharge during the dry summer season contributed to elevated cbz concentrations in the groundwater in the vicinity of the creek and tens of meters downstream the results of the sensitivity analysis show that cbz concentrations within the vadose and the saturated zones are highly affected by the solute exchange rate between the conduits and the porous matrix lower solute exchange rates result in lesser diffusion of contaminant into the matrix a greater mass of cbz reaching groundwater and a larger spread of cbz throughout the aquifer because the contaminant mass flux is mainly controlled by fast flow in fractures cbz concentrations alternate due to variations between fast and slow flow mechanism which was also reported by other researchers gasser et al 2014 who monitored six carbonate springs in northern israel reported higher cbz concentration levels during late winters 2010 to 2012 when fast flow existed due to precipitation infiltration doummar et al 2014 carried out a high resolution cbz breakthrough study in march 2011 at the jeita spring in lebanon in that study cbz concentration increase was monitored during precipitation events and was connected to flow through fast flow pathways with a rapid flow component later the authors showed that measurements of lower cbz concentration were related to old water flow into the system that stabilized the mass fluxes which remain constant in the spring water this study by doummar et al 2014 supports the proposed mechanism in which aquifer vulnerability rises during fast flow events when cbz remains in the conduits and propagates throughout the aquifer the site specific application of the model requires simplifications regarding input information it is desirable to estimate variations in model predictions due to the uncertainty of the inputs i e to assess uncertainty of prediction one major source of prediction uncertainty is the model parameters additionally model calibration by inverse solution is inherently ill posed and may lead to parameter equifinality beven and freer 2001 due to technical problems cbz concentration was only measured in one monitoring well in the current study an improved calibration can be achieved if measured concentration values of cbz from other monitoring sites can be used as inputs into the transport model on the other hand the sensitivity analysis shows that the model was sensitive to two parameters which reduce uncertainty longitudinal dispersivity and the rate of solute exchange between fracture and rock matrix another source of uncertainty is boundary conditions since the location of sinkholes along the creek was unknown in this study we assumed a uniform rate of sewage and water infiltration from the stream this led to a uniform front of contamination in the groundwater in real conditions spatial distribution of enhanced infiltration features can lead to faster migration of the contaminant in these locations estimating possible errors in our model predictions requires further independent research nevertheless the present study contributes to an improved understanding of wastewater contaminant transport in the vadose and saturated zones of carbonate aquifer 4 conclusion 1 a quasi 3d dual permeability mathematical model was applied to simulate the cbz transport in both the vadose and the saturated zones of karst aquifer results of simulations show that such an approach can be used to describe major mechanisms of flow and transport under considered conditions however the main limitation of the applied model is the assumption of only vertical flow in the unsaturated zone in places where the low permeability layers in the unsaturated zone extend significant distances conditions for developing perched water bodies and for essential lateral flow may limit use of quasi 3d approach 2 the results of the simulation show that after the sewage leakage stopped significant amounts of cbz were retained in the porous matrix of the unsaturated zone below the source zone water redistribution and slow recharge during the dry summer season contributed to elevated cbz concentrations in the groundwater in the vicinity of the creek and tens of meters downstream 3 during fast flow events the aquifer vulnerability increased due to low solute exchange rate lesser diffusion of contaminant into the matrix and a greater mass of cbz reaching the groundwater from the unsaturated zone as a result there was a larger spread of cbz throughout the aquifer acknowledgements the research was funded by the israeli water authority grant number 4500088042 the authors thank mr guy reshef
