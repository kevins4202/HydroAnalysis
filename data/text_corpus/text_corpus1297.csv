6485,to date many numerical approaches are available in studying water flow and sediment dynamics along rivers from the reach to the watershed scale based on various simplifications the aim of the present research is to demonstrate how the so called morphodynamic quasi equilibrium hypothesis is effective in modelling riverine landscape morphodynamics evolution at the watershed scale focussing on the long term changes of longitudinal profile and bed grainsize composition of large alluvial rivers a lumped 0 d two reach two grainsize model based on the local uniform flow hypothesis and originally developed for reproducing fluvial changes at the historical time scale has been applied to three large watercourses to reproduce their long term evolution performing a sensitivity analysis based on the present conditions three morphometric parameters were analysed aiming to describe the evolution of the longitudinal profile concavity and aggrading and the grainsize composition of the river bed fining though the 0 d approach does not allow for a spatial distribution of the input parameters namely the liquid and solid discharge the modelling outcomes show reasonably good qualitative trends at the scale of analysis centuries to millennia and for the chosen large sedimentary systems thousands of kilometres long which show high inertia to geomorphological changes likely owing to their longitudinal scale the model can be helpful in detecting where the present conditions reflect a big disturbance to the natural trend this initial detection method can provide additional insights in evaluating the capability of actual rivers to respond to the present external forcing eventually reaching a quasi stable configuration keywords 0 d model riverbed aggrading riverbed fining congo river large rivers mississippi river morphodynamic equilibrium orinoco river river concavity 1 introduction several studies show that long term configurations and evolution of fluvial sedimentary systems are the results of intrinsically coupled natural hydrological geological biological and anthropic social and economic feedbacks however this concept has only been recently explored and therefore additional research is necessary to completely address such feedbacks recalling the definition of howard 1982 the term equilibrium indicates a temporally invariant functional relationship between input and output values in a geomorphic system namely a system can be considered in equilibrium when it reaches a long term balance between erosional and depositional forces even though periodic changes in the short term dynamic equilibrium are possible ahnert 1994 in this context works focussing on the quasi equilibrium of natural riverine systems which have not been significantly influenced by anthropogenic interventions were performed to be used as a basis for palaeohydrological research e g schumm and lichty 1965 thoms et al 1999 oguchi et al 2001 and for evaluating the pristine conditions of fluvial systems brooks and brierley 2002 syvitski et al 2005 as also advised by the water framework directive in europe eu 2000 the results of these studies could also contribute to the research about the major effects of localized interventions that can lead to a large scale basin wide and long term impact marr et al 2000 latapie et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 this evaluation can be performed either by direct observation of geological records to discern the effects of natural climate change eustatism or subsidence etc or human driven dams restoration works etc alterations or by numerical simulations to forecasts future trends at different scales the development of advanced modelling tools allowed sediment transport and riverine morphodynamics assuming non equilibrium conditions to be reproduced with a limited computational effort see as an example nones et al 2018 m√ºller and hassan 2018 wickert and schildgen 2019 these numerical models involve different spatial and temporal scales non stationary initial and boundary conditions and account for the full range of sediment grainsizes in a relatively simplified way although ordinarily applied in engineering practice the hypothesis of local quasi equilibrium conditions hardly holds for the very fine fractions of material found in the bed of most natural streams armanini and di silvio 1988 to adequately reproduce the riverine behaviour in fact such assumptions should be removed for every grainsize fraction either transported as bedload or in suspension with no distinction between bed material and wash load with the latter being considered as not contributing in the river morphodynamics basically river basins are composed by hard rock material subjected to tectonic movements and erosion and by granular material sediments present in the river bed and fed into the hydrographic network from the basin slopes molnar 2004 unlike the hard rock material the sediments are transported by the water flow along the hydrographic network by means of external agents tectonics climate forces anthropogenic disturbances working with variable intensity and at different scales however at the very long temporal horizon orogenic scale anthropogenic disturbances e g damming river training sediment mining etc although very important at historical scale but relatively recent can be neglected similarly the long term changes of climate glaciations base level oscillations sea level rise temperature variations precipitation and vegetation cover etc may have relevant morphological consequences peizhen et al 2001 but can be neglected at the orogenic scale intrinsically larger than climate variations scale at the orogenic scale the combined morphodynamic effect of bedrock river incision and uplift willett et al 2014 can be considered in balance and in first approximation neglected while the unbalanced mass and surface erosion over the basin slopes can be seen as an overall time averaged sediment input fed into the fluvial network these simplifications are justified by the present configuration of large alluvial rivers which are characterized by an approximate balance between the overall amount of sediment fed into the hydrographic network and the volume of sediments discharged into the ocean however due to the different grainsize mobility the sediment transport as a process is far from being in equilibrium as the same amount of transported material is generally coarser in the upper part and subjected to a downstream fining this extremely slow process of progressive fining and sedimentation can be described as quasi equilibrium conditions in the case of a watercourse in equilibrium its transport capacities of water and sediments are in balance with the rates supplied while changes can be associated to climatic hydrologic and tectonic events as well as anthropogenic pressures after alteration the equilibrium can be reached again depending on the type of driver and the river characteristics chang 1986 franzoia and nones 2017 recent studies on the long term evolution of alluvial systems involved the use of complex models also thanks to the development of powerful computational tools gasparini et al 2004 the early and schematic hypothesis of long term longitudinal quasi equilibrium profile in river systems mackin 1948 howard 1982 is still widely used ahnert 1994 franzoia 2014 nanson and huang 2018 this is due to the advantage to describe the embedded complexity of large watersheds and complex watercourses in a relatively simplified manner as frequently observed through laboratory experiments wilcock et al 2001 direct and indirect analysis of field data wilcock and detemple 2005 and numerical and analytical models see among others viparelli et al 2011 bolla pittaluga et al 2014 blom et al 2017a this schematization is acceptable for alluvial sedimentary systems which evolving under the combination of geological sedimentology and morphology and hydrological hydrodynamics components are more likely to attain a long term configuration that sees the dynamic if short scaled balance of external and internal processes this allows for the numerical modelling of their evolution assuming quasi equilibrium conditions referred to an adequate temporal scale schumm and lichty 1965 indeed field observations suggest that on a relatively small temporal scale years or decades depending on the river size and granulometric characteristics and in the absence of major anthropogenic effects dams the average longitudinal profile may be in quasi equilibrium conditions bolla pittaluga et al 2014 on the other hand considering the inertia of large river systems to adapt to changing boundary conditions at the very long term alluvial watercourses tend to evolve towards a quasi equilibrium state assuming the validity of stationary boundary conditions franzoia and nones 2017 varrani 2017 generally large scale quasi equilibrium conditions are assumed as initial boundary conditions since common numerical models account for short term dynamics forced by local changes nones et al 2018 and only in a few cases are long term and large scale variations addressed gasparini et al 2004 latapie et al 2014 blom et al 2017a in fact combining long term trends with short term changes is extremely difficult and therefore for practical reasons these two phenomena are generally uncoupled focussing on a single scale aiming to provide information about the morphological changes in a river system at the watershed scale quasi equilibrium modelling can be a good simplification of the actual behaviour of large river systems characterised by high inertia due to the large spatial resolution and the inherently long processes involved simplified approaches therefore greatly reduce the computational effort eventually providing the boundary conditions of local scale models having a higher spatio temporal resolution or suggesting possible management strategies for the entire river system on the other part conceptual approaches and simplified models can be useful in understanding the general behaviour of a phenomenon starting from a 1 d numerical model originally created for engineering purposes di silvio and peviani 1991 fasolato et al 2011 and already tested on large watercourses for evaluating short term dynamics nones et al 2013 a 0 d two reach two grainsize model has been developed for reproducing the very long term geological evolution of alluvial streams this lumped model derives from an integration of a classical longitudinal wide 1 d model over the whole basin aiming to provide a few insights on the long term evolution of a river system accounting for a very limited number of parameters and therefore with a reduced computational effort the capability of the proposed 0 d model was tested against test cases di silvio et al 2016 but an application on real rivers is still missing the aim of the present work therefore is to provide some insights on the long term evolution of three large rivers pointing out the importance of the anthropogenic impact as an external driver and suggesting the need for coupling codes having manifold spatial and temporal scales for adequately simulate the river hydro dynamics since empirical data on the long term evolutionary scenarios are missing in particular on the spatial distribution of grainsize across the whole river basin the 0 d model adopts a simplistic approach and does not account for a spatial distribution of the liquid and solid input modelling the river systems as a virtual sediment and water fed flume having a constant and concentrated input of water and sediments along the paper this and the other main simplifications of the 0 d two reach two grainsize model adopted are further explained and discussed focussing on the dimensionless description of the morphometric parameters that are used to describe the evolution of alluvial systems concavity fining and aggrading and highlighting the importance of their extremes aside from the temporal evolution discussed in other works franzoia 2014 varrani 2017 the model is applied to three large alluvial rivers affected by anthropogenic pressures at a various level aiming to assess its ability in qualitatively reproducing their evolution towards quasi equilibrium conditions if compared with literature evidence as discussed in the following the model via the detection of the maximum values of three morphometric parameters can capture those morphological conditions that portray the present fluvial patterns albeit the presence of humans influence like hydropower dams could alter such behaviour in a strong manner besides the irregular trends observed in the modelling runs could be also correlated to the absence of accurate sedimentological data with their spatial distribution along and across the rivers which are paramount for a reliable description of the whole sedimentary system and affect the consistency of the 0 d model in quantitatively describing the river changes pointing out the need of additional research in this direction the paper is structured as follow after a short introduction covering the mathematical background of the model which was already presented by franzoia 2014 and varrani 2017 it is applied to three case studies the orinoco the congo e the mississippi rivers based on the actual state and assuming different ratios of sediment sorting and per cent of fine sediments in input because of a lack of sedimentological information the modelling application shows the capability of the lumped model in reproducing the observed trends both these results and the simplifications adopted are discussed and the main conclusions are drawn highlighting the ability of a model originally developed for engineering purposes to reproduce the fluvial behaviour at the geological scale potentially creating a bridge between the disciplines 2 methodology 2 1 numerical modelling the 0 d model used here previously proposed by franzoia 2014 and then developed and applied by various authors franzoia and nones 2017 varrani 2017 is based on a 1 d schematization already test against real rivers for simulating their evolution at the engineering decades scale e g di silvio and peviani 1991 nones et al 2014 aside from the hypothesis of local uniform flow frequently adopted to characterize the evolution of fluvial environments at the large spatial scale depending on the froude number fasolato et al 2011 the model assumes that only two grainsize classes composing the river bed characterize the solid phase evolution morphological changes are described via the sediment continuity exner 1920 and the mass balance hirano 1971 equations while an engelund hansen type formula franzoia and nones 2017 computes the sediment transport forced by geometry hydrology and sedimentological characteristics imposing two representative grainsizes classes coarse c and fine f fractions d df dc represents the diameter ratio giving an indication of the bed sorting on the other hand the sediment transport is characterized by a fine fraction per cent Œ≤ and a coarse one 1 Œ≤ for a sake of simplicity and because along the studied reaches the downstream fining is predominantly controlled by the selective sorting attal and lav√© 2009 the abrasion is not considered in the present application using digital elevation models having a resolution of 10 30 m and bathymetric data elevation of the longitudinal profile retrieved from literature as a geometrical basis varrani 2017 each river is schematized into two connected uniform slope channels these reaches can represent from a physical point of view respectively the highland part of the basin having steeper slopes and coarser bed grainsize i e gravel and the lowland one characterized by a milder slope and finer sediments i e sand composing the river bed the upstream reach is indicated with the subscript u and starts from a point where one can qualitatively locate the spatially fixed barycentre of the watershed where water and sediment inputs from the basin slopes are concentrated and feed the solid and liquid supplies to the main course franzoia 2014 the downstream reach subscript d starts from the transition point and ends at the river outlet assumed as fixed and corresponding to the sea level the transition point assumed having a fixed position is the location where the watershed area from a surface source of sediments becomes an alluvial depositional surface conventionally assumed at the confluence of the main river stem and its largest tributary fig 1 the mountain reach measures lu in length and has a constant valley width bu while the constant lowland length and valley widths are ld and bd respectively generally the valley width bd is greater than the upstream width bu since the lowland part flows through alluvial depositional surface while the upstream reach is confined by mountainous constraints the time variable sediment input g has a percent of fine Œ± g and is concentrated at the upstream end while pu and pd indicate the sediment transport from the upstream reach and the sediment flow that comes out from the river respectively franzoia 2014 franzoia et al 2017 the watercourse evolves from a horizontal flat condition at t 0 orogeny towards the virtual equilibrium state reached at the time t t where the bed elevation at the barycenter h becomes h given the relatively crude schematization of the entire river system with only two connected reaches one can argue that at the very long term centuries and millennia and assuming that the river discharge remains constant there is no concavity since pd pu g and the river bed composition of the fine fraction and consequently of the coarse one is the same for both reaches Œ≤u Œ≤d this oversimplification permits a qualitative analysis of the changes of longitudinal profile and grainsize distribution of large river systems without accounting for small scale phenomena like the localized input of flow and sediment tributaries bank failure or geological constraints knickpoints aiming to contribute to the long lasting debate on graded rivers see among others mackin 1948 bolla pittaluga et al 2014 blom et al 2017a franzoia and nones 2017 based on the assumptions described above the model can be written in a dimensionless form franzoia 2014 to compare river basins having different characteristics table 1 where the morphological parameter m relates the long term water formative discharge q biedenharn et al 1999 to the sediment transport p assuming the validity of a sediment rating curve for each reach e g di silvio and peviani 1991 asselman 2000 fasolato et al 2011 franzoia 2014 nones et al 2014 franzoia and nones 2017 varrani 2017 sediment continuity and momentum equations are combined with the sediment transport formula and these equations integrated for both the liquid assuming uniform flow hypothesis and solid phases over the two reaches lu and ld franzoia 2014 varrani 2017 accounting for the filling time of the basin di silvio and nones 2014 one obtains three time variable morphometric parameters necessary to characterize the evolution of a watercourse towards its morphological equilibrium state eventually reached at the equilibrium time t t franzoia 2014 1 x t s u t s d t s s u s d œÜ t Œ≤ d t Œ≤ u t Œ≤ b d b u a t m u t m d t m m orph u m orph d where the longitudinal profile concavity x t represents the ratio between the upstream and downstream slopes with respect to the very long term equilibrium slope s reached at the equilibrium time t bed sediment fining œÜ t and aggrading a t of the river bed give information about the long term sediment composition and longitudinal profile evolution showing how far the bed grainsize of the two reaches imposed as input is from the long term equilibrium conditions following the two reach schematization all the three parameters become equal to 0 at the equilibrium since the upstream and downstream parts transport the same quantity of material water and sediment that have the same composition and therefore no more changes on the longitudinal profile and bed composition are possible for a sake of simplicity additional details on the modelling approach and the assumed approximations are reported in appendix a an analysis of the available sources of input data among others castelltort and van den driessche 2003 gupta 2007 latrubesse 2008 di silvio and nones 2014 suggested that aside from the actual geometry and hydrology that are relatively easy to derive from remote imagery and literature data there are several uncertainties regarding the sedimentological parameters varrani 2017 in particular because of the complexity in monitoring such kind if data reliable and spatially distributed information on the bed grainsize composition is hardly discoverable in literature moreover given that the adopted input data referred to the actual conditions they are likely not representative of the pristine natural state of the river basin but rather of a condition already affected by human drivers syvitski et al 2005 therefore the results presented in this study refer to a long term quasi equilibrium eventually attained assuming stationary boundary conditions i e absence of natural and anthropogenic alterations and should be considered as a qualitative indication of a future trend the difficulty in finding up to date and spatially distributed sediment parameters reproducing the situation of the entire river system requires a sensitivity analysis on the two sedimentological input parameters adopted in the model for this reason while geometrical and hydrological information referred to the actual large rivers under study the percent of fine sediment at the input Œ±g and the diameter ratio d of the input material were chosen on the basis of few available indications and span between 0 75 0 99 and 0 10 0 50 respectively considering that the washload do not contribute in changing the overall parameters 2 2 case studies to point out the different behaviour between rivers deeply affected by the human presence and watercourses closer to their pristine state and mainly subjected to natural drivers the model was applied to the orinoco river representing practically non affected conditions and two highly impacted river basins namely the congo and the mississippi to simulate the evolution of such watercourses they were divided into two connected reaches using hydrological geometrical and sedimentological data retrieved from literature and gis mapping e g castelltort and van den driessche 2003 labat et al 2005 gupta 2007 di silvio and nones 2014 varrani 2017 given the high uncertainties regarding the sediment composition and distribution along the river system a sensitivity analysis over the sediment related parameters percent of fine input Œ±g and sorting ratio d was done the river behaviour is analyzed by means of the maximum values of three time variable morphometric parameters eq 1 evaluating them for a changing sorting ratio d of the bed sediments and a variable percent of fine sediment input Œ±g since these parameters can be largely variable along the stream and are also deeply affected by anthropogenic drivers franzoia 2014 varrani 2017 in evaluating the temporal changes of the three morphometric parameters the maxima are to be interpreted as referring to the effects of the present state on the natural riverine evolution namely indicating whether the river given the initial conditions i e solid and liquid discharge which relate to the current situation shows a tendency towards a more or less stable quasi equilibrium state and how far is the present configuration from it river information table 2 are based on literature data castelltort and van den driessche 2003 gupta 2007 latrubesse 2008 di silvio and nones 2014 updated from the interpretation of the present fluvial configuration as derived from gis analysis varrani 2017 the location of the barycentre where the localized fed of water and input is imposed is defined based on geometrical considerations and literature review while the transition point identifies the larger tributary of the river because of the uncertainties related to the positioning of these points a preliminary analysis was performed pointed out the little impact of their positioning with respect to the other parameters i e sorting ratio and sediment composition given that the model reproduces the long term evolution of the entire watershed sediment transport and water discharge rate refer to the present values measured at the river mouth castelltort and van den driessche 2003 gupta 2007 latrubesse 2008 di silvio and nones 2014 varrani 2017 as seen in table 2 the three case studies differ on the hydrological morphological and geometrical point of view however looking at each specific case study the difference in the simulation outcomes cannot be directly referred to the uncertainties in the initial conditions water and sediment discharges sediment sorting ratio length and width ratios giving reasons to correlate them to other causes like anthropogenic factors as discussed in the following 3 results in analysing the present conditions assuming varying sedimentological parameters two different behaviours were observed first a clear and smooth trend shown by less impounded watercourses such as the orinoco river and second a more irregular tendency indicating a sort of dynamic conditions that seems typical of highly impacted environments schumm and lichty 1965 syvitski et al 2005 lazarus et al 2016 like the congo and the mississippi rivers a detailed analysis of each watercourse is reported in the following focussing on the maximum values of the three morphometric parameters reached at the present state t 1 10 years the reason for choosing the maximum in the temporal evolution of the three morphometric parameters is that it represents a point where the time derivative equals zero meaning a neighbourhood where such parameter does not change in time 3 1 orinoco river for large watercourses insignificantly influenced by large scale anthropogenic activities e g dams riverbed mining etc like the orinoco river the maximum concavity x of the longitudinal profile has a consistent trend depending on the imposed sedimentological characteristics it increases with the sorting ratio d covering a larger range for lower per cent of the fine sediment input Œ±g fig 2 a in this case the higher the per cent of fine input the more constant the maximum concavity showing a quasi independent evolution of this parameter from the sediment ratio d namely from the sorting of the bed material of the entire course as pointed out by several studies e g blom et al 2017a wickert and schildgen 2019 river concavity and downstream fining are correlated thus the maximum values of the bed fining œÜ fig 2b shows a similar behaviour to the ones of x in this case a higher fine sediment input Œ± g corresponds to lower values of sorting ratio d because sediments imposed as input are already fine and therefore the overall adaptation process becomes very rapid the maximum bed aggrading a fig 2c as expected has a trend like the longitudinal profile concavity but spanning a narrower range 0 69 0 79 for bed aggrading with respect to 0 47 0 80 for profile concavity regarding the aggrading for high values of the sediment sorting ratio d well sorted material the trend has some small irregularities especially for very fine sediments Œ±g 0 999 that are highly sensitive to the changing boundary conditions and can be easily transported along the river system indeed as already observed describing the model hypotheses the very fine sediments imposed here as input Œ±g 0 999 cannot be considered as sediment transport that contributes to changes in the bed morphology but rather these very fine sediments are transported as washload due to their small grainsize and are assumed not to alter the bed morphodynamics using the orinoco river as a case study fig 3 reports an example of the temporal changes of the three analysed morphometric parameters simulated assuming a sediment sorting ratio d equal to 0 20 it is evident that the maximum values are reached at different times depending on the per cent of fine sediment imposed as input Œ±g besides the initial variations that depend on the adaptation phase of the numerical model to the initial conditions one can observe that a relatively constant value plateau is reached for log t around 0 i e t 1 indicating that the assumed input data may portray the present river conditions one must keep in mind that this figure represents a single run of the model while the maxima values reported elsewhere are representing the general behaviour of the entire fluvial system 3 2 congo river the congo river in africa has two major dams located in its lower course unep 2010 winemiller et al 2016 and because this anthropic pressure that obviously affects natural water and sediment regimes it can hardly reach quasi equilibrium conditions like the orinoco river described above as visible from fig 4 it is clear that the trend of the morphometric parameters is not smooth in particular looking at river bed aggrading a fig 4c a very irregular behaviour is observable this indicates that the assumed input values correlated to the present ones are not adequately representing a stable quasi equilibrium state even if the other morphometric parameters have a quite consistent trend the maxima for the longitudinal concavity x and bed fining œÜ are representative of a relatively quasi stable behaviour but this different behaviour could be related to the large inertia of the river to changing boundary conditions that allow for an adaptation of the grainsize composition and the longitudinal profile 3 3 mississippi river concerning the mississippi river the three morphometric parameters present several irregularities when compared to the results obtained for the orinoco river and even for an anthropized watercourse like the congo using the input data corresponding to the present configuration this river does reach stable quasi equilibrium conditions neither at short nor at long timescale but shows a very changing behaviour this is evident from the maximum values reported in fig 5 as well as observing the temporal variations of the three morphometric parameters varrani 2017 despite these irregularities a general behaviour is clearly discernible the greater the per cent of input fines Œ±g the lower the influence of the bed sediment sorting ratio d on all the parameters 4 discussion generally large alluvial rivers show a concave profile having a slope of the upstream mountain reach higher than the downstream lowland one accompanied by a longitudinal fining of the river bed composition and aggradation downstream e g sternberg 1875 mackin 1948 schumm and lichty 1965 sinha and parker 1996 franzoia and nones 2017 as discussed by many researchers since decades this configuration may be explained by a variety of mechanisms such as particle abrasion distributed input of finer sediments coming from the tributaries and increase of the transport river width see among others richter 1939 shulits 1941 leopold and maddock 1953 miller 1958 snow and slingerland 1987 parker 1991 paola et al 1992a b rice and church 2001 fedele and paola 2007 frings 2008 di silvio et al 2016 ferrer boix et al 2016 bolla pittaluga et al 2014 blom et al 2016 2017a b mudd et al 2018 at the same time this behaviour is frequently disproven by geological constraints like rocky gorges and knickpoints or localized sources of material e g bank failure which evidence a coarsening of the bed composition moreover human drivers e g dams channelization bed mining can alter the natural trend of sediment transport v√∂r√∂smarty et al 2003 syvitski et al 2005 latapie et al 2014 and consequently concavity and fining in a significant manner as well as observed from the comparison of several large rivers worldwide varrani 2017 particularly significant for the scope of this research are three time variable dimensionless morphometric quantities longitudinal profile concavity x t bed fining œÜ t and bed aggrading a t functions of the non dimensional time t besides the temporal changes the present application shows that the maximum values reached by these parameters represent a qualitative proxy of the overall river dynamics at the watershed scale moreover the temporal scale of the river evolution is a function of the river filling or response time tfill frequently used to characterize the response velocity of the phenomena involved in fluvial morphodynamics leopold and maddock 1953 castelltort and van den driessche 2003 di silvio et al 2016 franzoia and nones 2017 franzoia et al 2017 and therefore to evaluate inertia and adaptation scale of the studied systems the application to real data representing large river systems which are anthropized at different degrees but all characterized by high inertia resulted in a moderately slow morphological evolution towards quasi equilibrium conditions carried out in this research and in previous works di silvio and nones 2014 varrani 2017 even if starting from a very few data this study has proven reasonable results for the time centuries and millennia and spatial scale hundreds of kilometres of analysis and for the adopted assumptions as compared to qualitative outcomes of previous applications di silvio and nones 2014 di silvio et al 2016 franzoia and nones 2017 franzoia et al 2017 it must be considered that the simplifications adopted in the present approach hold only for large alluvial systems having particularly high inertia to changes triggered by external forcing in favour of attaining a morphological equilibrium state at the very long timescale varrani 2017 on the contrary watercourses characterized by much smaller dimensions or highly impacted by humans are more prone to abrupt variations induced by oscillations in their boundary and initial conditions i e their response time tfill is shorter it is therefore not recommended to model such systems at the very long timescale using the 0 d model and the hypotheses proposed in this research but rather to account for 1 d or even 2 d schematizations adopting the present conditions as input and accounting for uncertainties correlated to sediments characteristics the evaluation of the trend of the maximum values represents a qualitative indicator of the perturbations to which these systems are subjected with respect to their equilibrium conditions eventually reached at the very long term t however a thorough analysis of the spatial validity of the input data and the temporal evolution of the three morphometric parameters concavity fining and aggrading is required to corroborate the results reported here and completely characterize the long term evolution of the fluvial systems studied similarly a comparison with existing numerical and analytical models could be helpful in supporting the present outcomes fasolato et al 2011 di silvio and nones 2014 but the intrinsic limitations i e modelling assumptions and simplifications of the adopted equations of each code should be carefully considered however given the lack of sedimentological input data in both time and space and the uncertainties in simulating the future evolution of river systems because of the changing boundary conditions only a qualitative evaluation of the model performances can be drawn even if intrinsically affected by errors these results could be helpful for forcing more detailed models or as an indication for water managers looking at the very long term evolution of river basins focussing on the modelling results and drawing attention to the more anthropized river systems it is worth to notice that in the case of the congo river bed fining and longitudinal profile concavity have a relatively constant trend while the aggrading is more irregular these modelling results are in accordance to previous research on the correlation of profile concavity and downstream fining in alluvial rivers e g paola et al 1992b blom et al 2016 blom et al 2017a the unstable behaviour of the aggrading could be related to the presence of two dams close to the river mouth unep 2010 indeed these structures retain most of the solid discharge causing a reduction of the variance in the grainsize distribution and giving rise to sediment ratios similar to the ones adopted in this research the adopted input parameters relate to the sediment discharged at present in the sea so they take into account via the morphometric parameter the presence of this disturbance in trapping a significant part of the total sediment yield from the basin on the other hand it is evident that more research on the sedimentology and morphology of the more anthropized mississippi river is required since this watercourse has not yet reached quasi equilibrium conditions and therefore it is very sensitive to external human induced forcing like dams which entrap sediments and strongly decrease both water flow and sediment transport eventually changing the fluvial planforms hudson and kesel 2000 nittrouer et al 2012 indeed this river is highly dammed and therefore the present conditions imposed here as input could be very far from the quasi equilibrium conditions for both the hydrology and sedimentology the differences in modelling the river evolution between these two dammed rivers could be also related to the celerity of sediment transport indeed the mississippi river is characterized by a higher celerity with respect to the congo river because of its geological characteristics pointing out the effects of the impoundments in a clearer manner and at a shorter time scale due to the assumptions intrinsically related to the large scale modelling the management of alluvial rivers involves the implementation of strategies typically based on the results of small scale modelling tools and simulations in that the final morphological state is assumed as related to some equilibrium conditions usually considered as stable indeed natural alluvial river systems can show a more complicated behaviour referred to as dynamic equilibrium presenting short term oscillations from an assumed mean trend present management strategies usually consider the system to be managed as frozen with the actual conditions in most cases not accounting for the evolution and the different time scales involved the assumption of constant solid and liquid input all over the simulated time is intended to mimic such an idea of a static system under steady conditions projecting the actual values far off in time and observing how a simplified model simulates the evolution of the watercourses allows to appraise whether quasi equilibrium conditions are possible or not indicating if the input to the model namely solid and liquid discharges allow for a system recovery from the disturbances imposed relating to the cases of the congo and the mississippi rivers the 0 d model outcomes clearly show that both rivers are not able to attain a quasi equilibrium state given the present hydrological and sedimentological conditions which is indicative of potential problems when managing such watercourses at the basin scale in fact as pointed out among many others by harmar and clifford 2007 and wang and xu 2018 the mississippi river behaviour is clearly affected by the human presence both in the upper alluvial valley where the slight convexity of the longitudinal profile can be attributed to high rates of localised aggradation in the late wisconsinan and early holocene periods and in the middle zone where the linear profile reflects the dramatic shortening of the river by the programme of artificial channel cut offs between 1932 and 1942 and the subsequent bank stabilisation in summary these authors pointed out that the profile concavity of this river can be considered at least partially as a feature inherited from past geomorphological conditions which are maintained by engineering modifications to the planform and channel length and thus highly impacted by human drivers harmar and clifford 2007 this latter example indicates that for adequately reproduce the short term changes in watercourses strongly affected by anthropogenic pressures the present code could be not a solution but rather it should be used to point out possible large scale and long term trends to be downscaled and evaluated in a more comprehensive manner by means of detailed i e 1 d and 2 d models evidently a real watercourse differs from the very schematic system adopted in this work because besides other differences the feeding is not concentrated at the upstream end but it is spatially distributed by the network of tributaries however as shown in a first crude approximation a non concave profile at the very long time scale can be derived from the sediment continuity and uniform flow conditions but also from the key assumption of unlimited sediment supply at the upper boundary since mountains are assumed as infinite sediment sources steady uplift over time and local scale mechanisms are neglected franzoia 2014 clearly this cannot be valid for real river systems observed at the shorter historical time scale as along with water discharge increasing in the downstream direction sediment discharge changes being tributaries not only vectors of flow but also of solid input moreover at the very long time scale geological parameters such as uplift and subsidence can become significant peizhen et al 2001 willett et al 2014 also the abrasion is an important mechanism in downstream fining especially at the laboratory scale and for very steep reaches characterized by coarse sediments attal and lav√© 2009 but it results being less important basin wide paola et al 1992b and for large lowland and sandy watercourses indeed comparing abrasion and selective sorting as dominant control on downstream fining the latter is predominant in river systems where sediment aggradation occurs like alluvial watercourses brierley and hickin 1985 paola et al 1992b brewer and lewin 1993 ferguson et al 1996 surian 2002 moussavi harami et al 2004 attal and lav√© 2009 aiming to suggest a qualitative trend at the watershed scale the 0 d lumped model which integrates along the upper and lowland reaches the flow and the sediment equations does not allow to account for local sources of water and sediments tributaries bank collapse etc the absence of concavity resulting here as quasi equilibrium final condition is therefore not a real asymptotic condition and it is not discussed as possibly occurring at the very long term but its only accounted for mathematical purposes in the modelling runs despite this the hypotheses of aggregating the hydrographic network into one virtual main watercourse and localizing water and sediment input in its initial section do not appear to affect the main aspects of the river evolution provided that the main morphometric length and width and hydro morphological water and sediment input conditions of the watercourse are preserved franzoia 2014 franzoia and nones 2017 preliminary applications of the model in fact shown that all the approximations introduced cannot affect in a significant manner the model itself which remains a powerful tool in detecting long term trends of large alluvial rivers the findings discussed here can have a potential significance for the way in which fluvial engineers and geomorphologists evaluate the riverine longitudinal profiles conceptually indeed the interactions between natural and anthropogenic drivers responses and feedbacks are quite well known however from a practical point of view considerable problems remain preventing an upscale of these scale dependent interactions generally it is assumed that the equilibrium status of a watercourse is irrelevant as it may never be attained at the historical scale due to continuously changing boundary conditions hydrology and sediment input and uplift or subsidence however if the hydrologic and sedimentary controls change so slowly that the river system can keep pace with them its morphological evolution can continuously establish a state of quasi equilibrium as described in this paper in fact based on the evaluation of the temporal evolution and the maxima of the three morphometric parameters it may be assumed that the conditions obtained by the 0 d lumped model portray the present pattern of the watercourses and therefore that they are dependent on the non dimensional parameters describing each river basin for a coherent application of the schematization proposed in this research an evaluation of the sensitivity of the model and its hypotheses to the spatial scale is needed in order to assess the field of validity i e up to which scale starting from the whole river and reducing the studied dimensions can this schematization be valid and applicable is the present scheme realistic or should it be changed perhaps introducing a sequence of three or more connected reaches i e moving towards a 1 d model this is meaningful because the present approach is meant to be valid for the whole river system but generally for practical uses it might be required an analysis of the quasi equilibrium at the local scale via application to a sub system indeed the very simple altimetric and planimetric configuration with two reaches might not be appropriate for small scale watercourses since this may lead to inconsistencies of the results or oversimplifications of the real world similarly accounting for only two grainsize means that the modelled fluvial system presents a bed with a bimodal composition 5 conclusions the paper proposes the application of a simplified 0 d two reach two grainsize model to evaluate the long term evolution of large alluvial rivers forced by initial conditions representing the actual state to compare rivers highly anthropized with more natural watercourses the modelling inputs consist of localized solid and water discharges corresponding to the present values measured at the mouth and representing the formative conditions while sorting ratios and per cent of fine input were subjected to a sensitivity analysis because of the lack of such kind of data in the case of rivers affected by the human pressure in a minor way like the orinoco river flowing through colombia and venezuela concavity fining and aggrading have shown a consistent general pattern on the one hand the presence of anthropogenic disturbances can clearly alter this behaviour giving rise to a very irregular trend as visible in the case of the mississippi river usa on the other hand large infrastructures like dams when not correctly managed and maintained are likely to alter the evolution of a large river like the congo in africa as it can be seen by the oscillations present in the aggrading parameter due to the large scale of analysis long term modelling of alluvial rivers can indicate criticalities in the present situation like what is presented in this study for the mississippi river and in a minor way for the congo river for highly anthropized watercourses it is clear how the changes imposed alter the system which can gradually adapt to such disturbances but is only occasionally able to reach quasi equilibrium conditions the temporal scale of this process of self adjustment should be considered when planning any further activity on disturbed watercourses but estimates on this time are not always available or easily computable moreover recognising the importance of the interplay between both natural and engineering drivers is paramount to adequately manage large fluvial systems aside from the encouraging outcomes given the restrictive assumptions adopted in the present research for the future specific aspects of the modelling procedure should be improved by i analysing the relationship between the quasi equilibrium configuration and the morphometric parameters ii accounting for a more realistic description of alluvial river systems namely by introducing lithological discontinuities in the longitudinal profiles knickpoints waterfalls lakes etc a variable width and changing water and sediment inputs iii considering other parameters that could affect river concavity bed sediments fining and aggrading processes iv consider additional both natural climate change extreme events eustatism etc and anthropic levees dams diversions river bed mining etc drivers acting at many scales namely accounting for variable boundary conditions acknowledgements the authors would like to thank prof giampaolo di silvio and dr mariateresa franzoia for

6485,to date many numerical approaches are available in studying water flow and sediment dynamics along rivers from the reach to the watershed scale based on various simplifications the aim of the present research is to demonstrate how the so called morphodynamic quasi equilibrium hypothesis is effective in modelling riverine landscape morphodynamics evolution at the watershed scale focussing on the long term changes of longitudinal profile and bed grainsize composition of large alluvial rivers a lumped 0 d two reach two grainsize model based on the local uniform flow hypothesis and originally developed for reproducing fluvial changes at the historical time scale has been applied to three large watercourses to reproduce their long term evolution performing a sensitivity analysis based on the present conditions three morphometric parameters were analysed aiming to describe the evolution of the longitudinal profile concavity and aggrading and the grainsize composition of the river bed fining though the 0 d approach does not allow for a spatial distribution of the input parameters namely the liquid and solid discharge the modelling outcomes show reasonably good qualitative trends at the scale of analysis centuries to millennia and for the chosen large sedimentary systems thousands of kilometres long which show high inertia to geomorphological changes likely owing to their longitudinal scale the model can be helpful in detecting where the present conditions reflect a big disturbance to the natural trend this initial detection method can provide additional insights in evaluating the capability of actual rivers to respond to the present external forcing eventually reaching a quasi stable configuration keywords 0 d model riverbed aggrading riverbed fining congo river large rivers mississippi river morphodynamic equilibrium orinoco river river concavity 1 introduction several studies show that long term configurations and evolution of fluvial sedimentary systems are the results of intrinsically coupled natural hydrological geological biological and anthropic social and economic feedbacks however this concept has only been recently explored and therefore additional research is necessary to completely address such feedbacks recalling the definition of howard 1982 the term equilibrium indicates a temporally invariant functional relationship between input and output values in a geomorphic system namely a system can be considered in equilibrium when it reaches a long term balance between erosional and depositional forces even though periodic changes in the short term dynamic equilibrium are possible ahnert 1994 in this context works focussing on the quasi equilibrium of natural riverine systems which have not been significantly influenced by anthropogenic interventions were performed to be used as a basis for palaeohydrological research e g schumm and lichty 1965 thoms et al 1999 oguchi et al 2001 and for evaluating the pristine conditions of fluvial systems brooks and brierley 2002 syvitski et al 2005 as also advised by the water framework directive in europe eu 2000 the results of these studies could also contribute to the research about the major effects of localized interventions that can lead to a large scale basin wide and long term impact marr et al 2000 latapie et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 this evaluation can be performed either by direct observation of geological records to discern the effects of natural climate change eustatism or subsidence etc or human driven dams restoration works etc alterations or by numerical simulations to forecasts future trends at different scales the development of advanced modelling tools allowed sediment transport and riverine morphodynamics assuming non equilibrium conditions to be reproduced with a limited computational effort see as an example nones et al 2018 m√ºller and hassan 2018 wickert and schildgen 2019 these numerical models involve different spatial and temporal scales non stationary initial and boundary conditions and account for the full range of sediment grainsizes in a relatively simplified way although ordinarily applied in engineering practice the hypothesis of local quasi equilibrium conditions hardly holds for the very fine fractions of material found in the bed of most natural streams armanini and di silvio 1988 to adequately reproduce the riverine behaviour in fact such assumptions should be removed for every grainsize fraction either transported as bedload or in suspension with no distinction between bed material and wash load with the latter being considered as not contributing in the river morphodynamics basically river basins are composed by hard rock material subjected to tectonic movements and erosion and by granular material sediments present in the river bed and fed into the hydrographic network from the basin slopes molnar 2004 unlike the hard rock material the sediments are transported by the water flow along the hydrographic network by means of external agents tectonics climate forces anthropogenic disturbances working with variable intensity and at different scales however at the very long temporal horizon orogenic scale anthropogenic disturbances e g damming river training sediment mining etc although very important at historical scale but relatively recent can be neglected similarly the long term changes of climate glaciations base level oscillations sea level rise temperature variations precipitation and vegetation cover etc may have relevant morphological consequences peizhen et al 2001 but can be neglected at the orogenic scale intrinsically larger than climate variations scale at the orogenic scale the combined morphodynamic effect of bedrock river incision and uplift willett et al 2014 can be considered in balance and in first approximation neglected while the unbalanced mass and surface erosion over the basin slopes can be seen as an overall time averaged sediment input fed into the fluvial network these simplifications are justified by the present configuration of large alluvial rivers which are characterized by an approximate balance between the overall amount of sediment fed into the hydrographic network and the volume of sediments discharged into the ocean however due to the different grainsize mobility the sediment transport as a process is far from being in equilibrium as the same amount of transported material is generally coarser in the upper part and subjected to a downstream fining this extremely slow process of progressive fining and sedimentation can be described as quasi equilibrium conditions in the case of a watercourse in equilibrium its transport capacities of water and sediments are in balance with the rates supplied while changes can be associated to climatic hydrologic and tectonic events as well as anthropogenic pressures after alteration the equilibrium can be reached again depending on the type of driver and the river characteristics chang 1986 franzoia and nones 2017 recent studies on the long term evolution of alluvial systems involved the use of complex models also thanks to the development of powerful computational tools gasparini et al 2004 the early and schematic hypothesis of long term longitudinal quasi equilibrium profile in river systems mackin 1948 howard 1982 is still widely used ahnert 1994 franzoia 2014 nanson and huang 2018 this is due to the advantage to describe the embedded complexity of large watersheds and complex watercourses in a relatively simplified manner as frequently observed through laboratory experiments wilcock et al 2001 direct and indirect analysis of field data wilcock and detemple 2005 and numerical and analytical models see among others viparelli et al 2011 bolla pittaluga et al 2014 blom et al 2017a this schematization is acceptable for alluvial sedimentary systems which evolving under the combination of geological sedimentology and morphology and hydrological hydrodynamics components are more likely to attain a long term configuration that sees the dynamic if short scaled balance of external and internal processes this allows for the numerical modelling of their evolution assuming quasi equilibrium conditions referred to an adequate temporal scale schumm and lichty 1965 indeed field observations suggest that on a relatively small temporal scale years or decades depending on the river size and granulometric characteristics and in the absence of major anthropogenic effects dams the average longitudinal profile may be in quasi equilibrium conditions bolla pittaluga et al 2014 on the other hand considering the inertia of large river systems to adapt to changing boundary conditions at the very long term alluvial watercourses tend to evolve towards a quasi equilibrium state assuming the validity of stationary boundary conditions franzoia and nones 2017 varrani 2017 generally large scale quasi equilibrium conditions are assumed as initial boundary conditions since common numerical models account for short term dynamics forced by local changes nones et al 2018 and only in a few cases are long term and large scale variations addressed gasparini et al 2004 latapie et al 2014 blom et al 2017a in fact combining long term trends with short term changes is extremely difficult and therefore for practical reasons these two phenomena are generally uncoupled focussing on a single scale aiming to provide information about the morphological changes in a river system at the watershed scale quasi equilibrium modelling can be a good simplification of the actual behaviour of large river systems characterised by high inertia due to the large spatial resolution and the inherently long processes involved simplified approaches therefore greatly reduce the computational effort eventually providing the boundary conditions of local scale models having a higher spatio temporal resolution or suggesting possible management strategies for the entire river system on the other part conceptual approaches and simplified models can be useful in understanding the general behaviour of a phenomenon starting from a 1 d numerical model originally created for engineering purposes di silvio and peviani 1991 fasolato et al 2011 and already tested on large watercourses for evaluating short term dynamics nones et al 2013 a 0 d two reach two grainsize model has been developed for reproducing the very long term geological evolution of alluvial streams this lumped model derives from an integration of a classical longitudinal wide 1 d model over the whole basin aiming to provide a few insights on the long term evolution of a river system accounting for a very limited number of parameters and therefore with a reduced computational effort the capability of the proposed 0 d model was tested against test cases di silvio et al 2016 but an application on real rivers is still missing the aim of the present work therefore is to provide some insights on the long term evolution of three large rivers pointing out the importance of the anthropogenic impact as an external driver and suggesting the need for coupling codes having manifold spatial and temporal scales for adequately simulate the river hydro dynamics since empirical data on the long term evolutionary scenarios are missing in particular on the spatial distribution of grainsize across the whole river basin the 0 d model adopts a simplistic approach and does not account for a spatial distribution of the liquid and solid input modelling the river systems as a virtual sediment and water fed flume having a constant and concentrated input of water and sediments along the paper this and the other main simplifications of the 0 d two reach two grainsize model adopted are further explained and discussed focussing on the dimensionless description of the morphometric parameters that are used to describe the evolution of alluvial systems concavity fining and aggrading and highlighting the importance of their extremes aside from the temporal evolution discussed in other works franzoia 2014 varrani 2017 the model is applied to three large alluvial rivers affected by anthropogenic pressures at a various level aiming to assess its ability in qualitatively reproducing their evolution towards quasi equilibrium conditions if compared with literature evidence as discussed in the following the model via the detection of the maximum values of three morphometric parameters can capture those morphological conditions that portray the present fluvial patterns albeit the presence of humans influence like hydropower dams could alter such behaviour in a strong manner besides the irregular trends observed in the modelling runs could be also correlated to the absence of accurate sedimentological data with their spatial distribution along and across the rivers which are paramount for a reliable description of the whole sedimentary system and affect the consistency of the 0 d model in quantitatively describing the river changes pointing out the need of additional research in this direction the paper is structured as follow after a short introduction covering the mathematical background of the model which was already presented by franzoia 2014 and varrani 2017 it is applied to three case studies the orinoco the congo e the mississippi rivers based on the actual state and assuming different ratios of sediment sorting and per cent of fine sediments in input because of a lack of sedimentological information the modelling application shows the capability of the lumped model in reproducing the observed trends both these results and the simplifications adopted are discussed and the main conclusions are drawn highlighting the ability of a model originally developed for engineering purposes to reproduce the fluvial behaviour at the geological scale potentially creating a bridge between the disciplines 2 methodology 2 1 numerical modelling the 0 d model used here previously proposed by franzoia 2014 and then developed and applied by various authors franzoia and nones 2017 varrani 2017 is based on a 1 d schematization already test against real rivers for simulating their evolution at the engineering decades scale e g di silvio and peviani 1991 nones et al 2014 aside from the hypothesis of local uniform flow frequently adopted to characterize the evolution of fluvial environments at the large spatial scale depending on the froude number fasolato et al 2011 the model assumes that only two grainsize classes composing the river bed characterize the solid phase evolution morphological changes are described via the sediment continuity exner 1920 and the mass balance hirano 1971 equations while an engelund hansen type formula franzoia and nones 2017 computes the sediment transport forced by geometry hydrology and sedimentological characteristics imposing two representative grainsizes classes coarse c and fine f fractions d df dc represents the diameter ratio giving an indication of the bed sorting on the other hand the sediment transport is characterized by a fine fraction per cent Œ≤ and a coarse one 1 Œ≤ for a sake of simplicity and because along the studied reaches the downstream fining is predominantly controlled by the selective sorting attal and lav√© 2009 the abrasion is not considered in the present application using digital elevation models having a resolution of 10 30 m and bathymetric data elevation of the longitudinal profile retrieved from literature as a geometrical basis varrani 2017 each river is schematized into two connected uniform slope channels these reaches can represent from a physical point of view respectively the highland part of the basin having steeper slopes and coarser bed grainsize i e gravel and the lowland one characterized by a milder slope and finer sediments i e sand composing the river bed the upstream reach is indicated with the subscript u and starts from a point where one can qualitatively locate the spatially fixed barycentre of the watershed where water and sediment inputs from the basin slopes are concentrated and feed the solid and liquid supplies to the main course franzoia 2014 the downstream reach subscript d starts from the transition point and ends at the river outlet assumed as fixed and corresponding to the sea level the transition point assumed having a fixed position is the location where the watershed area from a surface source of sediments becomes an alluvial depositional surface conventionally assumed at the confluence of the main river stem and its largest tributary fig 1 the mountain reach measures lu in length and has a constant valley width bu while the constant lowland length and valley widths are ld and bd respectively generally the valley width bd is greater than the upstream width bu since the lowland part flows through alluvial depositional surface while the upstream reach is confined by mountainous constraints the time variable sediment input g has a percent of fine Œ± g and is concentrated at the upstream end while pu and pd indicate the sediment transport from the upstream reach and the sediment flow that comes out from the river respectively franzoia 2014 franzoia et al 2017 the watercourse evolves from a horizontal flat condition at t 0 orogeny towards the virtual equilibrium state reached at the time t t where the bed elevation at the barycenter h becomes h given the relatively crude schematization of the entire river system with only two connected reaches one can argue that at the very long term centuries and millennia and assuming that the river discharge remains constant there is no concavity since pd pu g and the river bed composition of the fine fraction and consequently of the coarse one is the same for both reaches Œ≤u Œ≤d this oversimplification permits a qualitative analysis of the changes of longitudinal profile and grainsize distribution of large river systems without accounting for small scale phenomena like the localized input of flow and sediment tributaries bank failure or geological constraints knickpoints aiming to contribute to the long lasting debate on graded rivers see among others mackin 1948 bolla pittaluga et al 2014 blom et al 2017a franzoia and nones 2017 based on the assumptions described above the model can be written in a dimensionless form franzoia 2014 to compare river basins having different characteristics table 1 where the morphological parameter m relates the long term water formative discharge q biedenharn et al 1999 to the sediment transport p assuming the validity of a sediment rating curve for each reach e g di silvio and peviani 1991 asselman 2000 fasolato et al 2011 franzoia 2014 nones et al 2014 franzoia and nones 2017 varrani 2017 sediment continuity and momentum equations are combined with the sediment transport formula and these equations integrated for both the liquid assuming uniform flow hypothesis and solid phases over the two reaches lu and ld franzoia 2014 varrani 2017 accounting for the filling time of the basin di silvio and nones 2014 one obtains three time variable morphometric parameters necessary to characterize the evolution of a watercourse towards its morphological equilibrium state eventually reached at the equilibrium time t t franzoia 2014 1 x t s u t s d t s s u s d œÜ t Œ≤ d t Œ≤ u t Œ≤ b d b u a t m u t m d t m m orph u m orph d where the longitudinal profile concavity x t represents the ratio between the upstream and downstream slopes with respect to the very long term equilibrium slope s reached at the equilibrium time t bed sediment fining œÜ t and aggrading a t of the river bed give information about the long term sediment composition and longitudinal profile evolution showing how far the bed grainsize of the two reaches imposed as input is from the long term equilibrium conditions following the two reach schematization all the three parameters become equal to 0 at the equilibrium since the upstream and downstream parts transport the same quantity of material water and sediment that have the same composition and therefore no more changes on the longitudinal profile and bed composition are possible for a sake of simplicity additional details on the modelling approach and the assumed approximations are reported in appendix a an analysis of the available sources of input data among others castelltort and van den driessche 2003 gupta 2007 latrubesse 2008 di silvio and nones 2014 suggested that aside from the actual geometry and hydrology that are relatively easy to derive from remote imagery and literature data there are several uncertainties regarding the sedimentological parameters varrani 2017 in particular because of the complexity in monitoring such kind if data reliable and spatially distributed information on the bed grainsize composition is hardly discoverable in literature moreover given that the adopted input data referred to the actual conditions they are likely not representative of the pristine natural state of the river basin but rather of a condition already affected by human drivers syvitski et al 2005 therefore the results presented in this study refer to a long term quasi equilibrium eventually attained assuming stationary boundary conditions i e absence of natural and anthropogenic alterations and should be considered as a qualitative indication of a future trend the difficulty in finding up to date and spatially distributed sediment parameters reproducing the situation of the entire river system requires a sensitivity analysis on the two sedimentological input parameters adopted in the model for this reason while geometrical and hydrological information referred to the actual large rivers under study the percent of fine sediment at the input Œ±g and the diameter ratio d of the input material were chosen on the basis of few available indications and span between 0 75 0 99 and 0 10 0 50 respectively considering that the washload do not contribute in changing the overall parameters 2 2 case studies to point out the different behaviour between rivers deeply affected by the human presence and watercourses closer to their pristine state and mainly subjected to natural drivers the model was applied to the orinoco river representing practically non affected conditions and two highly impacted river basins namely the congo and the mississippi to simulate the evolution of such watercourses they were divided into two connected reaches using hydrological geometrical and sedimentological data retrieved from literature and gis mapping e g castelltort and van den driessche 2003 labat et al 2005 gupta 2007 di silvio and nones 2014 varrani 2017 given the high uncertainties regarding the sediment composition and distribution along the river system a sensitivity analysis over the sediment related parameters percent of fine input Œ±g and sorting ratio d was done the river behaviour is analyzed by means of the maximum values of three time variable morphometric parameters eq 1 evaluating them for a changing sorting ratio d of the bed sediments and a variable percent of fine sediment input Œ±g since these parameters can be largely variable along the stream and are also deeply affected by anthropogenic drivers franzoia 2014 varrani 2017 in evaluating the temporal changes of the three morphometric parameters the maxima are to be interpreted as referring to the effects of the present state on the natural riverine evolution namely indicating whether the river given the initial conditions i e solid and liquid discharge which relate to the current situation shows a tendency towards a more or less stable quasi equilibrium state and how far is the present configuration from it river information table 2 are based on literature data castelltort and van den driessche 2003 gupta 2007 latrubesse 2008 di silvio and nones 2014 updated from the interpretation of the present fluvial configuration as derived from gis analysis varrani 2017 the location of the barycentre where the localized fed of water and input is imposed is defined based on geometrical considerations and literature review while the transition point identifies the larger tributary of the river because of the uncertainties related to the positioning of these points a preliminary analysis was performed pointed out the little impact of their positioning with respect to the other parameters i e sorting ratio and sediment composition given that the model reproduces the long term evolution of the entire watershed sediment transport and water discharge rate refer to the present values measured at the river mouth castelltort and van den driessche 2003 gupta 2007 latrubesse 2008 di silvio and nones 2014 varrani 2017 as seen in table 2 the three case studies differ on the hydrological morphological and geometrical point of view however looking at each specific case study the difference in the simulation outcomes cannot be directly referred to the uncertainties in the initial conditions water and sediment discharges sediment sorting ratio length and width ratios giving reasons to correlate them to other causes like anthropogenic factors as discussed in the following 3 results in analysing the present conditions assuming varying sedimentological parameters two different behaviours were observed first a clear and smooth trend shown by less impounded watercourses such as the orinoco river and second a more irregular tendency indicating a sort of dynamic conditions that seems typical of highly impacted environments schumm and lichty 1965 syvitski et al 2005 lazarus et al 2016 like the congo and the mississippi rivers a detailed analysis of each watercourse is reported in the following focussing on the maximum values of the three morphometric parameters reached at the present state t 1 10 years the reason for choosing the maximum in the temporal evolution of the three morphometric parameters is that it represents a point where the time derivative equals zero meaning a neighbourhood where such parameter does not change in time 3 1 orinoco river for large watercourses insignificantly influenced by large scale anthropogenic activities e g dams riverbed mining etc like the orinoco river the maximum concavity x of the longitudinal profile has a consistent trend depending on the imposed sedimentological characteristics it increases with the sorting ratio d covering a larger range for lower per cent of the fine sediment input Œ±g fig 2 a in this case the higher the per cent of fine input the more constant the maximum concavity showing a quasi independent evolution of this parameter from the sediment ratio d namely from the sorting of the bed material of the entire course as pointed out by several studies e g blom et al 2017a wickert and schildgen 2019 river concavity and downstream fining are correlated thus the maximum values of the bed fining œÜ fig 2b shows a similar behaviour to the ones of x in this case a higher fine sediment input Œ± g corresponds to lower values of sorting ratio d because sediments imposed as input are already fine and therefore the overall adaptation process becomes very rapid the maximum bed aggrading a fig 2c as expected has a trend like the longitudinal profile concavity but spanning a narrower range 0 69 0 79 for bed aggrading with respect to 0 47 0 80 for profile concavity regarding the aggrading for high values of the sediment sorting ratio d well sorted material the trend has some small irregularities especially for very fine sediments Œ±g 0 999 that are highly sensitive to the changing boundary conditions and can be easily transported along the river system indeed as already observed describing the model hypotheses the very fine sediments imposed here as input Œ±g 0 999 cannot be considered as sediment transport that contributes to changes in the bed morphology but rather these very fine sediments are transported as washload due to their small grainsize and are assumed not to alter the bed morphodynamics using the orinoco river as a case study fig 3 reports an example of the temporal changes of the three analysed morphometric parameters simulated assuming a sediment sorting ratio d equal to 0 20 it is evident that the maximum values are reached at different times depending on the per cent of fine sediment imposed as input Œ±g besides the initial variations that depend on the adaptation phase of the numerical model to the initial conditions one can observe that a relatively constant value plateau is reached for log t around 0 i e t 1 indicating that the assumed input data may portray the present river conditions one must keep in mind that this figure represents a single run of the model while the maxima values reported elsewhere are representing the general behaviour of the entire fluvial system 3 2 congo river the congo river in africa has two major dams located in its lower course unep 2010 winemiller et al 2016 and because this anthropic pressure that obviously affects natural water and sediment regimes it can hardly reach quasi equilibrium conditions like the orinoco river described above as visible from fig 4 it is clear that the trend of the morphometric parameters is not smooth in particular looking at river bed aggrading a fig 4c a very irregular behaviour is observable this indicates that the assumed input values correlated to the present ones are not adequately representing a stable quasi equilibrium state even if the other morphometric parameters have a quite consistent trend the maxima for the longitudinal concavity x and bed fining œÜ are representative of a relatively quasi stable behaviour but this different behaviour could be related to the large inertia of the river to changing boundary conditions that allow for an adaptation of the grainsize composition and the longitudinal profile 3 3 mississippi river concerning the mississippi river the three morphometric parameters present several irregularities when compared to the results obtained for the orinoco river and even for an anthropized watercourse like the congo using the input data corresponding to the present configuration this river does reach stable quasi equilibrium conditions neither at short nor at long timescale but shows a very changing behaviour this is evident from the maximum values reported in fig 5 as well as observing the temporal variations of the three morphometric parameters varrani 2017 despite these irregularities a general behaviour is clearly discernible the greater the per cent of input fines Œ±g the lower the influence of the bed sediment sorting ratio d on all the parameters 4 discussion generally large alluvial rivers show a concave profile having a slope of the upstream mountain reach higher than the downstream lowland one accompanied by a longitudinal fining of the river bed composition and aggradation downstream e g sternberg 1875 mackin 1948 schumm and lichty 1965 sinha and parker 1996 franzoia and nones 2017 as discussed by many researchers since decades this configuration may be explained by a variety of mechanisms such as particle abrasion distributed input of finer sediments coming from the tributaries and increase of the transport river width see among others richter 1939 shulits 1941 leopold and maddock 1953 miller 1958 snow and slingerland 1987 parker 1991 paola et al 1992a b rice and church 2001 fedele and paola 2007 frings 2008 di silvio et al 2016 ferrer boix et al 2016 bolla pittaluga et al 2014 blom et al 2016 2017a b mudd et al 2018 at the same time this behaviour is frequently disproven by geological constraints like rocky gorges and knickpoints or localized sources of material e g bank failure which evidence a coarsening of the bed composition moreover human drivers e g dams channelization bed mining can alter the natural trend of sediment transport v√∂r√∂smarty et al 2003 syvitski et al 2005 latapie et al 2014 and consequently concavity and fining in a significant manner as well as observed from the comparison of several large rivers worldwide varrani 2017 particularly significant for the scope of this research are three time variable dimensionless morphometric quantities longitudinal profile concavity x t bed fining œÜ t and bed aggrading a t functions of the non dimensional time t besides the temporal changes the present application shows that the maximum values reached by these parameters represent a qualitative proxy of the overall river dynamics at the watershed scale moreover the temporal scale of the river evolution is a function of the river filling or response time tfill frequently used to characterize the response velocity of the phenomena involved in fluvial morphodynamics leopold and maddock 1953 castelltort and van den driessche 2003 di silvio et al 2016 franzoia and nones 2017 franzoia et al 2017 and therefore to evaluate inertia and adaptation scale of the studied systems the application to real data representing large river systems which are anthropized at different degrees but all characterized by high inertia resulted in a moderately slow morphological evolution towards quasi equilibrium conditions carried out in this research and in previous works di silvio and nones 2014 varrani 2017 even if starting from a very few data this study has proven reasonable results for the time centuries and millennia and spatial scale hundreds of kilometres of analysis and for the adopted assumptions as compared to qualitative outcomes of previous applications di silvio and nones 2014 di silvio et al 2016 franzoia and nones 2017 franzoia et al 2017 it must be considered that the simplifications adopted in the present approach hold only for large alluvial systems having particularly high inertia to changes triggered by external forcing in favour of attaining a morphological equilibrium state at the very long timescale varrani 2017 on the contrary watercourses characterized by much smaller dimensions or highly impacted by humans are more prone to abrupt variations induced by oscillations in their boundary and initial conditions i e their response time tfill is shorter it is therefore not recommended to model such systems at the very long timescale using the 0 d model and the hypotheses proposed in this research but rather to account for 1 d or even 2 d schematizations adopting the present conditions as input and accounting for uncertainties correlated to sediments characteristics the evaluation of the trend of the maximum values represents a qualitative indicator of the perturbations to which these systems are subjected with respect to their equilibrium conditions eventually reached at the very long term t however a thorough analysis of the spatial validity of the input data and the temporal evolution of the three morphometric parameters concavity fining and aggrading is required to corroborate the results reported here and completely characterize the long term evolution of the fluvial systems studied similarly a comparison with existing numerical and analytical models could be helpful in supporting the present outcomes fasolato et al 2011 di silvio and nones 2014 but the intrinsic limitations i e modelling assumptions and simplifications of the adopted equations of each code should be carefully considered however given the lack of sedimentological input data in both time and space and the uncertainties in simulating the future evolution of river systems because of the changing boundary conditions only a qualitative evaluation of the model performances can be drawn even if intrinsically affected by errors these results could be helpful for forcing more detailed models or as an indication for water managers looking at the very long term evolution of river basins focussing on the modelling results and drawing attention to the more anthropized river systems it is worth to notice that in the case of the congo river bed fining and longitudinal profile concavity have a relatively constant trend while the aggrading is more irregular these modelling results are in accordance to previous research on the correlation of profile concavity and downstream fining in alluvial rivers e g paola et al 1992b blom et al 2016 blom et al 2017a the unstable behaviour of the aggrading could be related to the presence of two dams close to the river mouth unep 2010 indeed these structures retain most of the solid discharge causing a reduction of the variance in the grainsize distribution and giving rise to sediment ratios similar to the ones adopted in this research the adopted input parameters relate to the sediment discharged at present in the sea so they take into account via the morphometric parameter the presence of this disturbance in trapping a significant part of the total sediment yield from the basin on the other hand it is evident that more research on the sedimentology and morphology of the more anthropized mississippi river is required since this watercourse has not yet reached quasi equilibrium conditions and therefore it is very sensitive to external human induced forcing like dams which entrap sediments and strongly decrease both water flow and sediment transport eventually changing the fluvial planforms hudson and kesel 2000 nittrouer et al 2012 indeed this river is highly dammed and therefore the present conditions imposed here as input could be very far from the quasi equilibrium conditions for both the hydrology and sedimentology the differences in modelling the river evolution between these two dammed rivers could be also related to the celerity of sediment transport indeed the mississippi river is characterized by a higher celerity with respect to the congo river because of its geological characteristics pointing out the effects of the impoundments in a clearer manner and at a shorter time scale due to the assumptions intrinsically related to the large scale modelling the management of alluvial rivers involves the implementation of strategies typically based on the results of small scale modelling tools and simulations in that the final morphological state is assumed as related to some equilibrium conditions usually considered as stable indeed natural alluvial river systems can show a more complicated behaviour referred to as dynamic equilibrium presenting short term oscillations from an assumed mean trend present management strategies usually consider the system to be managed as frozen with the actual conditions in most cases not accounting for the evolution and the different time scales involved the assumption of constant solid and liquid input all over the simulated time is intended to mimic such an idea of a static system under steady conditions projecting the actual values far off in time and observing how a simplified model simulates the evolution of the watercourses allows to appraise whether quasi equilibrium conditions are possible or not indicating if the input to the model namely solid and liquid discharges allow for a system recovery from the disturbances imposed relating to the cases of the congo and the mississippi rivers the 0 d model outcomes clearly show that both rivers are not able to attain a quasi equilibrium state given the present hydrological and sedimentological conditions which is indicative of potential problems when managing such watercourses at the basin scale in fact as pointed out among many others by harmar and clifford 2007 and wang and xu 2018 the mississippi river behaviour is clearly affected by the human presence both in the upper alluvial valley where the slight convexity of the longitudinal profile can be attributed to high rates of localised aggradation in the late wisconsinan and early holocene periods and in the middle zone where the linear profile reflects the dramatic shortening of the river by the programme of artificial channel cut offs between 1932 and 1942 and the subsequent bank stabilisation in summary these authors pointed out that the profile concavity of this river can be considered at least partially as a feature inherited from past geomorphological conditions which are maintained by engineering modifications to the planform and channel length and thus highly impacted by human drivers harmar and clifford 2007 this latter example indicates that for adequately reproduce the short term changes in watercourses strongly affected by anthropogenic pressures the present code could be not a solution but rather it should be used to point out possible large scale and long term trends to be downscaled and evaluated in a more comprehensive manner by means of detailed i e 1 d and 2 d models evidently a real watercourse differs from the very schematic system adopted in this work because besides other differences the feeding is not concentrated at the upstream end but it is spatially distributed by the network of tributaries however as shown in a first crude approximation a non concave profile at the very long time scale can be derived from the sediment continuity and uniform flow conditions but also from the key assumption of unlimited sediment supply at the upper boundary since mountains are assumed as infinite sediment sources steady uplift over time and local scale mechanisms are neglected franzoia 2014 clearly this cannot be valid for real river systems observed at the shorter historical time scale as along with water discharge increasing in the downstream direction sediment discharge changes being tributaries not only vectors of flow but also of solid input moreover at the very long time scale geological parameters such as uplift and subsidence can become significant peizhen et al 2001 willett et al 2014 also the abrasion is an important mechanism in downstream fining especially at the laboratory scale and for very steep reaches characterized by coarse sediments attal and lav√© 2009 but it results being less important basin wide paola et al 1992b and for large lowland and sandy watercourses indeed comparing abrasion and selective sorting as dominant control on downstream fining the latter is predominant in river systems where sediment aggradation occurs like alluvial watercourses brierley and hickin 1985 paola et al 1992b brewer and lewin 1993 ferguson et al 1996 surian 2002 moussavi harami et al 2004 attal and lav√© 2009 aiming to suggest a qualitative trend at the watershed scale the 0 d lumped model which integrates along the upper and lowland reaches the flow and the sediment equations does not allow to account for local sources of water and sediments tributaries bank collapse etc the absence of concavity resulting here as quasi equilibrium final condition is therefore not a real asymptotic condition and it is not discussed as possibly occurring at the very long term but its only accounted for mathematical purposes in the modelling runs despite this the hypotheses of aggregating the hydrographic network into one virtual main watercourse and localizing water and sediment input in its initial section do not appear to affect the main aspects of the river evolution provided that the main morphometric length and width and hydro morphological water and sediment input conditions of the watercourse are preserved franzoia 2014 franzoia and nones 2017 preliminary applications of the model in fact shown that all the approximations introduced cannot affect in a significant manner the model itself which remains a powerful tool in detecting long term trends of large alluvial rivers the findings discussed here can have a potential significance for the way in which fluvial engineers and geomorphologists evaluate the riverine longitudinal profiles conceptually indeed the interactions between natural and anthropogenic drivers responses and feedbacks are quite well known however from a practical point of view considerable problems remain preventing an upscale of these scale dependent interactions generally it is assumed that the equilibrium status of a watercourse is irrelevant as it may never be attained at the historical scale due to continuously changing boundary conditions hydrology and sediment input and uplift or subsidence however if the hydrologic and sedimentary controls change so slowly that the river system can keep pace with them its morphological evolution can continuously establish a state of quasi equilibrium as described in this paper in fact based on the evaluation of the temporal evolution and the maxima of the three morphometric parameters it may be assumed that the conditions obtained by the 0 d lumped model portray the present pattern of the watercourses and therefore that they are dependent on the non dimensional parameters describing each river basin for a coherent application of the schematization proposed in this research an evaluation of the sensitivity of the model and its hypotheses to the spatial scale is needed in order to assess the field of validity i e up to which scale starting from the whole river and reducing the studied dimensions can this schematization be valid and applicable is the present scheme realistic or should it be changed perhaps introducing a sequence of three or more connected reaches i e moving towards a 1 d model this is meaningful because the present approach is meant to be valid for the whole river system but generally for practical uses it might be required an analysis of the quasi equilibrium at the local scale via application to a sub system indeed the very simple altimetric and planimetric configuration with two reaches might not be appropriate for small scale watercourses since this may lead to inconsistencies of the results or oversimplifications of the real world similarly accounting for only two grainsize means that the modelled fluvial system presents a bed with a bimodal composition 5 conclusions the paper proposes the application of a simplified 0 d two reach two grainsize model to evaluate the long term evolution of large alluvial rivers forced by initial conditions representing the actual state to compare rivers highly anthropized with more natural watercourses the modelling inputs consist of localized solid and water discharges corresponding to the present values measured at the mouth and representing the formative conditions while sorting ratios and per cent of fine input were subjected to a sensitivity analysis because of the lack of such kind of data in the case of rivers affected by the human pressure in a minor way like the orinoco river flowing through colombia and venezuela concavity fining and aggrading have shown a consistent general pattern on the one hand the presence of anthropogenic disturbances can clearly alter this behaviour giving rise to a very irregular trend as visible in the case of the mississippi river usa on the other hand large infrastructures like dams when not correctly managed and maintained are likely to alter the evolution of a large river like the congo in africa as it can be seen by the oscillations present in the aggrading parameter due to the large scale of analysis long term modelling of alluvial rivers can indicate criticalities in the present situation like what is presented in this study for the mississippi river and in a minor way for the congo river for highly anthropized watercourses it is clear how the changes imposed alter the system which can gradually adapt to such disturbances but is only occasionally able to reach quasi equilibrium conditions the temporal scale of this process of self adjustment should be considered when planning any further activity on disturbed watercourses but estimates on this time are not always available or easily computable moreover recognising the importance of the interplay between both natural and engineering drivers is paramount to adequately manage large fluvial systems aside from the encouraging outcomes given the restrictive assumptions adopted in the present research for the future specific aspects of the modelling procedure should be improved by i analysing the relationship between the quasi equilibrium configuration and the morphometric parameters ii accounting for a more realistic description of alluvial river systems namely by introducing lithological discontinuities in the longitudinal profiles knickpoints waterfalls lakes etc a variable width and changing water and sediment inputs iii considering other parameters that could affect river concavity bed sediments fining and aggrading processes iv consider additional both natural climate change extreme events eustatism etc and anthropic levees dams diversions river bed mining etc drivers acting at many scales namely accounting for variable boundary conditions acknowledgements the authors would like to thank prof giampaolo di silvio and dr mariateresa franzoia for

6486,grass swales are important elements of the urban green infrastructure that convey and attenuate urban runoff and improve its quality mostly through stormwater infiltration into and retention of conveyed pollutants by swale soils the retention of metals by grass swales was addressed in this study investigating the enrichment of swale soils by three common traffic related metals cu pb and zn three swales of various characteristics l1 l2 l3 were selected for study and their soils were sampled by coring the top 30 cm and dividing the cores into 5 cm thick layers cumulative metal burdens were compared to those modelled by the proprietary stormtac web model which estimates annual loads of specific constituents for the given land uses and stormwater treatment the comparisons of measured mbm and simulated mbs metal burdens retained by swales showed that the measured values exceed the simulated ones as described by average ratios mbs mbm 0 64 0 50 and 0 59 for swales l1 l2 and l3 respectively the measured burdens were calculated after subtracting the native soil metal concentrations assumed equal to those found in the deepest sampled layer 25 30 cm below the surface the results suggest the feasibility of assessing performance of grass swales by modelling metal cu pb zn retention by swales however for older facilities considered for rehabilitation the simulated results should be supplemented by soil chemistry sampling keywords grass swale heavy metals roadside soils planning level modelling metal transport 1 introduction modern or redeveloped urban areas include stormwater management measures in the form of green elements attempting to restore the original hydrological features of natural catchments and thereby reduce negative impacts of urbanisation among such elements grass swales are widely used examples of sustainable urban drainage systems suds serving to convey and attenuate urban runoff and improve its quality mostly through stormwater infiltration and retention of conveyed pollutants by swale soils ahiablame et al 2012 in urban drainage practice grassed swales are typically placed along roads and parking lots in the upper parts of catchments and are exposed to traffic generated pollutants including contaminated solids metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs much of the past research focused on retention of metals by grass swales because such metals may occur in stormwater at toxic levels and their traffic related sources are relatively ubiquitous and well known in urban areas huber et al 2016 as reported in the literature short term water quality enhancement performance of grass swales was investigated by comparing the quality of runoff entering and exiting swales either from samples of actual runoff generated by rainfall stagge et al 2012 or by sampling runoff simulated by irrigation deletic and fletcher 2006 in most studies runoff quality was described by total suspended solids tss nutrients species of n and p and metals cu pb zn boger et al 2018 gavriƒá et al 2019 removals of total suspended solids tss in grass swales were reported as high as 98 b√§ckstr√∂m et al 2006 but the removals of metals and nutrients were much lower boger et al 2018 overall the previous research recognised that grass swales enhance runoff quality mostly through infiltration into swale soils i e preventing pollutant transport and settling kondo et al 2016 compared the soils of different types of green stormwater infrastructure gsi to non gsi sites and showed that although the former had lower or similar concentrations of elements of concern to human health than the latter the mean metal concentrations were generally higher than background concentrations and guidelines in all studied samples in infiltration based suds metals accumulate in top layers of grassy areas 10 30 cm deep with the highest concentrations occurring near the runoff inflow area tedoldi et al 2017 such concentrations decrease with the distance from the runoff inlet and with the soil depth even though in older infiltration facilities 30 years old the contamination can reach deeper layers as reviewed by tedoldi et al 2016 particulate fractions of removed or immobilized pollutants remain either on the bottom of swales or are incorporated into the swale soil matrix and may represent in situ sources of pollution lind and karro 1995 rushton 2001 the strength of such sources depends on the runoff pollution sources and swale effectiveness in retaining the incoming pollutants as determined either from short duration field studies lind and karro 1995 or by modelling larm 2000 field studies of pollution abatement by grass swales are complicated by difficulties in measuring low flows and pollutant concentrations and analytical costs limiting the number of analysed samples and constituents such challenges can be overcome by modelling studies and the feasibility of modelling swale flows and their quality was addressed by a number of researchers e g larm 2000 deletic and fletcher 2006 larm and alm 2014 while the modelling of swale flows was found feasible with some limitations e g rujner et al 2018 the detailed modelling of water quality in swales remains to be a challenge the relevant models reported in the literature are either research models deletic and fletcher 2006 or represent integrated conceptual models derived directly from experimental data larm 2000 the objective of the study presented herein is to examine the feasibility of estimating the long term grass swale performance in retaining metals represented by the model substances cu pb zn from swale soil chemistry and conceptual modelling with the stormtac web model such a comparison should provide a long term assessment of grass swale performance in runoff pollution mitigation and the feasibility of conceptually modelling the annual metal balance of swales 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study sites three swale catchments were selected for study in the city of lule√• in northern sweden 65 35 4 n 22 10 14 e the local climate is characterised by long winters the snow season usually starts in october november and snow remains on the ground until april the lowest and highest monthly average temperatures occur in january 11 5 c and july 15 5 c respectively and the average annual precipitation is 506 mm smhi 2014 the first swale l1 is located in a small commercial catchment and receives lateral runoff from a parking lot a small part of the roof of an adjacent building and a single lane road with the average daily traffic adt 2750 the second swale l2 is located close to the downtown and on one side drains a two lane road with the highest adt in lule√• 11 650 the other side of the swale l2 is delineated by a continuous curb and does not receive any stormwater runoff consequently that side of the swale was excluded from investigations the third swale l3 is located in a small residential catchment and receives lateral runoff from a parking lot a roof of an adjacent building a grassed area and a two lane road with adt 2500 the footprint areas of the studied swales l1 l2 and l3 including the upstream non sampled sections and the downstream sampled sections were 225 357 and 516 m2 respectively according to the lule√• municipality the road and swale at l2 is 57 years old and the roads and swales at l1 and l3 are 38 years old swale catchment characteristics are summarized in table 1 in sweden there are no specific guidelines for type of soil to be used for swale construction and therefore lule√• swales are built using native soils soil infiltration rates of three swales corresponded to the soil texture of a loamy sand 2 2 soil sampling soil sampling was performed in october 2017 with a 5 cm diameter stainless steel corer 30 cm long at each site a 20 m long swale section receiving direct runoff from only roads and parking lots was selected and sampled along three cross sections 10 m apart samples were collected in each cross section at distances 40 and 80 cm from the edge of the contributing drainage area and at the deepest point of the cross section before extracting the soil cores the grass was cut each core sample was divided into 5 cm slices using a stainless steel knife placed in a plastic bag refrigerated and kept in cold storage until analysed up to 7 days at each swale samples representing topsoil layer 0 5 cm were subject to laboratory analysis in swale l3 the side draining a parking lot could not be sampled because of the presence of gravel from the construction of the parking lot at all three swales additional deeper soil layers from the swale bottom section i e 5 10 10 15 cm and the deepest layer obtained were subject to laboratory analysis lastly additional deeper soil samples i e 5 10 10 15 cm and the deepest sample obtained from the swale side draining road were also analysed except for swale l3 where only the samples from the top 5 cm were analysed some deeper soil layers could not be sampled because of high soil compaction during the sampling campaign location data x y z coordinates were collected at numerous points along the swale using a real time kinematic gps device model geomax zenith35 pro tag with the precision of 1 5 cm for x and y and 2 cm for z in order to investigate the swale topography and estimate runoff contributing areas 2 3 laboratory analyses samples collected in swales l1 l3 were preprocessed in the university laboratory according to the standard iso 11464 and analysed for conductivity and ph the conductivity was measured according to the standard iso 11 265 2016 using the cdm210 conductivity meter meterlab radiometer analytical with the accuracy of 0 2 of

dry sieved in a vibratory sieve shaker retsch as200 using a stainless sieve with the mesh size of 2 mm soil lumps 2 mm were crushed and mixed with the finer material 2 mm iso 11464 2016 the sample mass 2 mm and 2 mm was measured after sieving material 2 mm comprised stones and grass roots analyses of total metals cu pb and zn and loss on ignition loi were done by an accredited commercial laboratory als scandinavia ab in lule√• the total metal content was analysed using inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometry icp sfms element thermo fisher according to ss en iso 17294 1 2 and epa method 200 8 all metal concentrations were reported in mg kg of dry weight dw analytical uncertainties in the reported metal cu pb zn concentrations were 19 21 of the reported values the loi analysis was associated with the metal analysis and was made after melting the material with lithium metaborate libo2 at 1000 c 2 4 calculating metal burdens using soil chemistry data the mean pollutant concentration c mg kg in each layer was multiplied by the mass of swale soil kg in particles 2 mm in that layer which was estimated from the soil density kg m3 and the layer volume m3 a more detailed explanation of the method follows for each 5 cm layer of swale a mean metal concentration and standard deviation sd were calculated using all the samples collected in the layer in the case of swales l1 and l3 and the layers 15 20 cm and 20 25 cm where no samples were analysed the mean metal concentrations and sd were assumed to be equal to those of layers 10 15 and 25 30 cm respectively from the measured soil mass 2 mm and 2 mm a mean total soil mass in a 5 cm slice msample g was calculated as well as the share of the material 2 mm the volume of a sample vsample m3 was calculated from a 5 cm high cylinder with a 5 cm diameter representing the 5 cm slice from the soil corer soil density œÅ kg m3 in each layer was then calculated from the measured mass of the soil sample including both materials smaller and larger than 2 mm and the sample volume each 5 cm layer volume vlayer m3 of swale soil was calculated from the swale area m2 and the layer thickness 5 cm the area included the upstream swale section which was not sampled assuming that the metals were evenly distributed upstream of the sampled section mass of soil in each 5 cm layer msoil layer kg was calculated from œÅ kg m3 and layer volume m3 since the metal concentrations were analysed in sieved material 2 mm mass of soil 2 mm in each 5 cm layer m 2mm kg was calculated by multiplying msoil layer by the share of the material 2 mm finally the obtained mass of soil m 2mm kg was multiplied by c mg kg in order to estimate the metal mass kg retained in that layer of swale soil mmetal 2 4 1 soil background concentration metal burdens in swale soils comprise two components i naturally occurring background burdens in swale soils and ii burdens contributed by anthropogenic sources i e mostly road runoff and atmospheric deposition the knowledge of the chemistry of native soils in the three studied swales would allow for subtracting the native metal burdens from those calculated from sampled chemical concentrations the idea of obtaining the native soil chemistry information from swale l2 which does not receive stormwater runoff on one side was rejected because only top layer 0 5 cm samples from this side were analysed and were potentially contaminated by stored snow another way of accounting for native soil metal concentrations would be to use the mean concentration in the deepest soil layer 25 30 cm deep as the best estimate since the studied swales were built with native soils the metal concentrations in the deepest soil layer were compared to the background levels from johansson et al 1995 who investigated regional patterns of metals cu zn pb hg and cd in lake sediments and the mor layer in forest soils in sweden for cu and zn the authors adopted the soils data from remote areas of northern sweden andersson et al 1991 as the background concentrations of 55 and 6 3 ppm respectively concerning pb the mean concentration of 15 mg kg was reduced to 8 mg kg on the basis of the historical record of the anthropogenic effect on pb in lake sediments table 2 shows the mean metal concentration values from the deepest soil layer at the three sampled swales in this study l1 l3 together with the metal concentrations from remote areas of northern sweden and the estimated background levels of metals by johansson et al 1995 table 2 shows that the background levels of pb 8 mg kg and zn 55 mg kg are higher than the concentrations sampled in the deepest layers at l1 and l3 while those of cu were comparable the background levels of all the metals studied were lower than those in the deepest layer of l2 for estimating the background soil metal burdens mback in this study the mean metal concentrations in the deepest soil layer of individual swales were used as the best estimates of native soil metal concentrations cumulative metal burden mtot for a 30 cm thick soil layer was calculated as a sum of metal masses in individual layers mmetal reduced by the background

methods the second study objective was to examine the feasibility of estimating the total input loads of cu pb and zn with runoff into the tested swales and their partial retention in swale soils by runoff modelling recognizing the challenges of swale flow modelling and the need to model long term pollutant fluxes for modelling the swale mass balances of the metals studied a source based urban runoff model stormtac web was selected to simulate the annual pollutant mass retained in the swale soils this proprietary conceptual model requires little input data for performing long term calculations of annual runoff fluxes and pollutant loads which can be used for planning and design of stormwater treatment facilities larm 2000 the model inputs include i precipitation rain snow ii the land use data including the corresponding runoff contributing area and the volumetric runoff coefficient and iii the stormtac web database standard pollutant concentrations for each land use which represent annual averages based mainly on long term flow proportional sampling the annual stormwater pollutant load entering the swale lin kg year is calculated as a product of annual flow volume and standard pollutant concentrations for each land use the annual runoff volume q m3 year is calculated from annual precipitation a sub catchment area of specific land use and the land use specific volumetric runoff coefficient larm 2000 the total annual runoff is then obtained as a sum of annual runoff volumes from individual sub catchments 2 q 10 p i 1 n œÜ i a i m 3 year where p the average

annual pollutant loads entering and leaving the swales from which one can determine the annual loads retained in the swales using site specific functions for more than 15 different types of stormwater

calculated in stormtac web the annual load leaving the swale after treatment lout kg year is calculated from eq 4 4 l out l in re 100 l in the annual pollutant mass retained by the swale is calculated from the pollutant runoff input loads and the loads leaving the swale after treatment lin lout the stormtac web model calculates only the annual loads added kg year to the soil from the polluted stormwater and groundwater without consideration of the metal mass native to the soil thus the load retained by the swale represents the load added to the existing pollutant burden resulting from pollutant background concentrations in soils the annual loads produced by the model were multiplied by swale ages in years 38 57 and 38 years for l1 l2 and l3 respectively to obtain the total loads 2 5 1 modelling uncertainty for estimating the modelling uncertainty each pollutant concentration has been categorized by the model developers into three levels of uncertainty based on the coefficient of variation cv of input data i e cv 0 5 0 5 1 25 and 1 25 indicating high intermediate and low certainties respectively table 3 burton and pitt 2002 based on these criteria standard concentrations of cu pb and zn were ascribed low uncertainty for the reduction efficiencies in swales average uncertainty for the concentrations from parking lots and grass areas but high uncertainty for roofs for the road runoff different assessment criteria were used and according to such criteria the pollutant concentrations in road runoff were considered as containing low uncertainties r2 value 0 75 table 3 in this study the data from swedish studies were used for calculating standard concentrations in road runoff stormtac web standard pollutant concentrations larm 2000 are estimated for each land use based on an overall assessment of available literature data time trends calibrations based on case studies and comparisons with data from similar land uses therefore the standard concentration is not equal to median value from the flow proportional sampling presented in stormtac web database the standard concentrations for different pollutants and land uses are based on investigations where extensive flow or volume proportional sampling of runoff from catchments with one type of land use have been conducted these measurements cover all seasons of the year generating good estimates of the site mean concentrations and are conducted in a similar climate as where the model is applied the standard concentrations are updated continuously when new reliable data for a specific land use is incorporated into the database data for other comparable land uses are re evaluated the standard concentrations are also calibrated to consider different time trends stormtac web uses factors 0 10 for each land use except the roads to calculate land use specific concentrations a factor 5 indicates standard conditions of the land use while factors 5 and 5 indicate that the levels are adjusted towards the minimum or the maximum values in the database respectively for the roads the standard concentration is calculated on the basis of the adt to further investigate the modelling sensitivity and uncertainty two scenarios were formulated with a minimum factor 0 and a maximum factor 10 to obtain minimum and maximum land use input concentrations and thus the yearly input loads lin from the model moreover the swale pollutant reduction efficiency re was set to the minimum and maximum values estimated from stormtac web database the impact of these two parameters was investigated because they were considered the most uncertain and directly related to the stormwater quality modelling this resulted in two scenarios for estimating the minimum annual load retained in the swale soil kg year remin and cmin and the maximum annual load retained in the swale soil kg year remax and cmax the metal mass from these two scenarios was compared to the standard scenario 2 5 2 leaded gasoline scenario in order to investigate the scenario with higher pb concentrations reflecting the use of leaded gasoline in the past the median concentration of lead in runoff prior to 1995 was calculated from concentration data from the older road and parking lot data larm 1994 to estimate median concentrations of pb in road runoff after 1995 the stormtac web database was queried ignoring the data prior to 1995 this resulted in pb concentrations about seven times lower than those prior to 1995 thus two pb concentrations were used in computations of metal burdens entering the swales studied the concentration currently available in the model for the period starting in 1995 and the seven times higher concentration for the period prior to 1995 for cu and zn the current estimates of concentrations were used throughout the period studied 3 results soils properties of the three swales were characterized by measuring their loi ph and conductivity section 2 3 and the results are presented in table 4 the mean total metal concentrations in various soil layers at each swale site l1 l3 are listed in table 5 the coefficient of variation cv and the number of samples collected n are shown in the brackets the data in table 5 show distinctly higher metal concentrations particularly in the case of pb in soil samples from the oldest swale l2 which is exposed to runoff from the site with the highest adt intensity to assess the environmental significance of measured metal concentrations the calculated mean metal concentrations mean from all samples at the site and the maximum measured concentrations were compared to the swedish environmental protection agency guideline for polluted soils sepa 2016 the guideline is meant to protect people s health taking into account the direct exposure i e contact with the contaminated soil and indirect exposure i e transport of contaminants to air groundwater and plants sepa 2009 there are guideline values for two different types of land use sensitive land use s and less sensitive land use ls respectively both guideline values were used here for comparison as illustrated in table 6 listing the mean total metal concentrations the maximum measured concentrations and the two target values from the guideline exceeding the guideline values for less sensitive land use ls means that the soil quality limits the choice of land use to e g offices industries or roads sepa 2009 the maximum measured cu concentrations were 36 7 57 9 and 30 4 mg kg for l1 l2 and l3 respectively below the guideline maximum permissible concentrations of 80 s and 200 mg kg ls sepa 2016 similarly the maximum measured zn concentrations were 111 136 and 64 2 mg kg for l1 l2 and l3 respectively and none of them exceeded the guideline maximum permissible concentrations of 250 mg kg s and 500 mg kg ls sepa 2016 finally the maximum pb concentrations measured in soil samples were 13 3 188 and 14 5 mg kg for l1 l2 and l3 respectively while the pb concentrations at sites l1 and l3 complied with the sepa guideline 50 s and 400 mg kg ls sepa 2016 pb concentrations at site l2 exceeded the sensitive threshold s by the mean concentration and the maximum pb concentration fig 2 shows the pb burdens estimated from soil samples in three locations the lowest pb burden was calculated for swale l1 and the loads at l1 and l3 were low compared to the much higher load in swale l2 which is next to the road with the highest adt and thus exposed to more traffic pollution figs 1 and 3 show cu and zn burdens respectively which were larger in l1 and l3 than those of pb in the same swale and otherwise followed the same trend as noted above for pb l2 metal load l3 metal load l1 metal load stormtac web simulations of annual inputs and the retained loads are listed in table 7 together with the estimates of the total pollutant mass which has been retained since the swale construction the calculations were performed for the current catchment layout and the mean adts which were corrected to represent only the road lanes draining into the swales table 1 the annual input load was determined for the standard concentrations the retained load kg year is presented in three variants based on standard minimum and maximum concentrations as described in section 2 5 1 in road runoff pollution calculations the stormtac web model accounts for traffic intensity in order to examine the calculated metal loads sensitivities to adt historical adt values were obtained from the lule√• municipality for the period of swale operation the available data included three measured adts during 2008 2016 for l1 and l3 and more detailed measurements for l2 1980 2016 the yearly retained metal load was simulated using three adt values the mean and the mean standard deviation the modelled values were little sensitive to historical variations in adts at the study sites thus the mean adt was used for the load calculations fig 4 shows the comparison of cumulative metal loads from soil samples without background concentrations and from the model for the standard scenario and the scenario giving the minimum and maximum annual retained load the differences between the measured and modelled pb burdens can be further examined by accounting for phasing lead out of gasoline in the early 1990s analysis of historical trends in measured pb concentrations in road runoff over the course of five decades 1970 2010 showed a sharp decline in pb concentrations after 1990 corresponding to the phasing out of pb from gasoline huber et al 2016 the lead free gasoline was introduced in 1985 and from 1995 the sales of leaded gasoline were discontinued in sweden spbi 2014 fig 5 shows the comparison of the pb burdens calculated from 1 soil sample chemistry data 2 model outputs without modifying pb inflow concentrations prior to 1995 and 3 model outputs with increased pb concentrations prior to 1995 the calculated metal burdens for the leaded gasoline scenario were about 4 5 and 3 times higher than those neglecting the higher lead concentration in gasoline prior to 1995 for swales l1 l2 and l3 respectively overall fig 5 shows that the cumulative soil metal burdens do not exceed the modelled burdens for l2 and l3 when the higher past lead concentrations are considered in the case of l1 the opposite is true i e metal burden from the model output is around 3 times the cumulative mass from soil samples 4 discussion higher metal concentrations were measured in the soil samples from the oldest swale l2 which was exposed to the highest adt table 5 such a finding agrees with the previous research investigations of soil quality of 35 swales depths 20 30 cm showed increased soil metal concentrations cu cd cr pb and zn for higher average daily traffic adt intensity and frequent stop and go traffic horstmeyer et al 2016 moreover the metal content in swales of various ages 1 34 years old showed significantly higher content of pb in older facilities horstmeyer et al 2016 high pb concentrations in soils next to a highway road built in 1964 with adt of 40 000 50 000 were measured by norrstr√∂m and jacks 1998 along the line at distances of 0 5 and 2 5 m from the road 20 soil cores were sampled and divided in 5 cm slices the samples representing the same layer were composited and pb concentration measured in the 0 5 cm layer was 542 mg kg and in the 5 10 cm layer 502 mg kg moreover carrero et al 2013 measured high pb concentrations in roadside soil samples even though the leaded gasoline has been banned since 2001 at the study site location the total pollutant load entering the swale is partly incorporated into the soil matrix and partly passes through the swale unabated among the metals studied pb is mostly associated with the particulate fraction while cu and zn may also occur in appreciable quantities in the dissolved fraction huber et al 2016 fig 2 indicates the lowest pb concentrations in the two top layers of swale l2 followed by the peak in the fourth layer and gradual stabilisation in deeper layers pb layer burdens in l1 and l3 were more or less uniformly distributed recognizing the high pb affinity to solids high pb concentrations in the fourth layer of l2 15 20 cm below the surface would suggest migration flushing out of fine particles with pb from the top layer into the deeper soil horizons such vertical pb transport would confirm the previous observations that older stormwater facilities may have higher metal content and that pb may migrate into deeper soil layers rushton 2001 horstmeyer et al 2016 tedoldi et al 2016 there are multiple sources of uncertainties in the metal burdens presented in the results section i metal uptake by vegetation ii metal burden variation along the swale in the flow direction iii transport of metals into deeper layers iv background metal concentrations in native soils and v uncertainties in modelling results a brief discussion of all such uncertainties follows in the procedure applied in this study the metal mass calculated from the soil chemistry data represented the mass retained in the top soil layer 30 cm deep of the swale the soil material 2 mm in the study by leroy et al 2017 after two year period the plant uptake including both bellow and above ground plant parts was 0 4 4 6 of the initial soil metal mass the study included a control section and the swale section spiked with pahs and metals producing cd pb and zn surface soil content of 2 100 and 300 mg kg respectively the mean pb and zn mass plant uptake was significantly higher for the artificially contaminated swale section spiked with a mix of pahs and metals compared to the control section non contaminated leroy et al 2017 however the use of artificially spiked pollutants leroy et al 2017 might have increased the plant uptake considering that plants also contribute to metal zn cd pb retention in swales through metal uptake leroy et al 2017 the inclusion of such a metal uptake out of scope of the present study would have yielded higher retention of metals by the swales studied moreover we assumed that the mean pollutant concentration in each layer of the sampled 20 m long swale section was representative of the entire swale this could lead to a load overestimation if the pollutant concentrations in the swale were increasing in the downstream direction by comparison model outputs represent the annual pollutant burden retained by all soil layers without distinguishing the burden parts retained by individual soil layers the model calculation also does not include transfer of pollutants into the groundwater furthermore as suggested above dissolved metal burdens in the case of cu and zn could be transferred deeper than the 30 cm depth considered here and possibly even into the groundwater fig 4 shows a comparison among the cumulative metal burdens from soil samples reduced by the native soil burdens and those calculated from model outputs higher uncertainty can be observed for calculation of cumulative pb mass in swale l2 at swale l2 mean pb concentrations and the metal burdens in the deeper layers were higher than those in the top layers 0 5 and 5 10 cm fig 2 metal accumulations in swale soils are difficult to estimate for older facilities because of difficulties in estimating the effects of historical changes maintenance and reconstruction moreover simulated results for swale l1 and l3 had significantly higher zn burden for the scenario with maximum input concentrations this can be explained by the higher variation in input concentrations for the roofs table 4 fig 5 shows that the cumulative soil metal burdens do not exceed the modelled burdens for the three swales when the use of leaded gasoline in the past is considered in fact for swale l1 the metal burden from the model output is 3 times higher than the cumulative mass from soil samples one explanation of this could be the overestimation of the swale age the swale l1 is located at a commercial site which was redeveloped after the initial construction of the road and this could have affected the swale soils moreover the history of lead phasing out of gasoline is more complex than the simple margins prior and after 1995 the pb content in gasoline was subject to a gradual decrease from the maximum of 0 7 g l in 1970 to 0 15 g l in 1980 and the total lead ban on all motor fuels in 1995 spbi 2014 although the computational method used here represents a rough estimation with high uncertainty fig 5 offers some insight into the early years of operation of the swales studied when higher pb loads were entering the swales and contributed to the magnitude of pb burdens currently found in swale soils the accuracy of conceptual planning models that calculate annual pollutant loads based on annual runoff volumes cannot be assessed by standard approaches marsalek 1991 rather such models are subject to sensitivity analysis as done here for the minimum and maximum stormwater concentrations and assessed for applicability to specific problems e g when conducting planning analyses of future developments larm 2000 the stormtac web has been used in swedish municipalities for planning and design of stfs and their maintenance as applied in this paper stormtac web served for planning level analysis of the contamination of swale soils and the model results were further verified by soil chemistry data this method assessed the soil chemistry of stf exposed to road runoff during a long term such as swales and offered an opportunity to relate field results to the guideline values for contaminated soils the method presented in this study could be used for planning grass swale maintenance which would include screening the contamination of swale soils in order to decide upon the removal of contaminated soils this is important because the long term performance of infiltration swales in pollution mitigation can degrade over time because of soil saturation with pollutants leroy et al 2016 thus the scalping of the top layer of bottom of the swale is recommended as a regular maintenance by some municipalities in order to restore the soil ability to mitigate pollutants through infiltration leroy et al 2016 5 conclusions the feasibility of estimating the long term retention of three metals cu pb and zn by three grass swales was investigated by applying two methods i sampling swale soils for the metals studied and ii modelling the metal influx and retention by a source based runoff model in the former method the runoff contributed metal burdens retained in swale soils were assumed to equal the current burdens reduced for the metal content in native soils in general the metal concentrations and metal burdens in swales reflected the quality of road runoff draining into the swales the soils in swale l2 with the highest traffic density adt 11 650 contained the highest metal concentrations and burdens furthermore pb concentrations in l2 exceeded the swedish epa permissible pb levels for sensitive land use specified as 50 mg kg all the other metal concentrations in the swales studied ranged from 0 15 to 0 44 of the permissible metal levels for sensitive land uses defined for cu pb and zn as 80 50 and 250 mg kg respectively the background levels of the metal studied in swale soils were assumed equal to the metal concentrations in the deepest layer studied 25 30 cm below the surface in the modelling approach the annual metal mass retained in swales was simulated by a source based runoff quality model stormtac web the annual loads produced by the model were multiplied by swale ages in years 38 57 and 38 years for l1 l2 and l3 respectively to obtain total loads comparisons of measured and modelled hm loads retained by the swales indicated a fair agreement described by ratios of mbs mbm metal burden simulated metal burden measured varying from 0 2 to 0 9 and average values for the three metal studied in swales l1 l2 l3 equal to 0 64 0 50 and 0 59 respectively additional uncertainties in modelled burdens were caused by changes in environmental practices during the lifespan of swales 38 57 years including the phasing of pb out of gasoline in the mid 1990s storage of used urban snow in swales and maintenance done on swales the study results indicate that the modelled data should be supplemented by soil chemistry data when addressing rehabilitation of older swales declaration of interests none acknowledgement this study was funded by the swedish

6486,grass swales are important elements of the urban green infrastructure that convey and attenuate urban runoff and improve its quality mostly through stormwater infiltration into and retention of conveyed pollutants by swale soils the retention of metals by grass swales was addressed in this study investigating the enrichment of swale soils by three common traffic related metals cu pb and zn three swales of various characteristics l1 l2 l3 were selected for study and their soils were sampled by coring the top 30 cm and dividing the cores into 5 cm thick layers cumulative metal burdens were compared to those modelled by the proprietary stormtac web model which estimates annual loads of specific constituents for the given land uses and stormwater treatment the comparisons of measured mbm and simulated mbs metal burdens retained by swales showed that the measured values exceed the simulated ones as described by average ratios mbs mbm 0 64 0 50 and 0 59 for swales l1 l2 and l3 respectively the measured burdens were calculated after subtracting the native soil metal concentrations assumed equal to those found in the deepest sampled layer 25 30 cm below the surface the

results should be supplemented by soil chemistry sampling keywords grass swale heavy metals roadside soils planning level modelling metal transport 1 introduction modern or redeveloped urban areas include stormwater management measures in the form of green elements attempting to restore the original hydrological features of natural catchments and thereby reduce negative impacts of urbanisation among such elements grass swales are widely used examples of sustainable urban drainage systems suds serving to convey and attenuate urban runoff and improve its quality mostly through stormwater infiltration and retention of conveyed pollutants by swale soils ahiablame et al 2012 in urban drainage practice grassed swales are typically placed along roads and parking lots in the upper parts of catchments and are exposed to traffic generated pollutants including contaminated solids metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs much of the past research focused on retention of metals by grass swales because such metals may occur in stormwater at toxic levels and their traffic related sources are relatively ubiquitous and well known in urban areas huber et al 2016 as reported in the literature short term water quality enhancement performance of grass swales was investigated by comparing the quality of runoff entering and exiting swales either from samples of actual runoff generated by rainfall stagge et al 2012 or by sampling runoff simulated by irrigation deletic and fletcher 2006 in most studies runoff quality was described by total suspended solids tss nutrients species of n and p and metals cu pb zn boger et al 2018 gavriƒá et al 2019 removals of total suspended solids tss in grass swales were reported as high as 98 b√§ckstr√∂m et al 2006 but the removals of metals and nutrients were much lower boger et al 2018 overall the previous research recognised that grass swales enhance runoff quality mostly through infiltration into swale soils i e preventing pollutant transport and settling kondo et al 2016 compared the soils of different types of green stormwater infrastructure gsi to non gsi sites and showed that although the former had lower or similar concentrations of elements of concern to human health than the latter the mean metal concentrations were generally higher than background concentrations and guidelines in all studied samples in infiltration based suds metals accumulate in top layers of grassy areas 10 30 cm deep with the highest concentrations occurring near the runoff inflow area tedoldi et al 2017 such concentrations decrease with the distance from the runoff inlet and with the soil depth even though in older infiltration facilities 30 years old the contamination can reach deeper layers as reviewed by tedoldi et al 2016 particulate fractions of removed or immobilized pollutants remain either on the bottom of swales or are incorporated into the swale soil matrix and may represent in situ sources of pollution lind and karro 1995 rushton 2001 the strength of such sources depends on the runoff pollution sources and swale effectiveness in retaining the incoming pollutants as determined either from short duration field studies lind and karro 1995 or by modelling larm 2000 field studies of pollution abatement by grass swales are complicated by difficulties in measuring low flows and pollutant concentrations and analytical costs limiting the number of analysed samples and constituents such challenges can be overcome by modelling studies and the feasibility of modelling swale flows and their quality was addressed by a number of researchers e g larm 2000 deletic and fletcher 2006 larm and alm 2014 while the modelling of swale flows was found feasible with some limitations e g rujner et al 2018 the detailed modelling of water quality in swales remains to be a challenge the relevant models reported in the literature are either research models deletic and fletcher 2006 or represent integrated conceptual models derived directly from experimental data larm 2000 the objective of the study presented herein is to examine the feasibility of estimating the long term grass swale performance in retaining metals represented by the model substances cu pb zn from swale soil chemistry and conceptual modelling with the stormtac web model such a comparison should provide a long term assessment of grass swale performance in runoff pollution mitigation and the feasibility of conceptually modelling the annual metal balance of swales 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study sites three swale catchments were selected for study in the city of lule√• in northern sweden 65 35 4 n 22 10 14 e the local climate is characterised by long winters the snow season usually starts in october november and snow remains on the ground until april the lowest and highest monthly average temperatures occur in january 11 5 c and july 15 5 c respectively and the average annual precipitation is 506 mm smhi 2014 the first swale l1 is located in a small commercial catchment and receives lateral runoff from a parking lot a small part of the roof of an adjacent building and a single lane road with the average daily traffic adt 2750 the second swale l2 is located close to the downtown and on one side drains a two lane road with the highest adt in lule√• 11 650 the other side of the swale l2 is delineated by a continuous curb and does not receive any stormwater runoff consequently that side of the swale was excluded from investigations the third swale l3 is located in a small residential catchment and receives lateral runoff from a parking lot a roof of an adjacent building a grassed area and a two lane road with adt 2500 the footprint areas of the studied swales l1 l2 and l3 including the upstream non sampled sections and the downstream sampled sections were 225 357 and 516 m2 respectively according to the lule√• municipality the road and swale at l2 is 57 years old and the roads and swales at l1 and l3 are 38 years old swale catchment characteristics are summarized in table 1 in sweden there are no specific guidelines for type of soil to be used for swale construction and therefore lule√• swales are built using native soils soil infiltration rates of three swales corresponded to the soil texture of a loamy sand 2 2 soil sampling soil sampling was performed in october 2017 with a 5 cm diameter stainless steel corer 30 cm long at each site a 20 m long swale section receiving direct runoff from only roads and parking lots was selected and sampled along three cross sections 10 m apart samples were collected in each cross section at distances 40 and 80 cm from the edge of the contributing drainage area and at the deepest point of the cross section before extracting the soil cores the grass was cut each core sample was divided into 5 cm slices using a stainless steel knife placed in a plastic bag refrigerated and kept in cold storage until analysed up to 7 days at each swale samples representing topsoil layer 0 5 cm were subject to laboratory analysis in swale l3 the side draining a parking lot could not be sampled because of the presence of gravel from the construction of the parking lot at all three swales additional deeper soil layers from the swale bottom section i e 5 10 10 15 cm and the deepest layer obtained were subject to laboratory analysis lastly additional deeper soil samples i e 5 10 10 15 cm and the deepest sample obtained from the swale side draining road were also analysed except for swale l3 where only the samples from the top 5 cm were analysed some deeper soil layers could not be sampled because of high soil compaction during the sampling campaign location data x y z coordinates were collected at numerous points along the swale using a real time kinematic gps device model geomax zenith35 pro tag with the precision of 1 5 cm for x and y and 2 cm for z in order to investigate the

analysed for conductivity and ph the conductivity was measured according to the standard iso 11 265 2016 using the cdm210 conductivity meter meterlab radiometer analytical with the accuracy of 0 2 of

dry sieved in a vibratory sieve shaker retsch as200 using a stainless sieve with the mesh size of 2 mm soil lumps 2 mm were crushed and mixed with the finer material 2 mm iso 11464 2016 the sample mass 2 mm and 2 mm was measured after sieving material 2 mm comprised stones and grass roots analyses of total metals cu pb and zn and loss on ignition loi were done by an accredited commercial laboratory als scandinavia ab in lule√• the total metal content was analysed using inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometry icp sfms element thermo fisher according to ss en iso 17294 1 2 and epa method 200 8 all metal concentrations were reported in mg kg of dry weight dw analytical uncertainties in the reported metal cu pb zn concentrations were 19 21 of the reported values the loi analysis was associated with the metal analysis and was made after melting the material with lithium metaborate libo2 at 1000 c 2 4 calculating metal burdens using soil chemistry data the mean pollutant concentration c mg kg in each layer was multiplied by the mass of swale soil kg in particles 2 mm in that layer which was estimated from the soil density kg m3 and the layer volume m3 a more detailed explanation of the method follows for each 5 cm layer of swale a mean metal concentration and standard deviation sd were calculated using all the samples collected in the layer in the case of swales l1 and l3 and the layers 15 20 cm and 20 25 cm where no samples were analysed the mean metal concentrations and sd were assumed to be equal to those of layers 10 15 and 25 30 cm respectively from the measured soil mass 2 mm and 2 mm a mean total soil mass in a 5 cm slice msample g was calculated as well as the share of the material 2 mm the volume of a sample vsample m3 was calculated from a 5 cm high cylinder with a 5 cm diameter representing the 5 cm slice from the soil corer soil density œÅ kg m3 in each layer was then calculated from the measured mass of the soil sample including both materials smaller and larger than 2 mm and the sample volume each 5 cm layer volume vlayer m3 of swale soil was calculated from the swale area m2 and the layer thickness 5 cm the area included the upstream swale section which was not sampled assuming that the metals were evenly distributed upstream of the sampled section mass of soil in each 5 cm layer msoil layer kg was calculated from œÅ kg m3 and layer volume m3 since the metal concentrations were analysed in sieved material 2 mm mass of soil 2 mm in each 5 cm layer m 2mm kg was calculated by multiplying msoil layer by the share of the material 2 mm finally the obtained mass of soil m 2mm kg was multiplied by c mg kg in order to estimate the metal mass kg retained in that layer of swale soil mmetal 2 4 1 soil background concentration metal burdens in swale soils comprise two components i naturally occurring background burdens in swale soils and ii burdens contributed by anthropogenic sources i e mostly road runoff and atmospheric deposition the knowledge of the chemistry of native soils in the three studied swales would allow for subtracting the native metal burdens from those calculated from sampled chemical concentrations the idea of obtaining the native soil chemistry information from swale l2 which does not receive stormwater runoff on one side was rejected because only top layer 0 5 cm samples from this side were analysed and were potentially contaminated by stored snow another way of accounting for native soil metal concentrations would be to use the mean concentration in the deepest soil layer 25 30 cm deep as the best estimate since the studied swales were built with native soils the metal concentrations in the deepest soil layer were compared to the background levels from johansson et al 1995 who investigated regional patterns of metals cu zn pb hg and cd in lake sediments and the mor layer in forest soils in sweden for cu and zn the authors adopted the soils data from remote areas of northern sweden andersson et al 1991 as the background concentrations of 55 and 6 3 ppm respectively concerning pb the mean concentration of 15 mg kg was reduced to 8 mg kg on the basis of the historical record of the anthropogenic effect on pb in lake sediments table 2 shows the mean metal concentration values from the deepest soil layer at the three sampled swales in this study l1 l3 together with the metal concentrations from remote areas of northern sweden and the estimated background levels of metals by johansson et al 1995 table 2 shows that the background levels of pb 8 mg kg and zn 55 mg kg are higher than the concentrations sampled in the deepest layers at l1 and l3 while those of cu were comparable the background levels of all the metals studied were lower than those in the deepest layer of l2 for estimating the background soil metal burdens mback in this study the mean metal concentrations in the deepest soil layer of individual swales were used as the best estimates of native soil metal concentrations cumulative metal burden mtot for a 30 cm thick soil layer was calculated as a sum of metal masses in individual layers mmetal reduced by the background metal burden in each layer mback total uncertainty of the cumulative metal burden stot was calculated using the law of uncertainty propagation and considering the uncertainty of the mean metal

methods the second study objective was to examine the feasibility of estimating the total input loads of cu pb and zn with runoff into the tested swales and their partial retention in swale soils by runoff modelling recognizing the challenges of swale flow modelling and the need to model long term pollutant fluxes for modelling the swale mass balances of the metals studied a source based urban runoff model stormtac web was selected to simulate the annual pollutant mass retained in the swale soils this proprietary conceptual model requires little input data for performing long term calculations of annual runoff fluxes and pollutant loads which can be used for planning and design of stormwater treatment facilities larm 2000 the model inputs include i precipitation rain snow ii the land use data including the corresponding runoff contributing area and the volumetric runoff coefficient and iii the stormtac web database standard pollutant concentrations for each land use which represent annual averages based mainly on long term flow proportional sampling the annual stormwater pollutant load entering the swale lin kg year is calculated as a product of annual flow volume and standard pollutant concentrations for each land use the annual runoff volume q m3 year is calculated from annual precipitation a sub catchment area of specific land use and the land use specific volumetric runoff coefficient larm 2000 the total annual runoff is then obtained as a sum of annual runoff volumes from individual sub catchments 2 q 10 p i 1 n œÜ i a i m 3 year where p the average annual precipitation rain snow mm year corrected by a factor 1 1 to account for sampling errors such as wind evaporation and surface wetting constant 10 serves as a unit conversion constant œÜ volumetric runoff coefficient 0 85 for roads and parking lots 0 9 for roofs and 0 1 for grass areas a land use area ha i 1 2 n number of land use areas the model produces estimates of the average annual pollutant loads entering and leaving the swales from which one can determine the annual loads retained in the swales using site specific functions for more than 15 different types of stormwater treatment facilities stfs e g swales biofilters etc stormtac web database contains treatment efficiencies derived from flow proportional input and output data from such facilities furthermore the

calculated in stormtac web the annual load leaving the swale after treatment lout kg year is calculated from eq 4 4 l out l in re 100 l in the annual pollutant mass retained by the swale is calculated from the pollutant runoff input loads and the loads leaving the swale after treatment lin lout the stormtac web model calculates only the annual loads added kg year to the soil from the polluted stormwater and groundwater without consideration of the metal mass native to the soil thus the load retained by the swale represents the load added to the existing pollutant burden resulting from pollutant background concentrations in soils the annual loads produced by the model were multiplied by swale ages in years 38 57 and 38 years for l1 l2 and l3 respectively to obtain the total loads 2 5 1 modelling uncertainty for estimating the modelling uncertainty each pollutant concentration has been categorized by the model developers into three levels of uncertainty based on the coefficient of variation cv of input data i e cv 0 5 0 5 1 25 and 1 25 indicating high intermediate and low certainties respectively table 3 burton and pitt 2002 based on these criteria standard concentrations of cu pb and zn were ascribed low uncertainty for the reduction efficiencies in swales average uncertainty for the concentrations from parking lots and grass areas but high uncertainty for roofs for the road runoff different assessment criteria were used and according to such criteria the pollutant concentrations in road runoff were considered as containing low uncertainties r2 value 0 75 table 3 in this study the data from swedish studies were used for calculating standard concentrations in road runoff stormtac web standard pollutant concentrations larm 2000 are estimated for each land use based on an overall assessment of available literature data time trends calibrations based on case studies and comparisons with data from similar land uses therefore the standard concentration is not equal to median value from the flow proportional sampling presented in stormtac web database the standard concentrations for different pollutants and land uses are based on investigations where extensive flow or volume proportional sampling of runoff from catchments with one type of land use have been conducted these measurements cover all seasons of the year generating good estimates of the site mean concentrations and are conducted in a similar climate as where the model is applied the standard concentrations are updated continuously when new reliable data for a specific land use is incorporated into the database data for other comparable land uses are re evaluated the standard concentrations are also calibrated to consider different time trends stormtac web uses factors 0 10 for each land use except the roads to calculate land use specific concentrations a factor 5 indicates standard conditions of the land use while factors 5 and 5 indicate that the levels are adjusted towards the minimum or the maximum values in the database respectively for the roads the standard concentration is calculated on the basis of the adt to further investigate the modelling sensitivity and uncertainty two scenarios were formulated with a minimum factor 0 and a maximum factor 10 to obtain minimum and maximum land use input concentrations and thus the yearly input loads lin from the model moreover the swale pollutant reduction efficiency re was set to the minimum and maximum values estimated from stormtac web database the impact of these two parameters was investigated because they were considered the most uncertain and directly related to the stormwater quality modelling this resulted in two scenarios for estimating the minimum annual load retained in the swale soil kg year remin and cmin and the maximum annual load retained in the swale soil kg year remax and cmax the metal mass from these two scenarios was compared to the standard scenario 2 5 2 leaded gasoline scenario in order to investigate the scenario with higher pb concentrations reflecting the use of leaded gasoline in the past the median concentration of lead in runoff prior to 1995 was calculated from concentration data from the older road and parking lot data larm 1994 to estimate median concentrations of pb in road runoff after 1995 the stormtac web database was queried ignoring the data prior to 1995 this resulted in pb concentrations about seven times lower than those prior to 1995 thus two pb concentrations were used in computations of metal burdens entering the swales studied the concentration currently available in the model for the period starting in 1995 and the seven times higher concentration for the period prior to 1995 for cu and zn the current estimates of concentrations were used throughout the period studied 3 results soils properties of the three swales were characterized by measuring their loi ph and conductivity section 2 3 and the results are presented in table 4 the mean total metal concentrations in various soil layers at each swale site l1 l3 are listed in table 5 the coefficient of variation cv and the number of samples collected n are shown in the brackets the data in table 5 show distinctly higher metal concentrations particularly in the case of pb in soil samples from the oldest swale l2 which is exposed to runoff from the site with the highest adt intensity to assess the environmental significance of measured metal concentrations the calculated mean metal concentrations mean from all samples at the site and the maximum measured concentrations were compared to the swedish environmental protection agency guideline for polluted soils sepa 2016 the guideline is meant to protect people s health taking into account the direct exposure i e contact with the contaminated soil and indirect exposure i e transport of contaminants to air groundwater and plants sepa 2009 there are guideline values for two different types of land use sensitive land use s and less sensitive land use ls respectively both guideline values were used here for comparison as illustrated in table 6 listing the mean total metal concentrations the maximum measured concentrations and the two target values from the guideline exceeding the guideline values for less sensitive land use ls means that the soil quality limits the choice of land use to e g offices industries or roads sepa 2009 the maximum measured cu concentrations were 36 7 57 9 and 30 4 mg kg for l1 l2 and l3 respectively below the guideline maximum permissible concentrations of 80 s and 200 mg kg ls sepa 2016 similarly the maximum measured zn concentrations were 111 136 and 64 2 mg kg for l1 l2 and l3 respectively and none of them exceeded the guideline maximum permissible concentrations of 250 mg kg s and 500 mg kg ls sepa 2016 finally the maximum pb concentrations measured in soil samples were 13 3 188 and 14 5 mg kg for l1 l2 and l3 respectively while the pb concentrations at sites l1 and l3 complied with the sepa guideline 50 s and 400 mg kg ls sepa 2016 pb concentrations at site l2 exceeded the sensitive threshold s by the mean concentration and the maximum pb concentration fig 2 shows the pb burdens estimated from soil samples in three locations the lowest pb burden was calculated for swale l1 and the loads at l1 and l3 were low compared to the much higher load in swale l2 which is next to the road with the highest adt and thus exposed to more traffic pollution figs 1 and 3 show cu and zn burdens respectively which were larger in l1 and l3 than those of pb in the same swale and otherwise followed the same trend as noted above for pb l2 metal load l3 metal load l1 metal load stormtac web simulations of annual inputs and the retained loads are listed in table 7 together with the estimates of the total pollutant mass which has been retained since the swale construction the calculations were performed for the current catchment layout and the mean adts which were corrected to represent only the road lanes draining into the swales table 1 the annual input load was determined for the standard concentrations the retained load kg year is presented in three variants based on standard minimum and maximum concentrations as described in section 2 5 1 in road runoff pollution calculations the stormtac web model accounts for traffic intensity in order to examine the calculated metal loads sensitivities to adt historical adt values were obtained from the lule√• municipality for the period of swale operation the available data included three measured adts during 2008 2016 for l1 and l3 and more detailed measurements for l2 1980 2016 the yearly retained metal load was simulated using three adt values the mean and the mean standard deviation the modelled values were little sensitive to historical variations in adts at the study sites thus the mean adt was used for the load calculations fig 4 shows the comparison of cumulative metal loads from soil samples without background concentrations and from the model for the standard scenario and the scenario giving the minimum and maximum annual retained load the differences between the measured and modelled pb burdens can be further examined by accounting for phasing lead out of gasoline in the early 1990s analysis of historical trends in measured pb concentrations in road runoff over the course of five decades 1970 2010 showed a sharp decline in pb concentrations after 1990 corresponding to the phasing out of pb from gasoline huber et al 2016 the lead free gasoline was introduced in 1985 and from 1995 the sales of leaded gasoline were discontinued in sweden spbi 2014 fig 5 shows the comparison of the pb burdens calculated from 1 soil sample chemistry data 2 model outputs without modifying pb inflow concentrations prior to 1995 and 3 model outputs with increased pb concentrations prior to 1995 the calculated metal burdens for the leaded gasoline scenario were about 4 5 and 3 times higher than those neglecting the higher lead concentration in gasoline prior to 1995 for swales l1 l2 and l3 respectively overall fig 5 shows that the cumulative soil metal burdens do not exceed the modelled burdens for l2 and l3 when the higher past lead concentrations are considered in the case of l1 the opposite is true i e metal burden from the model output is around 3 times the cumulative mass from soil samples 4 discussion higher metal concentrations were measured in the soil samples from the oldest swale l2 which was exposed to the highest adt table 5 such a finding agrees with the previous research investigations of soil quality of 35 swales depths 20 30 cm showed increased soil metal concentrations cu cd cr pb and zn for higher average daily traffic adt intensity and frequent stop and go traffic horstmeyer et al 2016 moreover the metal content in swales of various ages 1 34 years old showed significantly higher content of pb in older facilities horstmeyer et al 2016 high pb concentrations in soils next to a highway road built in 1964 with adt of 40 000 50 000 were measured by norrstr√∂m and jacks 1998 along the line at distances of 0 5 and 2 5 m from the road 20 soil cores were sampled and divided in 5 cm slices the samples representing the same layer were composited and pb concentration measured in the 0 5 cm layer was 542 mg kg and in the 5 10 cm layer 502 mg kg moreover carrero et al 2013 measured high pb concentrations in roadside soil samples even though the leaded gasoline has been banned since 2001 at the study site location the total pollutant load entering the swale is partly incorporated into the soil matrix and partly passes through the swale unabated among the metals studied pb is mostly associated with the particulate fraction while cu and zn may also occur in appreciable quantities in the dissolved fraction huber et al 2016 fig 2 indicates the lowest pb concentrations in the two top layers of swale l2 followed by the peak in the fourth layer and gradual stabilisation in deeper layers pb layer burdens in l1 and l3 were more or less uniformly distributed recognizing the high pb affinity to solids high pb concentrations in the fourth layer of l2 15 20 cm below the surface would suggest migration flushing out of fine particles with pb from the top layer into the deeper soil horizons such vertical pb transport would confirm the previous observations that older stormwater facilities may have higher metal content and that pb may migrate into deeper soil layers rushton 2001 horstmeyer et al 2016 tedoldi et al 2016 there are multiple sources of uncertainties in the metal burdens presented in the results section i metal uptake by vegetation ii metal burden variation along the swale in the flow direction iii transport of metals into deeper layers iv background metal concentrations in native soils and v uncertainties in modelling results a brief discussion of all such uncertainties follows in the procedure applied in this study the metal mass calculated from the soil chemistry data represented the mass retained in the top soil layer 30 cm deep of the swale the soil material 2 mm in the study by leroy et al 2017 after two year period the plant uptake including both bellow and above ground plant parts was 0 4 4 6 of the initial soil metal mass the study included a control section and the swale section spiked with pahs and metals producing cd pb and zn surface soil content of 2 100 and 300 mg kg respectively the mean pb and zn mass plant uptake was significantly higher for the artificially contaminated swale section spiked with a mix of pahs and metals compared to the control section non contaminated leroy et al 2017 however the use of artificially spiked pollutants leroy et al 2017 might have increased the plant uptake considering that plants also contribute to metal zn cd pb retention in swales through metal uptake leroy et al 2017 the inclusion of such a metal uptake out of scope of the present study would have yielded higher retention of metals by the swales studied moreover we assumed that the mean pollutant concentration in each layer of the sampled 20 m long swale section was representative of the entire swale this could lead to a load overestimation if the pollutant concentrations in the swale were increasing in the downstream direction by comparison model outputs represent the annual pollutant burden retained by all soil layers without distinguishing the burden parts retained by individual soil layers the model calculation also does not include transfer of pollutants into the groundwater furthermore as suggested above dissolved metal burdens in the case of cu and zn could be transferred deeper than the 30 cm depth considered here and possibly even into the groundwater fig 4 shows a comparison among the cumulative metal burdens from soil samples reduced by the native soil burdens and those calculated from model outputs higher uncertainty can be observed for calculation of cumulative pb mass in swale l2 at swale l2 mean pb concentrations and the metal burdens in the deeper layers were higher than those in the top layers 0 5 and 5 10 cm fig 2 metal accumulations in swale soils are difficult to estimate for older facilities because of difficulties in estimating the effects of historical changes maintenance and reconstruction moreover simulated results for swale l1 and l3 had significantly higher zn burden for the scenario with maximum input concentrations this can be explained by the higher variation in input concentrations for the roofs table 4 fig 5 shows that the cumulative soil metal burdens do not exceed the modelled burdens for the three swales when the use of leaded gasoline in the past is considered in fact for swale l1 the metal burden from the model output is 3 times higher than the cumulative mass from soil samples one explanation of this could be the overestimation of the swale age the swale l1 is located at a commercial site which was redeveloped after the initial construction of the road and this could have affected the swale soils moreover the history of lead phasing out of gasoline is more complex than the simple margins prior and after 1995 the pb content in gasoline was subject to a gradual decrease from the maximum of 0 7 g l in 1970 to 0 15 g l in 1980 and the total lead ban on all motor fuels in 1995 spbi 2014 although the computational method used here represents a rough estimation with high uncertainty fig 5 offers some insight into the early years of operation of the swales studied when higher pb loads were entering the swales and contributed to the magnitude of pb burdens currently found in swale soils the accuracy of conceptual planning models that calculate annual pollutant loads based on annual runoff volumes cannot be assessed by standard approaches marsalek 1991 rather such models are subject to sensitivity analysis as done here for the minimum and maximum stormwater concentrations and assessed for applicability to specific problems e g when conducting planning analyses of future developments larm 2000 the stormtac web has been used in swedish municipalities for planning and design of stfs and their maintenance as applied in this paper stormtac web served for planning level analysis of the contamination of swale soils and the model results were further verified by soil chemistry data this method assessed the soil chemistry of stf exposed to road runoff during a long term such as swales and offered an opportunity to relate field results to the guideline values for contaminated soils the method presented in this study could be used for planning grass swale maintenance which would include screening the contamination of swale soils in order to decide upon the removal of contaminated soils this is important because the long term performance of infiltration swales in pollution mitigation can degrade over time because of soil saturation with pollutants leroy et al 2016 thus the scalping of the top layer of bottom of the swale is recommended as a regular maintenance by some municipalities in order to restore the soil ability to mitigate pollutants through infiltration leroy et al 2016 5 conclusions the feasibility of estimating the long term retention of three metals cu pb and zn by three grass swales was investigated by applying two methods i sampling swale soils for the metals studied and ii modelling the metal influx and retention by a source based runoff model in the former method the runoff contributed metal burdens retained in swale soils were assumed to equal the current burdens reduced for the metal content in native soils in general the metal concentrations and metal burdens in swales reflected the quality of road runoff draining into the swales the soils in swale l2 with the highest traffic density adt 11 650 contained the highest metal concentrations and burdens furthermore pb concentrations in l2 exceeded the swedish epa permissible pb levels for sensitive land use specified as 50 mg kg all the other metal concentrations in the swales studied ranged from 0 15 to 0 44 of the permissible metal levels for sensitive land uses defined for cu pb and zn as 80 50 and 250 mg kg respectively the background levels of the metal studied in swale soils were assumed equal to the metal concentrations in the deepest layer studied 25 30 cm below the surface in the modelling approach the annual metal mass retained in swales was simulated by a source based runoff quality model stormtac web the annual loads produced by the model were multiplied by swale ages in years 38 57 and 38 years for l1 l2 and l3 respectively to obtain total loads comparisons of measured and modelled hm loads retained by the swales indicated a fair agreement described by ratios of mbs mbm metal burden simulated metal burden measured varying from 0 2 to 0 9 and average values for the three metal studied in swales l1 l2 l3 equal to 0 64 0 50 and 0 59 respectively additional uncertainties in modelled burdens were caused by changes in environmental practices during the lifespan of swales 38 57 years including the phasing of pb out of gasoline in the mid 1990s storage of used urban snow in swales and maintenance done on swales the study results indicate that the modelled data should be supplemented by soil chemistry data when addressing rehabilitation of older swales declaration of interests none acknowledgement this study was funded by the swedish

6487,karst potential is rarely studied in calcareous sandstones and sandy limestones the minimum content of carbonate necessary for the development of conduits is unknown and the mechanisms of the origins of conduits in these rocks are poorly understood this article focuses upon these questions in an important regional aquifer samples of limestones and sandstones were taken from outcrops in vertical profiles and were subjected to a rapid dissolution test with 10 hcl the degree of disintegration of the samples after dissolution of the carbonate was observed in order to estimate which portions of the rock enabled formation of karst conduits carbonate content was measured by calcimetry distribution of calcite cement and other sources of cohesion were studied by scanning electron microscopy tracer tests in the conduits were evaluated calcite is the dominant carbonate mineral and main cementing agent in the jizera fm aquifer mean content 51 however calcite content was found to be a weak predictor of karst potential most of the samples disintegrated completely if the calcite content exceeded 55 on the other hand some rocks with a calcite content up to 70 did not disintegrate due to microcrystalline amorphous silica which bound the quartz grains together and or formed a foam like supporting structure after in situ calcite dissolution the rock in karst prone zones is turned to residuum which consequently is washed out by fast flow 0 01 0 2 m s based on tracer tests microscopic study of cementing agents of the siliciclastic carbonate sediments and dissolution tests are

is an environment where the dominant part of the groundwater flows through conduits that originated by dissolution of the rock klimchouk et al 2000 due to the high flow velocity in the conduits and the common presence of localized recharge points karst areas are often extremely vulnerable and contaminants can rapidly travel considerable distances worthington and ford 2009 the presence of conduits and their connectivity can be obscured in some areas it is therefore important to identify a karst environment and to test for the presence of conduits e g by tracer tests karst hydrogeology is mostly studied in pure limestone and dolomite ford and williams 2007 in other lithologies it has been studied far less e g klimchouk 1996 bruthans et al 2017 some quartz sandstones and quartzites

their formation e g martini 1979 mecchia et al 2014 wray and sauro 2017 such caves are common in venezuela brazil india and south africa generally in areas with relatively high precipitation totals steep hydraulic gradients and long lasting rock exposures wray and sauro 2017 on the contrary in friable quartz sandstone the origin of conduits and caves can be a non karst process the result of mechanical erosion piping bruthans et al 2012 2014 duszy≈Ñsky et al 2016 thus the two end member processes responsible for the origin of caves and conduits in quartz sandstones are i epigenic quartz dissolution causing disintegration i e arenisation followed by mechanical erosion versus ii direct mechanical erosion of sandstone that is originally post diagenetically friable the question of which one of these two processes is dominant and in which area is a matter of ongoing debate aubrecht 2011 wray and sauro 2017 duszy≈Ñski et al 2018 there are also many rocks which consist of beds of sand

inception horizons is unknown and dissolution of rock samples from inception horizons is generally not tested the karst origin of these pathways is commonly not proven this often results in speculation on the origins of these conduits e g green et al 2012 barry et al 2015 in addition the critical content of caco3 necessary for evolution of karst conduits in sandstones with carbonate cement is unknown the major objective of this study was to evaluate the karst potential of sandy limestone and calcareous sandstone and to characterize the conduits and conduit flow in selected parts of the jizera fm aquifer in the bohemian cretaceous basin which hosts many features typical for karst as well as serving as an important aquifer in the czech republic in order to reach this objective the following tasks were undertaken 1 to characterize the vertical distribution of calcite content in the aquifer with a focus on the conduits 2 to use dissolution tests of rock samples in 10 hcl as an indicator of the karst potential 3 to visualize the distribution of calcite cement and sand grains at the microscale to improve knowledge of the dissolution processes and sources of cohesion 4 to test to which degree the studied area is an example of ghost rock karst 5 to test the effect of confinement on residuum erosion 6 to characterize the effect of bedding planes and systematic subvertical fracture sets on the conduit pattern and 7 to characterize the flow pattern and velocity in the conduits by tracer tests in this paper rock is considered to be karst prone and suitable for conduit evolution if its structure collapses and disintegrates into small fragments and sand grains after dissolution tests in 10 hcl the study area is situated in the bohemian cretaceous basin a

considerable groundwater ages in the cenomanian aquifer corcho alvarado et al 2013 the jizera fm aquifer is overlain by the 10 20 m thick aquitard tur7 consisting of impermeable marls and clays aquitard tur7 is overlain by a perched coniacian quartz sandstone aquifer con which is equivalent to hrub√° sk√°la sandstone fig 2 bruthans et al 2012 the con aquifer lacks any carbonate and its water

1 sampling and field measurements to characterize the vertical distribution of carbonate content and karst potential in the jizera fm aquifer small horizontal rock samples cylindrical plugs were taken by an accumulator drill with a diamond core drill bit 35 mm in diameter from subvertical rock outcrops in profiles at a 1 m interval and also with a higher frequency in places with conduits sampling was focused on rock outcrops where important hydrogeological features such as conduits caves springs and sinks occurred profiles were selected to comprise the available portion of the jizera fm aquifer where rock outcrops occur the upper surface of the jizera fm aquifer forms a distinct slightly inclined surface to the ssw due to its higher erosional resistance compared to other formations it is dissected by narrow canyons of the jizera river and its tributaries fig 1c the upper surface of the jizera fm aquifer was identified by lidar image 5th generation http ags cuzk cz dmr to place the individual profiles in stratigraphic order their vertical distance to the upper surface of the jizera fm aquifer was determined the altitude of the profiles was determined by topcon grs 1 with a vertical precision of 0 3 m 3 2 laboratory measurements each sample plug was cut perpendicular to its axis into three cylindrical subsamples 1 2 cm long one subsample was used to measure calcite content by calcimetry the second for dissolution tests with hcl and the third was stored for scanning electron microscopy sem as coring was done along layering each subsample is sampling the same rock layer the subsamples for calcimetry were crushed milled into a 63 Œºm fraction and homogenized co2 content was measured by coulometry cao mgo feo fe2o3 and mno contents were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry faas calcium carbonate content was then calculated as the sum of cao and proportional part of co2 to test if subsamples cores will disintegrate in an acidic environment dissolution tests were done with 10 hcl this acid is commonly used to dissolve carbonate as its products of reaction with carbonate are soluble and it does not react with quartz nor most of the other common aluminosilicates ray et al 1957 cores were not crushed in this experimental setup dissolutions were separated for individual samples and were repeated up to 30 days until the reaction diminished while the acid remained aggressive enough in contact with the core cores were dried and weighed prior to dissolution moriginal after dissolution the two solid fractions were separated i cores or large fragments disintegrated from cores mlarge and ii sand grains and small fragments 2 mm mdisintegrated both fractions were separately washed with water dried and weighed the disintegration ratio d was defined as 1 d m disintegrated m insoluble 100 where mdisintegrated is the dry weight of sand grains and small fragments 2 mm which disintegrated from the sample due to leaching in hcl minsoluble is the weight of the total dry insoluble solid mass remaining after dissolution in hcl mlarge mdisintegrated disintegration ratio d thus does not consider soluble fraction if sample did not disintegrate at all during leaching in hcl its d 0 irrespectively whether the calcite content is 0 or 70 if the sample completely disintegrated to loose sand its d 100 also irrespectively on calcite content the disintegration ratio d is a parameter showing if rock disintegrates to fines transportable by flowing water or remains intact after acid leaching this parameter cannot be defined in pure carbonate a rough estimation of calcite content was obtained by 2 calcite approx 1 m insoluble m original 100 where moriginal is the dry weight of the sample prior to dissolution porosity of the original rock was determined by the archimedes principle measurements of saturated mass dry mass and volume these parameters were obtained by measuring the weight of dry sample sample immersed in water and sample immersed in water but hanging on wire thus sample affects the scale only by buoyancy following czechoslovak state norm csn 721010 the fine and medium grained sandstone is distinguished based on measurements of grain size in the samples as well as in the sand from hcl leaching grain size threshold 0 25 mm grain size was verified by scanning electron microscopy sem on selected samples uniaxial compression can prevent some locked sands and weak sandstones from erosion by flowing water bruthans et al 2014 filippi et al 2018 confinement in the solid material which encompasses the sample leaving only the single free face has a similar effect bruthans and ≈ôiho≈°ek 2017 both the compression and confinement prevent the dilatation of the sandstone which is a prerequisite for its disintegration as the sandstone is commonly densely packed and interlocked bruthans et al 2014 thus an unconfined sample of sandstone may show different behavior during erosion and potentially also after dissolution in hcl than a sample which is compressed or confined bruthans et al 2014 bruthans and ≈ôiho≈°ek 2017 to test the effect of confinement new plugs were taken in the field from positions where disintegration ratio d had reached more than 50 in the original plugs new plugs were placed into 50 mm polypropylene cups and were fixed by a plaster frame so that most of each core body was confined by plaster and only a small part remained sticking out fig s1 of the electronic supplementary material esm after setting of the plaster the cores were dissolved in 10 hcl it was observed whether the material disintegrated completely i e confinement was not preventing the disintegration of core after dissolution of calcite or whether only the material sticking out disintegrated into small particles material which was not compressed nor confined in the second case the material was considered stress controlled erosion material sce material 3 3 scanning electron microscopy and micro computed tomography selected subsamples were used for sem analysis of the carbonate and silica distribution in the rocks polished sections of cores were coated with gold the samples were investigated at the institute of rock structure and mechanics of the czech academy of sciences prague in a quanta 450 fei scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds and equipped with a photomultiplier detector centaurus for backscattered electrons bse at 15 and 30 kv mineral grains were analyzed with an apollo x eds detector using edx genesis software with a live time of 50 and 100 s one sample was investigated by micro computed tomographic analysis micro ct the micro ct scanning was carried out at the national museum in prague using the skyscan 1172 scanner an x ray source voltage of 100 kv a current of 100 Œºa and a pre filter of 1 mm copper was applied average pixel size was 6 8 Œºm post processing of the micro ct data was conducted using n recon and avizo software 3 4 tracer tests the tracer tests were designed and evaluated based on procedures described in field 2002 nacl and licl were used as tracers flow rate was measured at tracer injection mostly sinking streams and at the sampling points flow rate was measured by container fill method for flow rates 5 l s and by tracer dilution method for larger flow rates flow path was estimated as 1 5 of the direct distance between injection and sampling points based on field 2002 and in agreement with the ratio of the length of the mapped flow path in the barto≈°ova pec cave and the direct distance between inflow and outflow points in cave 1 45 the concentration of dissolved nacl was logged by electric conductivity meters cond 3310 wtw germany and leveloger solinst canada the relationship between dissolved nacl and electric conductivity was calibrated in the field sodium and lithium concentrations were measured at charles university by atomic absorption spectrometry aas and by mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma icp ms respectively breakthrough curves from the tracer tests were analyzed with the qtracer2 program field 2002 4 results and discussion 4 1 carbonate content in rock and dissolution tests ten vertical profiles were sampled and merged into a single composite vertical profile for the jizera fm aquifer fig 4 altogether 75 samples were analyzed for content of cao mgo feo fe2o3 mno and co2 table s1 of the esm caco3 content varied between 0 1 and 77 wt mean 51 wt most of the samples have a caco3 content between 32 and 69 10th and 90th percentile respectively mgco3 content is low mean 0 9 wt max 1 3 wt low mg calcite dominates in the profile based on the molar ratio of mgco3 in the carbonate as the carbonate is dominantly formed by calcite the caco3 is referred to in the further text as calcite mean fe and mn oxide contents are 0 7 wt and 0 03 wt respectively which is too low to consider them as cementing agents the only cementing agent that is present to any considerable amount and tends to decay in an acid environment is thus calcite calcite content is variable along the vertical profile through the jizera fm aquifer fig 4 and oscillates 40 within distances of from one to a few m a slightly lower calcite content is typical for the uppermost 20 m of the jizera fm aquifer seventy one samples were immersed into 10 hcl to test if they disintegrate after dissolution and if the studied horizons allow for forming of karst conduits altogether 32 of the samples disintegrated completely into sand grains and small fragments another 15 of the samples disintegrated at least from 50 into small fragments and grains thus about 47 of the samples are considered potentially karst prone as they experienced considerable or total disintegration due to dissolution of the calcite in an acid environment fig 4 samples taken from the brewery conduit horizon k23a b c d showed the disintegration ratio d 88 100 and a calcite content of 66 77 wt on the other hand low d 2 and a calcite content of only 21 32 was found at the entrance of the barto≈°ova pec cave which however has been artificially enlarged by chiseling and the original passage is now filled by sediment and flooded by water due to a dam built in front of the cave based on a composite profile fig 4 rocks with d 100 and a calcite content of 59 69 wt occur just vertically below the stream level of the barto≈°ova pec cave table s2 of the esm such rocks are outcropping at p5 profile in the illusion cave some samples fully disintegrated similarly the samples taken from the sink in the podhorƒç√≠ blind valley fully disintegrated a high proportion of disintegrated samples d 50 in the jizera fm aquifer and the presence of these samples in horizons where conduits occur or in their nearby surroundings indicates that dissolution of carbonate cement is essential for the origination of conduits the relationship between precise calcite content from calcimetry and approximate calcite content calciteaprox calculated by eq 2 see method section is relatively tight fig 5 a pearson 0 90 a rough estimation of calcite content can thus be obtained from samples reacted with 10 hcl instead of by the expensive and time consuming calcimetry method differences between results of calcimetry and calciteaprox content are caused by imperfect dissolution in the case of calciteaprox and inhomogenities in the calcite content within samples in further text the calcite content from calcimetry is used porosity of the rock samples is generally between 4 and 10 mean 7 this is likely equal to the original porosity of the rock only samples of residuum k38a and k38b from illusion cave where calcite was partly dissolved see chapter 4 3 have porosities of 26 and 16 respectively fig 5b 4 2 microstructure as a reason for the poor relationship between calcite content and disintegration ratio the relationship between calcite content and the disintegration ratio d is surprisingly weak fig 5c pearson 0 57 generally samples do not disintegrate if the calcite content is below 30 wt but there are only a few such samples on the other hand most samples disintegrated completely if the calcite content exceeded 55 wt however there were still three samples 4 of the total set which did not disintegrate despite a calcite content as high as 63 70 wt table s2 of the esm samples with calcite contents between 35 and 55 wt had some that completely disintegrated and others that did not disintegrate samples with medium grained sand generally disintegrated with a lower calcite content than those with fine grained sand fig 5c bal√°k 2015 rocks with medium grained sand therefore seem to be more karst prone than are fine grained ones with the same calcite content the stability of samples which originally contained up to 70 wt of calcite and yet did not disintegrate after complete dissolution of the calcite was surprising this means that 30 of the remaining material is capable of keeping the rock structure stable the very variable threshold of critical calcite content which results in complete disintegration 36 70 wt was also surprising fig 5c to explain these findings the distribution of carbonate and silica content was studied on polished sections upon selected subsamples by element mapping with sem fig 6 we targeted our focus on samples which did not disintegrate despite having a very high calcite content and compared them with samples which disintegrated despite having much lower calcite contents sample 312 is an example of a fully disintegrating d 100 calcite rich 75 material fig 6a fine sand grains were floating in the carbonate matrix and as the matrix supported the grains after its dissolution the material fell into a loose sand similarly sample k21 with a calcite content of 53 fully disintegrated d 100 medium sized sand grains showed some tangential contacts yet they disintegrated after calcite dissolution fig 6b sample k18b is an example of a material which partly kept a stable structure after calcite dissolution d 64 calcite content 53 fig 6d depicts material with partly dissolved calcite which shows long contacts between the sand grains but also a foam like structure of microcrystalline amorphous silica between the grains this silica creates a supportive network and is responsible for the stability of the sample where the calcite was dissolved in hcl note that this foam like structure is not readily visible in the original not hcl treated material fig 6c sample 293 has a calcite content of 70 yet d is just 3 the foam like structure of microcrystalline amorphous silica which stabilizes the material is visible fig 6e sample 291 has a calcite content of 75 and fully disintegrated d 100 unlike the previous sample in this case the microcrystalline amorphous silica is somewhat more dispersed in the material fig 6f the sem study demonstrated that microcrystalline amorphous silica is a very important cementing agent especially in the lower portion of the jizera fm aquifer the silica was leached from marine sponge spicules during diagenesis ƒç√°p 2006 and gives sufficient material strength if not dispersed through the material but concentrated into a foam like structure even high calcite content is thus not a sufficient condition for sample disintegration this should especially be considered in sediments containing marine sponge spicules the spicules were originally formed by opal a highly mobile form of silica which could be considerably mobilized during diagenesis a somewhat similar structure of amorphous silica was observed in tournaisian siliceous limestone in belgium by dubois et al 2014 through presence of silica in foam like structure the jizera fm does not contain chert nodules 4 3 ghost rock karstification and effects of other processes resiuum i e the in situ residuum after dissolution of calcite dubois et al 2014 was found in all conduits and caves in varying amounts the residuum was either low cohesive or cohesion less consisting of sandstone grains with the same structure as the original sediment observation in the field the brewery conduit is developed in a 2 cm thick zone of residuum consisting of cohesion less sand which follows a bedding plane fig 3g the conduit originated by washing out part of the residuum the conduit is 2 cm high and 15 30 cm wide with residuum forming the sides while firm limestone forms the roof and bottom of the conduit based on observations by an inspection microcamera residuum is easily erodible by flowing water based on field observations residuum about 5 cm thick developed along a bedding plane exposed on a road cut in turnov dol√°nky fig 3d in barto≈°ova pec cave about a 1 cm thick residuum zones developed along two bedding planes are responsible for the origin of small conduits and the separation and falling of blocks within the entrance the inner part of cave was not studied as it is only accessible to cave divers in illusion cave the residuum is developed along subvertical fractures fig 3e core i5 was taken from the fracture wall in illusion cave to document the transition between the original rock and residuum while the original rock was firm and had a very low porosity with pores filled by calcite the residuum was very friable and its porosity was high fig 7 a ghost rock karstification is thus responsible for the origin of caves and conduits in the jizera fm aquifer the surface of quartz grains and their cementing agents from two materials from a single rock horizon were compared by sem i unweathered firm sandstone ii friable residuum sample i5 at quartz sand grain surfaces no difference was observed between the two materials it is thus unlikely that corrosion of quartz grains plays a role in the development of residuum on the other hand quartz grains are commonly cemented by microcrystalline or amorphous silica fig 7b c as this silica forms bridges which are often a few microns wide they can be corroded at a much faster rate than quartz sand grains after dissolution of the calcite which fills most of the space between quartz grains intense exchange of pore water with an adjacent conduit is possible and longterm corrosion of microcrystalline or amorphous silica may loosen the sand grains this additional mechanism should be considered as potentially being responsible for enlargement of the conduits and caves along with calcite dissolution duplicates of samples with d exceeding 50 were tested in confined settings fig s1 of the esm to test if the materials would disintegrate under such conditions and to test whether the rock studied is a sce material with 29 samples tested no specimen was stabilized by confinement table s2 of the esm the samples disintegrated both in unconfined and confined settings without any considerable difference furthermore arcades typical features created by stress controlled erosion and indicators of a sce material filippi et al 2018 were not observed in the study area neither on the surface nor in caves therefore erosion is unaffected by confinement and stress does not seem to play any role in the erosion of residuum in the jizera fm aquifer 4 4 effect of bedding planes and systematic fracture sets on conduit pattern bedding planes broadened into fissures and conduits are common in the area fig 3d g similarly fissures developed on the crossing of systematic vertical fracture sets are also common fig 3i several mm thick calcite deposits which cover vertical fractures widened by corrosion at the turnov dol√°nky road cut demonstrate frequent corrosion and reprecipitation of calcite in the vadose zone of the jizera fm aquifer fig s2 of the esm barto≈°ova pec cave is predominantly developed along bedding planes subvertical systematic fractures have small apertures in the cave and they are not apparent on cave cross sections fig 8 a cross sections a g fig 3h however the subvertical fractures clearly set the direction of the linear segments of the cave on the horizontal plan fig 8a the strike of the linear segments of cave passages is the same as strike of two roughly orthogonal fracture sets measured at rock outcrops fig 8b it is clear from the cave s horizontal plan fig 8a that individual subvertical fractures were followed by water flow to a distance of several tens of m it is thus apparent that the individual subvertical fractures are not continuous over larger distances the density of these two roughly orthogonal systematic fracture sets is high and they each can be traced 15 30 m at rock outcrops fig 3a inception features along which karst conduits develop are thus the omnipresent bedding planes and subvertical fractures a typical feature for karst conduits in limestone ford and williams 2007 the great importance of bedding planes and systematic subvertical fracture sets for the origins of conduits is probably a general feature for siliciclastic carbonate sequences e g runkel et al 2003 2006 barry et al 2015 medici et al 2018 and this study 4 5 flow pattern and velocity in conduits flow velocities were obtained between the majority of sinks and springs in the area fig 1c the maximum flow velocities calculated from first arrival of tracer from tracer tests were 1900 17000 m day 0 02 0 2 m s table 1 flow velocity increased with the flow rate of the sinking streams fig 9 the flow velocity between sinks and springs is comparable with the flow velocity in regular limestone karst worthington and ford 2009 this shows that the conduits are continuous and do not taper into fractures unlike what is common in chalk karst c f maurice et al 2010 flow velocity in conduits in the jizera fm aquifer is considerably larger than in the siliciclastic carbonate sequences in minnesota and wisconsin 20 750 m day green et al 2012 barry et al 2015 as well as in sherwood sandstone in the uk 140 m day barker et al 1998 the minimum flow velocity required to erode and transport the sand grains fine to medium sized is 0 2 and 0 01 0 03 cm s respectively based on the hjulstr√∂m curve flow velocity indicated by tracer tests is thus sufficient to transport the sand fractions which is also demonstrated by sand transported from barto≈°ova pec and bezednice springs and turbidity observed in conduits after heavy rains relatively low tracer recovery 50 in the case of some tracer tests even in conduit systems where bifurcation is unlikely barto≈°ova pec cave system indicates that in some cases a considerable portion of the tracer was lost or greatly delayed and diluted probably in loose sand and residuum table 1 the peclet number varied between 2 and 1090 showing that advection generally dominates the transport of tracer over dispersion table 1 a dendritic flow pattern occurs in the case of barto≈°ova pec cave system where water from two sinks join together into a single spring on the other hand polyfurcation occurs in the case of the kolonie doline ≈°leiferna sink and illusion cave where water from a single sink flows to 2 3 springs fig 1c polyfurcation is common for other siliciclastic carbonate sequences green et al 2012 barry et al 2015 while sinks occur at the topmost part of the jizera fm aquifer springs predominantly occur in the middle part with one spring roughly at the base of the jizera fm aquifer fig 4 as conduits clearly continuously developed between sinks and springs based on the fast flow velocity cf maurice et al 2010 at least the 50 m thick upper portion of the jizera fm aquifer above the brewery conduit is capable of enlargement into karst conduits fig 4 4 6 broader consequences karst conduits in the study area have developed due to dissolution of the calcite cement and probably also by the dissolution of microcrystalline amorphous silica karstification can be expected to occur in the jizera fm aquifer throughout the whole transitional facies zones where large springs occur fig 1b blind valleys and localized sinks are with few exceptions not developed outside the area depicted in fig 1c these features are bound to the area where the deeply incised jizera river and its tributaries created sufficient hydraulic gradients for transport of sand grains for several km in the underground caves localized sinks as well as blind valleys and sinkholes are generally missing in other locations with the presence of the transitional facies fig 1b probably due to two reasons i the hydraulic gradients are smaller in other areas and ii the tur7 aquitard and perched con aquifer are missing so there is a lack of focused recharge to the jizera fm aquifer however the existence of large springs fig 1b and the fast flow derived from several tracer tests indicates that conduits occur in the whole area of the transitional facies bruthans et al 2011 5 conclusions the karst potential of sandy limestone and calcareous sandstone in the turnov area czech republic was studied calcite which is the dominant carbonate mineral and the main cementing agent in the studied rocks varies in content between 0 1 and 77 wt mean 51 wt however the calcite content was found to be a weak predictor of karst potential in the studied rocks on the other hand treating the rock samples in 10 hcl and testing if the material will disintegrate into sand grains and small fragments after calcite dissolution seems to be a suitable and reliable predictor of karst potential i e that conduits with fast flowing water can develop while some rock samples with a calcite content of about 35 wt disintegrated completely after calcite dissolution in other cases no disintegration occurred even where the calcite content was as high as 70 wt highly or totally disintegrated samples after calcite dissolution were taken in horizons where conduits occur or in their nearby surroundings rocks with medium grained sand disintegrated at lower calcite contents than did fine grained ones the stability of some samples with a high calcite content after calcite dissolution is caused by microcrystalline amorphous silica which either bound together the quartz grains or formed a foam like sparse but firm internal structure such structures are nicely traceable with scanning electron microscopy especially after calcite dissolution and are relatively common in those sediments rich in marine sponge spicules however while on one hand microcrystalline amorphous silica bridges stabilize the structure they may also be corroded at a much faster rate than the surrounding quartz sand grains causing disintegration of the structure after calcite dissolution which fills most of the space between the quartz grains intense exchange of pore water with an adjacent conduit is possible long term corrosion of microcrystalline amorphous silica may loosen the sand grains and thus may contribute to the origin of conduits and caves residuum after calcite dissolution was found in all conduits and caves in various amounts residuum was either low cohesive or cohesion less consisting of sand grains with the same structure as the original sediment residuum is often easily erodible by flowing water the study area could therefore be treated as an example of ghost rock karst confinement of the samples had no effect on the disintegration of the material during calcite dissolution in 10 hcl the maximum flow velocity based on tracer tests in individual conduits was 0 02 0 2 m s this flow velocity is sufficient to erode and transport the fine and medium sized sand grains based on the hjulstr√∂m curve transport of the sand fractions can be observed during high flow events in conduits in the area flow velocities in the conduits are comparable to flow velocities recorded in regular limestone karst the conduits mainly evolve along widened bedding planes and widened systematic vertical fracture sets based on analysis of flow paths in barto≈°ova pec cave the individual fractures are followed by water flow only for a distance of several tens of meters conduits are organized along these omnipresent fractures in a manner typical for karst this and the cited studies showed that conduits with fast groundwater flow caves and other features typical for karst such as dolines and blind valleys are not rare in siliciclastic carbonate sequences a dissolution test in 10 hcl is essential to verify the karst potential of these rocks even a high calcite content is not a sufficient condition for rock disintegration after calcite dissolution and development of conduits micro ct and automatic element mapping by sem are valuable methods to study the cementing agents of siliciclastic carbonate sediments as well as to characterize changes during weathering of the rock into residuum declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research was funded by the czech science foundation ga cr no 16 19459s and

6487,karst potential is rarely studied in calcareous sandstones and sandy limestones the minimum content of carbonate necessary for the development of conduits is unknown and the mechanisms of the origins of conduits in these rocks are poorly understood this article focuses upon these questions in an important regional aquifer samples of limestones and sandstones were taken from outcrops in vertical profiles and were subjected to a rapid dissolution test with 10 hcl the degree of disintegration of the samples after dissolution of the carbonate was observed in order to estimate which portions of the rock enabled formation of karst conduits carbonate content was measured by calcimetry distribution of calcite cement and other sources of cohesion were studied by scanning electron microscopy tracer tests in the conduits were evaluated calcite is the dominant carbonate mineral and main cementing agent in the jizera fm aquifer mean content 51 however calcite content was found to be a weak predictor of karst potential most of the samples disintegrated completely if the calcite content exceeded 55 on the other hand some rocks with a calcite content up to 70 did not disintegrate due to microcrystalline amorphous silica which bound the quartz grains together and or formed a foam like supporting structure after in situ calcite dissolution the rock in karst prone zones is turned to residuum which consequently is washed out by fast flow 0 01 0 2 m s based on tracer tests microscopic study of cementing agents of the siliciclastic carbonate sediments and dissolution tests are

is an environment where the dominant part of the groundwater flows through conduits that originated by dissolution of the rock klimchouk et al 2000 due to the high flow velocity in the conduits and the common presence of localized recharge points karst areas are often extremely vulnerable and contaminants can rapidly travel considerable distances worthington and ford 2009 the presence of conduits and their connectivity can be obscured in some areas it is therefore important to identify a karst environment and to test for the presence of conduits e g by tracer tests karst hydrogeology is mostly studied in pure limestone and dolomite ford and williams 2007 in other lithologies it has been studied far less e g klimchouk 1996 bruthans et al 2017 some quartz sandstones and quartzites with no carbonate cement host underground drainage and caves with lengths up to 19 km which are considered as karst features by numerous researchers due to the critical role of quartz dissolution in their formation e g martini 1979 mecchia et al 2014 wray and sauro 2017 such caves are common in venezuela brazil india and south africa generally in areas with relatively high precipitation totals steep hydraulic gradients and long lasting rock exposures wray and sauro 2017 on the contrary in friable quartz sandstone the origin of conduits and caves can be a non karst process the result of mechanical erosion piping bruthans et al 2012 2014 duszy≈Ñsky et al 2016 thus the two end member processes responsible for the origin of caves and conduits in quartz sandstones are i epigenic quartz dissolution causing disintegration i e arenisation followed by mechanical erosion versus ii direct mechanical erosion of sandstone that is originally post diagenetically friable the question of which one of these two processes is dominant and in which area is a matter of ongoing debate aubrecht 2011 wray and sauro 2017 duszy≈Ñski et al 2018 there are also many rocks which consist of beds of sand and silt sized siliciclastic and carbonate components or siliciclastics with carbonate cement caves up to 7 km long and dolines are known from the mesozoic eocene flysh deposits of northeastern italy with a caco3 content of 31 93 mocchiutti and maddaleni 2005 similar 1 6 km long caves with underground streams from eocene calcareous sandstone have been described from switzerland h√§uselmann and

tracer tests is up to 140 m day barker et al 1998 the above mentioned rocks in the usa and uk serve as important aquifers leaf et al 2012 medici et al 2018 in the case of some limestones and some siliciclastics with carbonate cement and a low hydraulic gradient dissolution of the carbonate leaves strongly weathered material in situ called alterite in dubois et al 2014 a term conflicting with previously defined alterite in american geological institute glossary of geology we use therefore term residuum further in the text instead of alterite steep hydraulic gradients are subsequently necessary to mechanically erode the residuum by piping to create the conduits or caves as the primary structures of rock are preserved but rock is turned to easily erodible residuum the process is called ghost rock karstification h√§uselmann and tognini 2005 dubois et al 2014 while stratigraphic position and the size and shape of conduit apertures are often nicely documented from wells and outcrops e g runkel et al 2003 medici et al 2016 data are missing concerning carbonate content in the rock layers which are prone to the development of conduits inception horizons filipponi et al 2009 in siliciclastic carbonate sequences work by mocchiutti and maddaleni 2005 who have analyzed the caco3 contents in several lithologies of flysch formation is the exception as the caco3 content of inception horizons is unknown and dissolution of rock samples from inception horizons is generally not tested the karst origin of these pathways is commonly not proven this often results in speculation on the origins of these conduits e g green et al 2012 barry et al 2015 in addition the critical content of caco3 necessary for evolution of karst conduits in sandstones with carbonate cement is unknown the major objective of this study was to evaluate the karst potential of sandy limestone and calcareous sandstone and to characterize the conduits and conduit flow in selected parts of the jizera fm aquifer in the bohemian cretaceous basin which hosts many features typical for karst as well as serving as an important aquifer in the czech republic in order to reach this objective the following tasks were undertaken 1 to characterize the vertical distribution of calcite content in the aquifer with a focus on the conduits 2 to use dissolution tests of rock samples in 10 hcl as an indicator of the karst potential 3 to visualize the distribution of calcite cement and sand grains at the microscale to improve knowledge of the dissolution processes and sources of cohesion 4 to test to which degree the studied area is an example of ghost rock karst 5 to test the effect of confinement on residuum erosion 6 to characterize the effect of bedding planes and systematic subvertical fracture sets on the conduit pattern and 7 to characterize the flow pattern and velocity in the conduits by tracer tests in this paper rock is considered to be karst prone and suitable for conduit evolution if its structure collapses and disintegrates into small fragments and sand grains after dissolution tests in 10 hcl the study area is situated in the bohemian cretaceous basin a

m thick confining unit b√≠l√° hora aquitard below which the cenomanian sandstone aquifer is developed distinct confinement is proven by a head difference of several tens of meters in both aquifers and considerable groundwater ages in the cenomanian aquifer corcho alvarado et al 2013 the jizera fm aquifer is overlain by the 10 20 m thick aquitard tur7 consisting of impermeable marls and clays aquitard tur7 is overlain by a perched coniacian quartz sandstone aquifer con which is equivalent to hrub√° sk√°la sandstone fig 2 bruthans et al 2012 the con aquifer lacks any carbonate and its water is acidic and unsaturated with respect to calcite mac√°k 1956 the rocks in the study area are largely undeformed and nearly flat lying regionally dipping 25 m per kilometer to the ssw bedding planes

1 sampling and field measurements to characterize the vertical distribution of carbonate content and karst potential in the jizera fm aquifer small horizontal rock samples cylindrical plugs were taken by an accumulator drill with a diamond core drill bit 35 mm in diameter from subvertical rock outcrops in profiles at a 1 m interval and also with a higher frequency in places with conduits sampling was focused on rock outcrops where important hydrogeological features such as conduits caves springs and sinks occurred profiles were selected to comprise the available portion of the jizera fm aquifer where rock outcrops occur the upper surface of the jizera fm aquifer forms a distinct slightly inclined surface to the ssw due to its higher erosional resistance compared to other formations it is dissected by narrow canyons of the jizera river and its tributaries fig 1c the upper surface of the jizera fm aquifer was identified by lidar image 5th generation http ags cuzk cz dmr to place the individual profiles in stratigraphic order their vertical distance to the upper surface of the jizera fm aquifer was determined the altitude of the profiles was determined by topcon grs 1 with a vertical precision of 0 3 m 3 2 laboratory measurements each sample plug was cut perpendicular to its axis into three cylindrical subsamples 1 2 cm long one subsample was used to measure calcite content by calcimetry the second for dissolution tests with hcl and the third was stored for scanning electron microscopy sem as coring was done along layering each subsample is sampling the same rock layer the subsamples for calcimetry were crushed milled into a 63 Œºm fraction and homogenized co2 content was measured by coulometry cao mgo feo fe2o3 and mno contents were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry faas calcium carbonate content was then calculated as the sum of cao and proportional part of co2 to test if subsamples cores will disintegrate in an acidic environment dissolution tests were done with 10 hcl this acid is commonly used to dissolve carbonate as its products of reaction with carbonate are soluble and it does not react with quartz nor most of the other common aluminosilicates ray et al 1957 cores were not crushed in this experimental setup dissolutions were separated for individual samples and were repeated up to 30 days until the reaction diminished while the acid remained aggressive enough in contact with the core cores were dried and weighed prior to dissolution moriginal after dissolution the two solid fractions were separated i cores or large fragments disintegrated from cores mlarge and ii sand grains and small fragments 2 mm mdisintegrated both fractions were separately washed with water dried and weighed the disintegration ratio d was defined as 1 d m disintegrated m insoluble 100 where mdisintegrated is the dry weight of sand grains and small fragments 2 mm which disintegrated from the sample due to leaching in hcl minsoluble is the weight of the total dry insoluble solid mass remaining after dissolution in hcl mlarge mdisintegrated disintegration ratio d thus does not consider soluble fraction if sample did not disintegrate at all during leaching in hcl its d 0 irrespectively whether the calcite content is 0 or 70 if the sample completely disintegrated to loose sand its d 100 also irrespectively on calcite content the disintegration ratio d is a parameter showing if rock disintegrates to fines transportable by flowing water or remains intact after acid leaching this parameter cannot be defined in pure carbonate a rough estimation of calcite content was obtained by 2 calcite approx 1 m insoluble m original 100 where moriginal is the dry weight of the sample prior to dissolution porosity of the original rock was determined by the archimedes principle measurements of saturated mass dry mass and volume these parameters were obtained by measuring the weight of dry sample sample immersed in water and sample immersed in water but hanging on wire thus sample affects the scale only by buoyancy following czechoslovak state norm csn 721010 the fine and medium grained sandstone is distinguished based on measurements of grain size in the samples as well as in the sand from hcl leaching grain size threshold 0 25 mm grain size was verified by scanning electron microscopy sem on selected samples uniaxial compression can prevent some locked sands and weak sandstones from erosion by flowing water bruthans et al 2014 filippi et al 2018 confinement in the solid material which encompasses the sample leaving only the single free face has a similar effect bruthans and ≈ôiho≈°ek 2017 both the compression and confinement prevent the dilatation of the sandstone which is a prerequisite for its disintegration as the sandstone is commonly densely packed and interlocked bruthans et al 2014 thus an unconfined sample of sandstone may show different behavior during erosion and potentially also after dissolution in hcl than a sample which is compressed or confined bruthans et al 2014 bruthans and ≈ôiho≈°ek 2017 to test the effect of confinement new plugs were taken in the field from positions where disintegration ratio d had reached more than 50 in the original plugs new plugs were placed into 50 mm polypropylene cups and were fixed by a plaster frame so that most of each core body was confined by plaster and only a small part remained sticking out fig s1 of the electronic supplementary material esm after setting of the plaster the cores were dissolved in 10 hcl it was observed whether the material disintegrated completely i e confinement was not preventing the disintegration of core after dissolution of calcite or whether only the material sticking out disintegrated into small particles material which was not compressed nor confined in the second case the material was considered stress controlled erosion material sce material 3 3 scanning electron microscopy and micro computed tomography selected subsamples were used for sem analysis of the carbonate and silica distribution in the rocks polished sections of cores were coated with gold the samples were investigated at the institute of rock structure and mechanics of the czech academy of sciences prague in a quanta 450 fei scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds and equipped with a photomultiplier detector centaurus for backscattered electrons bse at 15 and 30 kv mineral grains were analyzed with an apollo x eds detector using edx genesis software with a live time of 50 and 100 s one sample was investigated by micro computed tomographic analysis micro ct the micro ct scanning was carried out at the national museum in prague using the skyscan 1172 scanner an x ray source voltage of 100 kv a current of 100 Œºa and a pre filter of 1 mm copper was applied average pixel size was 6 8 Œºm post processing of the micro ct data was conducted using n recon and avizo software 3 4 tracer tests the tracer tests were designed and evaluated based on procedures described in field 2002 nacl and licl were used as tracers flow rate was measured at tracer injection mostly sinking streams and at the sampling points flow rate was measured by container fill method for flow rates 5 l s and by tracer dilution method for larger flow rates flow path was estimated as 1 5 of the direct distance between injection and sampling points based on field 2002 and in agreement with the ratio of the length of the mapped flow path in the barto≈°ova pec cave and the direct distance between inflow and outflow points in cave 1 45 the concentration of dissolved nacl was logged by electric conductivity meters cond 3310 wtw germany and leveloger solinst canada the relationship between dissolved nacl and electric conductivity was calibrated in the field sodium and lithium concentrations were measured at charles university by atomic absorption spectrometry aas and by mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma icp ms respectively breakthrough curves from the tracer tests were analyzed with the qtracer2 program field 2002 4 results and discussion 4 1 carbonate content in rock and dissolution tests ten vertical profiles were sampled and merged into a single composite vertical profile for the jizera fm aquifer fig 4 altogether 75 samples were analyzed for content of cao mgo feo fe2o3 mno and co2 table s1 of the esm caco3 content varied between 0 1 and 77 wt mean 51 wt most of the samples have a caco3 content between 32 and 69 10th and 90th percentile respectively mgco3 content is low mean 0 9 wt max 1 3 wt low mg calcite dominates in the profile based on the molar ratio of mgco3 in the carbonate as the carbonate is dominantly formed by calcite the caco3 is referred to in the further text as calcite mean fe and mn oxide contents are 0 7 wt and 0 03 wt respectively which is too low to consider them as cementing agents the only cementing agent that is present to any considerable amount and tends to decay in an acid environment is thus calcite calcite content is variable along the vertical profile through the jizera fm aquifer fig 4 and oscillates 40 within distances of from one to a few m a slightly lower calcite content is typical for the uppermost 20 m of the jizera fm aquifer seventy one samples were immersed into 10 hcl to test if they disintegrate after dissolution and if the studied horizons allow for forming of karst conduits altogether 32 of the samples disintegrated completely into sand grains and small fragments another 15 of the samples disintegrated at least from 50 into small fragments and grains thus about 47 of the samples are considered potentially karst prone as they experienced considerable or total disintegration due to dissolution of the calcite in an acid environment fig 4 samples taken from the brewery conduit horizon k23a b c d showed the disintegration ratio d 88 100 and a calcite content of 66 77 wt on the other hand low d 2 and a calcite content of only 21 32 was found at the entrance of the barto≈°ova pec cave which however has been artificially enlarged by chiseling and the original passage is now filled by sediment and flooded by water due to a dam built in front of the cave based on a composite profile fig 4 rocks with d 100 and a calcite content of 59 69 wt occur just vertically below the stream level of the barto≈°ova pec cave table s2 of the esm such rocks are outcropping at p5 profile in the illusion cave some samples fully disintegrated similarly the samples taken from the sink in the podhorƒç√≠ blind valley fully disintegrated a high proportion of disintegrated samples d 50 in the jizera fm aquifer and the presence of these samples in horizons where conduits occur or in their nearby surroundings indicates that dissolution of carbonate cement is essential for the origination of conduits the relationship between precise calcite content from calcimetry and approximate calcite content calciteaprox calculated by eq 2 see method section is relatively tight fig 5 a pearson 0 90 a rough estimation of calcite content can thus be obtained from samples reacted with 10 hcl instead of by the expensive and time consuming calcimetry method differences between results of calcimetry and calciteaprox content are caused by imperfect dissolution in the case of calciteaprox and inhomogenities in the calcite content within samples in further text the calcite content from calcimetry is used porosity of the rock samples is generally between 4 and 10 mean 7 this is likely equal to the original porosity of the rock only samples of residuum k38a and k38b from illusion cave where calcite was partly dissolved see chapter 4 3 have porosities of 26 and 16 respectively fig 5b 4 2 microstructure as a reason for the poor relationship between calcite content and disintegration ratio the relationship between calcite content and the disintegration ratio d is surprisingly weak fig 5c pearson 0 57 generally samples do not disintegrate if the calcite content is below 30 wt but there are only a few such samples on the other hand most samples disintegrated completely if the calcite content exceeded 55 wt however there were still three samples 4 of the total set which did not disintegrate despite a calcite content as high as 63 70 wt table s2 of the esm samples with calcite contents between 35 and 55 wt had some that completely disintegrated and others that did not disintegrate samples with medium grained sand generally disintegrated with a lower calcite content than those with fine grained sand fig 5c bal√°k 2015 rocks with medium grained sand therefore seem to be more karst prone than are fine grained ones with the same calcite content the stability of samples which originally contained up to 70 wt of calcite and yet did not disintegrate after complete dissolution of the calcite was surprising this means that 30 of the remaining material is capable of keeping the rock structure stable the very variable threshold of critical calcite content which results in complete disintegration 36 70 wt was also surprising fig 5c to explain these findings the distribution of carbonate and silica content was studied on polished sections upon selected subsamples by element mapping with sem fig 6 we targeted our focus on samples which did not disintegrate despite having a very high calcite content and compared them with samples which disintegrated despite having much lower calcite contents sample 312 is an example of a fully disintegrating d 100 calcite rich 75 material fig 6a fine sand grains were floating in the carbonate matrix and as the matrix supported the grains after its dissolution the material fell into a loose sand similarly sample k21 with a calcite content of 53 fully disintegrated d 100 medium sized sand grains showed some tangential contacts yet they disintegrated after calcite dissolution fig 6b sample k18b is an example of a material which partly kept a stable structure after calcite dissolution d 64 calcite content 53 fig 6d depicts material with partly dissolved calcite which shows long contacts between the sand grains but also a foam like structure of microcrystalline amorphous silica between the grains this silica creates a supportive network and is responsible for the stability of the sample where the calcite was dissolved in hcl note that this foam like structure is not readily visible in the original not hcl treated material fig 6c sample 293 has a calcite content of 70 yet d is just 3 the foam like structure of microcrystalline amorphous silica which stabilizes the material is visible fig 6e sample 291 has a calcite content of 75 and fully disintegrated d 100 unlike the previous sample in this case the microcrystalline amorphous silica is somewhat more dispersed in the material fig 6f the sem study demonstrated that microcrystalline amorphous silica is a very important cementing agent especially in the lower portion of the jizera fm aquifer the silica was leached from marine sponge spicules during diagenesis ƒç√°p 2006 and gives sufficient material strength if not dispersed through the material but concentrated into a foam like structure even high calcite content is thus not a sufficient condition for sample disintegration this should especially be considered in sediments containing marine sponge spicules the spicules were originally formed by opal a highly mobile form of silica which could be considerably mobilized during diagenesis a somewhat similar structure of amorphous silica was observed in tournaisian siliceous limestone in belgium by dubois et al 2014 through presence of silica in foam like structure the jizera fm does not contain chert nodules 4 3 ghost rock karstification and effects of other processes resiuum i e the in situ residuum after dissolution of calcite dubois et al 2014 was found in all conduits and caves in varying amounts the residuum was either low cohesive or cohesion less consisting of sandstone grains with the same structure as the original sediment observation in the field the brewery conduit is developed in a 2 cm thick zone of residuum consisting of cohesion less sand which follows a bedding plane fig 3g the conduit originated by washing out part of the residuum the conduit is 2 cm high and 15 30 cm wide with residuum forming the sides while firm limestone forms the roof and bottom of the conduit based on observations by an inspection microcamera residuum is easily erodible by flowing water based on field observations residuum about 5 cm thick developed along a bedding plane exposed on a road cut in turnov dol√°nky fig 3d in barto≈°ova pec cave about a 1 cm thick residuum zones developed along two bedding planes are responsible for the origin of small conduits and the separation and falling of blocks within the entrance the inner part of cave was not studied as it is only accessible to cave divers in illusion cave the residuum is developed along subvertical fractures fig 3e core i5 was taken from the fracture wall in illusion cave to document the transition between the original rock and residuum while the original rock was firm and had a very low porosity with pores filled by calcite the residuum was very friable and its porosity was high fig 7 a ghost rock karstification is thus responsible for the origin of caves and conduits in the jizera fm aquifer the surface of quartz grains and their cementing agents from two materials from a single rock horizon were compared by sem i unweathered firm sandstone ii friable residuum sample i5 at quartz sand grain surfaces no difference was observed between the two materials it is thus unlikely that corrosion of quartz grains plays a role in the development of residuum on the other hand quartz grains are commonly cemented by microcrystalline or amorphous silica fig 7b c as this silica forms bridges which are often a few microns wide they can be corroded at a much faster rate than quartz sand grains after dissolution of the calcite which fills most of the space between quartz grains intense exchange of pore water with an adjacent conduit is possible and longterm corrosion of microcrystalline or amorphous silica may loosen the sand grains this additional mechanism should be considered as potentially being responsible for enlargement of the conduits and caves along with calcite dissolution duplicates of samples with d exceeding 50 were tested in confined settings fig s1 of the esm to test if the materials would disintegrate under such conditions and to test whether the rock studied is a sce material with 29 samples tested no specimen was stabilized by confinement table s2 of the esm the samples disintegrated both in unconfined and confined settings without any considerable difference furthermore arcades typical features created by stress controlled erosion and indicators of a sce material filippi et al 2018 were not observed in the study area neither on the surface nor in caves therefore erosion is unaffected by confinement and stress does not seem to play any role in the erosion of residuum in the jizera fm aquifer 4 4 effect of bedding planes and systematic fracture sets on conduit pattern bedding planes broadened into fissures and conduits are common in the area fig 3d g similarly fissures developed on the crossing of systematic vertical fracture sets are also common fig 3i several mm thick calcite deposits which cover vertical fractures widened by corrosion at the turnov dol√°nky road cut demonstrate frequent corrosion and reprecipitation of calcite in the vadose zone of the jizera fm aquifer fig s2 of the esm barto≈°ova pec cave is predominantly developed along bedding planes subvertical systematic fractures have small apertures in the cave and they are not apparent on cave cross sections fig 8 a cross sections a g fig 3h however the subvertical fractures clearly set the direction of the linear segments of the cave on the horizontal plan fig 8a the strike of the linear segments of cave passages is the same as strike of two roughly orthogonal fracture sets measured at rock outcrops fig 8b it is clear from the cave s horizontal plan fig 8a that individual subvertical fractures were followed by water flow to a distance of several tens of m it is thus apparent that the individual subvertical fractures are not continuous over larger distances the density of these two roughly orthogonal systematic fracture sets is high and they each can be traced 15 30 m at rock outcrops fig 3a inception features along which karst conduits develop are thus the omnipresent bedding planes and subvertical fractures a typical feature for karst conduits in limestone ford and williams 2007 the great importance of bedding planes and systematic subvertical fracture sets for the origins of conduits is probably a general feature for siliciclastic carbonate sequences e g runkel et al 2003 2006 barry et al 2015 medici et al 2018 and this study 4 5 flow pattern and velocity in conduits flow velocities were obtained between the majority of sinks and springs in the area fig 1c the maximum flow velocities calculated from first arrival of tracer from tracer tests were 1900 17000 m day 0 02 0 2 m s table 1 flow velocity increased with the flow rate of the sinking streams fig 9 the flow velocity between sinks and springs is comparable with the flow velocity in regular limestone karst worthington and ford 2009 this shows that the conduits are continuous and do not taper into fractures unlike what is common in chalk karst c f maurice et al 2010 flow velocity in conduits in the jizera fm aquifer is considerably larger than in the siliciclastic carbonate sequences in minnesota and wisconsin 20 750 m day green et al 2012 barry et al 2015 as well as in sherwood sandstone in the uk 140 m day barker et al 1998 the minimum flow velocity required to erode and transport the sand grains fine to medium sized is 0 2 and 0 01 0 03 cm s respectively based on the hjulstr√∂m curve flow velocity indicated by tracer tests is thus sufficient to transport the sand fractions which is also demonstrated by sand transported from barto≈°ova pec and bezednice springs and turbidity observed in conduits after heavy rains relatively low tracer recovery 50 in the case of some tracer tests even in conduit systems where bifurcation is unlikely barto≈°ova pec cave system indicates that in some cases a considerable portion of the tracer was lost or greatly delayed and diluted probably in loose sand and residuum table 1 the peclet number varied between 2 and 1090 showing that advection generally dominates the transport of tracer over dispersion table 1 a dendritic flow pattern occurs in the case of barto≈°ova pec cave system where water from two sinks join together into a single spring on the other hand polyfurcation occurs in the case of the kolonie doline ≈°leiferna sink and illusion cave where water from a single sink flows to 2 3 springs fig 1c polyfurcation is common for other siliciclastic carbonate sequences green et al 2012 barry et al 2015 while sinks occur at the topmost part of the jizera fm aquifer springs predominantly occur in the middle part with one spring roughly at the base of the jizera fm aquifer fig 4 as conduits clearly continuously developed between sinks and springs based on the fast flow velocity cf maurice et al 2010 at least the 50 m thick upper portion of the jizera fm aquifer above the brewery conduit is capable of enlargement into karst conduits fig 4 4 6 broader consequences karst conduits in the study area have developed due to dissolution of the calcite cement and probably also by the dissolution of microcrystalline amorphous silica karstification can be expected to occur in the jizera fm aquifer throughout the whole transitional facies zones where large springs occur fig 1b blind valleys and localized sinks are with few exceptions not developed outside the area depicted in fig 1c these features are bound to the area where the deeply incised jizera river and its tributaries created sufficient hydraulic gradients for transport of sand grains for several km in the underground caves localized sinks as well as blind valleys and sinkholes are generally missing in other locations with the presence of the transitional facies fig 1b probably due to two reasons i the hydraulic gradients are smaller in other areas and ii the tur7 aquitard and perched con aquifer are missing so there is a lack of focused recharge to the jizera fm aquifer however the existence of large springs fig 1b and the fast flow derived from several tracer tests indicates that conduits occur in the whole area of the transitional facies bruthans et al 2011 5 conclusions the karst potential of sandy limestone and calcareous sandstone in the turnov area czech republic was studied calcite which is the dominant carbonate mineral and the main cementing agent in the studied rocks varies in content between 0 1 and 77 wt mean 51 wt however the calcite content was found to be a weak predictor of karst potential in the studied rocks on the other hand treating the rock samples in 10 hcl and testing if the material will disintegrate into sand grains and small fragments after calcite dissolution seems to be a suitable and reliable predictor of karst potential i e that conduits with fast flowing water can develop while some rock samples with a calcite content of about 35 wt disintegrated completely after calcite dissolution in other cases no disintegration occurred even where the calcite content was as high as 70 wt highly or totally disintegrated samples after calcite dissolution were taken in horizons where conduits occur or in their nearby surroundings rocks with medium grained sand disintegrated at lower calcite contents than did fine grained ones the stability of some samples with a high calcite content after calcite dissolution is caused by microcrystalline amorphous silica which either bound together the quartz grains or formed a foam like sparse but firm internal structure such structures are nicely traceable with scanning electron microscopy especially after calcite dissolution and are relatively common in those sediments rich in marine sponge spicules however while on one hand microcrystalline amorphous silica bridges stabilize the structure they may also be corroded at a much faster rate than the surrounding quartz sand grains causing disintegration of the structure after calcite dissolution which fills most of the space between the quartz grains intense exchange of pore water with an adjacent conduit is possible long term corrosion of microcrystalline amorphous silica may loosen the sand grains and thus may contribute to the origin of conduits and caves residuum after calcite dissolution was found in all conduits and caves in various amounts residuum was either low cohesive or cohesion less consisting of sand grains with the same structure as the original sediment residuum is often easily erodible by flowing water the study area could therefore be treated as an example of ghost rock karst confinement of the samples had no effect on the disintegration of the material during calcite dissolution in 10 hcl the maximum flow velocity based on tracer tests in individual conduits was 0 02 0 2 m s this flow velocity is sufficient to erode and transport the fine and medium sized sand grains based on the hjulstr√∂m curve transport of the sand fractions can be observed during high flow events in conduits in the area flow velocities in the conduits are comparable to flow velocities recorded in regular limestone karst the conduits mainly evolve along widened bedding planes and widened systematic vertical fracture sets based on analysis of flow paths in barto≈°ova pec cave the individual fractures are followed by water flow only for a distance of several tens of meters conduits are organized along these omnipresent fractures in a manner typical for karst this and the cited studies showed that conduits with fast groundwater flow caves and other features typical for karst such as dolines and blind valleys are not rare in siliciclastic carbonate sequences a dissolution test in 10 hcl is essential to verify the karst potential of these rocks even a high calcite content is not a sufficient condition for rock disintegration after calcite dissolution and development of conduits micro ct and automatic element mapping by sem are valuable methods to study the cementing agents of siliciclastic carbonate sediments as well as to characterize changes during weathering of the rock into residuum declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research was funded by the czech science foundation ga cr no 16 19459s and

6488,wetlands are considered to be the important carbon sequestration functional units and moisture is a critical environmental factor that affects the mineralization of soil organic carbon soc however little information is available on the effects of soil moisture on soc mineralization in floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies soil samples to a depth of 20 cm were collected in five types of floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies i e permanent floodplain f0 1 year floodplain f1 5 year floodplain f5 10 year floodplain f10 and 100 year floodplain f100 in the downstream of the huolin river basin of china a 30 day incubation experiment with three moisture treatments i e 30 60 and 100 water holding capacity whc was used to identify soc mineralization processes and key influencing factors in these five floodplain wetlands our results showed that the topsoils 0 10 cm contained significantly higher soc contents than the subsurface soils 10 20 cm the soc contents followed the order of f5 f0 f1 f10 f100 and the order f0 f5 f100 f1 f10 in the topsoils and subsurface soils respectively of five floodplain wetlands the optimum moisture for the soc mineralization of the topsoils was 30 whc in f100 and 60 whc in the other four wetlands in the case of all the subsurface soils 30 whc was the optimum moisture for the soc mineralization the mineralization processes of soc especially the active carbon pool could be better fitted by first order kinetic models r2 0 98 the topsoils basically showed a lower c0 soc ratio c0 the potentially mineralized carbon than the subsurface soils except in the case of 60 and 100 whc in f0 and f5 under higher soil moisture conditions the mineralization parameter k was significantly correlated with soil conductivity p 0 05 under low soil moisture condition c0 soc showed significant correlations with soil ph p 0 01 our findings indicate that the change in the soil moisture of floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies could greatly affect the carbon pool of inland wetlands keywords floodplain wetlands soil organic carbon carbon mineralization moisture flooding frequency 1 introduction wetlands are large carbon pools that hold approximately 450 pg of global soil carbon lal 2008 many studies have been focused on blue carbon in coastal wetlands whereas there are limited studies on teal carbon in inland wetlands nahlik and fennessy 2016 inland floodplain wetlands are a transitional zone formed by the dynamic processes in aquatic and terrestrial environments and the hydrological connection between floods and the surrounding floodplains could cause the exchange of material between them tockner et al 2010 hence hydrological connectivity between the river and the floodplain accelerates the transfer of carbon and nutrients heritage et al 2016 thoms 2003 the hydro morphological indicators may be the important factors influencing soil organic carbon content and nutrient distribution including the flooding frequency size of the floodplain and flooding duration day et al 1988 saint laurent et al 2017 for instance a high frequency of flooding increases soc input and the flooding duration and soil co2 emissions have a significant correlation in floodplain wetlands s√°nchez andr√©s et al 2010 changes in soc could significant affect the atmospheric co2 level even if the magnitude of the change is very small tian et al 2015 therefore soc decomposition or soil respiration in wetland ecosystems have received increasing attention in recent years sihi et al 2016 chen et al 2018 in order to describe the soc mineralization process previous researchers have developed the single and double exponential fitting models which are widely used kumar et al 2018 ojeda et al 2015 to fit the mineralization processes of soc and active organic carbon boyle and paul 1989 alvarez and alvarez 2000 cooper et al 2011 temperature moisture soil texture ph microbes and vegetation have been regarded as important factors that influence soc mineralization feng et al 2016 norton et al 2012 davidson et al 2000 proposed that moisture effects on soil respiration could be expressed using a variety of equations e g linear logarithmic and quadratic under different circumstances as compared with temperature effects although the effects of moisture on soc mineralization have received a greater amount of attentions in past decades previous studies have been mainly focused on soc mineralization in farmlands forests and peatland soils feng et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 wang et al 2016a wickland and neff 2008 showed that the soil respiration reached a maximum value when the relative moisture saturation was approximately 0 75 and then decreased under 20 c wang et al 2010 reported that soc mineralization rates were negatively correlated with soil depths and the highest rate was at 60 whc treatments however higher soc mineralization rates were also observed at higher or lower moisture levels mi et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 soil moisture levels corresponding to the maximum co2 emission in different ecosystems may be different owing to local soil characteristics more recently huang and hall 2017 presented that an increase in moisture could accelerate carbon loss in mineral soils however the soc mineralization in response to changing soil moistures in floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies is poorly understood the primary objectives of this work are as follows 1 to reveal the soc mineralization response to different moisture treatments in floodplain wetland soils with different flooding frequencies 2 to fit the soc mineralization processes using first order kinetic models and 3 to reveal the relationships between soc mineralization and soil physico chemical properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area is located in xianghai national nature reserve 122 05 122 35 e 44 50 45 19 n and approximately 73 of the study area comprises inland salt marshes that lie downstream of the huolin river basin jilin province of china fig 1 xianghai wetland is on the list of wetlands of international importance the sample area comprises approximately 30 km2 of floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies it has a semi arid continental monsoon climate the annual average precipitation is 408 mm and the annual average evaporation is 1945 mm with the dry seasons occurring from october to may and the rainy seasons from june to september the annual average temperature is 5 c and the average temperature in july is 24 c with a frost free period of 140 days the soil is marsh soil that is dominantly covered by phragmites australis 2 2 soil collection and analysis a series of typical soil collection areas with different flooding frequencies were selected and set up along a straight line fig 1 these areas included a permanently flooded floodplain f0 1 year floodplain f1 flooding occurs once a year 5 year floodplain f5 flooding occurs once every five years 10 year floodplain f10 flooding occurs once every ten years and 100 year floodplain f100 flooding occurs once every one hundred years according to bai et al 2005 2007 soil samples with three replicates were collected to a depth of 20 cm at 10 cm intervals i e 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm using a soil auger in july 2010 the distance between each repetition was 10 m and each repetition was a mixture of five soil samples randomly obtained from a 1 m 1 m quadrat a total of 30 soil samples were obtained and placed in polyethylene bags the soil samples were air dried at room temperature for 3 weeks all the samples were sieved using a 2 mm sieve to eliminate recognizable plant litters coarse roots and stones one part of the air dried soils was used to determine soil particle size and one part was grounded and sieved using a 0 149 mm sieve for the determination of the initial soil properties the remaining soil samples were sieved using a 2 mm sieve for the incubation experiments the other three soil cores 100 cm3 were collected for the determination of the soil moisture and bulk density bd the soil moisture and bd were measured using drying soil at 105 c for 48 h in an oven the particle size of the soil treated with hexametaphosphate was analyzed using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 england the soil ph and electrical conductivity ec were determined using a ph meter sartorius germany and conductivity meter mettler toledo usa respectively in a suspension of 1 5 soil water m v the soc was determined by dichromate and concentrated sulfuric acid oxidation nelson and sommers 1975 the water holding capacity whc was determined using the modified method of borch et al 2003 briefly 20 g air dried soil that was passed through a 2 mm sieve was placed in a funnel with a cotton ball in the filter and deionized water was then added to the soil until saturation after soaking for 2 h the cotton ball was removed and the upper part of the funnel was covered with plastic wrap for one night the soil samples were dried at 105 c for 48 h in an oven and weighed finally whc of these soils could be calculated according to the measured soil moistures the traditional indoor incubation alkali absorption method was used in the soc mineralization experiments the soil samples 10 g dry weight were placed in 150 ml incubation bottles while slowly adding deionized water into the bottles to realize three moisture treatments i e 30 60 and 100 whc all the bottles were covered with plastic wraps to minimize moisture loss when they were pre incubated for 5 days in the dark at 25 1 c a total of 90 soil samples 5 sites 2 depths 3 replicates 3 moistures levels were incubated after 5 days of pre incubation a beaker with 10 ml of 0 1 mol l 1 naoh was placed in each bottle to ensure that co2 was absorbed at a certain incubation time then the bottles were sealed and airtight the incubation of the treated bottles continued to be incubated at 25 1 c in the dark for 30 days the co2 concentrations in the small beakers were measured at days 1 3 7 10 14 21 and 30 the bottles were weighed at each sampling to supplement the lost soil moisture and were then opened for 1 h to ensure that the gas in the bottles was consistent with that in the surrounding air the bottles were subsequently sealed again the co2 concentration was measured by removing the solution from the small beaker and pouring it into the conical flask and then adding 3 ml of 1 mol l 1 bacl2 solution to the conical flask the amount of co2 released was calculated according to the amount of hydrochloric acid used for titration at the same time four blank experiments were set up without soil samples in this study borax was used for calibration the mineralized soc was calculated using the following equation 1 co 2 c v 0 v c hcl 2 1000 44 12 44 1 w m where co2 c represents the amount of co2 c mg kg 1 mineralized at a certain incubation time v0 is the volume of the standard acid ml consumed when titrating the blank sample v is the volume of the standard acid ml consumed when titrating the tested sample chcl is the concentration of the standard acid mol l 1 44 is the molecular mass of co2 12 is the molecular mass of c m is the air dried soil mass g and w is the hygroscopic moisture content of the air dried soil the soc mineralization is mainly the decomposition of active soc in 35 days of incubation including 5 days of pre incubation and thus we used the given first order kinetic eq 2 to fit the soc mineralization processes 2 c t c 0 1 exp kt where ct represents the cumulative amount of co2 c mineralized from the soc at a certain incubation time mg kg 1 c0 represents the potentially mineralized c mg kg 1 and mainly the active carbon pool k is the mineralization rate constant d 1 and t is the incubation time d 2 3 statistical analysis an analysis of variance anova was used to test the soc contents and cumulative amount of co2 c mineralized in the case of different floodplain wetlands soil depth incubation time or moisture treatments which was followed by duncan s test at a significance level of 0 05 for comparing the differences a redundancy analysis rda and pearson correlation analysis were conducted using canoco 4 5 software packages and r3 4 1 cor test function in the stats package tool to reveal the relationships between the soil physico chemical properties and soc mineralization parameters or soc contents a stepwise regression analysis was performed to characterize the relationships between the soc contents and soil physico chemical properties data recording and pre processing were performed by using the excel 2010 software package and all the results were expressed as the mean of the three experiment repetitions anova analysis and stepwise regression analysis were performed using the spss 20 0 software package the graphics were created using originpro 2017 software package 3 results 3 1 soc levels in five floodplain wetlands the soc contents in the topsoils 0 10 cm ranged from 10 01 to 27 31 g kg 1 and followed the order of f5 f0 f1 f10 f100 comparatively topsoils contained higher soc contents than the subsurface soils 10 20 cm p 0 05 table 1 the soc levels in the subsurface soils varied from 3 97 to 10 87 g kg 1 following the order of f0 f5 f100 f1 f10 according to the classification by hu et al 2008 the spatial variabilities of the soc levels generally exhibited medium variations in both topsoils cv 44 63 and subsurface soils cv 41 03 all the soil physico chemical properties except for ec p 0 05 were significantly correlated with the soc contents table 2 the soc was significantly negatively correlated with the bd sand p 0 01 and ph values p 0 05 however a significant positive correlation was observed between the moisture clay silt and soc in this study p 0 01 we conducted a stepwise regression analysis in order to further determine the impacts on the selected soil properties the regression equation is given as follows y soc 21 25x1 bd 0 16x2 silt 3 08x3 ph 65 596 r2 0 983 p 0 01 this means that the bd silt and ph could explain 98 of the variations in the soc contents 3 2 cumulative soc mineralization in five floodplain wetlands the results of the four way anova for the incubation experiment are listed in table 3 the cumulative soc mineralization was significantly affected by the four factors of the sampling zone moisture soil depth and incubation time respectively p 0 01 with the exception of the interactions among the sampling zone moisture and incubation time and among the sampling zone moisture soil depth and incubation time all the interactive effects of these factors had significant impacts on the cumulative soc mineralization p 0 01 fig 2 shows the changes in the cumulative amount of soc mineralized in both soil depths of the five floodplain wetlands for the 30 days of incubation in the laboratory under the three moisture treatments a significant difference p 0 01 in the cumulative mineralized soc was observed for both soil depths in each of the five floodplain wetlands higher soc mineralization was observed in the topsoils as compared with those in the subsurface soils p 0 01 in the topsoils the cumulative mineralized soc followed the order of f5 f0 f1 f10 f100 the highest cumulative mineralized soc for 30 days of incubation in the topsoils occurred in the case of f5 1410 57 mg kg 1 under the 60 whc which was approximately 1 15 1 93 2 01 and 3 57 times as high as those in f0 f1 f10 and f100 respectively in contrast to the topsoils the maximum cumulative mineralized soc 478 77 mg kg 1 in the subsurface soils was observed in the case of f1 under the 30 whc which was 1 12 1 64 times as high as those in the cases of the other wetlands which followed the order of f0 f5 f100 f10 fig 3 shows the effects of the soil moistures on the soc mineralization in five floodplain wetlands in the topsoils of f10 f5 f1 and f0 the highest cumulative co2 c values were observed in the case of the 60 whc moisture treatment followed by the 100 whc whereas the lowest values occurred at 30 whc with the exception of f5 topsoils no significant differences were observed in the cumulative co2 c values between the 30 whc and 100 whc treatments p 0 05 at the 60 whc the cumulative co2 c in the f10 f5 f1 and f0 topsoils were 1 05 1 18 times as high as that at the 100 whc and were 1 14 1 23 times as high as that at the 30 whc the cumulative co2 c values in the f100 topsoils followed the order of 30 whc 429 80 mg c kg 1 soil 60 whc 395 49 mg c kg 1 soil 100 whc 385 29 mg c kg 1 soil in the subsurface soils of each floodplain wetland the cumulative co2 c values were 1 14 1 29 times higher at the 30 whc than those at the 60 or 100 whc p 0 05 3 3 fitting of soc mineralization processes using first order kinetic models as shown in fig 4 the mineralization processes were estimated using the first order kinetic model at each moisture treatment higher levels of cumulative co2 c were observed in the topsoils at all the moisture treatments levels over the incubation period as compared with the subsurface soils meanwhile higher soc mineralization rates were observed for all the soils in the early stage of incubation before 10 days of incubation and the soc mineralization rates then gradually decreased after 10 days of incubation table 4 lists the fitting parameter values for all the moisture treatments for the topsoils and subsurface soils the c0 soc value ranged from 0 036 to 0 111 in this study except for 60 and 100 whc in f0 and f5 the topsoils basically had a lower c0 soc compared to the subsurface soils the values of k inconsistent in these five floodplain wetlands and it was varied from 0 042 to 0 081 all the goodness of fit r2 values of the fitting equations were close to 1 the ct c0 values were less than 1 at three moisture treatments for all the soils and varied from 0 717 to 0 953 moreover in the topsoils the ct c0 values decreased gradually as the soil moistures increased 3 4 relationships between mineralization parameters and soil physico chemical properties fig 5 illustrates the rda analysis results of the soc mineralization parameters and soil physico chemical properties at each of the three moisture treatments for the mineralization parameters i e k c0 and c0 soc at 30 whc treatments 56 6 and 17 3 of the total variance was explained by axis 1 and axis 2 respectively the k values exhibited no significant relationships with ec p 0 05 c0 showed close relationships with bd moisture and soil texture p 0 01 and the c0 soc values were closely correlated with soil ph p 0 01 however at higher moisture treatments 60 and 100 whc no significant relationships p 0 05 were observed between c0 soc and ph while the k values were significantly positively correlated with soil ec p 0 05 c0 exhibited close correlations with all soil physico chemical properties except ec at 60 and 100 whc treatments both the axes explained nearly 77 of the total variance 4 discussion 4 1 effects of flooding frequencies on soc levels in floodplain wetlands the accumulation of soc was an integrated effect of carbon input and mineralization which could be influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors the flooding frequencies could greatly influence soc levels because floods could bring particulate organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon doc and doc could be easily accumulated under flooded and anoxic conditions kim et al 2014 similarly higher water tables inhibit soc decomposition owing to anoxic conditions ise et al 2008 moreover flooding could influence soil organic matter breakdown by altering the composition of soil microbial communities randle boggis et al 2018 floodplain wetlands with higher flooding frequencies e g f0 and f5 contained higher soc levels in both soil layers in this study thus indicating that these two floodplain wetlands could be regarded as soc hotspots among the five floodplain wetlands higher flooding frequencies tend to keep the soil in an oxygen limited condition thus leading to reducing hydrolase activity associated with organic carbon according to the enzymatic latch hypothesis which promotes wetland carbon sequestration hall et al 2014 moreover the highest soc level appeared in f5 not in f0 in the topsoils this might be associated with higher contents of clay and silt in f5 table 1 because large amounts of organic matter could be physically protected in clay and silt aggregates skjemstad et al 1993 significant positive correlations were also observed between clay and soc contents in this study p 0 01 thus indicating that fine particles could contribute to the soc storage in floodplain wetlands moreover lower soc contents in f100 could be ascribed to less vegetation in the past as plant debris was the key source of soil organic matter som formation bai et al 2005 kogelknabner 2002 miltner et al 2012 and plant roots were another important source of soc that was affected by their secretions and mortality ma et al 2016 in contrast f5 has more plant litters and organic carbon sources and thus it has a higher organic carbon content 4 2 effects of flooding frequencies and moisture on soc mineralization moisture is a very important factor for soc mineralization it has a direct effect on soc mineralization process and indirect effect on the relationships between temperature and soc mineralization suh et al 2009 previous study has suggested that the appropriate enhancement of soil moisture aided in increasing the microbes and their activities thus accelerating the mineralization of soc liu et al 2009 a significant correlation was also observed between soc mineralization e g c0 and the initial soil moisture fig 5 however extreme moisture could hinder the emission of mineralized carbon because the activities of microbes would be limited under extremely high moisture conditions and the soil pore space would be filled under flooding conditions that would prevent gas release wang et al 2016b different types of soils had different optimum moistures for soc mineralization tang et al 2017 reported that the amount of mineralized soc was higher at 100 water filled pore space wfps treatment than that at 60 wfps aerobic treatment in paddy soil taggart et al 2012 concluded that the optimum moisture for soc mineralization was nearly 50 saturation for the experimental soil our results showed that before the realization of the optimal soil moisture the cumulative mineralized soc increased as the moistures increased and sequentially kept a constant or a decrease over that moisture treatments which has been supported by previous research results suh et al 2009 wang et al 2013 generally the optimal moisture was 60 whc for the topsoils excluding f100 30 whc for the subsurface soils and 30 whc for f100 in this study this might be ascribed to the differing flooding conditions which could result in the differences in microbial communities in these regions peralta et al 2014 presented that hydrological conditions could directly affect microbial communities and change the functions of microbes moreover the optimum moisture content was determined based on the availability of readily mineralizable organic carbon and the balance of microbial activity ling et al 2006 reported that clay content was positively correlated with the adsorbed doc an increase in moisture and a higher ph promoted the dissolution rate of doc which was beneficial to the soc mineralization andersson et al 2000 tavakkoli et al 2015 however the excessive moisture would inhibit microbial activities owing to the limited of oxygen available as above mentioned davidson et al 2006 as a result the highest cumulative soc mineralization could be achieved at 30 whc under lower clay at a lower doc only small amount of water is required for the dissolution and higher ph conditions the presence of higher cumulative co2 c in the f5 and f1 soils implied that the highest mineralized soc appeared in floodplain wetlands with certain flooding frequencies and not in f0 with permanent flooding conditions this was because permanent flooding could prohibit soc breakdown the flooding processes in floodplain wetlands could be considered to be an alternating drying wetting process which was important for soc decomposition repeated drying rewetting cycles could result in a significant decline in the mineralized c because of the reduction in microbial activity or biomass mikha et al 2005 butterly et al 2009 similarly shi and marschner 2014 also found that frequent drying rewetting cycles may retain the less active microbes and decrease the soc mineralization however gao et al 2016 presented that fluctuations in water pressure due to the drying rewetting cycles made the substrate available for microbes thus accelerating c mineralization in this study the highest flooding frequency f0 was not the most beneficial to soc mineralization whereas the moderate flooding frequencies i e f5 and f1 improved the soc mineralization overall a relatively high flooding frequency f0 f1 and f5 on the subsurface soils was conducive to soc mineralization fig 3 with the exception of subsurface soils in f1 the mineralized carbon in all soils showed similar changes in soc contents indicating that soc mineralization was highly dependent on soc levels which is consistent with previous results li et al 2010 therefore the spatial variabilities of the cumulative soc mineralized in topsoils was greater than those of subsurface soils in the five floodplain wetlands fig 2 4 3 carbon mineralization kinetics the mineralization rate decreased gradually with incubation time and tended to stabilize eventually this was consistent with results by boulogne et al 2016 the initial rapid soc mineralization was associated with the active soc levels because the active soc could be easily to mineralize compared with soil recalcitrant carbon or passive carbon active organic carbon had a short residence time 5 years as compared to passive carbon which implied that it was easily oxidized and decomposed in the presence of microbes wang et al 2015 nath et al 2018 active soc mainly included doc labile organic carbon particulate organic carbon etc xu et al 2011 thus the labile fraction like sugars and proteins was easily decomposed which provided abundant carbon sources and nutrients for soil microbes mulvaney et al 2010 moreover the rewetting of dry soils would affect the microbial activity and increase the decomposition of organic carbon resulting in the birch effect jarvis et al 2007 manzoni et al 2012 therefore we set up pre culture and reduced this interference to simulate the real situation in this study alvarez and alvarez 2000 proved that the exponential model was a good descriptor of soc mineralization as shown in table 4 it could be observed that the fitting results of the soc mineralization for all moisture treatments were ideal r2 values ranging from 0 98 to 1 00 which implies that it is suitable for the first order kinetic models to fit soc mineralization in these floodplain wetlands considering the short incubation time it might only better fit the active carbon changes except for f100 the k value in subsurface soils was greater at 60 whc treatment as compared with 30 whc and 100 whc treatments this may be associated with soil properties e g soil texture and further studies are still necessary to clarify the causes the c0 soc values could reflect the carbon fixation capacity and higher values indicate stronger mineralization abilities li et al 2010 according to the c0 soc values the optimum moisture content of each floodplain wetland could be indirectly identified it could also indicate the proportion of potentially mineralizable c in organic carbon which reflects the carbon quality of organic carbon moscatelli et al 2007 the active fraction is low approximately 6 under all conditions although the topsoil contains more organic carbon carbon quality is slightly lower than that of subsurface soils and it is opposite in f0 and f5 under 60 and 100 whc ct c0 values could reflect the degree of consumption of active carbon comparatively the ct c0 values 1 at three moisture treatments for all soils indicated that microbes predominantly utilized the active organic carbon fraction of the soil moreover a gradual decrease in the ct c0 values for topsoils with increasing soil moistures suggested that the utilization of active soc was higher at 30 whc than those at the 60 whc and 100 whc treatments the values of k were different under different types of hydrogeomorphic zones we compared the k values under six hydrogeomorphic zones with those of floodplain wetlands table 5 generally the k values of soc mineralization in these floodplain wetlands were lower compared with other hydrogeomorphic zones except for peatlands and forest this implied that floodplain wetlands had a stronger carbon sequestration capacity and the carbon storage function of peatlands was the strongest owing to the large amount of carbon fixation under high moisture conditions harenda et al 2018 in contrast the rate constant of the fast k and slow h c pool in urban soils were much higher approximately ten times as high as other types of soils which might be influenced by human disturbances e g horticultural management and urban environmental factors pouyat et al 2006 kaye et al 2005 also found that soil respiration in urban ecosystems was nearly five times higher than that in other hydrogeomorphic zones and urban lawns played a significant role in it 4 4 effects of selected soil properties on soc levels and mineralization soc contents could be influenced by soil properties such as soil texture ph ec etc these properties regulate soc contents through biological and physical effects as mentioned above the clay and silt aggregates could protect soc in terms of biological effects microbes play an important role in the soil and regulated the carbon cycle directly or indirectly six et al 2006 bd and ph affect soc indirectly through soil microbes bd controls soil porosity and aeration which could influence the decomposition and transformation of carbon sources by aerobic microbes the ph values could indirectly affect soc levels by influencing microbial activities cao et al 2016 when the ph was 4 5 the biomass and activity of bacteria and fungi were strongly inhibited by aluminium toxicity to increase the carbon storage rousk et al 2009 moreover a significant inhibition of most microbes was also observed in alkaline soils ph 8 5 chen et al 2004 high soc mineralization was observed in the topsoils as compared with subsurface soils which is consistent with the results of tian et al 2016 this may be associated with the differences in soc and microbes because soc and microbial activities generally declined with depth and thus affected carbon mineralization leeuwen et al 2017 additionally the topsoils contributed to higher carbon emissions which may be associated with higher clay contents table 1 causing greater water retention singh et al 2017 meanwhile a higher ec in subsurface soils table 1 except f100 prohibited soc mineralization as a higher ec could prevent soil microbes from using substrates through the low osmotic potential thapa et al 2017 setia et al 2011 the kinetics parameters of mineralization k is the result of a combination of various environmental factors the effects of soil ph on k were inconsistent mou et al 2018 presented that ph values were negatively correlated with k values in coastal wetlands however cote et al 2000 showed a negative correlation in mineral soil and a positive relationship with k in forest soil in this study the effects of soil ph on k values exhibited a change from a negative correlation to a positive correlation with the increasing moisture fig 5 meanwhile the k values were closely positively correlated with ec at both 60 whc r 0 764 fig 5 and 100 whc r 0 674 fig 5 treatments it is contrary to previous research on the role of salinity in carbon mineralization setia et al 2011 therefore further research is needed 5 conclusions we studied the effects of moisture on soc mineralization in five floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies our results showed that the highest soc levels occurred in the topsoils of the 5 year floodplain wetlands comparatively the subsurface soils of the permanently flooded floodplain wetlands contained the highest soc levels among the five sampling zones followed by the 5 year floodpain wetlands this indicates that appropriate flooding frequencies could improve soc stocks in floodplain wetlands e g the 5 year floodplain wetlands should be given more concerns as hotspot of soc storage in addition to flooding frequencies soc levels in these floodplain wetlands were significantly correlated with bd silt and ph the topsoils exhibited significantly higher soc contents than subsurface soils but the proportion of active carbon was opposite except in f0 and f5 similarly the cumulative co2 c in topsoils were also higher as compared with the subsurface soils for the three moisture treatments the optimum soil moisture for soc mineralization was 60 whc in the topsoils of these floodplain wetlands excluding f100 and 30 whc in subsurface soils of all five floodplain wetlands therefore the soc mineralization processes could be manipulated by controlling soil moisture in our incubation experiment the first order kinetic equations could better fit soc mainly the active carbon pool mineralization processes the fitting parameters showed that k values were significantly correlated with ec p 0 05 under higher moisture conditions i e 60 and 100 whc while the c0 values showed significant correlations with bd initial soil moisture and soil texture p 0 01 under all moisture treatments the findings of this work could provide a guidance for carbon conservation and management of floodplain wetlands however further studies are still required to be focused on the interactive effects of moisture temperature ph etc on soc mineralization and microbial mechanisms of soc

6488,wetlands are considered to be the important carbon sequestration functional units and moisture is a critical environmental factor that affects the mineralization of soil organic carbon soc however little information is available on the effects of soil moisture on soc mineralization in floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies soil samples to a depth of 20 cm were collected in five types of floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies i e permanent floodplain f0 1 year floodplain f1 5 year floodplain f5 10 year floodplain f10 and 100 year floodplain f100 in the downstream of the huolin river basin of china a 30 day incubation experiment with three moisture treatments i e 30 60 and 100 water holding capacity whc was used to identify soc mineralization processes and key influencing factors in these five floodplain wetlands our results showed that the topsoils 0 10 cm contained significantly higher soc contents than the subsurface soils 10 20 cm the soc contents followed the order of f5 f0 f1 f10 f100 and the order f0 f5 f100 f1 f10 in the topsoils and subsurface soils respectively of five floodplain wetlands the optimum moisture for the soc mineralization of the topsoils was 30 whc in f100 and 60 whc in the other four wetlands in the case of all the subsurface soils 30 whc was the optimum moisture for the soc mineralization the mineralization processes of soc especially the active carbon pool could be better fitted by first order kinetic models r2 0 98 the topsoils basically showed a lower c0 soc ratio c0 the potentially mineralized carbon than the subsurface soils except in the case of 60 and 100 whc in f0 and f5 under higher soil moisture conditions the mineralization parameter k was significantly correlated with soil conductivity p 0 05 under low soil moisture condition c0 soc showed significant correlations with soil ph p 0 01 our findings indicate that the change in the soil moisture of floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies could greatly affect the carbon pool of inland wetlands keywords floodplain wetlands soil organic carbon carbon mineralization moisture flooding frequency 1 introduction wetlands are large carbon pools that hold approximately 450 pg of global soil carbon lal 2008 many studies have been focused on blue carbon in coastal wetlands whereas there are limited studies on teal carbon in inland wetlands nahlik and fennessy 2016 inland floodplain wetlands are a transitional zone formed by the dynamic processes in aquatic and terrestrial environments and the hydrological connection between floods and the surrounding floodplains could cause the exchange of material between them tockner et al 2010 hence hydrological connectivity between the river and the floodplain accelerates the transfer of carbon and nutrients heritage et al 2016 thoms 2003 the hydro morphological indicators may be the important factors influencing soil organic carbon content and nutrient distribution including the flooding frequency size of the floodplain and flooding duration day et al 1988 saint laurent et al 2017 for instance a high frequency of flooding increases soc input and the flooding duration and soil co2 emissions have a significant correlation in floodplain wetlands s√°nchez andr√©s et al 2010 changes in soc could significant affect the atmospheric co2 level even if the magnitude of the change is very small tian et al 2015 therefore soc decomposition or soil respiration in wetland ecosystems have received increasing attention in recent years sihi et al 2016 chen et al 2018 in order to describe the soc mineralization process previous researchers have developed the single and double exponential fitting models which are widely used kumar et al 2018 ojeda et al 2015 to fit the mineralization processes of soc and active organic carbon boyle and paul 1989 alvarez and alvarez 2000 cooper et al 2011 temperature moisture soil texture ph microbes and vegetation have been regarded as important factors that influence soc mineralization feng et al 2016 norton et al 2012 davidson et al 2000 proposed that moisture effects on soil respiration could be expressed using a variety of equations e g linear logarithmic and quadratic under different circumstances as compared with temperature effects although the effects of moisture on soc mineralization have received a greater amount of attentions in past decades previous studies have been mainly focused on soc mineralization in farmlands forests and peatland soils feng et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 wang et al 2016a wickland and neff 2008 showed that the soil respiration reached a maximum value when the relative moisture saturation was approximately 0 75 and then decreased under 20 c wang et al 2010 reported that soc mineralization rates were negatively correlated with soil depths and the highest rate was at 60 whc treatments however higher soc mineralization rates were also observed at higher or lower moisture levels mi et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 soil moisture levels corresponding to the maximum co2 emission in different ecosystems may be different owing to local soil characteristics more recently huang and hall 2017 presented that an increase in moisture could accelerate carbon loss in mineral soils however the soc mineralization in response to changing soil moistures in floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies is poorly understood the primary objectives of this work are as follows 1 to reveal the soc mineralization response to different moisture treatments in floodplain wetland soils with different flooding frequencies 2 to fit the soc mineralization processes using first order kinetic models and 3 to reveal the relationships between soc mineralization and soil physico chemical properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area is located in xianghai national nature reserve 122 05 122 35 e 44 50 45 19 n and approximately 73 of the study area comprises inland salt marshes that lie downstream of the huolin river basin jilin province of china fig 1 xianghai wetland is on the list of wetlands of international importance the sample area comprises approximately 30 km2 of floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies it has a semi arid continental monsoon climate the annual average precipitation is 408 mm and the annual average evaporation is 1945 mm with the dry seasons occurring from october to may and the rainy seasons from june to september the annual average temperature is 5 c and the average temperature in july is 24 c with a frost free period of 140 days the soil is marsh soil that is dominantly covered by phragmites australis 2 2 soil collection and analysis a series of typical soil collection areas with different flooding frequencies were selected and set up along a straight line fig 1 these areas included a permanently flooded floodplain f0 1 year floodplain f1 flooding occurs once a year 5 year floodplain f5 flooding occurs once every five years 10 year floodplain f10 flooding occurs once every ten years and 100 year floodplain f100 flooding occurs once every one hundred years according to bai et al 2005 2007 soil samples with three replicates were collected to a depth of 20 cm at 10 cm intervals i e 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm using a soil auger in july 2010 the distance between each repetition was 10 m and each repetition was a mixture of five soil samples randomly obtained from a 1 m 1 m quadrat a total of 30 soil samples were obtained and placed in polyethylene bags the soil samples were air dried at room temperature for 3 weeks all the samples were sieved using a 2 mm sieve to eliminate recognizable plant litters coarse roots and stones one part of the air dried soils was used to determine soil particle size and one part was grounded and sieved using a 0 149 mm sieve for the determination of the initial soil properties the remaining soil samples were sieved using a 2 mm sieve for the incubation experiments the other three soil cores 100 cm3 were collected for the determination of the soil moisture and bulk density bd the soil moisture and bd were measured using drying soil at 105 c for 48 h in an oven the particle size of the soil treated with hexametaphosphate was analyzed using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 england the soil ph and electrical conductivity ec were determined using a ph meter sartorius germany and conductivity meter mettler toledo usa respectively in a suspension of 1 5 soil water m v the soc was determined by dichromate and concentrated sulfuric acid oxidation nelson and sommers 1975 the water holding capacity whc was determined using the modified method of borch et al 2003 briefly 20 g air dried soil that was passed through a 2 mm sieve was placed in a funnel with a cotton ball in the filter and deionized water was then added to the soil until saturation after soaking for 2 h the cotton ball was removed and the upper part of the funnel was covered with plastic wrap for one night the soil samples were dried at 105 c for 48 h in an oven and weighed finally whc of these soils could be calculated according to the measured soil moistures the traditional indoor incubation alkali absorption method was used in the soc mineralization experiments the soil samples 10 g dry weight were placed in 150 ml incubation bottles while slowly adding deionized water into the bottles to realize three moisture treatments i e 30 60 and 100 whc all the bottles were covered with plastic wraps to minimize moisture loss when they were pre incubated for 5 days in the dark at 25 1 c a total of 90 soil samples 5 sites 2 depths 3 replicates 3 moistures levels were incubated after 5 days of pre incubation a beaker with 10 ml of 0 1 mol l 1 naoh was placed in each bottle to ensure that co2 was absorbed at a certain incubation time then the bottles were sealed and airtight the incubation of the treated bottles continued to be incubated at 25 1 c in the dark for 30 days the co2 concentrations in the small beakers were measured at days 1 3 7 10 14 21 and 30 the bottles were weighed at each sampling to supplement the lost soil moisture and were then opened for 1 h to ensure that the gas in the bottles was consistent with that in the surrounding air the bottles were subsequently sealed again the co2 concentration was measured by removing the solution from the small beaker and pouring it into the conical flask and then adding 3 ml of 1 mol l 1 bacl2 solution to the conical flask the amount of co2 released was calculated according to the amount of hydrochloric acid used for titration at the same time four blank experiments were set up without soil samples in this study borax was used for calibration the mineralized soc was calculated using the following equation 1 co 2 c v 0 v c hcl 2 1000 44 12 44 1 w m where co2 c represents the amount of co2 c mg kg 1 mineralized at a certain incubation time v0 is the volume of the standard acid ml consumed when titrating the blank sample v is the volume of the standard acid ml consumed when titrating the tested sample chcl is the concentration of the standard acid mol l 1 44 is the molecular mass of co2 12 is the molecular mass of c m is the air dried soil mass g and w is the hygroscopic moisture content of the air dried soil the soc mineralization is mainly the decomposition of active soc in 35 days of incubation including 5 days of pre incubation and thus we used the given first order kinetic eq 2 to fit the soc mineralization processes 2 c t c 0 1 exp kt where ct represents the cumulative amount of co2 c mineralized from the soc at a certain incubation time mg kg 1 c0 represents the potentially mineralized c mg kg 1 and mainly the active carbon pool k is the mineralization rate constant d 1 and t is the incubation time d 2 3 statistical analysis an analysis of variance anova was used to test the soc contents and cumulative amount of co2 c mineralized in the case of different floodplain wetlands soil depth incubation time or moisture treatments which was followed by duncan s test at a significance level of 0 05 for comparing the differences a redundancy analysis rda and pearson correlation analysis were conducted using canoco 4 5 software packages and r3 4 1 cor test function in the stats package tool to reveal the relationships between the soil physico chemical properties and soc mineralization parameters or soc contents a stepwise regression analysis was performed to characterize the relationships between the soc contents and soil physico chemical properties data recording and pre processing were performed by using the excel 2010 software package and all the results were expressed as the mean of the three experiment repetitions anova analysis and stepwise regression analysis were performed using the spss 20 0 software package the graphics were created using originpro 2017 software package 3 results 3 1 soc levels in five floodplain wetlands the soc contents in the topsoils 0 10 cm ranged from 10 01 to 27 31 g kg 1 and followed the order of f5 f0 f1 f10 f100 comparatively topsoils contained higher soc contents than the subsurface soils 10 20 cm p 0 05 table 1 the soc levels in the subsurface soils varied from 3 97 to 10 87 g kg 1 following the order of f0 f5 f100 f1 f10 according to the classification by hu et al 2008 the spatial variabilities of the soc levels generally exhibited medium variations in both topsoils cv 44 63 and subsurface soils cv 41 03 all the soil physico chemical properties except for ec p 0 05 were significantly correlated with the soc contents table 2 the soc was significantly negatively correlated with the bd sand p 0 01 and ph values p 0 05 however a significant positive correlation was observed between the moisture clay silt and soc in this study p 0 01 we conducted a stepwise regression analysis in order to further determine the impacts on the selected soil properties the regression equation is given as follows y soc 21 25x1 bd 0 16x2 silt 3 08x3 ph 65 596 r2 0 983 p 0 01 this means that the bd silt and ph could explain 98 of the variations in the soc contents 3 2 cumulative soc mineralization in five floodplain wetlands the results of the four way anova for the incubation experiment are listed in table 3 the cumulative soc mineralization was significantly affected by the four factors of the sampling zone moisture soil depth and incubation time respectively p 0 01 with the exception of the interactions among the sampling zone moisture and incubation time and among the sampling zone moisture soil depth and incubation time all the interactive effects of these factors had significant impacts on the cumulative soc mineralization p 0 01 fig 2 shows the changes in the cumulative amount of soc mineralized in both soil depths of the five floodplain wetlands for the 30 days of incubation in the laboratory under the three moisture treatments a significant difference p 0 01 in the cumulative mineralized soc was observed for both soil depths in each of the five floodplain wetlands higher soc mineralization was observed in the topsoils as compared with those in the subsurface soils p 0 01 in the topsoils the cumulative mineralized soc followed the order of f5 f0 f1 f10 f100 the highest cumulative mineralized soc for 30 days of incubation in the topsoils occurred in the case of f5 1410 57 mg kg 1 under the 60 whc which was approximately 1 15 1 93 2 01 and 3 57 times as high as those in f0 f1 f10 and f100 respectively in contrast to the topsoils the maximum cumulative mineralized soc 478 77 mg kg 1 in the subsurface soils was observed in the case of f1 under the 30 whc which was 1 12 1 64 times as high as those in the cases of the other wetlands which followed the order of f0 f5 f100 f10 fig 3 shows the effects of the soil moistures on the soc mineralization in five floodplain wetlands in the topsoils of f10 f5 f1 and f0 the highest cumulative co2 c values were observed in the case of the 60 whc moisture treatment followed by the 100 whc whereas the lowest values occurred at 30 whc with the exception of f5 topsoils no significant differences were observed in the cumulative co2 c values between the 30 whc and 100 whc treatments p 0 05 at the 60 whc the cumulative co2 c in the f10 f5 f1 and f0 topsoils were 1 05 1 18 times as high as that at the 100 whc and were 1 14 1 23 times as high as that at the 30 whc the cumulative co2 c values in the f100 topsoils followed the order of 30 whc 429 80 mg c kg 1 soil 60 whc 395 49 mg c kg 1 soil 100 whc 385 29 mg c kg 1 soil in the subsurface soils of each floodplain wetland the cumulative co2 c values were 1 14 1 29 times higher at the 30 whc than those at the 60 or 100 whc p 0 05 3 3 fitting of soc mineralization processes using first order kinetic models as shown in fig 4 the mineralization processes were estimated using the first order kinetic model at each moisture treatment higher levels of cumulative co2 c were observed in the topsoils at all the moisture treatments levels over the incubation period as compared with the subsurface soils meanwhile higher soc mineralization rates were observed for all the soils in the early stage of incubation before 10 days of incubation and the soc mineralization rates then gradually decreased after 10 days of incubation table 4 lists the fitting parameter values for all the moisture treatments for the topsoils and subsurface soils the c0 soc value ranged from 0 036 to 0 111 in this study except for 60 and 100 whc in f0 and f5 the topsoils basically had a lower c0 soc compared to the subsurface soils the values of k inconsistent in these five floodplain wetlands and it was varied from 0 042 to 0 081 all the goodness of fit r2 values of the fitting equations were close to 1 the ct c0 values were less than 1 at three moisture treatments for all the soils and varied from 0 717 to 0 953 moreover in the topsoils the ct c0 values decreased gradually as the soil moistures increased 3 4 relationships between mineralization parameters and soil physico chemical properties fig 5 illustrates the rda analysis results of the soc mineralization parameters and soil physico chemical properties at each of the three moisture treatments for the mineralization parameters i e k c0 and c0 soc at 30 whc treatments 56 6 and 17 3 of the total variance was explained by axis 1 and axis 2 respectively the k values exhibited no significant relationships with ec p 0 05 c0 showed close relationships with bd moisture and soil texture p 0 01 and the c0 soc values were closely correlated with soil ph p 0 01 however at higher moisture treatments 60 and 100 whc no significant relationships p 0 05 were observed between c0 soc and ph while the k values were significantly positively correlated with soil ec p 0 05 c0 exhibited close correlations with all soil physico chemical properties except ec at 60 and 100 whc treatments both the axes explained nearly 77 of the total variance 4 discussion 4 1 effects of flooding frequencies on soc levels in floodplain wetlands the accumulation of soc was an integrated effect of carbon input and mineralization which could be influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors the flooding frequencies could greatly influence soc levels because floods could bring particulate organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon doc and doc could be easily accumulated under flooded and anoxic conditions kim et al 2014 similarly higher water tables inhibit soc decomposition owing to anoxic conditions ise et al 2008 moreover flooding could influence soil organic matter breakdown by altering the composition of soil microbial communities randle boggis et al 2018 floodplain wetlands with higher flooding frequencies e g f0 and f5 contained higher soc levels in both soil layers in this study thus indicating that these two floodplain wetlands could be regarded as soc hotspots among the five floodplain wetlands higher flooding frequencies tend to keep the soil in an oxygen limited condition thus leading to reducing hydrolase activity associated with organic carbon according to the enzymatic latch hypothesis which promotes wetland carbon sequestration hall et al 2014 moreover the highest soc level appeared in f5 not in f0 in the topsoils this might be associated with higher contents of clay and silt in f5 table 1 because large amounts of organic matter could be physically protected in clay and silt aggregates skjemstad et al 1993 significant positive correlations were also observed between clay and soc contents in this study p 0 01 thus indicating that fine particles could contribute to the soc storage in floodplain wetlands moreover lower soc contents in f100 could be ascribed to less vegetation in the past as plant debris was the key source of soil organic matter som formation bai et al 2005 kogelknabner 2002 miltner et al 2012 and plant roots were another important source of soc that was affected by their secretions and mortality ma et al 2016 in contrast f5 has more plant litters and organic carbon sources and thus it has a higher organic carbon content 4 2 effects of flooding frequencies and moisture on soc mineralization moisture is a very important factor for soc mineralization it has a direct effect on soc mineralization process and indirect effect on the relationships between temperature and soc mineralization suh et al 2009 previous study has suggested that the appropriate enhancement of soil moisture aided in increasing the microbes and their activities thus accelerating the mineralization of soc liu et al 2009 a significant correlation was also observed between soc mineralization e g c0 and the initial soil moisture fig 5 however extreme moisture could hinder the emission of mineralized carbon because the activities of microbes would be limited under extremely high moisture conditions and the soil pore space would be filled under flooding conditions that would prevent gas release wang et al 2016b different types of soils had different optimum moistures for soc mineralization tang et al 2017 reported that the amount of mineralized soc was higher at 100 water filled pore space wfps treatment than that at 60 wfps aerobic treatment in paddy soil taggart et al 2012 concluded that the optimum moisture for soc mineralization was nearly 50 saturation for the experimental soil our results showed that before the realization of the optimal soil moisture the cumulative mineralized soc increased as the moistures increased and sequentially kept a constant or a decrease over that moisture treatments which has been supported by previous research results suh et al 2009 wang et al 2013 generally the optimal moisture was 60 whc for the topsoils excluding f100 30 whc for the subsurface soils and 30 whc for f100 in this study this might be ascribed to the differing flooding conditions which could result in the differences in microbial communities in these regions peralta et al 2014 presented that hydrological conditions could directly affect microbial communities and change the functions of microbes moreover the optimum moisture content was determined based on the availability of readily mineralizable organic carbon and the balance of microbial activity ling et al 2006 reported that clay content was positively correlated with the adsorbed doc an increase in moisture and a higher ph promoted the dissolution rate of doc which was beneficial to the soc mineralization andersson et al 2000 tavakkoli et al 2015 however the excessive moisture would inhibit microbial activities owing to the limited of oxygen available as above mentioned davidson et al 2006 as a result the highest cumulative soc mineralization could be achieved at 30 whc under lower clay at a lower doc only small amount of water is required for the dissolution and higher ph conditions the presence of higher cumulative co2 c in the f5 and f1 soils implied that the highest mineralized soc appeared in floodplain wetlands with certain flooding frequencies and not in f0 with permanent flooding conditions this was because permanent flooding could prohibit soc breakdown the flooding processes in floodplain wetlands could be considered to be an alternating drying wetting process which was important for soc decomposition repeated drying rewetting cycles could result in a significant decline in the mineralized c because of the reduction in microbial activity or biomass mikha et al 2005 butterly et al 2009 similarly shi and marschner 2014 also found that frequent drying rewetting cycles may retain the less active microbes and decrease the soc mineralization however gao et al 2016 presented that fluctuations in water pressure due to the drying rewetting cycles made the substrate available for microbes thus accelerating c mineralization in this study the highest flooding frequency f0 was not the most beneficial to soc mineralization whereas the moderate flooding frequencies i e f5 and f1 improved the soc mineralization overall a relatively high flooding frequency f0 f1 and f5 on the subsurface soils was conducive to soc mineralization fig 3 with the exception of subsurface soils in f1 the mineralized carbon in all soils showed similar changes in soc contents indicating that soc mineralization was highly dependent on soc levels which is consistent with previous results li et al 2010 therefore the spatial variabilities of the cumulative soc mineralized in topsoils was greater than those of subsurface soils in the five floodplain wetlands fig 2 4 3 carbon mineralization kinetics the mineralization rate decreased gradually with incubation time and tended to stabilize eventually this was consistent with results by boulogne et al 2016 the initial rapid soc mineralization was associated with the active soc levels because the active soc could be easily to mineralize compared with soil recalcitrant carbon or passive carbon active organic carbon had a short residence time 5 years as compared to passive carbon which implied that it was easily oxidized and decomposed in the presence of microbes wang et al 2015 nath et al 2018 active soc mainly included doc labile organic carbon particulate organic carbon etc xu et al 2011 thus the labile fraction like sugars and proteins was easily decomposed which provided abundant carbon sources and nutrients for soil microbes mulvaney et al 2010 moreover the rewetting of dry soils would affect the microbial activity and increase the decomposition of organic carbon resulting in the birch effect jarvis et al 2007 manzoni et al 2012 therefore we set up pre culture and reduced this interference to simulate the real situation in this study alvarez and alvarez 2000 proved that the exponential model was a good descriptor of soc mineralization as shown in table 4 it could be observed that the fitting results of the soc mineralization for all moisture treatments were ideal r2 values ranging from 0 98 to 1 00 which implies that it is suitable for the first order kinetic models to fit soc mineralization in these floodplain wetlands considering the short incubation time it might only better fit the active carbon changes except for f100 the k value in subsurface soils was greater at 60 whc treatment as compared with 30 whc and 100 whc treatments this may be associated with soil properties e g soil texture and further studies are still necessary to clarify the causes the c0 soc values could reflect the carbon fixation capacity and higher values indicate stronger mineralization abilities li et al 2010 according to the c0 soc values the optimum moisture content of each floodplain wetland could be indirectly identified it could also indicate the proportion of potentially mineralizable c in organic carbon which reflects the carbon quality of organic carbon moscatelli et al 2007 the active fraction is low approximately 6 under all conditions although the topsoil contains more organic carbon carbon quality is slightly lower than that of subsurface soils and it is opposite in f0 and f5 under 60 and 100 whc ct c0 values could reflect the degree of consumption of active carbon comparatively the ct c0 values 1 at three moisture treatments for all soils indicated that microbes predominantly utilized the active organic carbon fraction of the soil moreover a gradual decrease in the ct c0 values for topsoils with increasing soil moistures suggested that the utilization of active soc was higher at 30 whc than those at the 60 whc and 100 whc treatments the values of k were different under different types of hydrogeomorphic zones we compared the k values under six hydrogeomorphic zones with those of floodplain wetlands table 5 generally the k values of soc mineralization in these floodplain wetlands were lower compared with other hydrogeomorphic zones except for peatlands and forest this implied that floodplain wetlands had a stronger carbon sequestration capacity and the carbon storage function of peatlands was the strongest owing to the large amount of carbon fixation under high moisture conditions harenda et al 2018 in contrast the rate constant of the fast k and slow h c pool in urban soils were much higher approximately ten times as high as other types of soils which might be influenced by human disturbances e g horticultural management and urban environmental factors pouyat et al 2006 kaye et al 2005 also found that soil respiration in urban ecosystems was nearly five times higher than that in other hydrogeomorphic zones and urban lawns played a significant role in it 4 4 effects of selected soil properties on soc levels and mineralization soc contents could be influenced by soil properties such as soil texture ph ec etc these properties regulate soc contents through biological and physical effects as mentioned above the clay and silt aggregates could protect soc in terms of biological effects microbes play an important role in the soil and regulated the carbon cycle directly or indirectly six et al 2006 bd and ph affect soc indirectly through soil microbes bd controls soil porosity and aeration which could influence the decomposition and transformation of carbon sources by aerobic microbes the ph values could indirectly affect soc levels by influencing microbial activities cao et al 2016 when the ph was 4 5 the biomass and activity of bacteria and fungi were strongly inhibited by aluminium toxicity to increase the carbon storage rousk et al 2009 moreover a significant inhibition of most microbes was also observed in alkaline soils ph 8 5 chen et al 2004 high soc mineralization was observed in the topsoils as compared with subsurface soils which is consistent with the results of tian et al 2016 this may be associated with the differences in soc and microbes because soc and microbial activities generally declined with depth and thus affected carbon mineralization leeuwen et al 2017 additionally the topsoils contributed to higher carbon emissions which may be associated with higher clay contents table 1 causing greater water retention singh et al 2017 meanwhile a higher ec in subsurface soils table 1 except f100 prohibited soc mineralization as a higher ec could prevent soil microbes from using substrates through the low osmotic potential thapa et al 2017 setia et al 2011 the kinetics parameters of mineralization k is the result of a combination of various environmental factors the effects of soil ph on k were inconsistent mou et al 2018 presented that ph values were negatively correlated with k values in coastal wetlands however cote et al 2000 showed a negative correlation in mineral soil and a positive relationship with k in forest soil in this study the effects of soil ph on k values exhibited a change from a negative correlation to a positive correlation with the increasing moisture fig 5 meanwhile the k values were closely positively correlated with ec at both 60 whc r 0 764 fig 5 and 100 whc r 0 674 fig 5 treatments it is contrary to previous research on the role of salinity in carbon mineralization setia et al 2011 therefore further research is needed 5 conclusions we studied the effects of moisture on soc mineralization in five floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies our results showed that the highest soc levels occurred in the topsoils of the 5 year floodplain wetlands comparatively the subsurface soils of the permanently flooded floodplain wetlands contained the highest soc levels among the five sampling zones followed by the 5 year floodpain wetlands this indicates that appropriate flooding frequencies could improve soc stocks in floodplain wetlands e g the 5 year floodplain wetlands should be given more concerns as hotspot of soc storage in addition to flooding frequencies soc levels in these floodplain wetlands were significantly correlated with bd silt and ph the topsoils exhibited significantly higher soc contents than subsurface soils but the proportion of active carbon was opposite except in f0 and f5 similarly the cumulative co2 c in topsoils were also higher as compared with the subsurface soils for the three moisture treatments the optimum soil moisture for soc mineralization was 60 whc in the topsoils of these floodplain wetlands excluding f100 and 30 whc in subsurface soils of all five floodplain wetlands therefore the soc mineralization processes could be manipulated by controlling soil moisture in our incubation experiment the first order kinetic equations could better fit soc mainly the active carbon pool mineralization processes the fitting parameters showed that k values were significantly correlated with ec p 0 05 under higher moisture conditions i e 60 and 100 whc while the c0 values showed significant correlations with bd initial soil moisture and soil texture p 0 01 under all moisture treatments the findings of this work could provide a guidance for carbon conservation and management of floodplain wetlands however further studies are still required to be focused on the interactive effects of moisture temperature ph etc on soc mineralization and microbial mechanisms of soc

6489,the strong saline water intrusion in the north branch of the yangtze estuary threatens the freshwater supply of the region in winter half year strong northerly winds have been identified as a factor increasing saline water intrusion however there are few studies on this subject and the mechanisms of winds influencing saline water intrusion are still unclear in the present contribution we investigate the variation trend of strong wind events during cold outbreaks in winter half year and their correlation with saline water intrusion in the north branch together with the processes and mechanism of strong winds increasing saline water intrusion based on observations and an analytical salt water intrusion model the results indicate that the strong northerly and northeasterly wind events and saline water intrusion in the north branch have similar variation trends in 1994 2008 both being relatively weak in the 1990s but being intensified dramatically after 1999 the significant correlation between these two trends suggests that the increase in strong wind events may be one of the factors inducing the enhanced saline water intrusion observations and model output show that the strong northerly and northeasterly winds can induce dramatic water level setup increase of flood tide current velocities decrease of ebb tide velocities and decrease of freshwater inflow into the north branch these changes in combination cause the enhanced intensity of saline water intrusion the ekman transport from remote winds results in water level setup at the estuary mouth pumping more seawater into the north branch which should be a dominant mechanism inducing the change in hydrodynamics and increase of saline water intrusion keywords saline water intrusion strong winds cold outbreaks yangtze estuary 1 introduction in non tidal and micro tidal estuaries wind can significantly affect hydrodynamics and salt transport in recent decades many scholars have researched the effects of wind on the subtidal variability and salinity regime in estuaries and bays over the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea e g great south bay wong and wilson 1984 delaware estuary wong and garvine 1984 wong and moses hall 1998 lower patos lagoon estuary costa et al 1988 hudson river estuary ralston et al 2008 rio de la plata estuary simionato et al 2007 pamlico river estuary xu et al 2008 st johns river estuary giardino 2009 atchafalaya bay li et al 2011 and tiber river mouth manca et al 2014 in meso tidal and macro tidal estuaries river discharge and tidal dynamics are believed to represent the primary forcing the effects of wind are usually ignored and there are few related studies including those by bola√±os et al 2013 on the influence of wind on the circulation of the dee a macro tidal estuary and by reyes merlo et al 2015 on the impacts of wind conditions on the salt intrusion in the guadalquivir a meso tidal estuary the yangtze estuary is a meso tidal partially mixed estuary with complex topography three order bifurcations and four outlets towards the sea fig 1 among the branches the north branch is a tidally dominated well mixed channel due to its special topography i e almost perpendicular to the main channel south branch and the trumpet channel shape the freshwater inflow ratio is very small and the tidal range is large resulting in the strongest saline water intrusion among the branches in dry season the saline water in the north branch often spill over into the south branch during spring and intermediate tides which is the main problem threatening freshwater supply around the estuary because there are several reservoirs for urban water supply along the south branch river discharge tidal intensity and topography interact controlling the saline water intrusion pattern in the north branch of the yangtze estuary in recent years strong winds were also found as a factor influencing saline water intrusion li et al 2012 found abnormal salinity increases at the chongxi station a fixed station measuring salinity located at the northern bank of the south branch during 10 12 november 2009 neap tide and 11 12 february 2010 intermediate tide plot a in fig 2 the saline water at chongxi originated from the north branch in january 2014 zhang et al 2014 also observed a strange phenomenon saline water intrusion in the north branch during neap tide was much stronger than during spring tide plots b and c in fig 2 it can be seen from plot d in fig 2 that during and around the neap tide on 10 12 november 2009 the corresponding river discharges at datong station the values between dashed lines 7 days in advance were almost the same i e around 14200 m3 s but the salinity at chongxi increased suddenly during 10 12 november 2009 the discharges 7 days in advance were used because datong is located some 700 km upstream of the river mouth and 6 9 days are usually regarded as the time required for water to travel from datong to the estuary xu and yuan 1994 gu et al 2003 cao et al 2006 li et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 during the intermediate tide on 11 12 february 2010 the river discharges were larger than during the neighboring neap tide and previous intermediate and spring tides but the salinity at chongxi increased sharply as well even higher than during the previous spring tide during the neap tide on 8 9 january 2014 the corresponding river discharges were similar to the spring tide on 1 2 january the values between dashed lines in plot e of fig 2 however the salinity along the north branch was much higher than during spring tide both li et al 2012 and zhang et al 2014 proposed that the strong northerly winds were responsible for the abnormal salinity increases wind patterns around the yangtze estuary show east asian monsoon characteristics the northerly winds are the prevailing winds in winter half year particularly between november and march resulting from the passages of cold wave and strong cold air this period is exactly in accordance with the strong saline water intrusion in the yangtze estuary in terms of the effects of wind there have been few related studies xue et al 2009 wu et al 2010 and li et al 2012 carried out numerical experiments to study the effects of wind on the saline water intrusion li et al 2012 modeled the abnormal salinity at chongxi station during 10 12 november 2009 and 11 12 february 2010 and investigated the impacts of wind direction and speed on saltwater intrusion zhang et al 2014 presented the observations of abnormally strong saline water intrusion during neap tide on 8 9 january 2014 compared with the spring tide and discussed the impact factors most studies were based on numerical experiments using average wind conditions which is different from the real situation the processes of winds affecting saline water intrusion or how do the factors controlling saline water intrusion change influenced by winds are still poorly understood in the yangtze estuary the strong winds should be most important could induce obvious effects the aim of this study is to investigate the variation trend of strong wind events in winter half year and their correlation with saline water intrusion in the north branch and to reveal the processes and mechanism of strong winds increasing saline water intrusion based on observations and model analysis 2 data sets used in the study the data used in this study include salinity river discharge tidal level wind observations temperature tidal current velocity and water depth the salinity tidal current velocities and wind conditions at locations b1 b2 and b3 were measured on 1 2 and 7 9 january 2014 the river discharges at the datong station were provided by the hydrological administration of anhui province the tidal levels at the qinglonggang station were provided by the jiangsu province hydrology and water resources investigation bureau the wind observations the average speed and direction within 2 min with intervals of three hours at the shengsi station in 1994 2008 were obtained from the national centers for environmental information ncei the frequency and total durations of saline water intrusion at the chenhang reservoir in 1994 2008 are from paper of tang et al 2011 the temperature with intervals of three hours at shengsi in november 2009 february 2010 and january 2014 were obtained from the national centers for environmental information ncei as well the wind observations the average speed and direction within 2 min with intervals of one hour at the dongtan station in november 2009 february 2010 and january 2014 were obtained from the state key laboratory of estuarine and coastal research water depths of the north branch measured in 2012 were obtained from the state key laboratory of estuarine and coastal research the stations and locations of measurements are shown in fig 1 3 methods of analyses 3 1 processing of tidal level and tidal range data for eliminating sharp tidal oscillations with a period shorter than 25 h the low pass filter was used to obtain subtidal water levels and tidal ranges in order to obtain the net setup and setdown of water level and tidal range affected by winds excluding other factors the emd empirical mode decomposition method was used to decompose tidal levels and tidal ranges 3 1 1 the emd method the emd empirical mode decomposition method was proposed by huang et al 1998 the processes are as follows the first step is to identify the extrema all the local maxima and minima from the original data all the local maxima are connected by a cubic spline line as the upper envelope and all the local minima are connected by a cubic spline line as the lower envelope the upper and lower envelopes should cover all the data between them their mean is designated as m 1 and the difference between the data and m 1 is the first component h 1 i e 1 x t m 1 h 1 in the second sifting process h 1 is treated as the data then 2 h 1 m 11 h 11 this sifting procedure is repeated for j times 3 h 1 j 1 m 1 j h 1 j then c 1 h 1j is the first imf intrinsic mode function component from the data c 1 is separated from the data by 4 x t c 1 r 1 the residue r 1 is treated as the new data and subjected to the same sifting process as described above this procedure can be repeated on all the subsequent ri s and the result is 5 r 1 c 2 r 2 r n 1 c n r n finally we obtain n imf components and residue r n x t c 1 c 2 c 3 c n r n the imf should have two properties 1 throughout the whole length of a single imf the number of extrema and the number of zero crossings must either be equal or differ at most by one and 2 at any data location the mean value of the envelope defined by the local maxima and the envelope defined by the local minima is zero the total number of imfs of a data set is close to and might be fewer than log2n with n the number of total data points wu and huang 2009 there are two factors influencing the results one is stopping criterion of producing an imf component the stopping criterion for the sifting used in the decompositions is a modified cauchy type criterion c r i m ij 2 i h ij 2 where h ij is the prototype ith imf after j rounds of sifting and mij is the mean of the upper and lower envelopes of hij in the decompositions a value of 0 0001 was selected for cr wu and huang 2009 the other factor influencing the decomposed results is the end effects we use the similar method proposed by wu and huang 2009 to reduce the end effects in addition we extended the data at two sides respectively which is the best way resolving this problem 3 1 2 obtaining net setup and setdown of water level and tidal range taking tidal levels in january 2014 for example eight imf components are obtained after decomposition which are presented in fig 3 imf1 and imf2 are clearly the components of semi diurnal tides and diurnal tides respectively imf5 is the component of half monthly variation of tides its peaks and valleys are in accordance with spring tides and neap tides respectively imf6 is the component of monthly variation of tides its peaks and valleys correspond with the relatively strong and weak spring tides respectively because there are errors at the two sides i e the end effects the correspondence is relatively poor at the two sides imf7 and imf8 should represent longer periodic variations therefore imf3 and imf4 between diurnal tide component and half monthly tide component should contain components of wind effects the previous studies showed that 2 3 and 4 5 days are the main periods of low frequency variations of water level around the yangtze estuary which are in accordance with the wind s variations zhao and cao 1987 chen and su 1991 the imf3 and imf4 components correspond to the 2 3 days and 4 5 days periods respectively the sum of imf3 and imf4 is regarded as the net water level setup and setdown the situation for november 2009 was a little bit different the subtidal water levels were abnormal relative to the normal tidal variations low in spring tide and high in neap tide because the water level setdown and setup exactly occurred in spring tide and neap tide respectively which can be seen from plot a in fig 7 the half monthly tide and monthly tide components are not correctly decomposed with peaks and valleys in neap tide and spring tide respectively the same as the subtidal water levels therefore imf 5 and imf 6 are included as well to obtain the net water level setup for the tidal range since all data looked normal the same as the tidal variation the data processing was similar to that for the tidal level 3 2 analytical model for saline water intrusion for better analyzing the process of wind s effects on the saline water intrusion an analytical model for alluvial estuaries developed by savenije 1986 1989 2005 was used this model has been successfully applied to the yangtze estuary by zhang et al 2011 3 2 1 summary of the model the shape of alluvial estuaries can be described by the following exponential functions in a multiple reach estuary in estuaries where the geometry of channels cannot be described by a single exponential function multiple reaches can be used a i a 0 exp x a i i 1 6 a i a i 1 exp x x i 1 a i i 1 b i b 0 exp x b i i 1 7 b i b i 1 exp x x i 1 b i i 1 h i h 0 exp x a i b i a i b i i 1 8 h i h i 1 exp x x i 1 a i b i a i b i i 1 where ai bi and hi are the cross sectional area width and depth at location x from the mouth respectively a 0 b 0 and h 0 are the area width and depth at the mouth i represents the reach number i 1 2 3 beginning from the mouth ai and bi are the area and width convergence length for reach i x i 1 is the inflection point and a i 1 b i 1 and h i 1 are the cross sectional area width and depth respectively at the inflection point the cross sectional average salt balance equations for high water slack hws low water slack lws and tidal average ta situations can be written as 9 s s f c s x where s is the steady state salinity for three different states of hws lws or ta and sf is the fresh water salinity the coefficient c is an x dependent coefficient equal to the ratio between the dispersion coefficient and the freshwater velocity 10 c a q f d where qf is the river discharge which is negative since the positive x axis points upstream d is the dispersion coefficient for the hws lws or ta condition which can be calculated by means of the following equation based on previous work by van der burgh 1972 11 d x k q f a where k is van der burgh s coefficient taken as a value between 0 and 1 combining eqs 9 11 the equation for the longitudinal variation of the salinity in the estuary is obtained 12 s s f s 0 s f d d 0 1 k where s 0 is the boundary salinity at the estuary mouth under the hws lws or ta condition and sf is the salinity of the river water at the upstream boundary integration of eq 11 in combination with an exponentially varying cross section yields the expression for the dispersion along the estuary d x d 0 1 Œ≤ i exp x a i 1 i 1 13 d x d i 1 1 Œ≤ i exp x x i 1 a i 1 i 1 where 14 Œ≤ i k a i q f d 0 a 0 i 1 Œ≤ i k a i q f d i 1 a i 1 i 1 where Œ≤i is the dispersion reduction rate at reach i for hws lws or ta d i 1 is the dispersion coefficient at the inflection point for hws lws or ta d0 is the boundary condition at the estuary mouth x 0 for the hws lws or ta condition which can be calculated by means of the following predictive equation based on observations in real estuaries a predictive expression for the dispersion d 0 hws was obtained by savenije 2005 15 d 0 hws 1400 e 0 œÖ 0 h 0 a n r 0 5 where nr is the estuarine richardson number which is defined as 16 n r Œ¥ œÅ œÅ gh q f t a 0 e 0 œÖ 0 2 where œÅ is the density at the mouth and Œ¥œÅ is the density difference between ocean and river water t is the tidal period e 0 and œÖ 0 are the tidal excursion and tidal velocity amplitude at the estuary mouth respectively e 0 œÖ 0 t œÄ based on lagrangean reasoning d 0 ta and d 0 lws can be computed as savenije 1989 17 d 0 ta d hws x e 2 exp e 2 a 18 d 0 lws d hws x e exp e a where d hws x is determined with eqs 13 16 and e is the tidal excursion using the above equations the longitudinal salinity distribution in the estuary can be calculated for hws lws or ta 3 2 2 determination of the input parameters the topographical parameters ai and bi are determined by means of fitting topographic data to the eqs 6 8 the van der burgh s coefficient k is an important parameter which is obtained by calibrating the computed saline water intrusion curve against the measurements it is usually regarded as constant independent of river discharge and tide the tidal velocity amplitude at the estuary mouth œÖ 0 was determined based on measurements the tidal excursion e 0 was calculated based on equation e 0 œÖ 0 t œÄ then with the salinity at the mouth and the river discharge input the longitudinal salinity distribution along the channel can be calculated based on equations 12 18 the model was calibrated using measurements on 1 2 january 2014 4 results 4 1 variation trend and correlation of strong wind events and saline water intrusion in winter half year the previous studies were mostly based on the wind conditions at dongtan station fig 4 shows the wind vectors at shengsi and dongtan stations in november 2009 february 2010 and january 2014 the wind directions at two stations were basically accordant but the wind speeds at shengsi were larger on 10 12 november 2009 11 12 february 2010 and 8 9 january 2014 three periods during which abnormal saline water intrusion occurred the winds were mostly from north or northeast with the speeds continuously exceeding 10 m s and a maximum of higher than 15 m s at the shengsi station on 10 12 november 2009 not only the northerly winds but also the northeasterly winds were dominant they often occurred together during a single strong wind event because there is a lack of long term data at the dongtan station the statistics of strong northerly and northeasterly wind events at the shengsi station for winter half year were used for analyzing the variation trend and correlation with the saline water intrusion here a strong wind event is defined as all wind speeds 10 m s with a maximum 15 m s and the duration 12 h the chenhang reservoir is located at the south branch supplying freshwater for shanghai salinity here is controlled by the dispersion of saline water that originates from the north branch as such the situation of saline water intrusion at chenhang represents an index for saline water intrusion in the north branch according to statistics for the period 1994 2008 saline water intrusion at chenhang was weak before 1999 but it had dramatically increased since 1999 both in terms of frequency and duration plot a in fig 5 it can be seen from plots b and c of fig 5 that the frequencies and durations of strong northerly and northeasterly wind events had similar variation trend in the same period 1994 2008 low in the 1990 s but increased dramatically after 1999 for the events with duration both less than 24 h and more than 24 h fig 6 shows the good correlation of frequencies between saline water intrusion and strong northerly and northeasterly wind events in 1994 2008 for the events with duration longer than 12 h the correlation coefficient was 0 85 this suggests that the increase of strong northerly and northeasterly wind events may be one factor inducing the increase of saline water intrusion in the north branch of the yangtze estuary after 1999 4 2 processes of strong northerly and northeasterly winds increasing saline water intrusion water depth tidal range tidal currents and freshwater inflow are the main factors controlling saline water intrusion for the north branch of the yangtze estuary these are all affected by the condition of strong northerly and northeasterly winds 4 2 1 water level setup the net water level setup and setdown at the qinglonggang station based on emd subtidal water levels based on low pass filter and wind conditions in november 2009 february 2010 and january 2014 are presented in fig 7 the net water level setup and setdown based on emd plots d e f were in accordance with the variation of subtidal water levels plots a b c and also basically corresponded with the variation of wind conditions plots g o the water level setups mostly corresponded with the northerly and northeasterly winds which was in accordance with the decrease of temperature influenced by cold air particularly for the strong winds plots g i during 10 12 november 2009 neap tide 11 12 february 2010 intermediate tide and 8 9 january 2014 neap tide the three periods during which abnormally strong saline water intrusion occurred the water levels all set up dramatically corresponding with strong northerly and northeasterly winds the highest wind speed 20 m s agreed with the highest water level setup of 0 55 m during 10 12 november 2009 in the three periods in addition during 16 17 november 2009 quasi spring tide water levels surged dramatically as well corresponding with the strong northeasterly winds with a maximum speed of 18 m s at shengsi fig 2 shows that the salinity values around 17 november 2009 was much higher than those during the previous spring tide around 3 4 november at the chongxi station although on that day the tidal range was smaller and the corresponding yangtze river discharge was relatively large the salinity increase was probably induced by the strong northeasterly winds as well water level set up implies water depth increase which is a factor inducing increase of saline water intrusion 4 2 2 limited change of tidal range the setup and setdown of tidal range at the qinglonggang station in november 2009 february 2010 and january 2014 based on emd are presented in plots a c of fig 8 which generally corresponded with the variations of subtidal tidal range in plots d f in the subtidal tidal ranges because the difference between spring tide and neap tide is large the small changes were not obvious particularly during neap tide the setup and setdown of tidal range resulted from the change of water level depending on the water level setup or setdown during flood and ebb the changes of tidal range were generally small because the water level set up or set down during both flood and ebb during the several strong wind events the tidal ranges had both setups and setdowns the relatively large setups and setdowns usually occurred at the beginning or end of the events resulting from the sudden setup and setdown during flood or ebb with a maximum setup of 0 16 m and a maximum setdown 0 25 m in november 2009 and january 2014 on 11 12 february 2010 the situation was slightly different the tidal range set up during the whole event with a maximum of 0 25 m which can be seen also from the subtidal tidal ranges plot e this is likely the result of the larger setups during the flood phase of the tide than during the ebb 4 2 3 flood tide current enhanced and ebb tide current reduced in the north branch of the yangtze estuary the tidal current velocity during flood tide is usually larger than during ebb tide in spring tide in neap tide the tidal current velocity during flood tide is generally smaller than during ebb tide however on 8 january 2014 neap tide during strong northerly winds the tidal current velocities during flood tide were larger than during ebb tide at locations b1 b2 and b3 fig 9 particularly in the first tidal cycle of b1 the much smaller velocities during ebb tide can be easily seen the strong winds began at 04 00 or 05 00 i e the velocities during the ebb tide were affected by strong winds in the second tidal cycle of b2 the maximum velocity during the ebb was larger than during the flood which corresponded with the smaller tidal range and much weaker winds this observation suggests that the velocities on 8 9 january 2014 were affected by the strong northerly winds whereby the flood tide velocities increased and the ebb tide velocities decreased this induced the increase of saline water intrusion in november 2009 and february 2010 no measured current data were available 4 2 4 decrease of freshwater inflow due to the special topography the ratio of freshwater inflow into the north branch is very small less than 1 of the yangtze river discharge in recent years chen and chen 2003 yu et al 2003 tan and wang 2004 zhang et al 2011 the saline water intrusion in the north branch is sensitive to the freshwater inflow particularly during dry season the strong northerly and northeasterly winds set up water levels strengthen flood currents and reduce ebb currents which block freshwater inflow into the north branch and further downstream this may be an important mechanism inducing abnormally strong saline water intrusion during strong northerly and northeasterly winds on 10 12 november 2009 11 12 february 2010 and 8 9 january 2014 the longitudinal salinity distributions along the north branch on 1 2 spring tide and 8 9 neap tide january 2014 were computed based on the analytical model during neap tide water depth tidal velocity amplitude and ratio of freshwater inflow were possibly influenced by strong winds which were considered in the calculation of salinity water depth hi was set to increase 0 3 m based on the net water level setup the tidal velocity amplitude at the estuary mouth œÖ 0 was determined based on observations the topography of the north branch parameters used in the model and computed salinity are shown in fig 10 table1 and fig 11 respectively fig 11 shows that the computed salinity agreed with the measured salinity well except for the low salinity at b3 in the upper reach during neap tide for the computed results the input freshwater inflow into the north branch during neap tide is much smaller than for spring tide table1 the absence of high low variations of salinity during flood and ebb tides almost equal high salinity in the middle and lower reaches and very high salinity during flood tide in the upper reach all confirmed very small freshwater inflow however there was no much difference between the corresponding yangtze river discharges during spring and neap tides fig 2 table1 if the ratio of freshwater inflow during neap tide were not changed the same as the spring tide the salinity would be much lower dashed lines in fig 11 only the high salinity at b1 in the lower reach and low salinity at b3 in the upper reach can fit the measurements this suggests the effect of strong northerly winds inducing a decrease of freshwater inflow into the north branch the poor agreement between computed results and measurements for the low salinity at b3 in the upper reach during neap tide is due to the fact that b3 is close to the south branch where the salinity is largely affected by freshwater during the ebb during the flood the tidal current is dominant the salinity can reach a high value which is why the saline water can spill over into the south branch if the north branch were a single channel estuary the saline water intrusion could reach around 130 km during the flood and the low salinity at b3 would be much higher for the same freshwater inflow 4 3 mechanism of wind forcing on saline water intrusion the effects of wind on the hydrodynamics and saline water intrusion may come from two sides the effects of remote winds over the continental shelf and the effects of local winds over the estuary the alongshore winds over the continental shelf could generate ekman transport toward or off the estuary and coastal area inducing coastal sea level fluctuations and subtidal exchange between the estuarine and shelf waters snedden et al 2007 ralston et al 2008 in the yangtze estuary the events of abnormal salinity increase in the north branch all correspond with alongshore winds i e the northerly and northeasterly winds the resulted ekman transport by winds over the continental shelf forces seawater towards the estuary mouth this process results in water level setup outside the estuary mouth and an enhanced seawater transport into the estuary which has been proposed by wu et al 2010 and li et al 2012 based on numerical experiments in addition to pumping more seawater into the estuary during flood tide this process blocks water out of the estuary during ebb tide inducing water level setup during both flood and ebb tides the increase of current velocity during flood tide and decrease of velocity during ebb tide the local northeasterly winds are exactly parallel to the upper reach of the north branch which could play some role as well the numerical experiment by li et al 2012 confirmed that the water mass spilling over into the south branch from the north branch under a northeasterly wind condition was larger than under a northerly wind condition however it can be seen from fig 12 that the wind speeds inside the estuary were much smaller than outside during the strong winds event of 8 9 january 2014 affected by the terrestrial topography although the wind directions were similar the wind speeds at b2 and b3 in the middle and upper reaches were smaller than 4 m s in half and even longer period of the strong winds event this suggests that the effect of local winds is limited the shengsi station outside the estuary is also a land based station on the shengsi island the winds over the sea should be stronger this also suggests that the effect from remote winds was dominant 5 discussions 5 1 effects of wind on hydrodynamics song et al 2011 studied the effects of wind on water level and tidal range at qinglonggang station based on numerical experiments and multi years average wind conditions at half month mean level their results indicate that the winds have small effect on water level and almost no effect on tidal range the water level setups influenced by the northerly winds are generally smaller than 0 05 m our results based on observations show that during the strong northerly and northeasterly winds the water level set up dramatically with a maximum of 0 55 m at the qinglonggang station during 10 12 september 2009 this dramatic water level setup can occur on neap intermediate or spring tide this result is different from the numerical experiment result by song et al 2011 too their result indicates that the water level setup is relatively strong during neap tides but no obvious setup or even setdown occurs during spring tides as a result of the same northerly wind conditions on neap tides the tidal intensity is weak so the effects of wind could be larger on spring tides the situation is vice versa however observations show that if the winds are strong the effect of winds is obvious as well during spring tides e g 16 17 november 2009 with a maximum wind speed of 18 m s at the shengsi station as to the tidal range our results indicate that the variations during strong winds are not much with both setup and setdown however the magnitude is much larger than the result from song et al 2011 in some cases relatively large setups occurred such as those on 11 12 february 2010 with a maximum of 0 25 m the relationship between wind and hydrodynamics should be nonlinear so additional work is needed to confirm the results including the variations of tidal current velocity which were based on a limited data set 5 2 mechanisms related to wind forcing for the effects of wind on subtidal variability of hydrodynamics and saline water intrusion the ekman transport resulting from remote alongshore winds is believed to be the main mechanism in many estuaries such as great south bay wong and wilson 1984 delaware estuary wong and garvine 1984 ross et al 2015 mississippi river deltaic estuary snedden et al 2007 keum river estuary son et al 2007 chesapeake bay guo and valle levinson 2008 northern gulf of mexico estuary kim and park 2012 and narragansett bay estuary pfeiffer herbert et al 2015 in the yangtze estuary this mechanism was also proposed by wu et al 2010 and li et al 2012 garvine 1985 believed that the effect of remote winds is larger than local winds because most estuaries are short relative to the low subtidal estuarine wave length our results indicate that the remote winds outside the estuary are much stronger than the local winds over the estuary which may represent another reason for the dominance of remote effects this result also suggests that the replacement of local winds by remote winds or replacement of remote winds by local winds in some previous research is unreasonable in micro tidal estuaries stratification is more common whereby intrusion of seawater takes place in the form of a salt wedge in that case gravitational circulation and nonlinear pumping effect are the main mechanisms zyryanov 2013 zyryanov et al 2015 in those estuaries the along channel local winds could apparently affect the saline water intrusion down estuary and up estuary winds increase and curb the circulation respectively resulting in an increase and decrease of saline water intrusion as is the cases in the lower patos lagoon estuary costa et al 1988 and the pamlico river estuary xu et al 2008 in addition outside the yangtze estuary there are alongshore currents from the north in winter season during the strong northerly winds the alongshore currents are intensified riedlinger and jacobs 2000 and some studies suggest that the water level setup forced by strong winds can propagate southward in the form of kelvin waves ko et al 2003 yang et al 2016 these two factors may also induce the water level setup at the estuary mouth influencing the hydrodynamics and saline water intrusion 6 conclusions the statistics of the 1994 2008 data sets show that the frequency and duration of saline water intrusion in the north branch of the yangtze estuary were weak in the 1990s but they had dramatically increased since 1999 the strong northerly and northeasterly wind events around the estuary during cold outbreaks in winter half year show the similar variation trend in both frequency and duration low in the 1990s but increased dramatically after 1999 in addition to this agreement in trend the correlation between strong wind events and saline water intrusion is also significant this suggests that the increase of strong northerly and northeasterly wind events may be one of the factors inducing the increase of saline water intrusion in the north branch of the yangtze estuary in situ observations show that strong northerly and northeasterly winds can induce dramatic water level setup in the north branch of the yangtze estuary which can occur in neap intermediate or spring tide the tidal range is relatively less affected due to the water level setup during both flood and ebb tides the current velocities are also affected whereby the flood tide velocities increased and ebb tide velocities decreased in addition the results of the analytical saline water intrusion model suggest that the freshwater inflow into the north branch decreases considerably these changes in combination cause the intensified saline water intrusion during strong northerly and northeasterly winds ekman transport from remote winds over the continental shelf areas forces seawater towards the coastal area and estuary mouth which induces water level setup at the mouth pumping more seawater into the estuary this should be a primary mechanism for the change of hydrodynamics and increase of saline water intrusion the much stronger winds outside than inside the estuary also suggest the dominant effect of remote winds

6489,the strong saline water intrusion in the north branch of the yangtze estuary threatens the freshwater supply of the region in winter half year strong northerly winds have been identified as a factor increasing saline water intrusion however there are few studies on this subject and the mechanisms of winds influencing saline water intrusion are still unclear in the present contribution we investigate the variation trend of strong wind events during cold outbreaks in winter half year and their correlation with saline water intrusion in the north branch together with the processes and mechanism of strong winds increasing saline water intrusion based on observations and an analytical salt water intrusion model the results indicate that the strong northerly and northeasterly wind events and saline water intrusion in the north branch have similar variation trends in 1994 2008 both being relatively weak in the 1990s but being intensified dramatically after 1999 the significant correlation between these two trends suggests that the increase in strong wind events may be one of the factors inducing the enhanced saline water intrusion observations and model output show that the strong northerly and northeasterly winds can induce dramatic water level setup increase of flood tide current velocities decrease of ebb tide velocities and decrease of freshwater inflow into the north branch these changes in combination cause the enhanced intensity of saline water intrusion the ekman transport from remote winds results in water level setup at the estuary mouth pumping more seawater into the north branch which should be a dominant mechanism inducing the change in hydrodynamics and increase of saline water intrusion keywords saline water intrusion strong winds cold outbreaks yangtze estuary 1 introduction in non tidal and micro tidal estuaries wind can significantly affect hydrodynamics and salt transport in recent decades many scholars have researched the effects of wind on the subtidal variability and salinity regime in estuaries and bays over the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea e g great south bay wong and wilson 1984 delaware estuary wong and garvine 1984 wong and moses hall 1998 lower patos lagoon estuary costa et al 1988 hudson river estuary ralston et al 2008 rio de la plata estuary simionato et al 2007 pamlico river estuary xu et al 2008 st johns river estuary giardino 2009 atchafalaya bay li et al 2011 and tiber river mouth manca et al 2014 in meso tidal and macro tidal estuaries river discharge and tidal dynamics are believed to represent the primary forcing the effects of wind are usually ignored and there are few related studies including those by bola√±os et al 2013 on the influence of wind on the circulation of the dee a macro tidal estuary and by reyes merlo et al 2015 on the impacts of wind conditions on the salt intrusion in the guadalquivir a meso tidal estuary the yangtze estuary is a meso tidal partially mixed estuary with complex topography three order bifurcations and four outlets towards the sea fig 1 among the branches the north branch is a tidally dominated well mixed channel due to its special topography i e almost perpendicular to the main channel south branch and the trumpet channel shape the freshwater inflow ratio is very small and the tidal range is large resulting in the strongest saline water intrusion among the branches in dry season the saline water in the north branch often spill over into the south branch during spring and intermediate tides which is the main problem threatening freshwater supply around the estuary because there are several reservoirs for urban water supply along the south branch river discharge tidal intensity and topography interact controlling the saline water intrusion pattern in the north branch of the yangtze estuary in recent years strong winds were also found as a factor influencing saline water intrusion li et al 2012 found abnormal salinity increases at the chongxi station a fixed station measuring salinity located at the northern bank of the south branch during 10 12 november 2009 neap tide and 11 12 february 2010 intermediate tide plot a in fig 2 the saline water at chongxi originated from the north branch in january 2014 zhang et al 2014 also observed a strange phenomenon saline water intrusion in the north branch during neap tide was much stronger than during spring tide plots b and c in fig 2 it can be seen from plot d in fig 2 that during and around the neap tide on 10 12 november 2009 the corresponding river discharges at datong station the values between dashed lines 7 days in advance were almost the same i e around 14200 m3 s but the salinity at chongxi increased suddenly during 10 12 november 2009 the discharges 7 days in advance were used because datong is located some 700 km upstream of the river mouth and 6 9 days are usually regarded as the time required for water to travel from datong to the estuary xu and yuan 1994 gu et al 2003 cao et al 2006 li et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 during the intermediate tide on 11 12 february 2010 the river discharges were larger than during the neighboring neap tide and previous intermediate and spring tides but the salinity at chongxi increased sharply as well even higher than during the previous spring tide during the neap tide on 8 9 january 2014 the corresponding river discharges were similar to the spring tide on 1 2 january the values between dashed lines in plot e of fig 2 however the salinity along the north branch was much higher than during spring tide both li et al 2012 and zhang et al 2014 proposed that the strong northerly winds were responsible for the abnormal salinity increases wind patterns around the yangtze estuary show east asian monsoon characteristics the northerly winds are the prevailing winds in winter half year particularly between november and march resulting from the passages of cold wave and strong cold air this period is exactly in accordance with the strong saline water intrusion in the yangtze estuary in terms of the effects of wind there have been few related studies xue et al 2009 wu et al 2010 and li et al 2012 carried out numerical experiments to study the effects of wind on the saline water intrusion li et al 2012 modeled the abnormal salinity at chongxi station during 10 12 november 2009 and 11 12 february 2010 and investigated the impacts of wind direction and speed on saltwater intrusion zhang et al 2014 presented the observations of abnormally strong saline water intrusion during neap tide on 8 9 january 2014 compared with the spring tide and discussed the impact factors most studies were based on numerical experiments using average wind conditions which is different from the real situation the processes of winds affecting saline water intrusion or how do the factors controlling saline water intrusion change influenced by winds are still poorly understood in the yangtze estuary the strong winds should be most important could induce obvious effects the aim of this study is to investigate the variation trend of strong wind events in winter half year and their correlation with saline water intrusion in the north branch and to reveal the processes and mechanism of strong winds increasing saline water intrusion based on observations and model analysis 2 data sets used in the study the data used in this study include salinity river discharge tidal level wind observations temperature tidal current velocity and water depth the salinity tidal current velocities and wind conditions at locations b1 b2 and b3 were measured on 1 2 and 7 9 january 2014 the river discharges at the datong station were provided by the hydrological administration of anhui province the tidal levels at the qinglonggang station were provided by the jiangsu province hydrology and water resources investigation bureau the wind observations the average speed and direction within 2 min with intervals of three hours at the shengsi station in 1994 2008 were obtained from the national centers for environmental information ncei the frequency and total durations of saline water intrusion at the chenhang reservoir in 1994 2008 are from paper of tang et al 2011 the temperature with intervals of three hours at shengsi in november 2009 february 2010 and january 2014 were obtained from the national centers for environmental information ncei as well the wind observations the average speed and direction within 2 min with intervals of one hour at the dongtan station in november 2009 february 2010 and january 2014 were obtained from the state key laboratory of estuarine and coastal research water depths of the north branch measured in 2012 were obtained from the state key laboratory of estuarine and coastal research the stations and locations of measurements are shown in fig 1 3 methods of analyses 3 1 processing of tidal level and tidal range data for eliminating sharp tidal oscillations with a period shorter than 25 h the low pass filter was used to obtain subtidal water levels and tidal ranges in order to obtain the net setup and setdown of water level and tidal range affected by winds excluding other factors the emd empirical mode decomposition method was used to decompose tidal levels and tidal ranges 3 1 1 the emd method the emd empirical mode decomposition method was proposed by huang et al 1998 the processes are as follows the first step is to identify the extrema all the local maxima and minima from the original data all the local maxima are connected by a cubic spline line as the upper envelope and all the local minima are connected by a cubic spline line as the lower envelope the upper and lower envelopes should cover all the data between them their mean is designated as m 1 and the difference between the data and m 1 is the first component h 1 i e 1 x t m 1 h 1 in the second sifting process h 1 is treated as the data then 2 h 1 m 11 h 11 this sifting procedure is repeated for j times 3 h 1 j 1 m 1 j h 1 j then c 1 h 1j is the first imf intrinsic mode function component from the data c 1 is separated from the data by 4 x t c 1 r 1 the residue r 1 is treated as the new data and subjected to the same sifting process as described above this procedure can be repeated on all the subsequent ri s and the result is 5 r 1 c 2 r 2 r n 1 c n r n finally we obtain n imf components and residue r n x t c 1 c 2 c 3 c n r n the imf should have two properties 1 throughout the whole length of a single imf the number of extrema and the number of zero crossings must either be equal or differ at most by one and 2 at any data location the mean value of the envelope defined by the local maxima and the envelope defined by the local minima is zero the total number of imfs of a data set is close to and might be fewer than log2n with n the number of total data points wu and huang 2009 there are two factors influencing the results one is stopping criterion of producing an imf component the stopping criterion for the sifting used in the decompositions is a modified cauchy type criterion c r i m ij 2 i h ij 2 where h ij is the prototype ith imf after j rounds of sifting and mij is the mean of the upper and lower envelopes of hij in the decompositions a value of 0 0001 was selected for cr wu and huang 2009 the other factor influencing the decomposed results is the end effects we use the similar method proposed by wu and huang 2009 to reduce the end effects in addition we extended the data at two sides respectively which is the best way resolving this problem 3 1 2 obtaining net setup and setdown of water level and tidal range taking tidal levels in january 2014 for example eight imf components are obtained after decomposition which are presented in fig 3 imf1 and imf2 are clearly the components of semi diurnal tides and diurnal tides respectively imf5 is the component of half monthly variation of tides its peaks and valleys are in accordance with spring tides and neap tides respectively imf6 is the component of monthly variation of tides its peaks and valleys correspond with the relatively strong and weak spring tides respectively because there are errors at the two sides i e the end effects the correspondence is relatively poor at the two sides imf7 and imf8 should represent longer periodic variations therefore imf3 and imf4 between diurnal tide component and half monthly tide component should contain components of wind effects the previous studies showed that 2 3 and 4 5 days are the main periods of low frequency variations of water level around the yangtze estuary which are in accordance with the wind s variations zhao and cao 1987 chen and su 1991 the imf3 and imf4 components correspond to the 2 3 days and 4 5 days periods respectively the sum of imf3 and imf4 is regarded as the net water level setup and setdown the situation for november 2009 was a little bit different the subtidal water levels were abnormal relative to the normal tidal variations low in spring tide and high in neap tide because the water level setdown and setup exactly occurred in spring tide and neap tide respectively which can be seen from plot a in fig 7 the half monthly tide and monthly tide components are not correctly decomposed with peaks and valleys in neap tide and spring tide respectively the same as the subtidal water levels therefore imf 5 and imf 6 are included as well to obtain the net water level setup for the tidal range since all data looked normal the same as the tidal variation the data processing was similar to that for the tidal level 3 2 analytical model for saline water intrusion for better analyzing the process of wind s effects on the saline water intrusion an analytical model for alluvial estuaries developed by savenije 1986 1989 2005 was used this model has been successfully applied to the yangtze estuary by zhang et al 2011 3 2 1 summary of the model the shape of alluvial estuaries can be described by the following exponential functions in a multiple reach estuary in estuaries where the geometry of channels cannot be described by a single exponential function multiple reaches can be used a i a 0 exp x a i i 1 6 a i a i 1 exp x x i 1 a i i 1 b i b 0 exp x b i i 1 7 b i b i 1 exp x x i 1 b i i 1 h i h 0 exp x a i b i a i b i i 1 8 h i h i 1 exp x x i 1 a i b i a i b i i 1 where ai bi and hi are the cross sectional area width and depth at location x from the mouth respectively a 0 b 0 and h 0 are the area width and depth at the mouth i represents the reach number i 1 2 3 beginning from the mouth ai and bi are the area and width convergence length for reach i x i 1 is the inflection point and a i 1 b i 1 and h i 1 are the cross sectional area width and depth respectively at the inflection point the cross sectional average salt balance equations for high water slack hws low water slack lws and tidal average ta situations can be written as 9 s s f c s x where s is the steady state salinity for three different states of hws lws or ta and sf is the fresh water salinity the coefficient c is an x dependent coefficient equal to the ratio between the dispersion coefficient and the freshwater velocity 10 c a q f d where qf is the river discharge which is negative since the positive x axis points upstream d is the dispersion coefficient for the hws lws or ta condition which can be calculated by means of the following equation based on previous work by van der burgh 1972 11 d x k q f a where k is van der burgh s coefficient taken as a value between 0 and 1 combining eqs 9 11 the equation for the longitudinal variation of the salinity in the estuary is obtained 12 s s f s 0 s f d d 0 1 k where s 0 is the boundary salinity at the estuary mouth under the hws lws or ta condition and sf is the salinity of the river water at the upstream boundary integration of eq 11 in combination with an exponentially varying cross section yields the expression for the dispersion along the estuary d x d 0 1 Œ≤ i exp x a i 1 i 1 13 d x d i 1 1 Œ≤ i exp x x i 1 a i 1 i 1 where 14 Œ≤ i k a i q f d 0 a 0 i 1 Œ≤ i k a i q f d i 1 a i 1 i 1 where Œ≤i is the dispersion reduction rate at reach i for hws lws or ta d i 1 is the dispersion coefficient at the inflection point for hws lws or ta d0 is the boundary condition at the estuary mouth x 0 for the hws lws or ta condition which can be calculated by means of the following predictive equation based on observations in real estuaries a predictive expression for the dispersion d 0 hws was obtained by savenije 2005 15 d 0 hws 1400 e 0 œÖ 0 h 0 a n r 0 5 where nr is the estuarine richardson number which is defined as 16 n r Œ¥ œÅ œÅ gh q f t a 0 e 0 œÖ 0 2 where œÅ is the density at the mouth and Œ¥œÅ is the density difference between ocean and river water t is the tidal period e 0 and œÖ 0 are the tidal excursion and tidal velocity amplitude at the estuary mouth respectively e 0 œÖ 0 t œÄ based on lagrangean reasoning d 0 ta and d 0 lws can be computed as savenije 1989 17 d 0 ta d hws x e 2 exp e 2 a 18 d 0 lws d hws x e exp e a where d hws x is determined with eqs 13 16 and e is the tidal excursion using the above equations the longitudinal salinity distribution in the estuary can be calculated for hws lws or ta 3 2 2 determination of the input parameters the topographical parameters ai and bi are determined by means of fitting topographic data to the eqs 6 8 the van der burgh s coefficient k is an important parameter which is obtained by calibrating the computed saline water intrusion curve against the measurements it is usually regarded as constant independent of river discharge and tide the tidal velocity amplitude at the estuary mouth œÖ 0 was determined based on measurements the tidal excursion e 0 was calculated based on equation e 0 œÖ 0 t œÄ then with the salinity at the mouth and the river discharge input the longitudinal salinity distribution along the channel can be calculated based on equations 12 18 the model was calibrated using measurements on 1 2 january 2014 4 results 4 1 variation trend and correlation of strong wind events and saline water intrusion in winter half year the previous studies were mostly based on the wind conditions at dongtan station fig 4 shows the wind vectors at shengsi and dongtan stations in november 2009 february 2010 and january 2014 the wind directions at two stations were basically accordant but the wind speeds at shengsi were larger on 10 12 november 2009 11 12 february 2010 and 8 9 january 2014 three periods during which abnormal saline water intrusion occurred the winds were mostly from north or northeast with the speeds continuously exceeding 10 m s and a maximum of higher than 15 m s at the shengsi station on 10 12 november 2009 not only the northerly winds but also the northeasterly winds were dominant they often occurred together during a single strong wind event because there is a lack of long term data at the dongtan station the statistics of strong northerly and northeasterly wind events at the shengsi station for winter half year were used for analyzing the variation trend and correlation with the saline water intrusion here a strong wind event is defined as all wind speeds 10 m s with a maximum 15 m s and the duration 12 h the chenhang reservoir is located at the south branch supplying freshwater for shanghai salinity here is controlled by the dispersion of saline water that originates from the north branch as such the situation of saline water intrusion at chenhang represents an index for saline water intrusion in the north branch according to statistics for the period 1994 2008 saline water intrusion at chenhang was weak before 1999 but it had dramatically increased since 1999 both in terms of frequency and duration plot a in fig 5 it can be seen from plots b and c of fig 5 that the frequencies and durations of strong northerly and northeasterly wind events had similar variation trend in the same period 1994 2008 low in the 1990 s but increased dramatically after 1999 for the events with duration both less than 24 h and more than 24 h fig 6 shows the good correlation of frequencies between saline water intrusion and strong northerly and northeasterly wind events in 1994 2008 for the events with duration longer than 12 h the correlation coefficient was 0 85 this suggests that the increase of strong northerly and northeasterly wind events may be one factor inducing the increase of saline water intrusion in the north branch of the yangtze estuary after 1999 4 2 processes of strong northerly and northeasterly winds increasing saline water intrusion water depth tidal range tidal currents and freshwater inflow are the main factors controlling saline water intrusion for the north branch of the yangtze estuary these are all affected by the condition of strong northerly and northeasterly winds 4 2 1 water level setup the net water level setup and setdown at the qinglonggang station based on emd subtidal water levels based on low pass filter and wind conditions in november 2009 february 2010 and january 2014 are presented in fig 7 the net water level setup and setdown based on emd plots d e f were in accordance with the variation of subtidal water levels plots a b c and also basically corresponded with the variation of wind conditions plots g o the water level setups mostly corresponded with the northerly and northeasterly winds which was in accordance with the decrease of temperature influenced by cold air particularly for the strong winds plots g i during 10 12 november 2009 neap tide 11 12 february 2010 intermediate tide and 8 9 january 2014 neap tide the three periods during which abnormally strong saline water intrusion occurred the water levels all set up dramatically corresponding with strong northerly and northeasterly winds the highest wind speed 20 m s agreed with the highest water level setup of 0 55 m during 10 12 november 2009 in the three periods in addition during 16 17 november 2009 quasi spring tide water levels surged dramatically as well corresponding with the strong northeasterly winds with a maximum speed of 18 m s at shengsi fig 2 shows that the salinity values around 17 november 2009 was much higher than those during the previous spring tide around 3 4 november at the chongxi station although on that day the tidal range was smaller and the corresponding yangtze river discharge was relatively large the salinity increase was probably induced by the strong northeasterly winds as well water level set up implies water depth increase which is a factor inducing increase of saline water intrusion 4 2 2 limited change of tidal range the setup and setdown of tidal range at the qinglonggang station in november 2009 february 2010 and january 2014 based on emd are presented in plots a c of fig 8 which generally corresponded with the variations of subtidal tidal range in plots d f in the subtidal tidal ranges because the difference between spring tide and neap tide is large the small changes were not obvious particularly during neap tide the setup and setdown of tidal range resulted from the change of water level depending on the water level setup or setdown during flood and ebb the changes of tidal range were generally small because the water level set up or set down during both flood and ebb during the several strong wind events the tidal ranges had both setups and setdowns the relatively large setups and setdowns usually occurred at the beginning or end of the events resulting from the sudden setup and setdown during flood or ebb with a maximum setup of 0 16 m and a maximum setdown 0 25 m in november 2009 and january 2014 on 11 12 february 2010 the situation was slightly different the tidal range set up during the whole event with a maximum of 0 25 m which can be seen also from the subtidal tidal ranges plot e this is likely the result of the larger setups during the flood phase of the tide than during the ebb 4 2 3 flood tide current enhanced and ebb tide current reduced in the north branch of the yangtze estuary the tidal current velocity during flood tide is usually larger than during ebb tide in spring tide in neap tide the tidal current velocity during flood tide is generally smaller than during ebb tide however on 8 january 2014 neap tide during strong northerly winds the tidal current velocities during flood tide were larger than during ebb tide at locations b1 b2 and b3 fig 9 particularly in the first tidal cycle of b1 the much smaller velocities during ebb tide can be easily seen the strong winds began at 04 00 or 05 00 i e the velocities during the ebb tide were affected by strong winds in the second tidal cycle of b2 the maximum velocity during the ebb was larger than during the flood which corresponded with the smaller tidal range and much weaker winds this observation suggests that the velocities on 8 9 january 2014 were affected by the strong northerly winds whereby the flood tide velocities increased and the ebb tide velocities decreased this induced the increase of saline water intrusion in november 2009 and february 2010 no measured current data were available 4 2 4 decrease of freshwater inflow due to the special topography the ratio of freshwater inflow into the north branch is very small less than 1 of the yangtze river discharge in recent years chen and chen 2003 yu et al 2003 tan and wang 2004 zhang et al 2011 the saline water intrusion in the north branch is sensitive to the freshwater inflow particularly during dry season the strong northerly and northeasterly winds set up water levels strengthen flood currents and reduce ebb currents which block freshwater inflow into the north branch and further downstream this may be an important mechanism inducing abnormally strong saline water intrusion during strong northerly and northeasterly winds on 10 12 november 2009 11 12 february 2010 and 8 9 january 2014 the longitudinal salinity distributions along the north branch on 1 2 spring tide and 8 9 neap tide january 2014 were computed based on the analytical model during neap tide water depth tidal velocity amplitude and ratio of freshwater inflow were possibly influenced by strong winds which were considered in the calculation of salinity water depth hi was set to increase 0 3 m based on the net water level setup the tidal velocity amplitude at the estuary mouth œÖ 0 was determined based on observations the topography of the north branch parameters used in the model and computed salinity are shown in fig 10 table1 and fig 11 respectively fig 11 shows that the computed salinity agreed with the measured salinity well except for the low salinity at b3 in the upper reach during neap tide for the computed results the input freshwater inflow into the north branch during neap tide is much smaller than for spring tide table1 the absence of high low variations of salinity during flood and ebb tides almost equal high salinity in the middle and lower reaches and very high salinity during flood tide in the upper reach all confirmed very small freshwater inflow however there was no much difference between the corresponding yangtze river discharges during spring and neap tides fig 2 table1 if the ratio of freshwater inflow during neap tide were not changed the same as the spring tide the salinity would be much lower dashed lines in fig 11 only the high salinity at b1 in the lower reach and low salinity at b3 in the upper reach can fit the measurements this suggests the effect of strong northerly winds inducing a decrease of freshwater inflow into the north branch the poor agreement between computed results and measurements for the low salinity at b3 in the upper reach during neap tide is due to the fact that b3 is close to the south branch where the salinity is largely affected by freshwater during the ebb during the flood the tidal current is dominant the salinity can reach a high value which is why the saline water can spill over into the south branch if the north branch were a single channel estuary the saline water intrusion could reach around 130 km during the flood and the low salinity at b3 would be much higher for the same freshwater inflow 4 3 mechanism of wind forcing on saline water intrusion the effects of wind on the hydrodynamics and saline water intrusion may come from two sides the effects of remote winds over the continental shelf and the effects of local winds over the estuary the alongshore winds over the continental shelf could generate ekman transport toward or off the estuary and coastal area inducing coastal sea level fluctuations and subtidal exchange between the estuarine and shelf waters snedden et al 2007 ralston et al 2008 in the yangtze estuary the events of abnormal salinity increase in the north branch all correspond with alongshore winds i e the northerly and northeasterly winds the resulted ekman transport by winds over the continental shelf forces seawater towards the estuary mouth this process results in water level setup outside the estuary mouth and an enhanced seawater transport into the estuary which has been proposed by wu et al 2010 and li et al 2012 based on numerical experiments in addition to pumping more seawater into the estuary during flood tide this process blocks water out of the estuary during ebb tide inducing water level setup during both flood and ebb tides the increase of current velocity during flood tide and decrease of velocity during ebb tide the local northeasterly winds are exactly parallel to the upper reach of the north branch which could play some role as well the numerical experiment by li et al 2012 confirmed that the water mass spilling over into the south branch from the north branch under a northeasterly wind condition was larger than under a northerly wind condition however it can be seen from fig 12 that the wind speeds inside the estuary were much smaller than outside during the strong winds event of 8 9 january 2014 affected by the terrestrial topography although the wind directions were similar the wind speeds at b2 and b3 in the middle and upper reaches were smaller than 4 m s in half and even longer period of the strong winds event this suggests that the effect of local winds is limited the shengsi station outside the estuary is also a land based station on the shengsi island the winds over the sea should be stronger this also suggests that the effect from remote winds was dominant 5 discussions 5 1 effects of wind on hydrodynamics song et al 2011 studied the effects of wind on water level and tidal range at qinglonggang station based on numerical experiments and multi years average wind conditions at half month mean level their results indicate that the winds have small effect on water level and almost no effect on tidal range the water level setups influenced by the northerly winds are generally smaller than 0 05 m our results based on observations show that during the strong northerly and northeasterly winds the water level set up dramatically with a maximum of 0 55 m at the qinglonggang station during 10 12 september 2009 this dramatic water level setup can occur on neap intermediate or spring tide this result is different from the numerical experiment result by song et al 2011 too their result indicates that the water level setup is relatively strong during neap tides but no obvious setup or even setdown occurs during spring tides as a result of the same northerly wind conditions on neap tides the tidal intensity is weak so the effects of wind could be larger on spring tides the situation is vice versa however observations show that if the winds are strong the effect of winds is obvious as well during spring tides e g 16 17 november 2009 with a maximum wind speed of 18 m s at the shengsi station as to the tidal range our results indicate that the variations during strong winds are not much with both setup and setdown however the magnitude is much larger than the result from song et al 2011 in some cases relatively large setups occurred such as those on 11 12 february 2010 with a maximum of 0 25 m the relationship between wind and hydrodynamics should be nonlinear so additional work is needed to confirm the results including the variations of tidal current velocity which were based on a limited data set 5 2 mechanisms related to wind forcing for the effects of wind on subtidal variability of hydrodynamics and saline water intrusion the ekman transport resulting from remote alongshore winds is believed to be the main mechanism in many estuaries such as great south bay wong and wilson 1984 delaware estuary wong and garvine 1984 ross et al 2015 mississippi river deltaic estuary snedden et al 2007 keum river estuary son et al 2007 chesapeake bay guo and valle levinson 2008 northern gulf of mexico estuary kim and park 2012 and narragansett bay estuary pfeiffer herbert et al 2015 in the yangtze estuary this mechanism was also proposed by wu et al 2010 and li et al 2012 garvine 1985 believed that the effect of remote winds is larger than local winds because most estuaries are short relative to the low subtidal estuarine wave length our results indicate that the remote winds outside the estuary are much stronger than the local winds over the estuary which may represent another reason for the dominance of remote effects this result also suggests that the replacement of local winds by remote winds or replacement of remote winds by local winds in some previous research is unreasonable in micro tidal estuaries stratification is more common whereby intrusion of seawater takes place in the form of a salt wedge in that case gravitational circulation and nonlinear pumping effect are the main mechanisms zyryanov 2013 zyryanov et al 2015 in those estuaries the along channel local winds could apparently affect the saline water intrusion down estuary and up estuary winds increase and curb the circulation respectively resulting in an increase and decrease of saline water intrusion as is the cases in the lower patos lagoon estuary costa et al 1988 and the pamlico river estuary xu et al 2008 in addition outside the yangtze estuary there are alongshore currents from the north in winter season during the strong northerly winds the alongshore currents are intensified riedlinger and jacobs 2000 and some studies suggest that the water level setup forced by strong winds can propagate southward in the form of kelvin waves ko et al 2003 yang et al 2016 these two factors may also induce the water level setup at the estuary mouth influencing the hydrodynamics and saline water intrusion 6 conclusions the statistics of the 1994 2008 data sets show that the frequency and duration of saline water intrusion in the north branch of the yangtze estuary were weak in the 1990s but they had dramatically increased since 1999 the strong northerly and northeasterly wind events around the estuary during cold outbreaks in winter half year show the similar variation trend in both frequency and duration low in the 1990s but increased dramatically after 1999 in addition to this agreement in trend the correlation between strong wind events and saline water intrusion is also significant this suggests that the increase of strong northerly and northeasterly wind events may be one of the factors inducing the increase of saline water intrusion in the north branch of the yangtze estuary in situ observations show that strong northerly and northeasterly winds can induce dramatic water level setup in the north branch of the yangtze estuary which can occur in neap intermediate or spring tide the tidal range is relatively less affected due to the water level setup during both flood and ebb tides the current velocities are also affected whereby the flood tide velocities increased and ebb tide velocities decreased in addition the results of the analytical saline water intrusion model suggest that the freshwater inflow into the north branch decreases considerably these changes in combination cause the intensified saline water intrusion during strong northerly and northeasterly winds ekman transport from remote winds over the continental shelf areas forces seawater towards the coastal area and estuary mouth which induces water level setup at the mouth pumping more seawater into the estuary this should be a primary mechanism for the change of hydrodynamics and increase of saline water intrusion the much stronger winds outside than inside the estuary also suggest the dominant effect of remote winds
