synthesized materials were characterized using xrd sem xps uv vis and n2 adsorption desorption experiment the doping of ag not only decreased the band gap energy and particle size but also enhanced the separation of charge carriers and decreased the electron hole recombination in the g c3n4 structure the photocatalytic activity of ag doped g c3n4 was investigated using oxytetracycline otc as a model pollutant the loading of 7 ag onto g c3n4 showed highest photocatalytic degradation efficiency of ot the synthesized photocatalyst showed extremely high stability after 5 cycles as confirmed through various characterization techniques such as sem and xrd eventually several degradation intermediates of otc were identified and possible decomposition pathways were proposed the 7 agcn also

supportedg c3n4 and its promising application prospect in environmental remediation keywords graphitic carbon nitride noble metal photocatalyst oxytetracycline wastewater 1 introduction nowadays the frequent abuse of antibiotics has aroused extensive concerns due to its potential threat to the health and safety of aquatic organisms 1 2 the main reason for the presence of antibiotics in aquatic ecosystems is that the conventional wastewater treatment technologies are not extremely effective 3 4 besides antibiotics bring many potential risks to human beings and animals as it can easily penetrate into the human body through food where its accumulation can directly induce negative effects on human health as well as environment 5 7 more recently the advanced oxidation processes based on visible light photocatalysts have been proven to be a promising and efficient strategy for emerging antibiotics contaminates degradation in general the advanced oxidation processes based on visible light photocatalysts have attracted considerable attention due to its high processing efficiency fast reaction rate and low cost the metal free graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 with a band gap energy of 2 7 ev has been applied widely as new photocatalyst in wastewater treatment 6 8 however its photocatalytic degradation ability is severely restricted mainly due to the high recombination rates of electron hole pairs therefore it gives us an idea to design and prepare this novel and practical photocatalyst with the low band gap energy high separation rate of electron and hole to generate reactive free radical species for removal antibiotics under the visible light in recent years noble metal nanoparticles are an emerging kind of heterogeneous catalysts which is of great importance application value in various fields nano silver catalysts have already had considerable development prospects in environmental remediation 9 13 in the present work ag nanoparticles were successfully doped onto g c3n4 and otc was chosen as the target contaminant to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of material under visible light the catalysts were then characterized using xrd sem xps uv vis and n2 adsorption desorption experiment additionally the influence of various parameters e g ph catalyst dosage and initial concentration on otc degradation were evaluated in detail besides stability and reusability of the photocatalysts were also investigated the principal intermediates of otc photocatalytic degradation were investigated and reasonable pathways of degradation were also proposed more importantly the degradation of otc from wastewater was carried out for further application in pilot scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals melamine 98 ethylene glycol 96 5 isopropanol 98 5

prepare solutions complex antibiotic wastewater sample was collected from dinh vu industrial park located in hai phong city vietnam with the basic properties are listed in table 1 2 2 materials preparation the materials were prepared by a typical thermal condensation method based on previous published works 14 17 initially 37 5 mmol of melamine was dissolved in 61 3 ml ethylene glycol and 20 ml distilled water under magnetic stirring for 60 min while various amounts of ag no3 3 5 7 and 10 wt were also dispersed in 50 ml ethylene glycol by magnetic stirring after 60 min two solutions above were mixed together with vigorous and continuous stirring for 60 min to obtain a dispersed solution then the mixture was dried at 100 c in a vacuum oven for 12 h the obtained solid products were calcined at 350 c for 2 h followed by 500 c for 1 h and finally at 550 c for 5 h at the same heating rate of 1 c min 1 the collected powders were washed with distilled water and ethanol several times and dried at 50 c the ag doped g c3n4 was obtained and the materials were denoted as 3 agcn 5 agcn 7 agcn and 10 agcn the pure g c3n4 was synthesized following the same procedure above without the adding of ag no3 2 3 effect of dopant ratio on the removal of otc fig s1 showed the effect of different dopant amount on the removal of otc under the dark and visible light it can be seen that in terms of the dark condition the removal efficiency of otc by doped samples were similar at around 45 2 and slightly higher than the undoped g c3n4 36 4 when the light on the otc removal efficiency was increased from 67 6 to 96 2 with an increasing ag content in g c3n4 from 3 to 7 when the ag loading was further increased from 7 to 10 the otc degradation was slightly decreased from 96 2 to 89 8 the decrease in the removal efficiency of otc due to the recombination center when amount of ag excessive into the graphitic phase 16 18 these results demonstrated that the ag doping content has a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity 7 agcn showed the best tc elimination efficiency therefore as the superior photocatalyst 7 agcn was used for further process optimization of all operating parameters 2 4 characterization of materials the specific surface area and pore volume of adsorbents were measured using a five point bet method under nitrogen atmosphere using a surface area and porosity analyzer sa 9600 series micromeritics co usa scanning electron microscopy sem system hitachi s4700 high technologies co japan was used to observe the surface morphology of materials and the transmission electron microscopy tem images were obtained from philips xe 210 transmission electron microscope the crystal structure of doped and undoped samples were investigated by using x ray diffractometer bruker advance se32 thermo fisher scientific inc usa equipped with cu kα radiation source within the range of 2θ 10 to 80 the optical properties of samples were identified by uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrum uv vis drs agilent model sa928 in the wavelength range of 200 800 nm finally the elemental states and compositions were determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy scientific xps 235 thermo fisher 2 5 photocatalytic experiments the photocatalytic decomposition of otc by g c3n4 and agcn was investigated by the removal efficiency of otc from wastewater under visible light a xenon lamp 300 w with a 420 nm cut off filter fgc 400 was employed as the visible light source an aqueous suspension 100 ml containing 0 05 g of materials and 20 ml of otc 30 mg l 1 was added to a 200 ml glass beaker the suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark for 60 min to attain the adsorption desorption equilibrium and the resulting reaction mixture was continuously illuminated and magnetically stirred for 120 min during the photodegradation 5 ml of a solution was taken out after regular intervals of time and filtered off with a syringe filter 0 45 μm and analyzed by a high performance liquid hplc agilent 1200 inc usa the experiment for photocatalytic decomposition of otc from wastewater was tested by using the same conditions of catalyst and 30 ml of wastewater sample the removal efficiency r of otc was calculated as follows the eq 1 1 r c 0 c c 0 100 where c 0 mg l 1 is the initial concentration of otc and c mg l 1 is the concentration of otc after photocatalytic decomposition 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of materials 3 1 1 specific surface area and pore volume analysis table 2 showed the measured bet surface area and total pore volumes of 7 agcn and g c3n4 it can be seen that doped sample has higher surface area 48 5 m2 g 1 as compared to the pure form g c3n4 36 8 m2 g 1 a similar trend of total pore volumes were observed for 7 agcn and g c3n4 at 0 98 and 0 61 cm3 g 1 respectively the result confirmed that doping of ag could improve the surface area and the total pore volume of g c3n4 leading to increase the removal of otc in aqueous solution 18 20 the result also demonstrated the greater number of adsorption sites for doped sample as compared to that of the undoped g c3n4 which may increase the chance for interaction between the material and the otc 20 23 3 1 2 surface morphology and the transmission electron microscopy analysis the surface morphology of pure g c3n4 and agcn are shown in fig 1 as observed in fig 1 a g c3n4 shows a typical flat layer structure while the 7 agcn showed some small particle loaded on the surface which confirmed the present ag onto the doped sample see in fig 1 b the microstructure of g c3n4 and 7 agcn were investigated by tem analysis fig 1 c d it can be seen that the doped sample had some uniformly back dots on the surface while it did not show in the pure g c3n4 the black dots represented for the apparent of ag nanoparticles with the average size around 40 nm the result confirmed that ag nanoparticles successfully loaded onto g c3n4 16 21 additionally the sem image of g c3n4 and 7 agcn after recycle were also analyzed to investigate stability of photocatalyst it can be observed from fig 1 e f that the surface morphology of samples after 5 times reused showed similarly the morphology with the original once the results indicated that almost no change occurred in the photocatlyst material before and after reused which further demonstrated that 7 agcn exhibited excellent durability 3 1 3 the xrd analysis the xrd patterns of prepared g c3n4 and 7 agcn were identified and the results are shown in fig 2 the strong diffraction peaks at 13 5 and 27 5 are related to interlayer stacking of the conjugated aromatic system which confirmed the structure of g c3n 15 18 however the 7 agcn before and after recycles experiment showed the absence of peak at 13 5 which was tentatively attributed to the defects derived from the inadequate polymerization process in addition the diffraction of the new peaks at 46 3 and 57 8 are related to the ag 19 21 fig 2 also displayed the xrd analysis of 7 agcn after 5 time reused the intensity of the diffraction peaks were similar as compared with the original material before recycling experiment the result from xrd demonstrated that 7 agcn could be use as long term photocatalytic decomposition of organic pollutants 3 1 4 xps analysis the surface elemental composition and the chemical state of agcn was analyzed by xps measurements see in supporting information fig s2 the xps survey spectrum of 7 agcn confirmed the existence of the c n and ag elements in the surface of the material see in fig s2 a as seen in the survey spectrum fig s2 a the sharp peaks corresponding to ag 3d ag 3p and ag 4p species were obviously observed which demonstrated the successful introduction of ag into the g c3n4 phase 15 20 in the ag 3d region fig s2 b the ag 3d peaks were split into two peaks at binding energies of 369 4 and 375 2 ev which were assigned to ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 peaks respectively indicating the typical binding energies of ago the uv vis drs of the pure g c3n4 and ag doped g c3n4 were analyzed by uv vis drs at the range of 200 700 nm and the relevant diffuse reflectance spectra were converted from kubelka munk equation see in fig 3 the steeper curve in the visible light region for ag doped g c3n4 revealed its significant absorption band in the visible region compared with the pure g c3n4 the adsorption edge of pure g c3n4 at 450 nm could be clearly observed while the adsorption edge of 7 agcn pristine at about 510 nm could also be detected in addition it can be seen in the vertical coordinates that 7 agcn composites can absorb more photons and thus generate more electron hole pairs which will be advantageous to photocatalytic decomposition of organic pollutants 20 21 the calculated bandgap energy of g c3n4 and 7 agcn were 2 71 and 2 46 ev respectively the decreased in the bandgap energy of doped sample due to the enhancement of visible light harvesting as well as reduced the recombination rate of electron and hole 15 19 3 2 removal of antibiotic pollutant 3 2 1 effect of catalyst dose fig 4 a showed the removal of otc using 7 agcn as a function of catalyst dose under the dark condition the adsorption of otc onto 7 agcn significantly increased with the dose increasing from 0 1 0 2 g it due to the greater number of adsorption sites and larger of surface area initially available to adsorb the otc onto the surface of materials however when the catalyst loading is increased further to 0 5 g the removal rate of otc no further increase because the otc was fully exited onto the surface area and active sites of material the removal efficiency of otc by 7 agcn were 33 5 at 120 min of reaction time under the visible light the degradation efficiency of otc using 7 agcn significant increased up by the increasing in catalyst dose the photocatalytic degradation of otc was 98 7 after 120 min of reaction time and 0 2 g of dose however when the catalyst loading is increased further to 0 5 g the rate of otc degradation tends to slightly decrease the increased amount of catalyst could result in an enlargement in the total surface area of materials thereby indirectly increasing the number of active sites besides at excessive catalyst content the turbidity of the solution also drastically increases which reduced the light penetration through the solution and indirectly hindered the formation of charge carriers 24 28 3 2 2 effect of initial concentration fig 4 b shows the removal efficiencies of otc using 7 agcn as a function of the initial concentrations under the dark condition the increase in initial concentrations resulting in decreased the removal efficiency of otc at low initial concentrations less than 50 mg l more unoccupied surface areas or active sites are available for removal of otc at initial concentrations above 50 mg l the removal efficiency of otc sharply dropped this can be explained because all active sites for further adsorption were almost occupied or saturated by otc 26 27 when the light on it can be observed that the decomposition efficiency of otc by 7 agcn was inhibited and the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies declined from 98 6 10 mg l 1 to 71 2 100 mg l the loss in photocatalytic efficiency due to the enhanced competition effect for reactive species between otc and the generated otc by products 26 30 3 2 3 stability and reusability of 7 agcn photocatlyst the recovery and recycling ability of ag doped g c3n4 was studied by repeating the photocatalytic reactions a minimum of five times fig 5 after each experiment the photocatalyst was merely collected washing with 50 ml solution containing 10 h2o2 and then drying at 50 c before being continuously reused for a new cycle the removal efficiency of otc after 5 cycles is shown in fig 5 it can be seen that efficiency of otc was decreased by only 13 8 after five cycles corresponding to 84 8 degradation using the recovered catalyst this slight reduction in otc degradation efficiency using recycled photocatalyst was attributed to some loss of material during its recovery via washing process based on the result 7 agcn has potential for long term applications in photocatalytic degradation of toxic organic compounds under visible light 3 2 4 proposal mechanism in order to investigate the free radicals species for the photocatalyst oxidation of otc a series of experimental were conducted p benzoquinone bq is a scavenger of o2 whereas ethanol etoh and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta 2na were adopted for the prevalence of oh and h respectively fig 6 a showed the degradation of otc with and without the present of quenchers the degradation of otc rapidly decreased by adding bq and edta 2na indicated that o2 and h played an important role in the photo degradation of otc 28 31 however in addition of etoh the decomposition of tc only slightly decreased less than 25 5 of tc was degraded which demonstrates that o2 and h are the predominant oxidative species for tc degradation using 7 agcn 3 2 5 identification of intermediates and mineralization analysis the reduction of tocs during photocatalytic decomposition of otc by using g c3n4 and 7 agcn were identified the mineralization progress was identified by checking the total organic carbon toc of the samples by using toc analyzer model toc 463 hatachi co japan the reduction of toc was calculated following the eq 2 2 toc removal 1 toct toco 100 where toco mg l and toct value mg l are the total organic carbon values of test solution at reaction time 0 and t min during the reaction respectively from fig 6 b it can be seen that within 120 min of reaction time the toc removal efficiency reaches to 64 8 and 98 3 for g c3n4 and 7 agcn respectively the reduction of toc by ag doped g c3n4 was much higher than that of g c3n4 in addition high removal of toc indicated that otc was completely degraded into co2 and h2o 31 32 to determine the concentration variations of otc and intermediates during the photocatalytic reactions liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was performed from fig s3 it can be seen that the main peak of the initial otc sample appearing at an elution time of approximately 20 min significantly reduced with the increase in the irradiation time after 120 min of visible light irradiation the main otc peak was totally disappeared indicating the complete decomposition of tc during the photocatalytic reaction eventually these intermediates were further mineralized to the co2 and h2o 3 2 6 possible photocatalytic mechanism the degradation of otc through photocatalysis is based mainly in the formation of chemical radicals when the 7 agcn is activated by light the results from xps and uv vis analysis confirmed that introduction of ag successfully narrowed the band gap of g c3n4 from 2 71 to 2 46 ev which could be activated by visible light during photocatalytic degradation of otc the incident photons that have the required band gap energy will promote the transfer of electrons from the catalyst valence band vb to the conduction band cb forming e h pairs then the photoexcited e in the cb of g c3n4 can migrate to the cb of ag the electron in the cb of ag is picked up by oxygen to generate superoxide o2 radical anion while the hole left in the vb will react with adsorbed water to produce hydroxyl oh radicals the generated holes and o2 can react with h2o molecules to produce oh radicals 15 19 therefore the photocatalytic activity of ag doped g c3n4 would be attributed to the oxidation species o2 and oh and the otc was degraded into smaller intermediates and finally into co2 and h2o 30 31 3 2 7 the application of catalysts for antibiotic removal in wastewater to evaluate the universality of ag doped g c3n4 in the degradation of complex antibiotic wastewater the samples containing several common antibiotics such as tetracycline tc and gatifloxacin gfa along with otc were applied as antibiotic model organic pollutants see in fig 7 additionally the removal efficiencies of otc tc and gfa within 120 min were 94 5 81 8 and 67 3 respectively the result fully demonstrated that the agcn photocatalyst exhibited a superior degradation effect for antibiotics especially for otc and tc 4 conclusions in summary ag doped g c3n4 photocatlyst was successfully synthesized with high photocatalytic decomposition of antibiotic contaminants the loading of ag onto g c3n4 not only increased the active sites and number of pore volume but also drastically improved the generation of photo induced e and h pairs the narrow of bandgap energy leading to greatly improved the photocatalytic decomposition of otc it was clearly demonstrated that otc can be effectively decomposed by o2 and oh free radical oxidation during the photocatalytic degradation processes the principal intermediates of otc degradation were identified and the possible pathways of degradation were also proposed under optimal conditions the otc degradation rate retained at 85 6 after seven consecutive runs which indicated that the satisfactory stability and reusability of photocatalyst additionally 7 agcn was applied to remove the complex antibiotic pollutants from wastewater ag doped g c3n4 showed excellent the removal efficiency of oct and tc in wastewater based on these results ag doped g c3n4 can be potentially utilized in the field of antibiotics degradation declaration of competing interest the authors do not have any conflict of interests to declare acknowledgments this

observed for 7 agcn and g c3n4 at 0 98 and 0 61 cm3 g 1 respectively the result confirmed that doping of ag could improve the surface area and the total pore volume of g c3n4 leading to increase the removal of otc in aqueous solution 18 20 the result also demonstrated the greater number of adsorption sites for doped sample as compared to that of the undoped g c3n4 which may increase the chance for interaction between the material and the otc 20 23 3 1 2 surface morphology and the transmission electron microscopy analysis the surface morphology of pure g c3n4 and agcn are shown in fig 1 as observed in fig 1 a g c3n4 shows a typical flat layer structure while the 7 agcn showed some small particle loaded on the surface which confirmed the present ag onto the doped sample see in fig 1 b the microstructure of g c3n4 and 7 agcn were investigated by tem analysis fig 1 c d it can be seen that the doped sample had some uniformly back dots on the surface while it did not show in the pure g

reduced the recombination rate of electron and hole 15 19 3 2 removal of antibiotic pollutant 3 2 1 effect of catalyst dose fig 4 a showed the removal of otc using 7 agcn as a function of catalyst dose under the dark condition the adsorption of otc onto 7 agcn significantly increased with the dose increasing from 0 1 0 2 g it due to the greater number of adsorption sites and larger of surface area initially available to adsorb the otc onto the surface of materials however when the catalyst loading is increased further to 0 5 g the removal rate of otc no further increase because the otc was fully exited onto the surface area and active sites of material the removal efficiency of otc by 7 agcn were 33 5 at 120 min of reaction time under the visible light the degradation efficiency of otc using 7 agcn significant increased up by the increasing in catalyst dose the photocatalytic degradation of otc was 98 7 after 120 min of reaction time and 0 2 g of dose however when the catalyst loading is increased further to 0 5 g the rate of otc degradation tends to slightly decrease the increased amount of catalyst could result in an enlargement in the total surface area of materials thereby indirectly increasing the number of active sites besides at excessive catalyst content the turbidity of the solution also drastically increases which reduced the light penetration through the solution and indirectly hindered the formation of charge carriers 24 28 3 2 2 effect of initial concentration fig 4 b shows the removal efficiencies of otc using 7 agcn as a function of the initial concentrations under the dark condition the increase in initial concentrations resulting in decreased the removal efficiency of otc at low initial concentrations less than 50 mg l more unoccupied surface areas or active sites are available for removal of otc at initial concentrations above 50 mg l the removal efficiency of otc sharply dropped this can be explained because all active sites for further adsorption were almost occupied or saturated by otc 26 27 when the light on it can be observed that the decomposition efficiency of otc by 7 agcn was inhibited and the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies declined from 98 6 10 mg l 1 to 71 2 100 mg l the loss in photocatalytic efficiency due to the enhanced competition effect for reactive species between otc and the generated otc by products 26 30 3 2 3 stability and reusability of 7 agcn photocatlyst the recovery and recycling ability of ag doped g c3n4 was studied by repeating the photocatalytic reactions a minimum of five times fig 5 after each experiment the photocatalyst was merely collected washing with 50 ml solution containing 10 h2o2 and then drying at 50 c before being continuously reused for a new cycle the removal efficiency of otc after 5 cycles is shown in fig 5 it can be seen that efficiency of otc was decreased by only 13 8 after five cycles corresponding to 84 8 degradation using the recovered catalyst this slight reduction in otc degradation efficiency using recycled photocatalyst was attributed to some loss of material during its recovery via washing process based on the result 7 agcn has potential for long term applications in photocatalytic degradation of toxic organic compounds under visible light 3 2 4 proposal mechanism in order to investigate the free radicals species for the photocatalyst oxidation of otc a series of experimental were conducted p benzoquinone bq is a scavenger of o2 whereas ethanol etoh and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta 2na were adopted for the prevalence of oh and h respectively fig 6 a showed the degradation of otc with and without the present of quenchers the degradation of otc rapidly decreased by adding bq and edta 2na indicated that o2 and h played an important role in the photo degradation of otc 28 31 however in addition of etoh the decomposition of tc only slightly decreased less than 25 5 of tc was degraded which demonstrates that o2 and h are the predominant oxidative species for tc degradation using 7 agcn 3 2 5 identification of intermediates and mineralization analysis the reduction of tocs during photocatalytic decomposition of otc by using g c3n4 and 7 agcn were identified the mineralization progress was identified by checking the total organic carbon toc of the samples by using toc analyzer model toc 463 hatachi co japan the reduction of toc was calculated following the eq 2 2 toc removal 1 toct toco 100 where toco mg l and toct value mg l are the total organic carbon values of test solution at reaction time 0 and t min during the reaction respectively from fig 6 b it can be seen that within 120 min of reaction time the toc removal efficiency reaches to 64 8 and 98 3 for g c3n4 and 7 agcn respectively the reduction of toc by ag doped g c3n4 was much higher than that of g c3n4 in addition high removal of toc indicated that otc was completely degraded into co2 and h2o 31 32 to determine the concentration variations of otc and intermediates during the photocatalytic reactions liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was performed from fig s3 it can be seen that the main peak of the initial otc sample appearing at an elution time of approximately 20 min significantly reduced with the increase in the irradiation time after 120 min of visible light irradiation the main otc peak was totally disappeared indicating the complete decomposition of tc during the photocatalytic reaction eventually these intermediates were further mineralized to the co2 and h2o 3 2 6 possible photocatalytic mechanism the degradation of otc through photocatalysis is based mainly in the formation of chemical radicals when the 7 agcn is activated by light the results from xps and uv vis analysis confirmed that introduction of ag successfully narrowed the band gap of g c3n4 from 2 71 to 2 46 ev which could be activated by visible light during photocatalytic degradation of otc the incident photons that have the required band gap energy will promote the transfer of electrons from the catalyst valence band vb to the conduction band cb forming e h pairs then the photoexcited e in the cb of g c3n4 can migrate to the cb of ag the electron in the cb of ag is picked up by oxygen to generate superoxide o2 radical anion while the hole left in the vb will react with adsorbed water to produce hydroxyl oh radicals the generated holes and o2 can react with h2o molecules to produce oh radicals 15 19 therefore the photocatalytic activity of ag doped g c3n4 would be attributed to the oxidation species o2 and oh and the otc was degraded into smaller intermediates and finally into co2 and h2o 30 31 3 2 7 the application of catalysts for antibiotic removal in wastewater to evaluate the universality of ag doped g c3n4 in the degradation of complex antibiotic wastewater the samples containing several common antibiotics such as tetracycline tc and gatifloxacin gfa along with otc were applied as antibiotic model organic pollutants see in fig 7 additionally the removal efficiencies of otc tc and gfa within 120 min were 94 5 81 8 and 67 3 respectively the result fully demonstrated that the agcn photocatalyst exhibited a superior degradation effect for antibiotics especially for otc and tc 4 conclusions in summary ag doped g c3n4 photocatlyst was successfully synthesized with high photocatalytic decomposition of antibiotic contaminants the loading of ag onto g c3n4 not only increased the active sites and number of pore volume but also drastically improved the generation of photo induced e and h pairs the narrow of bandgap energy leading to greatly improved the photocatalytic decomposition of otc it was clearly demonstrated that otc can be effectively decomposed by o2 and oh free radical oxidation during the photocatalytic degradation processes the principal intermediates of otc degradation were identified and the possible pathways of degradation were also proposed under optimal conditions the otc degradation rate retained at 85 6 after seven consecutive runs which indicated that the satisfactory stability and reusability of photocatalyst additionally 7 agcn was applied to remove the complex antibiotic pollutants from wastewater ag doped g c3n4 showed excellent the removal efficiency of oct and tc in wastewater based on these results ag doped g c3n4 can be potentially utilized in the field of antibiotics degradation declaration of competing interest the authors do not have any conflict of interests to declare acknowledgments this

of dialysis on the other hand the spes sio2 ch2 3 sh membrane adsorbs more cd2 than pb2 ions which represents another outcome for pb2 cd2 separation keywords lead and cadmium separation silica membrane ion exchanger functionalized silica 1 introduction heavy metals can be considered as the elements having a specific gravity greater than 5 1 and an atomic mass less than 200 6 u atomic mass unit elements are known as light metals with a mass below 40 u in the last few decades the production of heavy metals containing wastewater was strongly increased due to the rapid development of industries such as mining processing the fertilizer industry tanneries batteries paper and metal plating 2 in the environment heavy metals are not biodegradable and persist longer in a natural environment than organic pollutants they can be transported in soils depending on the ph of the medium and can be leached to an aquifer or introduced in living organisms 3 the highest toxicity of these elements in the ionic form is found in the most stable oxidation states e g cd2 pb2 hg2 ag and as3 where they react with bio molecules leading to stable biotoxic compounds which are difficult to be dissociated 4 many techniques have been employed for the elimination of heavy metals from wastewater including chemical precipitation adsorption membrane filtration and ion exchange 2 5 6 the exposure to lead and cadmium results in a higher risk of several chronic diseases frailty and even death 7 these metals are widely used in heavy industries as process vessels jewelry batteries shield and bullet production 8 and may occur in wastewater the removal of lead and cadmium from water in particular was studied before for example the removal of pb2 and cd2 ions from aqueous media by adsorption on montmorillonite 9 was explored it was found that lead is more retained by the clay than cadmium on the other hand kaolinite clay was used as adsorbent to eliminate pb2 and cd2 where it was noted that phosphate modified kaolinite favors the adsorption of metal ions from industrial wastewaters even in the presence of low concentrations of electrolytes membrane separation processes were found a feasible and promising alternative for heavy metals removal because of their high efficiency and ease of operation 10 in a previous study polymer inclusion membranes pims were prepared and employed for the elimination of pb2 and cd2 ions the membranes were made of cellulose acetate using tributyl phosphate tbp as carrier and 2 nitro phenyl octyl ether npoe or tris ethylhexyl phosphate tehp as plasticizer furthermore the effect of pim coupled with a photo chemical electrode was examined 11 the results showed that pb2 transport increased using the modified pim due to the electrode polyethersulfone pes is a polymer typically used for membrane preparation due to its mechanical thermal and chemical stabilities as well as its capability to be chemically modified 12 it was employed for the removal of heavy metals 13 in particular also for pb2 and cd2 ions 12 14 sulfonation is the most common route to produce pes cation exchange membranes 15 and either an amphiphilic or semi amphiphilic material 16 the resulting spes membranes have been used for separation purposes 17 the sulfonating agent that has been commonly employed for pes polymer is the chlorosulfonic acid hclso3 18 19 but its toxicity encouraged the use of other chemicals as sulfuric acid h2so4 which is already used for preparing spes membranes 20 21 in the present work for the same reason spes polymer was developed by sulfonation of pes polymer with sulfuric acid then the prepared spes membranes were used for the elimination and the separation of pb2 and cd2 ions from water on the other hand the elimination of metal ions from aqueous solutions can be improved by introducing functionalized silica particles in membrane matrix 22 the effective functionalization of silica can be feasible by using the appropriate groups such as amine and thiol groups which are widely used and incorporated in the membrane structure 23 26 in view of the previous findings the objective of the present work is to improve the elimination and separation of pb2 and cd2 ions by introducing amine and thiol functionalized silica nanoparticles in the spes membrane matrix such membranes can present an adsorption effect in addition to ion exchange due to the attractive interactions that can occur between silica particles nitrogen and sulfur groups with metal cations this can promote the elimination and separation of pb2 and cd2 present in aqueous solutions 27 2 experimental 2 1 materials the type of polyethersulfone pes used in the present work is radel 3100p with an average molecular weight of 35 000 g mol it was kindly supplied by solvay belgium sulfuric acid h2so4 98 was purchased from rectapur n n dimethylformamide dmf 99 used as solvent was procured from vwr international nitric acid silica ludox hs 40 sio2 40 in water 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes 98 and 3 mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane mptms 95 were purchased from sigma aldrich chemicals metal salts pb no3 2 and cd no3 2 4h2o were provided from biochem and fluka begium respectively 2 2 sulfonation of polyethersulfone sulfuric acid h2so4 was employed as a sulfonating agent for pes 20 g of pes was treated with 100 ml of concentrated h2so4 acid in a glass reactor the reaction is carried out under vigorous stirring at 50 c for 20 h leading to a partial sulfonation 20 the resulting spes was progressively precipitated into ice cold deionized water afterwards the spes was washed several times with deionized water until neutral ph ph 7 to remove the excess of sulfuric acid 2 3 functionalization of silica particles ludox hs 40 was used as a source of silica nanoparticles the functionalization of silica with amine groups was carried out by silica surface modification with 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes first 5 ml ludox hs 40 was dispersed in 100 ml of ethanol powered by ultrasound during 10 min in order to homogenize the mixture the ph was adjusted to 4 0 by addition of 1 m nitic acid to obtain a good dispersion of particles 28 then 1 ml of aptes was added to the mixture the reaction was performed with continuous stirring during 20 h at room temperature the amine functionalized silica particles were obtained by centrifugation at 11 000 rpm for 30 min the formed precipitate particles were then purified through triple washes with ethanol and dried at 80 c during 8 h the functionalization of silica with the thiol groups was realized by the same method as previously stated except that 1 ml of mptms was added to the mixture instead of aptes in order to functionalize the silica with sh groups 2 4 membrane preparation the prepared spes was dissolved at 18 wt in dmf solvent for preparing neat membranes in addition spes was also dissolved at 17 5 wt in dmf with 0 5 wt of sio2 sio2 ch3 3 nh2 or sio2 ch3 3 sh for preparing hybrid membranes all mixtures were homogenized with mechanical stirring overnight the dispersion of nanoparticles in spes polymer dissolved in dmf was carried out by ultrasonication for 30 min the membranes were then prepared by casting on a glass plate using a knife with a slit of 250 μm and were dried in a vacuum oven at 55 c overnight the prepared membranes were stored in deionized water at 5 c the reference of prepared membranes and the composition of the casting solutions for all membranes are shown in table 1 2 5 metal ions exchange the elimination of pb2 and cd2 ions in aqueous solution was studied by means of a simple donnan dialysis separation the dialysis cell was composed of two compartments containing 50 ml of the feed and strip solutions on each side synthetic solutions were prepared at neutral ph and all experiments were carried out at ambient temperature 23 1 c a continuous mechanical stirring was applied in order to homogenize the solutions the membrane effective surface area was 9 62 cm2 and the time of the ion exchange process was 8 h the regeneration of the membranes was carried out by chloric acid 0 1 n several wash cycles were used to eliminate the excess of acidity the metal concentrations were determined by sampling each 1 h aliquots the analysis was carried out with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer perkin elmer analyst 700 and error bars represent the standard deviation 2 6 characterization 2 6 1 structure and composition of membranes the structure of the developed pristine and hybrid membranes was studied by xrd analysis using a mini diffractometer md 10 equipped with cu kα x ray radiation in order to reveal the chemical composition of membranes even for hybrid ones atr ftir spectroscopy analysis was carried out an atr ftir spectrometer perkin elmer spectrum 100 germany was used equipped with platinum diamond for single reflection the spectra range was settled at 4000 400 cm1 with a resolution of 1 cm1 the surface morphology of the membranes was studied by sem analysis using a philips microscope xl30 feg the netherlands the samples were sputter coated with platinum nanoparticles before analysis in addition the chemical composition of membranes surfaces was determined by edx spectroscopy of a membrane area during sem analysis 2 6 2 membrane performance the water uptake or the equilibrium water content ewc was calculated according eq 1 first membranes must be dried at 50 c overnight and then weighed after that the membranes were soaked in 250 ml of distilled water for 1 day the wetted membranes were dried by filter paper to eliminate water droplets on the surface of the membranes and immediately weighed the water content was determined as 1 e w c w w w d w w 100 where ww and wd are the weight of wet and dry membranes respectively the hydrophilicity of surface membrane is an important parameter a more hydrophilic surface has a better antifouling resistance 29 the contact angle measurement was carried out by a kruss device dsa 10 mk2 germany a small flat sheet of the membrane was dried at 50 c during 2 h and a droplet of milli q water was deposed on the membrane surface the contact angle was measured within 10 s the ion exchange capacity was calculated as the concentration of sulfonic acid groups per dry membrane weight according to eq 2 in view of this a membrane was soaked in 1 mol l hcl then it was washed with distilled water to eliminate the excess of acid after that it was immersed in 1 mol l nacl solution the amount of protons h liberated from the membrane was determined by titration with 0 01 mol l naoh solution using phenolphthalein as color indicator 15 the degree of sulfonation ds of pes can be calculated by various methods such as 1h nmr elemental analysis ir spectra and acid base titration 30 31 herein we have used the titration method and ds is calculated according to eq 3 2 i e c c n a o h v n a o h w d 3 d s 0 244 c n a o h v n a o h w d 0 081 c n a o h v n a o h 100 where cnaoh and vnaoh are the concentration and volume of naoh respectively wd is the dry weight of the membrane 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization the synthesized membranes were analyzed by xrd in order to reveal the crystallinity of all synthesized membranes fig 1 shows the xrd patterns of the pristine and hybrid membranes from fig 1 the pattern of the pristine spes membrane shows an amorphous structure while the patterns of the hybrid membranes containing silica and functional silica nanoparticles represent a crystalline structures which could be related to the introduction of colloidal silica nanoparticles in the membrane polymer 32 the structure of pristine spes membranes is generally amorphous 33 the introduction of silica particles in the spes polymer resulting in the attraction between polymer chains and silica surfaces leads to an interfacial layer with reduced chain mobility conducting to different crystallization behavior than that the bulk polymer 34 35 the chemical functional groups in the membranes structure were identified by ftir atr analysis in fig 2 a ftir atr spectra of pes and spes membranes are shown comparing the ftir atr spectra of pes and spes membranes both membranes presented the characteristic peaks of pes membranes 29 while a new peak appeared at 102 679 cm 1 for the spes membrane corresponding to the symmetric stretching vibrations of the aromatic so3h this confirms the successful sulfonation of pes 33 on the other hand in fig 2 b the incorporation of silica nanoparticles was detected by the appearance of new bonds at 850 and at 960 cm 1 which are attributed to the to the symmetric stretching of si o si groups and the stretching of si oh groups respectively 36 another one near 1390 cm 1 corresponds to the deformation vibration of oh 37 probably associated to silica particles the surface sem analysis represented in fig 3 reveals the surface state of the synthesized membranes some aggregated particles of silica were noted on the hybrid membrane surfaces it can be seen that the aggregations are more important in the case of non functionalized silica fig 3b compared to functionalized silica fig 3c and fig 3d this is due to the hydrogen band between hydroxyls groups of silica particles leading to the formation of aggregates this effect was decreased with functionalized silica particles edx was further used to confirm the functionalized groups of silica and eventually the presence of functionalized silica in different membranes table 3 represents the different elements in silica functionalized particles and the elements present in different synthesized membranes from table 2 the functionalization of silica was confirmed by the presence of carbon and nitrogen in the case of functionalization of silica with 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane and the presence of carbon and sulfur in the case of functionalization of silica with 3 mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane table 2 summarizes even the percentages of all detectable elements present in the different membranes which confirmed that the silica and the functionalized silica particles were successfully incorporated in the membranes matrix 3 2 membrane performance the water uptake values of spes and hybrid spes membranes were measured and summarized in table 3 it was found that the water uptake was increased by adding silica and functionalized silica particles compared with pristine spes membrane however the ewc measured with the spes sio2 membrane was higher than for membranes modified with functionalized silica this is due to the strong hydrophilicity of silica particles likewise the contact angle decreased for the hybrid membrane compared with the pristine spes membrane table 3 and the best hydrophilicity was noted with the spes sio2 membrane again due to the hydrophilicity of the silica particles the ion exchange capacity iec was calculated as well it was 1 05 meq g for the pristine spes membrane which increased to 1 82 meq g for the spes sio2 membrane a further raise of the iec was then observed when functionalized silica was introduced in an spes membrane this is due to the contribution of silica nitrogen and sulfur functions on the removal of metal cations from a feed solution the best iec was recorded for the spes sio2 ch2 3 nh2 membrane the degree of sulfonation of spes was calculated by titration it was 27 12 which is in good agreement with the literature 38 3 3 elimination and separation of pb2 and cd2 ions in the following the study of removal of pb2 and cd2 ions was carried out first the cations were treated separately subsequently the mixture of the two cations pb2 cd2 was studied the adsorbed amount of metal ions in the membrane matrix was calculated by the difference between the feed and the strip concentrations 3 3 1 elimination of pb2 ions a solution containing 50 ppm mg l of pb2 at neutral ph was used as feed solution in a dialysis process the kinetics of removal of pb2 ions from the feed compartment are shown in fig 4 the fixed quantity of pb2 ions in the membrane matrix is represented in table 5 from fig 4 it can be observed that the elimination of pb2 from the feed compartment increases with time for all membranes the elimination of metal ions occurs by means of ion exchange the removed amount of pb2 ions was increased when silica and functionalized silica were introduced in spes membranes the elimination yield followed the order spes spes sio2 spes sio2 ch2 3 sh spes sio2 ch2 3 nh2 the elimination of pb2 was accelerated when the silica particles were introduced this is due to the hydrophilic character of the silica particles on the other hand the removal yield was improved by adding functional silica the functional groups of nitrogen and sulfur facilitate the transport of pb2 ions through the membrane whereby the nh2 group was more efficient than the sh group the adsorbed amount of pb2 ions in the membrane matrix increased with time for all membranes table 4 these ions were adsorbed on either the fixed sulfonic groups or in the membrane matrix the amounts of fixed pb2 varied according to the membrane composition where the fixation yield for different membranes respect the same order as that observed for the elimination spes spes sio2 spes sio2 ch2 3 sh spes sio2 ch2 3 nh2 generally the removed metal ions are transported to the strip side by ion exchange however a part of the eliminated metal cations from the feed compartment can be adsorbed and fixed in the membrane matrix by means of complexation reactions 39 in this case silica particles had the potential to adsorb metal ions in the other hand nh2 and sh groups formed complexes with pb2 and cd2 cations in membrane matrix 27 40 41 3 3 2 elimination of cd2 ions a solution containing 50 ppm of cd2 at neutral ph was used as feed solution the kinetics of elimination of cd2 is shown in fig 5 from fig 5 it can be noted that the elimination of cd2 from the feed compartment is almost similar to that of pb2 elimination but it has a lower effect the cd2 ion elimination increased with time for all membranes and the introduction of silica and functional silica particles on spes matrix increased the cd2 elimination with the same order spes spes sio2 spes sio2 ch2 3 sh spes sio2 ch2 nh2 moreover the elimination of cd2 ion was lower than that of pb2 for each membrane this could represent an affinity of sulfonic groups towards pb2 and a more effective contribution of additive silica and functional silica particles on pb2 elimination the adsorbed amount of cd2 ions in the membrane matrix is shown in table 5 the fixation of cd2 ions increased with time for all membranes however an enhanced cd2 ions adsorption was noted for membrane 4 spes sio2 ch2 3 sh this suggests that the sh group is more efficient for fixation of cd2 ions than pb2 ions which is in agreement with previous results 40 the fixation order became spes spes sio2 spes sio2 ch2 nh2 spes sio2 ch2 3 sh the optimal removal rates of pb2 and cd2 cations treated separately were 30 1 and 27 2 respectively after 8 h of dialysis these values are satisfactory compared with previous studies 42 3 3 3 elimination and separation of mixture of cd2 pb2 ions a solution containing a mixture of pb2 cd2 at 50 ppm for each ion was employed as feed solution the elimination and separation of cd2 and pb2 cations is summarized in fig 6 from fig 6 it can be noted that the elimination of pb2 in the mixture pb2 cd2 is more significant than that of cd2 for all membranes furthermore the total elimination yield for both metallic cations was increased by using hybrid membranes where the more efficient membrane was spes sio2 ch2 3 nh2 and the elimination order was spes spes sio2 spes sio2 ch2 3 sh spes sio2 ch2 3 nh2 the pes sio2 ch2 3 nh2 membrane performed a cation elimination about 43 2 and 31 6 for pb2 and cd2 respectively after 8 h on the other hand for the same time the pes sio2 ch2 3 sh membrane eliminated 40 8 and 26 9 of pb2 and cd2 respectively in the following the kinetics of elimination of the mixture of pb2 and cd2 ions for membrane 3 and 4 are studied fig 7 represents the elimination kinetics a significant elimination of pb2 ions from a feed solution compared with cd2 ions was registered using membrane 3 spes sio2 ch2 3 nh2 after 2 h of dialysis the removal of pb2 ions was estimated at 36 4 versus 9 2 for cd2 ions thus membrane 3 could selectively separate pb2 from cd2 ions in the feed solution on the other hand regarding the adsorbed amounts of metallic cations on the membrane matrix table 6 higher fixed amounts of cd2 ions were noted for membrane 4 spes sio2 ch2 3 sh after 8 h of treatment compared with pb2 ions the adsorbed amounts were estimated at 26 8 mg g for cd2 ions versus 12 1 mg g for pb2 ions hence in the strip compartment about 32 for pb2 was measured versus about 8 for cd2 ions which can presented a new strategy of selective separation of the two metallic cations in the strip solution such elimination and separation of pb2 and cd2 ions present in the aqueous media cannot be achieved using existing commercial ion exchange membranes hence this kind of membranes has potential for large scale applications 4 conclusion spes ion exchange membranes were successfully prepared by sulfonation of polyethersulfone using sulfuric acid silica and functional silica particles were introduced in an spes membrane matrix in order to promote the elimination and the separation of pb2 and cd2 ions present in aqueous solutions the elimination of both metallic cations was enhanced using silica hybrid membranes following the order spes spes sio2 spes sio2 ch2 3 sh spes sio2 ch2 3 nh2 the enhanced elimination rate of the mixture pb2 cd2 was 43 2 and 31 6 for pb2 and cd2 respectively the separation between pb2 and cd2 ions could be optimized by a simple dialysis using the spes sio2 ch2 nh2 membrane during 2 h the removal rate for pb2 ions was 36 4 whereas it was only 9 2 for cd2 at 2 h on the other hand the spes sio2 ch2 3 sh membrane performed during 8 h of dialysis an adsorption of 24 6 mg g versus 12 1 mg g for pb2 and cd2 ions respectively hence a significant separation between pb2 and cd2 ions can be obtained in the strip phase

of dialysis on the other hand the spes sio2 ch2 3 sh membrane adsorbs more cd2 than pb2 ions which represents another outcome for pb2 cd2 separation keywords lead and cadmium separation silica

improve the elimination and separation of pb2 and cd2 ions by introducing amine and thiol functionalized silica nanoparticles in the spes membrane matrix such membranes can present an adsorption effect in addition to ion exchange due to the attractive interactions that can occur between silica particles nitrogen and sulfur groups with metal cations this can promote the elimination and separation of pb2 and cd2 present in aqueous solutions 27 2 experimental 2 1 materials the type of polyethersulfone pes used in the present work is radel 3100p with an average molecular weight of 35 000 g mol it was kindly supplied by solvay belgium sulfuric acid h2so4 98 was purchased from rectapur n n dimethylformamide dmf 99 used as solvent was procured from vwr international nitric acid silica ludox hs 40 sio2 40 in water 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes 98 and 3 mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane mptms 95 were purchased from sigma aldrich chemicals metal salts pb no3 2 and cd no3 2 4h2o were provided from biochem and fluka begium respectively 2 2 sulfonation of polyethersulfone sulfuric acid h2so4 was employed as a sulfonating agent for pes 20 g of pes was treated with 100 ml of concentrated h2so4 acid in a glass reactor the reaction is carried out under vigorous stirring at 50 c for 20 h leading to a partial sulfonation 20 the resulting spes was progressively precipitated into ice cold deionized water afterwards the spes was washed several times with deionized water until neutral ph ph 7 to remove the excess of sulfuric acid 2 3 functionalization of silica particles ludox hs 40 was used as a source of silica nanoparticles the functionalization of silica with amine groups was carried out by silica surface modification with 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes first 5 ml ludox hs 40 was dispersed in 100 ml of ethanol powered by ultrasound during 10 min in order to homogenize the mixture the ph was adjusted to 4 0 by addition of 1 m nitic acid to obtain a good dispersion of particles 28 then 1 ml of aptes was added to the mixture the reaction was performed with continuous stirring during 20 h at room temperature the amine functionalized silica particles were obtained by centrifugation at 11 000 rpm for 30 min the formed precipitate particles were then purified through triple washes with ethanol and dried at 80 c during 8 h the functionalization of silica with the thiol groups was realized by the same method as previously stated except that 1 ml of mptms was added to the mixture instead of aptes in order to functionalize the silica with sh groups 2 4 membrane preparation the prepared spes was dissolved at 18 wt in dmf solvent for preparing neat membranes in addition spes was also dissolved at 17 5 wt in dmf with 0 5 wt of sio2 sio2 ch3 3 nh2 or sio2 ch3 3 sh for preparing hybrid membranes all mixtures were homogenized with mechanical stirring overnight the dispersion of nanoparticles in spes polymer dissolved in dmf was carried out by ultrasonication for 30 min the membranes were then prepared by casting on a glass plate using a knife with a slit of 250 μm and were dried in a vacuum oven at 55 c overnight the prepared membranes were stored in deionized water at 5 c the reference of prepared membranes and the composition of the casting solutions for all membranes are shown in table 1 2 5 metal ions exchange the elimination of pb2 and cd2 ions in aqueous solution was studied by means of a simple donnan dialysis separation the dialysis cell was composed of two compartments containing 50 ml of the feed and strip solutions on each side synthetic solutions were prepared at neutral ph and all experiments were carried out at ambient temperature 23 1 c a continuous mechanical stirring was applied in order to homogenize the solutions the membrane effective surface area was 9 62 cm2 and the time of the ion exchange process was 8 h the regeneration of the membranes was carried out by chloric acid 0 1 n several wash cycles were used to eliminate the excess of acidity the metal concentrations were determined by sampling each 1 h aliquots the analysis was carried out with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer perkin elmer analyst 700 and error bars represent the standard deviation 2 6 characterization 2 6 1 structure and composition of membranes the structure of the developed pristine and hybrid membranes was studied by xrd analysis using a mini diffractometer md 10 equipped with cu kα x ray radiation in order to reveal the chemical composition of membranes even for hybrid ones atr ftir spectroscopy analysis was carried out an atr ftir spectrometer perkin elmer spectrum 100 germany was used equipped with platinum diamond for single reflection the spectra range was settled at 4000 400 cm1 with a resolution of 1 cm1 the surface morphology of the membranes was studied by sem analysis using a philips microscope xl30 feg the netherlands the samples were sputter coated with platinum nanoparticles before analysis in addition the chemical composition of membranes surfaces was determined by edx spectroscopy of a membrane area during sem analysis 2 6 2 membrane performance the water uptake or the equilibrium water content ewc was calculated according eq 1 first membranes must be dried at 50 c overnight and then weighed after that the membranes were soaked in 250 ml of distilled water for 1 day the wetted membranes were dried by filter paper to eliminate water droplets on the surface of the membranes and immediately weighed the water content was determined as 1 e w c w w w d w w 100 where ww and wd are the weight of wet and dry membranes respectively the hydrophilicity of surface membrane is an important parameter a more hydrophilic surface has a better antifouling resistance 29 the contact angle measurement was carried out by a kruss device dsa 10 mk2 germany a small flat sheet of the membrane was dried at 50 c during 2 h and a droplet of milli q water was deposed on the membrane surface the contact angle was measured within 10 s the ion exchange capacity was calculated as the concentration of sulfonic acid groups per dry membrane weight according to eq 2 in view of this a membrane was soaked in 1 mol l hcl then it was washed with distilled water to eliminate the excess of acid after that it was immersed in 1 mol l nacl solution the amount of protons h liberated from the membrane was determined by titration with 0 01 mol l naoh solution using phenolphthalein as color indicator 15 the degree of sulfonation ds of pes can be calculated by various methods such as 1h nmr elemental analysis ir spectra and acid base titration 30 31 herein we have used the titration method and ds is calculated according to eq 3 2 i e c c n a o h v n a o h w d 3 d s 0 244 c n a o h v n a o h w d 0 081 c n a o h v n a o h 100 where cnaoh and vnaoh are the concentration and volume of naoh respectively wd is the dry weight of the membrane 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization the synthesized membranes were analyzed by xrd in order to reveal the crystallinity of all synthesized membranes fig 1 shows the xrd patterns of the pristine and hybrid membranes from fig 1 the pattern of the pristine spes membrane shows an amorphous structure while the patterns of the hybrid membranes containing silica and functional silica nanoparticles represent a crystalline structures which could be related to the introduction of colloidal silica nanoparticles in the membrane polymer 32 the structure of pristine spes membranes is generally amorphous 33 the introduction of silica particles in the spes polymer resulting in the attraction between polymer chains and silica surfaces leads to an interfacial layer with reduced chain mobility conducting to different crystallization behavior than that the bulk polymer 34 35 the chemical functional groups in the membranes structure were identified by ftir atr analysis in fig 2 a ftir atr spectra of pes and spes membranes are shown comparing the ftir atr spectra of pes and spes membranes both membranes presented the characteristic peaks of pes membranes 29 while a new peak appeared at 102 679 cm 1 for the spes membrane corresponding to the symmetric stretching vibrations of the aromatic so3h this confirms the successful sulfonation of pes 33 on the other hand in fig 2 b the incorporation of silica nanoparticles was detected by the appearance of new bonds at 850 and at 960 cm 1 which are attributed to the to the symmetric stretching of si o si groups and the stretching of si oh groups respectively 36 another one near 1390 cm 1 corresponds to the deformation vibration of oh 37 probably associated to silica particles the surface sem analysis represented in fig 3 reveals the surface state of the synthesized membranes some aggregated particles of silica were noted on the hybrid membrane surfaces it can be seen that the aggregations are more important in the case of non functionalized silica fig 3b compared to functionalized silica fig 3c and fig 3d this is due to the hydrogen band between hydroxyls groups of silica particles leading to the formation of aggregates this effect was decreased with functionalized silica particles edx was further used to confirm the functionalized groups of silica and eventually the presence of functionalized silica in different membranes table 3 represents the different elements in silica functionalized particles and the elements present in different synthesized membranes from table 2 the functionalization of silica was confirmed by the presence of carbon and nitrogen in the case of functionalization of silica with 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane and the presence of carbon and sulfur in the case of functionalization of silica with 3 mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane table 2 summarizes even the percentages of all detectable elements present in the different membranes which confirmed that the silica and the functionalized silica particles were successfully incorporated in the membranes matrix 3 2 membrane performance the water uptake values of spes and hybrid spes membranes were measured and summarized in table 3 it was found that the water uptake was increased by adding silica and functionalized silica particles compared with pristine spes membrane however the ewc measured with the spes sio2 membrane was higher than for membranes modified with functionalized silica this is due to the strong hydrophilicity of silica particles likewise the contact angle decreased for the hybrid membrane compared with the pristine spes membrane table 3 and the best hydrophilicity was noted with the spes sio2 membrane again due to the hydrophilicity of the silica particles the ion exchange capacity iec was calculated as well it was 1 05 meq g for the pristine spes membrane which increased to 1 82 meq g for the spes sio2 membrane a further raise of the iec was then observed when functionalized silica was introduced in an spes membrane this is due to the contribution of silica nitrogen and sulfur functions on the removal of metal cations from a feed solution the best iec was recorded for the spes sio2 ch2 3 nh2 membrane the degree of sulfonation of spes was calculated by titration it was 27 12 which is in good agreement with the literature 38 3 3 elimination and separation of pb2 and cd2 ions in the following the study of removal of pb2 and cd2 ions was carried out first the cations were treated separately subsequently the mixture of the two cations pb2 cd2 was studied the adsorbed amount of metal ions in the membrane matrix was calculated by the difference between the feed and the strip concentrations 3 3 1 elimination of pb2 ions a solution containing 50 ppm mg l of pb2 at neutral ph was used as feed solution in a dialysis process the kinetics of removal of pb2 ions from the feed compartment are shown in fig 4 the fixed quantity of pb2 ions in the membrane matrix is represented in table 5 from fig 4 it can be observed that the elimination of pb2 from the feed compartment increases with time for all membranes the elimination of metal ions occurs by means of ion exchange the removed amount of pb2 ions was increased when silica and functionalized silica were introduced in spes membranes the elimination yield followed the order spes spes sio2 spes sio2 ch2 3 sh spes sio2 ch2 3 nh2 the elimination of pb2 was accelerated when the silica particles were introduced this is due to the hydrophilic character of the silica particles on the other hand the removal yield was improved by adding functional silica the functional groups of nitrogen and sulfur facilitate the transport of pb2 ions through the membrane whereby the nh2 group was more efficient than the sh group the adsorbed amount of pb2 ions in the membrane matrix increased with time for all membranes table 4 these ions were adsorbed on either the fixed sulfonic groups or in the membrane matrix the amounts of fixed pb2 varied according to the membrane composition where the fixation yield for different membranes respect the same order as that observed for the elimination spes spes sio2 spes sio2 ch2 3 sh spes sio2 ch2 3 nh2 generally the removed metal ions are transported to the strip side by ion exchange however a part of the eliminated metal cations from the feed compartment can be adsorbed and fixed in the membrane matrix by means of complexation reactions 39 in this case silica particles had the potential to adsorb metal ions in the other hand nh2 and sh groups formed complexes with pb2 and cd2 cations in membrane matrix 27 40 41 3 3 2 elimination of cd2 ions a solution containing 50 ppm of cd2 at neutral ph was used as feed solution the kinetics of elimination of cd2 is shown in fig 5 from fig 5 it can be noted that the elimination of cd2 from the feed compartment is almost similar to that of pb2 elimination but it has a lower effect the cd2 ion elimination increased with time for all membranes and the introduction of silica and functional silica particles on spes matrix increased the cd2 elimination with the same order spes spes sio2 spes sio2 ch2 3 sh spes sio2 ch2 nh2 moreover the elimination of cd2 ion was lower than that of pb2 for each membrane this could represent an affinity of sulfonic groups towards pb2 and a more effective contribution of additive silica and functional silica particles on pb2 elimination the adsorbed amount of cd2 ions in the membrane matrix is shown in table 5 the fixation of cd2 ions increased with time for all membranes however an enhanced cd2 ions adsorption was noted for membrane 4 spes sio2 ch2 3 sh this suggests that the sh group is more efficient for fixation of cd2 ions than pb2 ions which is in agreement with previous results 40 the fixation order became spes spes sio2 spes sio2 ch2 nh2 spes sio2 ch2 3 sh the optimal removal rates of pb2 and cd2 cations treated separately were 30 1 and 27 2 respectively after 8 h of dialysis these values are satisfactory compared with previous studies 42 3 3 3 elimination and separation of mixture of cd2 pb2 ions a solution containing a mixture of pb2 cd2 at 50 ppm for each ion was employed as feed solution the elimination and separation of cd2 and pb2 cations is summarized in fig 6 from fig 6 it can be noted that the elimination of pb2 in the mixture pb2 cd2 is more significant than that of cd2 for all membranes furthermore the total elimination yield for both metallic cations was increased by using hybrid membranes where the more efficient membrane was spes sio2 ch2 3 nh2 and the elimination order was spes spes sio2 spes sio2 ch2 3 sh spes sio2 ch2 3 nh2 the pes sio2 ch2 3 nh2 membrane performed a cation elimination about 43 2 and 31 6 for pb2 and cd2 respectively after 8 h on the other hand for the same time the pes sio2 ch2 3 sh membrane eliminated 40 8 and 26 9 of pb2 and cd2 respectively in the following the kinetics of elimination of the mixture of pb2 and cd2 ions for membrane 3 and 4 are studied fig 7 represents the elimination kinetics a significant elimination of pb2 ions from a feed solution compared with cd2 ions was registered using membrane 3 spes sio2 ch2 3 nh2 after 2 h of dialysis the removal of pb2 ions was estimated at 36 4 versus 9 2 for cd2 ions thus membrane 3 could selectively separate pb2 from cd2 ions in the feed solution on the other hand regarding the adsorbed amounts of metallic cations on the membrane matrix table 6 higher fixed amounts of cd2 ions were noted for membrane 4 spes sio2 ch2 3 sh after 8 h of treatment compared with pb2 ions the adsorbed amounts were estimated at 26 8 mg g for cd2 ions versus 12 1 mg g for pb2 ions hence in the strip compartment about 32 for pb2 was measured versus about 8 for cd2 ions which can presented a new strategy of selective separation of the two metallic cations in the strip solution such elimination and separation of pb2 and cd2 ions present in the aqueous media cannot be achieved using existing commercial ion exchange membranes hence this kind of membranes has potential for large scale applications 4 conclusion spes ion exchange membranes were successfully prepared by sulfonation of polyethersulfone using sulfuric acid silica and functional silica particles were introduced in an spes membrane matrix in order to promote the elimination and the separation of pb2 and cd2 ions present in aqueous solutions the elimination of both metallic cations was enhanced using silica hybrid membranes following the order spes spes sio2 spes sio2 ch2 3 sh spes sio2 ch2 3 nh2 the enhanced elimination rate of the mixture pb2 cd2 was 43 2 and 31 6 for pb2 and cd2 respectively the separation between pb2 and cd2 ions could be optimized by a simple dialysis using the spes sio2 ch2 nh2 membrane during 2 h the removal rate for pb2 ions was 36 4 whereas it was only 9 2 for cd2 at 2 h on the other hand the spes sio2 ch2 3 sh membrane performed during 8 h of dialysis an adsorption of 24 6 mg g versus 12 1 mg g for pb2 and cd2 ions respectively hence a significant separation between pb2 and cd2 ions can be obtained in the strip phase 
14262,surfactant enhanced oil recovery is a method used to augment residual oil extraction from reservoirshowever this kind of procedure can produce stable emulsions of water oil and oil water making the conventional treatment of the produced water more difficult this study evaluates the performance of ultrafiltration process using ceramic membranes for produced water treatment containing the cationic surfactant dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide dtab to better understand the process the effect of dtab and sodium chloride nacl on interfacial properties of oil water and oil water membrane such as surface tension membrane wetting zeta potential and adhesion map were investigated it was observed that the surfactant facilitates the oil phase adhesion to the membrane surface causing a permeate flux reduction on the other hand the presence of nacl in the oily emulsion containing dtab lead to a permeate flux increase which indicated that ionic strength modifies the interaction between the oil phase and the membrane surface considering the high salinity of the produced water it is possible to imply that the presence of surfactant can contribute to treatment by ultrafiltration process independent of surfactant presence in produced water the oil and grease cog content in the permeate stream was consistently lower than 5 mg l keywords produced water surfactants enhanced oil recovery ceramic membranes treatment 1 introduction primary and secondary recovery procedures are capable of recovering only about 35 of the oil contained in the reservoir 1 in order to extract residual oil in mature reservoirs enhanced oil recovery eor methods are applied among them chemical addition methods can be highlighted the purpose of chemicals is to modify the interaction between the fluid injected and the fluid contained in the reservoir with the rock three chemical categories are usually applied polymers surfactants and alkaline products either together or separately 2 injection of surfactant solutions has proven to be very efficient in increasing the degree of oil recovery it its caused by the amphiphilic characteristic of the surfactant i e each molecule has two functional groups a polar group hydrophilic and a nonpolar group hydrophobic which are capable of interacting with both water and oil leading to an improvement in the sweep efficiency and thus the recovery factor the hydrophobic group is generally comprised of a long hydrocarbon chain c8 and c18 which may be branched or not while the hydrophilic group is formed by moieties such as carboxylates sulfates sulfonates anionic alcohols nonionic and quaternary ammonium salts cationic 3 due to this structure the surfactant can be used to emulsify the oil by the strong reduction of interfacial tension ift or to alter the oil wettability in the reservoir 4 according to gary and handwerk 5 in presence of dissolved salt the surfactants accumulate at the interface oil water intensifying formation of an adsorbed film and ift reduction depending on the properties of the crude oil api gravity viscosity sulfur content salts metals among others the structure of adsorbed surfactant film can vary significantly the molecular packing surface viscosity surface elasticity and surface charge of the adsorbed film are key parameters that determine several phenomena such as the coalescence of emulsion droplets as well as the migration of oil droplets in porous media 3 different surfactants have been investigated with the purpose of altering the wettability of the reservoir rock and consequently increasing the oil recovery factor 6 among these products the cationics ones have the advantage of having the same surface charge as carbonate minerals standnes and austad 7 showed that cationic surfactants such as dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide dtab are highly efficient for this purpose being able to recover approximately 70 of original oil in place according to the authors this high rate could be related to the same surface charge presented by the carbonate minerals and the surfactant despite the many advantages related to advanced recovery chemical methods an important aspect to consider is the impact of chemicals in the produced water treatment cycle injection of surfactants can produce stable emulsions of water oil and oil water making the water treatment more difficult and less cost effective due to the need of more specific additives and equipment in order to keep the topside processing system efficient according to argillier et al 1 and deng et al 8 the additional treatment cost is one of the causes that limit application of this technology najamudin et al 9 mentioned that the use of surfactants could increase the water toxicity and affect the ecosystem hence produced water reuse reinjection can become indispensable when an eor is applied for oil recovery as pointed out by weschenfelder et al 10 11 the use of ceramic membranes has shown great potential for produced water treatment specially when the goal is the reinjection in restrictive reservoirs i e low water injectivity by making the effluent practically free of suspended solids and dispersed oils and greases in this sense the objective of this work was to evaluate the effect a surfactant has on the ultrafiltration process using ceramic membranes for produced water treatment dtab was chosen for this study due to its potential application for eor for a better understanding of the process the effect of dtab and salinity on interfacial properties of water oil membrane system by measuring surface tension wetting electrokinetic potential and oil adhesion was investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 membrane this study was carried out with zirconium oxide supported by tio2 al2o3 multi channel membranes acquired from likuid nanotek with 0 1 μm pore size 0 003 m channel diameter 0 2 m length and 0 0019 m2 surface area 2 2 synthetic produced water crude oil 28 1 api gravity was emulsified at 50 c by using ultra turrax model t 50 at the speed of 11 000 rpm during 5 min the average concentration of oil and grease cog and salt content cs were kept at 100 5 mg l and 100 000 mg l respectively which is usually found in offshore treatment units for sake of comparison oily water with no salinity was also investigated due to the difficulty of predicting surfactant concentration in produced water it was decided to evaluate its influence up to the maximum concentration commonly injected 1 000 mg l the emulsified particle size was then determined by malvern mastersizer 3000e equipment the procedure and conditions applied in this work were based on the study conducted by weschenfelder et al 10 12 2 3 permeation of synthetic produced water the permeation set up used in the tests is shown in fig 1 it consists of a permeation module capable of accommodating a permeation element ceramic membrane a positive displacement recirculation pump pressure gauges flow meter feed tank with mechanical stiring and a tank for permeate mass data collection the transmembrane pressure δp of 2 0 bar and across flow velocity of 2 0 m s re 6000 were selected according to the values proposed by weschenfelder et al 10 as stated by these authors the permeation time of 60 min can be considered sufficient for the permeate flux stabilization the feed temperature 50 2 c was chosen considering normal operating conditions found in offshore treatment plants of produced water 13 during permeation experiments cog and surfactant concentration were periodically measured in feed and permeate streams cog and dtab concentration were measured with a spectrophotometer hach dr 2800 according to the astm d3921 method and a spectrophotometer uv vis hach dr 6000 respectively 2 4 interfacial properties 2 4 1 cmc determination surfactant critical micelle concentration cmc was determined by measuring the interfacial tension of the solutions with a spinning drop tensiometer svt 20 dataphysics each measurement was performed after oil solution contact time of twenty minutes 2 4 2 contact angle determination the pendant drop method was applied to evaluate the contact angle between the oil droplets and the membrane surface by using oca 15 dataphysics goniometer for the evaluation one drop of oil 1 μl was placed in contact with the membrane surface immersed in the solution for each experimental condition the static drop image was captured it is noteworthy that for these experiments zro2 membranes were supplied by likuid nanotek in flat conformation with similar characteristics to tubular membranes used in the permeation tests 2 4 3 adhesion mapping the adhesion test was carried out in order to verify the oil membrane adhesion in presence of different solutions for the evaluation 2 g of a flat membrane of zro2 was crushed and immersed in different solutions after a contact time of 5 min 1 ml of oil was added to the bottom of each graduated cylinder with the assistance of a syringe after 15 min of contact with the membrane the volume of supernatant oil and its adhesion to the membrane material were observed 2 4 4 zeta potential the zeta potential of all emulsions were measured by a zetasizer nano zs90 with the purpose of evaluating the influence of salinity on the mobility and charge of oil particles 3 results and discussion 3 1 process efficiency 3 1 1 permeate quality the oil content of all the permeate samples collected after permeation with ceramic membranes was lower than 5 mg l similar results were reported in other studies and indicate that the water can be considered appropriate for reinjection even in restrictive petroleum reservoirs 11 14 absorbance analysis results showed that the membrane selected for this study mean pore size of 0 1 μm did not retain the surfactant dtab this was expected since the molecular size of the surfactant is much smaller than the membrane pore size this fact can represent a saving of surfactant because it will reduce the make up needed during reinjection into the reservoir 3 1 2 permeate flux fig 2 shows the normalized permeate flux as a function of dtab concentration in synthetic produced water with nacl concentration of 100 000 mg l and without salt added the permeate flux was normalized by the initial flux j j0 to allow comparison of solutions with different viscosities and to minimize experimental fluctuations inherent in the ultrafiltration process in this figure it is possible to observe different behaviors of normalized permeate flux as a function of salinity as the concentration of dtab increases in the emulsion the permeate flux reduces for the nacl free emulsion while the inverse behavior was observed for emulsion with 100 000 mg l nacl at highest dtab concentration the permeate flux for the emulsion with salt was approximately 6 times higher than the one obtained with the solution with no salt added the permeate flux augment in the combined presence of dtab and salinity indicates that the presence of this surfactant may favor the treatment of the produced water by ultrafiltration process for a better understanding of these results the oil particle size distribution and interfacial properties related to the process were investigated 3 1 3 critical micelle concentration fig 3 shows the interfacial tension values for the emulsions prepared with different dtab concentration with the presence and absence of nacl the value of the cmc can be verified at the beginning of the asymptotic region of the interfacial tension determined by intersection of two curves as expected the cmc value is strongly influenced by the solution salinity in the study the cmc observed in the solution containing 100 g l of nacl was approximately 200 mg l emulsion with 100 000 mg l nacl exhibit a high reduction in the cmc 200 mg l which favors the oil phase emulsification this result is related to the surfactant solubility reduction with salinity intensifying surface segregation phenomenon due to strong interaction between water and ionic species 15 it is important to highlight that the concentration of the water injected in the reservoirs is commonly much lower than the cmc 3 500 mg l observed in emulsions with no salt added 3 1 4 particle size distribution particle size distribution was determined for the emulsions containing 100 mg l of oils and greases 1 000 mg l of surfactant dtab with 0 and 100 000 mg l nacl as portrayed in fig 4 both samples had particle with sizes comparable to the values commonly found in produced water 13 in this figure it is possible to observe that the particle size distribution shifts for smaller sizes for emulsion with 100 000 mg l of nacl this fact can be related to the reduction of approximately 15 times in the critical micelle concentration cmc as can be observed in fig 3 lower value of cmc increases the stability of oil droplets dispersed in the produced water although there is a reduction in particle size the disperse phase is still significantly larger than the membrane pore size furthermore higher emulsion stability should diminishes membrane fouling by oil deposition resulting in higher permeate fluxes 3 1 5 contact angle the contact angle between oil droplet and the membrane surface was determined by the verification of the interaction between the dispersed phase and the membrane surface in the presence of surfactant and nacl fig 5 shows the static images of oil droplets in contact with the membrane surface immersed in solutions with different dtab and nacl concentrations when the membrane was immersed in water without surfactant and nacl the interaction with the oil phase is low fig 5a which characterizes a hydrophilic nature of the membrane however increase of dtab concentration alters the interaction between the membrane and the oil phase fig 5b which can be attributed to the amphiphilic characteristic of the surfactant facilitating wetting of the membrane by the oil this phenomenon has a direct impact on membrane fouling and may justify low values of permeate flux observed in this condition when the solution contains 1 000 mg l of dtab and 100 000 mg l of nacl fig 5c the membrane interaction with the oil is also reduced it can be attributed to the increase of ionic strength in the solution which enhances interaction between the dtab molecules and the oil phase as evidenced by cmc reduction fig 3 and decrease of oil droplets mean size fig 4 3 1 6 adhesion mapping in order to qualitatively evaluate the membrane fouling by the oil phase as a function of the solution composition adhesion mapping tests were performed fig 6 in these tests as presented in the experimental methodology the membrane was crushed and immersed in solutions with different compositions when the membrane material was immersed in water without surfactant and nacl as well as when immersion occurred in solution with 1 000 mg l dtab and 100 000 mg l nacl the oil trapped with the membrane particles was almost completely displaced on the other hand greater oil phase adhesion to the membrane material was observed when only surfactant was present in the solution this result corroborates with previous analysis of membrane material hydrophilicity and its low affinity for the oil phase the presence of surfactant facilitates oil adhesion to the membrane which is reversed in high ionic strength solutions the permeate flux is a consequence of these effects 3 1 7 zeta potential the electrochemical properties of dispersed particles may significantly impact the nature and magnitude of membrane fouling causing a decline in the permeate flux fig 7 shows the zeta potential measured in oil emulsions with different salinities and dtab concentration in absence of dtab the oil droplets exhibit negative charges as indicated by the zeta potential value however the addition of dtab neutralizes these charges even leading to signal inversion and zeta potential intensity which can be attributed to surfactant adsorption on the dispersed particles surface another aspect observed in fig 7 is the salinity influence on the zeta potential as expected there is reduction of zeta potential value with ionic strength increase i e the electric double layer undergoes a contraction reducing charge intensity in the solution nacl concentrations above 50 000 mg l bring the zeta potential value to approximately 0 mv as commonly known the zro2 membrane isoelectric point is approximately 6 this point indicates the equality between positive and negative charges only at ph values lower than the isoelectric point ph 6 the membrane has a positive zeta potential 16 at the produced water ph commonly around 6 8 a low and negative value of the membrane zeta potential is expected hence the absence of dtab and nacl in the emulsion lead to an electro repulsion between the membrane surface and the dispersed oil phase as evidenced by the oil displacement observed in the adhesion map on the other hand the presence of dtab in the solution prepared without nacl changes the zeta potential value leading to electro attraction between oil droplets and membrane surface which can justify the sharp drop in the permeate flux moreover high ionic strength reduces electrostatic interactions by compression of the double electric layer and enhances interaction between the dtab and the oil phase as evidenced by cmc reduction this condition also reduces oil adhesion to the membrane surface diminishing fouling and favoring water permeation as evidenced by the permeate flux increase 4 conclusions the ultrafiltration process with ceramic membranes can be considered an effective alternative for produced water treatment even when cationic surfactants are present in the effluent dtab was studied as typical surfactant added to injection water which should be present in the produced water interfacial phenomena investigation allowed the broadening of the understanding of the effects promoted by the presence of surfactant in produced water in the separation process as dtab concentration increases in the emulsion the oil adhesion to the membrane material is enhaced resulting in a reduction of the permeate flux this effect is related to electrical attraction as evidenced by zeta potential however produced water has high ionic strength that affects the interaction between emulsified oil droplets and the membrane surface as well as intensifies adsorption of dtab in the oil dispersed phase these phenomena were perceived by low values of zeta potential reduction of both particle size distribution and membrane wetting by the oily phase combination of these effects seems to reduce membrane fouling and facilitate water permeation the efficiency of the oil phase retention by the membrane was not affected even at high concentrations of surfactant 1 000 mg l being possible to obtain an effluent stream with contents of oils and greases below 5 mg l

in order to extract residual oil in mature reservoirs enhanced oil recovery eor methods are applied among them chemical addition methods can be highlighted the purpose of chemicals is to modify the interaction between the fluid injected and the fluid contained in the reservoir with the rock three chemical categories are usually applied polymers surfactants and alkaline products either together or separately 2 injection of surfactant solutions has proven to be very efficient in increasing the degree of oil recovery it its caused by the amphiphilic characteristic of the surfactant i e each molecule has two functional groups a polar group hydrophilic and a nonpolar group hydrophobic which are capable of interacting with both water and oil leading to an improvement in the sweep efficiency and thus the recovery factor the hydrophobic group is generally comprised of a long hydrocarbon chain c8 and c18 which may be branched or not while the hydrophilic group is formed by moieties such as carboxylates sulfates sulfonates anionic alcohols nonionic and quaternary ammonium salts cationic 3 due to this structure the surfactant can be used to emulsify the oil by the strong reduction of interfacial tension ift or to alter the oil wettability in the reservoir 4 according to gary and handwerk 5 in presence of dissolved salt the surfactants accumulate at the interface oil water intensifying formation of an adsorbed film and ift reduction depending on the properties of the crude oil api gravity viscosity sulfur content salts metals among others the structure of adsorbed surfactant film can vary significantly the molecular packing surface viscosity surface elasticity and surface charge of the adsorbed film are key parameters that determine several phenomena such as the coalescence of emulsion droplets as well as the migration of oil droplets in porous media 3 different surfactants have been investigated with the purpose of altering the wettability of the reservoir rock and consequently increasing the oil recovery factor 6 among these products the cationics ones have the advantage of having the same surface charge as carbonate minerals standnes and austad 7 showed that cationic surfactants such as dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide dtab are highly efficient for this purpose being able to recover approximately 70 of original oil in place according to the authors this high rate could be related to the same surface charge presented by the carbonate minerals and the surfactant despite the many advantages related to advanced recovery chemical methods an important aspect to consider is the impact of chemicals in the produced water treatment cycle injection of surfactants can produce stable emulsions of water oil and oil water making the water treatment more difficult and less cost effective due to the need of more specific additives and equipment in order to keep the topside processing system efficient according to argillier et al 1 and deng et al 8 the additional treatment cost is one of the causes that limit application of this technology najamudin et al 9 mentioned that the use of surfactants could increase the water toxicity and affect the ecosystem hence produced water reuse reinjection can become indispensable when an eor is applied for oil recovery as pointed out by weschenfelder et al 10 11 the use of ceramic membranes has shown great potential for produced water treatment specially when the goal is the reinjection in restrictive reservoirs i e low water injectivity by making the effluent practically free of suspended solids and dispersed oils and greases in this sense the objective of this work was to evaluate the effect a surfactant has on the ultrafiltration process using ceramic membranes for produced water treatment dtab was chosen for this study due to its potential application for eor for a better understanding of the process the effect of dtab and salinity on interfacial properties of water oil membrane system by measuring surface tension wetting electrokinetic potential and oil adhesion was investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 membrane this study was carried out with zirconium oxide supported by tio2 al2o3 multi channel membranes acquired from likuid nanotek with 0 1 μm pore size 0 003 m channel diameter 0 2 m length and 0 0019 m2 surface area 2 2 synthetic produced water crude oil 28 1 api gravity was emulsified at 50 c by using ultra turrax model t 50 at the speed of 11 000 rpm during 5 min the average concentration of oil and grease cog and salt content cs were kept at 100 5 mg l and 100 000 mg l respectively which is usually found in offshore treatment units for sake of comparison oily water with no salinity was also investigated due to the difficulty of predicting surfactant concentration in produced water it was decided to evaluate its influence up to the maximum concentration commonly injected 1 000 mg l the emulsified particle size was then determined by malvern mastersizer 3000e equipment the procedure and conditions applied in this work were based on the study conducted by weschenfelder et al 10 12 2 3 permeation of synthetic produced water the permeation set up used in the tests is shown in fig 1 it consists of a permeation module capable of accommodating a permeation element ceramic membrane a positive displacement recirculation pump pressure gauges flow meter feed tank with mechanical stiring and a tank for permeate mass data collection the transmembrane pressure δp of 2 0 bar and across flow velocity of 2 0 m s re 6000 were selected according to the values proposed by weschenfelder et al 10 as stated by these authors the permeation time of 60 min can be considered sufficient for the permeate flux stabilization the feed temperature 50 2 c was chosen considering normal operating conditions found in offshore treatment plants of produced water 13 during permeation experiments cog and surfactant concentration were periodically measured in feed and permeate streams cog and dtab concentration were measured with a spectrophotometer hach dr 2800 according to the astm d3921 method and a spectrophotometer uv vis hach dr 6000 respectively 2 4 interfacial properties 2 4 1 cmc determination surfactant critical micelle concentration cmc was determined by measuring the interfacial tension of the solutions with a spinning drop tensiometer svt 20 dataphysics each measurement was performed after oil solution contact time of twenty minutes 2 4 2 contact angle determination the pendant drop method was applied to evaluate the contact angle between the oil droplets and the membrane surface by using oca 15 dataphysics goniometer for the evaluation one drop of oil 1 μl was placed in contact with the membrane surface immersed in the solution for each experimental condition the static drop image was captured it is noteworthy that for these experiments zro2 membranes were supplied by likuid nanotek in flat conformation with similar characteristics to tubular membranes used in the permeation tests 2 4 3 adhesion mapping the adhesion test was carried out in order to verify the oil membrane adhesion in presence of different solutions for the evaluation 2 g of a flat membrane of zro2 was crushed and immersed in different solutions after a contact time of 5 min 1 ml of oil was added to the bottom of each graduated cylinder with the assistance of a syringe after 15 min of contact with the membrane the volume of supernatant oil and its adhesion to the membrane material were observed 2 4 4 zeta potential the zeta potential of all emulsions were measured by a zetasizer nano zs90 with the purpose of evaluating the influence of salinity on the mobility and charge of oil particles 3 results and discussion 3 1 process efficiency 3 1 1 permeate quality the oil content of all the permeate samples collected after permeation with ceramic membranes was lower than 5 mg l similar results were reported in other studies and indicate that the water can be considered appropriate for reinjection even in restrictive petroleum reservoirs 11 14 absorbance analysis results showed that the membrane selected for this study mean pore size of 0 1 μm did not retain the surfactant dtab this was expected since the molecular size of the surfactant is much smaller than the membrane pore size this fact can represent a saving of surfactant because it will reduce the make up needed during reinjection into the reservoir 3 1 2 permeate flux fig 2 shows the normalized permeate flux as a function of dtab concentration in synthetic produced water with nacl concentration of 100 000 mg l and without salt added the permeate flux was normalized by the initial flux j j0 to allow comparison of solutions with different viscosities and to minimize experimental fluctuations inherent in the ultrafiltration process in this figure it is possible to observe different behaviors of normalized permeate flux as a function of salinity as the concentration of dtab increases in the emulsion the permeate flux reduces for the nacl free emulsion while the inverse behavior was observed for emulsion with 100 000 mg l nacl at highest dtab concentration the permeate flux for the emulsion with salt was approximately 6 times higher than the one obtained with the solution with no salt added the permeate flux augment in the combined presence of dtab and salinity indicates that the presence of this surfactant may favor the treatment of the produced water by ultrafiltration process for a better understanding of these results the oil particle size distribution and interfacial properties related to the process were investigated 3 1 3 critical micelle concentration fig 3 shows the interfacial tension values for the emulsions prepared with different dtab concentration with the presence and absence of nacl the value of the cmc can be verified at the beginning of the asymptotic region of the interfacial tension determined by intersection of two curves as expected the cmc value is strongly influenced by the solution salinity in the study the cmc observed in the solution containing 100 g l of nacl was approximately 200 mg l emulsion with 100 000 mg l nacl exhibit a high reduction in the cmc 200 mg l which favors the oil phase emulsification this result is related to the surfactant solubility reduction with salinity intensifying surface segregation phenomenon due to strong interaction between water and ionic species 15 it is important to highlight that the concentration of the water injected in the reservoirs is commonly much lower than the cmc 3 500 mg l observed in emulsions with no salt added 3 1 4 particle size distribution particle size distribution was determined for the emulsions containing 100 mg l of oils and greases 1 000 mg l of surfactant dtab with 0 and 100 000 mg l nacl as portrayed in fig 4 both samples had particle with sizes comparable to the values commonly found in produced water 13 in this figure it is possible to observe that the particle size distribution shifts for smaller sizes for emulsion with 100 000 mg l of nacl this fact can be related to the reduction of approximately 15 times in the critical micelle concentration cmc as can be observed in fig 3 lower value of cmc increases the stability of oil droplets dispersed in the produced water although there is a reduction in particle size the disperse phase is still significantly larger than the membrane pore size furthermore higher emulsion stability should diminishes membrane fouling by oil deposition resulting in higher permeate fluxes 3 1 5 contact angle the contact angle between oil droplet and the membrane surface was determined by the verification of the interaction between the dispersed phase and the membrane surface in the presence of surfactant and nacl fig 5 shows the static images of oil droplets in contact with the membrane surface immersed in solutions with different dtab and nacl concentrations when the membrane was immersed in water without surfactant and nacl the interaction with the oil phase is low fig 5a which characterizes a hydrophilic nature of the membrane however increase of dtab concentration alters the interaction between the membrane and the oil phase fig 5b which can be attributed to the amphiphilic characteristic of the surfactant facilitating wetting of the membrane by the oil this phenomenon has a direct impact on membrane fouling and may justify low values of permeate flux observed in this condition when the solution contains 1 000 mg l of dtab and 100 000 mg l of nacl fig 5c the membrane interaction with the oil is also reduced it can be attributed to the increase of ionic strength in the solution which enhances interaction between the dtab molecules and the oil phase as evidenced by cmc reduction fig 3 and decrease of oil droplets mean size fig 4 3 1 6 adhesion mapping in order to qualitatively evaluate the membrane fouling by the oil phase as a function of the solution composition adhesion mapping tests were performed fig 6 in these tests as presented in the experimental methodology the membrane was crushed and immersed in solutions with different compositions when the membrane material was immersed in water without surfactant and nacl as well as when immersion occurred in solution with 1 000 mg l dtab and 100 000 mg l nacl the oil trapped with the membrane particles was almost completely displaced on the other hand greater oil phase adhesion to the membrane material was observed when only surfactant was present in the solution this result corroborates with previous analysis of membrane material hydrophilicity and its low affinity for the oil phase the presence of surfactant facilitates oil adhesion to the membrane which is reversed in high ionic strength solutions the permeate flux is a consequence of these effects 3 1 7 zeta potential the electrochemical properties of dispersed particles may significantly impact the nature and magnitude of membrane fouling causing a decline in the permeate flux fig 7 shows the zeta potential measured in oil emulsions with different salinities and dtab concentration in absence of dtab the oil droplets exhibit negative charges as indicated by the zeta potential value however the addition of dtab neutralizes these charges even leading to signal inversion and zeta potential intensity which can be attributed to surfactant adsorption on the dispersed particles surface another aspect observed in fig 7 is the salinity influence on the zeta potential as expected there is reduction of zeta potential value with ionic strength increase i e the electric double layer undergoes a contraction reducing charge intensity in the solution nacl concentrations above 50 000 mg l bring the zeta potential value to approximately 0 mv as commonly known the zro2 membrane isoelectric point is approximately 6 this point indicates the equality between positive and negative charges only at ph values lower than the isoelectric point ph 6 the membrane has a positive zeta potential 16 at the produced water ph commonly around 6 8 a low and negative value of the membrane zeta potential is expected hence the absence of dtab and nacl in the emulsion lead to an electro repulsion between the membrane surface and the dispersed oil phase as evidenced by the oil displacement observed in the adhesion map on the other hand the presence of dtab in the solution prepared without nacl changes the zeta potential value leading to electro attraction between oil droplets and membrane surface which can justify the sharp drop in the permeate flux moreover high ionic strength reduces electrostatic interactions by compression of the double electric layer and enhances interaction between the dtab and the oil phase as evidenced by cmc reduction this condition also reduces oil adhesion to the membrane surface diminishing fouling and favoring water permeation as evidenced by the permeate flux increase 4 conclusions the ultrafiltration process with ceramic membranes can be considered an effective alternative for produced water treatment even when cationic surfactants are present in the effluent dtab was studied as typical surfactant added to injection water which should be present in the produced water interfacial phenomena investigation allowed the broadening of the understanding of the effects promoted by the presence of surfactant in produced water in the separation process as dtab concentration increases in the emulsion the oil adhesion to the membrane material is enhaced resulting in a reduction of the permeate flux this effect is related to electrical attraction as evidenced by zeta potential however produced water has high ionic strength that affects the interaction between emulsified oil droplets and the membrane surface as well as intensifies adsorption of dtab in the oil dispersed phase these phenomena were perceived by low values of zeta potential reduction of both particle size distribution and membrane wetting by the oily phase combination of these effects seems to reduce membrane fouling and facilitate water permeation the efficiency of the oil phase retention by the membrane was not affected even at high concentrations of surfactant 1 000 mg l being possible to obtain an effluent stream with contents of oils and greases below 5 mg l 
14263,this work assessed the feasibility of recovering exhausted high silica zsm 5 for the first time high silica zsm 5 hszsm 5 loaded with sulfamethoxazole smx was regenerated by water dissolved ozone results showed that 97 recovery of adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 was obtained at 2 54 mg l of ozone after 15 min reaction lower sio2 al2o3 ratio of hszsm 5 and initial smx concentration had a higher recovery ratio of adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 the sequential hszsm 5 adsorption ad and ozone oxidation oz experiments were also performed to investigate the effect of ph on the regeneration efficiency of loaded hszsm 5 and the regeneration mechanism was characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy x ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis no degraded isoxazole ring of smx adsorbed in the sinusoidal channels of hszsm 5 was responsible for the decreased recyclability of hszsm 5 higher ozone activity of deprotonated smx at higher ph pka2 favored the hszsm 5 regeneration high silica zeolite based sequential ad oz process may be a sustainable way for the removal of organic micropollutants from water keywords high silica zeolites smx adsorption ozone recyclability 1 introduction sulfonamide antibiotics sas have been widely used in human and veterinary medicine since 1937 sas exhibit a wide spectrum of action against most gram positive and many gram negative microorganisms 1 sulfonamides residues released from municipal wastewater treatment plants hospital waste and agricultural runoff are often detected in surface water and groundwater 2 the adverse eﬀ ects of sas on the environment included bio toxicity resistance to bacterial inhibition of disease therapy and even carcinogenicity to humans 3 4 furthermore conventional water treatment processes cannot guarantee the removal of sas 5 adsorption was one of the potential technologies to removal sas from aquatic environment 2 6 the adsorption capacity of adsorbent is limited and it will be saturated at later stage 7 the exhausted adsorbent should be disposed regenerated or replaced although activated carbon with excellent adsorption performance was used for sas removal 8 the poor regeneration and recyclability of carbon limited its practical application 9 hence there is a tremendous need to develop an adsorbent capable of adsorbing contaminants and recovering their adsorption capacity during regeneration zeolites are competitive materials in terms of low cost shape selectivity and adsorption effective they were regulated to preferentially capture hydrophilic or hydrophobic molecules by adjusting the ratio of sio2 al2o3 10 high silica zeolites have been recently used to remove sas 10 12 moreover the regeneration of exhausted zeolite is also an important issue in the utilization of zeolite 13 the sorbate characteristics adsorption properties and the regeneration cost affected the choice of the regeneration method 14 the spent zeolites were traditionally regenerated by several methods including thermal treatment photolysis fenton like reaction and solvent extraction 10 14 among these ozone regeneration was found to be simple scalable and cost eﬀ ective 15 the effective adsorption of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol by ozone regenerated high silica fau zeolites maintained at least 8 adsorption regeneration cycles 16 the adsorption capacity of nitrobenzene by high silica zeolites after ozone treatment was completely restored 17 to date there is litter known about the sas adsorption and ozone regeneration characteristics of high silica zsm 5 zeolites in this work widely used sas sulfamethoxazole smx was chosen as model pollutant the specific objectives of this work were i optimal condition of loaded zeolites regeneration by ozone ii evaluation of regenerated zeolites over several adsorption regeneration cycles iii regeneration mechanisms of high silica zsm 5 it is expected to apply this technology to the ﬁeld of zeolite based adsorption regeneration process and realize its industrial applications in water and wastewater treatment containing emerging contaminants in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials high silica zeolites zsm 5 average particle size of 0 53 0 58 nm sio2 al2o3 mol mol ratio of 38 70 170 350 and 500 hszsm 5 were purchased from nanjing xfnano materials tech co ltd nanjing china smx was got from sigma aldrich usa all other reagents were of analytical grade and used as received all preparations were made with double distilled water 2 2 smx adsorption experiments to study the influence of regeneration conditions on the adsorption capacity and its recovery ratio the adsorption experiments were conducted at 298 k and ph of 6 0 the concentration of smx aqueous solutions were 0 5 mg l a given amount of pristine or regenerated hszsm 5 was immerged into smx solutions under continuous stirring after 48 h adsorption 100 ml of solution was taken out as the sample the adsorption kinetics experiments of regenerated hszsm 5 were also carried out to reduce measurement errors in all the experiments the sample concentration was measured in triplicates 2 3 ozone experiments in order to obtain optimal regeneration conditions the loaded hszsm 5 were used to ozone regeneration experiment a 2 l reactor was used in the experiment at room temperature fig s1 ozone was generated from o2 purity 99 99 using an ozone generator with a maximum zone production rate of around 5 g o3 hr gaseous ozone stream was bubbling into the water tank the specific experiments were conducted to obtain the optimal regeneration conditions with a fixed amount of hszsm 5 0 2 g l a initial smx concentration was 1 5 10 and 20 mg l b ozone dosage was

q e n were the adsorption capacity of virgin zeolites and regenerated zeolites in the specific cycle n respectively 2 4 sequential adsorption ozonation experiments sequential adsorption ozonation experiments were carried out in the reactor under the following conditions after 48 h adsorption the suspension was centrifuged at 4000 r min for 10 min and the hszsm 5 dried at 60 for 6 h the ozonation process was performed under the optimum conditions obtained in the context and the hszsm 5 was collected by the same method above mentioned the experiment was repeated five times with the same material but the fresh smx solution was loaded before the next run all adsorption and regeneration tests were conducted in duplicate 2 5 analysis of smx the concentration of smx was determined by using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc 1200 aglient america with a uv vis detector set at 268 nm the analysis consisted of carrying out a solid phase extraction spe of 100 ml samples

german equipped with monochromatic cu k α radiation λ 0 154 nm at 40 kv and 40 ma all samples were analyzed in continuous scan mode with 2 θ ranging from 10 to 80 thermal stability of the zeolites was determined by thermogravimetric analysis tga netzsch tg 209c germany in order to remove the residual solvent from the sample 30 mg specimens were kept at 90 c for 24 h under vacuum 100 mmhg column and then heated under n2 atmosphere from 80 to 800 c at 10 c min 3 results and discussion 3 1 regeneration conditions 3 1 1 effect of initial smx concentration fig 1 shows the effect of regeneration time on the recovery efficiency of the adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 it is clear that the maximum recovery ratio was obtained at 15 min the recovery ratio had no continuously increase with increasing regeneration time although long regeneration time meant that more ozone molecules were introduced into the reaction system there was almost no increment fifteen minutes was enough to ensure adequate regeneration of the loaded hszsm 5 3 1 2 effect of ozone concentration fig 2 shows the recovery ratio of the adsorption capacity of saturated hszsm 5 regenerated at various ozone dosages the recovery ratio showed a two stage adsorption with a sharp initial curve followed by a plateau an ozone dosage of 2 54 mg l 15 min of reaction was enough to achieve almost a complete smx removal 97 before the ozone concentration reaches saturation in the liquid phase the equilibrium concentration of ozone is proportional to the ozone dosage fig s2 the larger ozone dosage implied greater gas liquid mass transfer coefficient fig s3 which meant that the adsorbed smx on zeolites was prone to contact with ozone and then smx removed resulting in the recovery of the adsorption capacity of hszsm 5 at ozone concentration higher than 2 54 mg l adsorbed smx removal no longer increased due to low smx available in the medium to react with the ozone 3 1 3 effect of regeneration time on equilibrated zeolites fig 3 shows the effect of smx concentration on the adsorption efficiency of regenerated hszsm 5 increasing initial concentration of smx led to an increased equilibrium adsorption capacity of virgin hszsm 5 the equilibrium adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 increased when smx concentration rose from 1 to 5 mg l moreover the adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 was equivalent to that of fresh hszsm 5 at smx concentration lower than 5 0 mg l this could be explained by that i unsaturated zeolites at lower initial concentration of smx still had a higher adsorption capacity regardless of regeneration ii after the regeneration process some of the adsorbed smx degraded by ozone inducing more adsorption sites to expose no difference in the recovery efficiency of adsorption capacity might be the joint effect of the two reasons with a further increase of initial smx concentration the adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 decreased which implied that some of the adsorbed smx still occupied the binding sites on in the hszsm 5 it is clear that the re values decreased with increasing smx concentration 5 mg l 3 1 4 effect of sio2 al2o3 ratio fig 4 shows the adsorption capacity of hszsm 5 with different sio2 al2o3 mol mol ratio the adsorbed amount of smx on the pristine and regenerated hszsm 5 tended to increase with increasing sio2 al2o3 mol mol ratio due to the hydrophobicity of hszsm 5 and smx an increased hydrophobicity interaction between hszsm 5 and smx led to much more adsorption of smx by hszsm 5 it should be noted that the adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 was slightly higher than that of virgin hszsm 5 except hszsm 5 with sio2 al2o3 ratio of 500 this finding was consistent with the literature 7 which reported that the adsorption capacity of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol by regenerated fau zeolite increased after regeneration better re was achieved for the hszsm 5 but the re values decreased from 118 2 to 98 9 with the increase of sio2 al2o3 ratio of hszsm 5 when the total amount of hszsm 5 was fixed the adsorption capacity of hszsm 5 with lower sio2 al2o3 ratio on smx was relative smaller which made it easier to be degraded by ozone with same concentration thus leading to higher re the phenomenon that dissolved ozone regeneration led to the increase in adsorption capacity of hszsm 5 that could be related to the cleaning effect of ozone on the pore of zeolites 17 this high capacity recovery was associated not only with binding site regeneration but also with the fact that the adsorption site was not fully saturated at the end of the adsorption step 3 2 roles of ph in regeneration cycles ph not only affects the surface charge of the adsorbent and the form of smx but also impacts the stability of o3 in water thus ph would have an important impact on re according to our earlier research the adsorption of smx from water by hszsm 5 was strongly dependent on ph in order to evaluate the influence of ph on the regeneration of loaded hszsm 5 in four adsorption oxidation ad oz cycles ph in the adsorption process was kept at 6 while ph values of 3 6 and 10 were studied in the oxidation process respectively the experimental data are shown in fig 5 fig 5a shows that the virgin hszsm 5 exhibited the similar adsorption efficiency of smx in the 1st adsorption after the first regeneration by o3 solution at different ph slightly difference of the adsorption efficiency of smx on the regenerated hszsm 5 was observed but obvious difference was obtained in the following ad oz cycles as shown in fig 5a it was also found that the adsorption efficiency of regenerated hszsm 5 was higher than non regenerated zeolites regardless of ph moreover the loaded hszsm 5 after regeneration at ph of 10 had better adsorption efficiency than those at other ph values the adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 in the specific ad oz cycles decreased considerably but decreased relative slightly at ph of 10 as indicated in fig 5b linear relationship between equilibrium adsorption capacity and operation cycle was analyzed and the slope of fitting curves was used to evaluate the regeneration effective the decline of adsorption capacity of the regenerated hszsm 5 followed the ph sequence of 3 6 10 therefore higher ph was favorable for loaded hszsm 5 regeneration the different ozone activity of the smx species protonated neutral deprotonated was responsible for the difference in re values of regenerated hszsm 5 at different ph values the dissociated hydrogen presents in the p aminophenyl sulfonamide so2nh group at ph pka2 promoted the reactivity of smx 19 fig s4 the deprotonated smx smx as the main species was more likely to react with ozone than neutral smx molecules as shown in fig s5 owing to the deprotonation effect the electron donating intensity of the sulfonamide nh group of smx increased correspondingly with the increase of solution ph 20 which may be the reason for the favorable removal of adsorbed smx from the loaded hszsm 5 by ozone at higher ph o3 molecules in water are unstable at ph of 10 and they dissolve and decompose rapidly and then produce hydroxyl radicals 7 it could be inferred that at base condition smx may be further mineralized by hydroxyl radicals into small molecular organic matter or even inorganic matter which destroyed the isoxazole structure of smx and released its adsorption sites as will be discussed in the following section nevertheless as above mentioned the removal of smx in aqueous solution mainly depended on the direct reaction with o3 molecules rather than the indirect reaction of hydroxyl radical 21 22 according to the adsorption analysis of smx on zeolites by blasioli et al 12 the isoxazole ring of smx extended into the sinusoidal channel of the zeolite and the aniline ring of smx located at the center of the intersection of the straight and sinusoidal channel fig s6 hence to remove the adsorbed smx on hszsm 5 it was necessary to destroy the structure of isoxazole many degradation products of smx by ozone still had the structure of isoxazole 23 meaning that they still occupied the adsorption sites of hszsm 5 reducing the adsorption performance this was one of the possible reasons for the low adsorption efficiency and decreased recovery ratio of regenerated hszsm 5 3 3 smx adsorption kinetics in different cycles table 1 shows the adsorption kinetics of smx by regenerated zeolites the adsorption kinetics fitted very well with the pseudo second order model fig s7 the equilibrium adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 followed the decrement trend suggesting that the loaded hszsm 5 had no complete regeneration the determination coefficient r2 for almost all linear regressions were 0 99 ph appeared to be a similar influence on the rate constants of regenerated hszsm 5 the rate constant of regenerated hszsm 5 decreased compared with the pristine hszsm 5 with the increasing operation cycle the adsorption capacity decreased and the corresponding rate constants increased 3 4 ftir xrd and tga analysis 3 4 1 ftir fig 6 shows the ftir spectra of the raw materials hszsm 5 and smx hszsm 5 loaded with smx hszsm 5 smx and hszsm 5 smx regenerated at ph of 6 and 10 respectively in the hszsm 5 spectrum the bands at 3430 and 1630 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of oh corresponding to the water molecules in the interlayer space the bands at 1097 and 805 cm 1 were associated to the antisymmetric and symmetric stretching si o of the zeolites respectively the characteristic bands of the smx observed at 3465 and 3377 cm 1 were ascribed to the nh aniline stretching the band at 3298 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching of the sulfonamide group the band at 3143 cm 1 was assigned to the c h valence vibration of the aromatic ring and the heterocycle the bands between 1550 and 1350 cm 1 can be assigned to isoxazole ring c n vibrations the band at 1150 cm 1 was associated to the symmetric stretching of the sulfonyl group hszsm 5 smx spectra displayed characteristic bands of smx between 1550 and 1350 cm 1 which confirmed its presence in the loaded hszsm 5 the typical bands of hszsm 5 appear overlapped with the smx bands particularly in the regions of 3465 3143 1089 833 687 580 cm 1 there was no significant shift in the bands of the raw materials revealing that a weak zeolites drug interaction through van der waals forces and or hydrophobic interaction the spectrum of hszsm 5 smx regenerated by o3 produced a difference in subtle places as indicated in fig 6 comparing the hszsm 5 smx spectrum with regeneration conditions at ph 6 and 10 it is clear that the spectra of hszsm 5 smx after regeneration at ph of 10 was close to that of the hszsm 5 with no bands between 1550 and 1350 cm 1 suggesting that the isoxazole ring of smx was removed after regeneration the spectra of hszsm 5 smx after regeneration at ph of 6 was close to that of hszsm 5 smx which still had the peaks of the isoxazole ring suggesting that adsorbed smx was not effectively removed by ozone at ph of 6 3 4 2 xrd fig 7 shows the xrd patterns of origin hszsm 5 and hszsm 5 smx at different regeneration cycles the patterns of all the zeolites had the representative peaks at 8 9 and 22 24 which showed that the virgin hszsm 5 had mfi structure 24 the structure of hszsm 5 smx after regeneration was similar as the pristine hszsm 5 meaning that the structure of the hszsm 5 was not destroyed during regeneration the 2θ value at 7 8 corresponded to 020 and 200 of sinusoidal channels which were the main filling channels of hszsm 5 the intensity of the peak at 2θ 7 8 decreased with the increase of regeneration cycle this was explained by that the sinusoidal channels of hszsm 5 were filled by smx which was responsible for the decrease of the equilibrium adsorption capacity and its recovery ratio of loaded hszsm 5 after regeneration y is the ratio of the peak area of regenerated hszsm 5 to the peak area of pristine hszsm 5 at 2θ 7 8 it was found that y values of hszsm 5 smx hszsm 5 smx regenerated at ph of 6 and 10 were 58 6 76 3 and 93 6 respectively as shown in table s1 this meant that the larger the y value the closer the regenerated sample was to pristine one the result indicated that smx adsorbed by hszsm 5 was removed effectively by ozonation particularly at ph of 10 the pore filling degree of regenerated samples was much closer to the pristine hszsm 5 3 4 3 tg dtg the thermal stability of the zeolites were investigated by tg dtg and the diagrams obtained are presented in fig 8 two regions of mass loss were observed the first weight loss occurred around 100 c which was ascribed to the loss of absorbed water molecules in the hszsm 5 the second weight loss region from 300 to 400 c corresponded to the decomposition of smx 25 except the pristine hszsm 5 the prominent peak of mass loss can be identified in the dtg curves the intensity of the peaks at 316 326 c increased meaning that much more smx existed in the zeolites this result could explain the decreased re values of regenerated hszsm 5 moreover the thermal stability of the regenerated hszsm 5 decreased due to residual smx in the hszsm 5 4 conclusions almost a complete smx removal 97 and totally recovered hszsm 5 was obtained under batch experiment conditions higher ph pka 2 was favorable for the regeneration of hszsm 5 loaded with smx by water dissolved ozone the adsorbed isoxazole ring of smx on hszsm 5 was removed due to ozone at ph of 10 demonstrated by ftir analysis the adsorption of regenerated hszsm 5 still followed the pseudo second order model tga dtg and xrd studies further confirmed that much more sinusoidal channels of hszsm 5 were filled

14263,this work assessed the feasibility of recovering exhausted high silica zsm 5 for the first time high silica zsm 5 hszsm 5 loaded with sulfamethoxazole smx was regenerated by water dissolved ozone results showed that 97 recovery of adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 was obtained at 2 54 mg l of ozone after 15 min reaction lower sio2 al2o3 ratio of hszsm 5 and initial smx concentration had a higher recovery ratio of adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 the sequential hszsm 5 adsorption ad and ozone oxidation oz experiments were also performed to investigate the effect of ph on the regeneration efficiency of loaded hszsm 5 and the regeneration mechanism was characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy x ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis no degraded isoxazole ring of smx adsorbed in the sinusoidal channels of hszsm 5 was responsible for the decreased recyclability of hszsm 5 higher ozone activity of deprotonated smx at higher ph pka2 favored the hszsm 5 regeneration high silica zeolite based sequential ad oz process may be a sustainable way for the removal of organic micropollutants from water keywords high silica zeolites smx adsorption ozone recyclability 1 introduction sulfonamide antibiotics sas have been widely used in human and veterinary medicine since 1937 sas exhibit a wide spectrum of action against most gram positive and many gram negative microorganisms 1 sulfonamides residues released from municipal wastewater treatment plants hospital waste and agricultural runoff are often detected in surface water and groundwater 2 the adverse eﬀ ects of sas on the environment included bio toxicity resistance to bacterial inhibition of disease therapy and even carcinogenicity to humans 3 4 furthermore conventional water treatment processes cannot guarantee the removal of sas 5 adsorption was one of the potential technologies to removal sas from aquatic environment 2 6 the adsorption capacity of adsorbent is limited and it will be saturated at later stage 7 the exhausted adsorbent should be disposed regenerated or replaced although activated carbon with excellent adsorption performance was used for sas removal 8 the poor regeneration and recyclability of carbon limited its practical application 9 hence there is a tremendous need to develop an adsorbent capable of adsorbing contaminants and recovering their adsorption capacity during regeneration zeolites are competitive materials in terms of low cost shape selectivity and adsorption effective they were regulated to preferentially capture hydrophilic or hydrophobic molecules by adjusting the ratio of sio2 al2o3 10 high silica zeolites have been recently used to remove sas 10 12 moreover the regeneration of exhausted zeolite is also an important issue in the utilization of zeolite 13 the sorbate characteristics adsorption properties and the regeneration cost affected the choice of the regeneration method 14 the spent zeolites were traditionally regenerated by several methods including thermal treatment photolysis fenton like reaction and solvent extraction 10 14 among these ozone regeneration was found to be simple scalable and cost eﬀ ective 15 the effective adsorption of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol by ozone regenerated high silica fau zeolites maintained at least 8 adsorption regeneration cycles 16 the adsorption capacity of nitrobenzene by high silica zeolites after ozone treatment was completely restored 17 to date there is litter known about the sas adsorption and ozone regeneration characteristics of high silica zsm 5 zeolites in this work widely used sas sulfamethoxazole smx was chosen as model pollutant the specific objectives of this work were i optimal condition of loaded zeolites regeneration by ozone ii evaluation of regenerated zeolites over several adsorption regeneration cycles iii regeneration mechanisms of high silica zsm 5 it is expected to apply this technology to the ﬁeld of zeolite based adsorption regeneration process and realize its industrial applications in water and wastewater treatment containing emerging contaminants in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials high silica zeolites zsm 5 average particle size of 0 53 0 58 nm sio2 al2o3 mol mol ratio of 38 70 170 350 and 500 hszsm 5 were purchased from nanjing xfnano materials tech co ltd nanjing china smx was got from sigma aldrich usa all other reagents were of analytical grade and used as received all preparations were made with double distilled water 2 2 smx adsorption experiments to study the influence of regeneration conditions on the adsorption capacity and its recovery ratio the adsorption experiments were conducted at 298 k and ph of 6 0 the concentration of smx aqueous solutions were 0 5 mg l a given amount of pristine or regenerated hszsm 5 was immerged into smx solutions under continuous stirring after 48 h adsorption 100 ml of solution was taken out as the sample the adsorption kinetics experiments of regenerated hszsm 5 were also carried out to reduce measurement errors in all the experiments the sample concentration was measured in triplicates 2 3 ozone experiments in order to obtain optimal regeneration conditions the loaded hszsm 5 were used to ozone regeneration experiment a 2 l reactor was used in the experiment at room temperature fig s1 ozone was generated from o2 purity 99 99 using an ozone generator with a maximum zone production rate of around 5 g o3 hr gaseous ozone stream was bubbling into the water tank the specific experiments were conducted to obtain the optimal regeneration conditions with a fixed amount of hszsm 5 0 2 g l a initial smx concentration was 1 5 10 and 20 mg l b ozone dosage was controlled from 2 21 to 11 04 mg min equilibrium concentration of 0 067 to 8 14 mg l c the contact time set as 5 10 15 25 35 45 min d the sio2 al2o3 mol mol ratio was kept as 38 70 170 and 500 compared with the adsorption capacity of pristine and regenerated zeolites the regeneration efficiency was obtained r e q e n q e 1 100 where re is the recovery ratio of adsorption capacity q e 1 and q e n were the adsorption capacity of virgin zeolites and regenerated zeolites in the specific cycle n respectively 2 4 sequential adsorption ozonation experiments sequential adsorption ozonation experiments were carried out in the reactor under the following conditions after 48 h adsorption the suspension was centrifuged at 4000 r min for 10 min and the hszsm 5 dried at 60 for 6 h the ozonation process was performed under the optimum conditions obtained in the context and the hszsm 5 was collected by the same method above mentioned the experiment was repeated five times with the same material but the fresh smx solution was loaded before the next run all adsorption and regeneration tests were conducted in duplicate 2 5 analysis of smx the concentration of smx was determined by using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc 1200 aglient america with a uv vis detector set at 268 nm the analysis consisted of carrying out a solid phase extraction spe of 100 ml samples using 60 mg oasis hlb cartridges waters milford ma usa and a final elution from the cartridge using 6 ml of methanol an agilent 1200 module agilent palo alto ca usa equipped with a 150 4 6 mm zobrax eclipse xdb c18 column 5 mm agilent palo alto ca usa was employed to separate the analytes a gradient with a flow rate of 0 8 ml min was used mobile phase a contained hplc grade methanol and mobile phase b contained 0 5 v v hplc grade acetic acid in water 2 6 analytical methods the aqueous o3 concentration was measured using indigo method 18 fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of the zeolites were recorded on a ftir spectrometer equinox 55 bruker german within 4000 500 cm 1 the x ray diffractometer xrd analyses of zeolites were conducted with a diffractometer d8 advance bruker german equipped with monochromatic cu k α radiation λ 0 154 nm at 40 kv and 40 ma all samples were analyzed in continuous scan mode with 2 θ ranging from 10 to 80 thermal stability of the zeolites was determined by thermogravimetric analysis tga netzsch tg 209c germany in order to remove the residual solvent from the sample 30 mg specimens were kept at 90 c for 24 h under vacuum 100 mmhg column and then heated under n2 atmosphere from 80 to 800 c at 10 c min 3 results and discussion 3 1 regeneration conditions 3 1 1 effect of initial smx concentration fig 1 shows the effect of regeneration time on the recovery efficiency of the adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 it is clear that the maximum recovery ratio was obtained at 15 min the recovery ratio had no continuously increase with increasing regeneration time although long regeneration time meant that more ozone molecules were introduced into the reaction system there was almost no increment fifteen minutes was enough to ensure adequate regeneration of the loaded hszsm 5 3 1 2 effect of ozone concentration fig 2 shows the recovery ratio of the adsorption capacity of saturated hszsm 5 regenerated at various ozone dosages the recovery ratio showed a two stage adsorption with a sharp initial curve followed by a plateau an ozone dosage of 2 54 mg l 15 min of reaction was enough to achieve almost a complete smx removal 97 before the ozone concentration reaches saturation in the liquid phase the equilibrium concentration of ozone is proportional to the ozone dosage fig s2 the larger ozone dosage implied greater gas liquid mass transfer coefficient fig s3 which meant that the adsorbed smx on zeolites was prone to contact with ozone and then smx removed resulting in the recovery of the adsorption capacity of hszsm 5 at ozone concentration higher than 2 54 mg l adsorbed smx removal no longer increased due to low smx available in the medium to react with the ozone 3 1 3 effect of regeneration time on equilibrated zeolites fig 3 shows the effect of smx concentration on the adsorption efficiency of regenerated hszsm 5 increasing initial concentration of smx led to an increased equilibrium adsorption capacity of virgin hszsm 5 the equilibrium adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 increased when smx concentration rose from 1 to 5 mg l moreover the adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 was equivalent to that of fresh hszsm 5 at smx concentration lower than 5 0 mg l this could be explained by that i unsaturated zeolites at lower initial concentration of smx still had a higher adsorption capacity regardless of regeneration ii after the regeneration process some of the adsorbed smx degraded by ozone inducing more adsorption sites to expose no difference in the recovery efficiency of adsorption capacity might be the joint effect of the two reasons with a further increase of initial smx concentration the adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 decreased which implied that some of the adsorbed smx still occupied the binding sites on in the hszsm 5 it is clear that the re values decreased with increasing smx concentration 5 mg l 3 1 4 effect of sio2 al2o3 ratio fig 4 shows the adsorption capacity of hszsm 5 with different sio2 al2o3 mol mol ratio the adsorbed amount of smx on the pristine and regenerated hszsm 5 tended to increase with increasing sio2 al2o3 mol mol ratio due to the hydrophobicity of hszsm 5 and smx an increased hydrophobicity interaction between hszsm 5 and smx led to much more adsorption of smx by hszsm 5 it should be noted that the adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 was slightly higher than that of virgin hszsm 5 except hszsm 5 with sio2 al2o3 ratio of 500 this finding was consistent with the literature 7 which reported that the adsorption capacity of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol by regenerated fau zeolite increased after regeneration better re was achieved for the hszsm 5 but the re values decreased from 118 2 to 98 9 with the increase of sio2 al2o3 ratio of hszsm 5 when the total amount of hszsm 5 was fixed the adsorption capacity of hszsm 5 with lower sio2 al2o3 ratio on smx was relative smaller which made it easier to be degraded by ozone with same concentration thus leading to higher re the phenomenon that dissolved ozone regeneration led to the increase in adsorption capacity of hszsm 5 that could be related to the cleaning effect of ozone on the pore of zeolites 17 this high capacity recovery was associated not only with binding site regeneration but also with the fact that the adsorption site was not fully saturated at the end of the adsorption step 3 2 roles of ph in regeneration cycles ph not only affects the surface charge of the adsorbent and the form of smx but also impacts the stability of o3 in water thus ph would have an important impact on re according to our earlier research the adsorption of smx from water by hszsm 5 was strongly dependent on ph in order to evaluate the influence of ph on the regeneration of loaded hszsm 5 in four adsorption oxidation ad oz cycles ph in the adsorption process was kept at 6 while ph values of 3 6 and 10 were studied in the oxidation process respectively the experimental data are shown in fig 5 fig 5a shows that the virgin hszsm 5 exhibited the similar adsorption efficiency of smx in the 1st adsorption after the first regeneration by o3 solution at different ph slightly difference of the adsorption efficiency of smx on the regenerated hszsm 5 was observed but obvious difference was obtained in the following ad oz cycles as shown in fig 5a it was also found that the adsorption efficiency of regenerated hszsm 5 was higher than non regenerated zeolites regardless of ph moreover the loaded hszsm 5 after regeneration at ph of 10 had better adsorption efficiency than those at other ph values the adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 in the specific ad oz cycles decreased considerably but decreased relative slightly at ph of 10 as indicated in fig 5b linear relationship between equilibrium adsorption capacity and operation cycle was analyzed and the slope of fitting curves was used to evaluate the regeneration effective the decline of adsorption capacity of the regenerated hszsm 5 followed the ph sequence of 3 6 10 therefore higher ph was favorable for loaded hszsm 5 regeneration the different ozone activity of the smx species protonated neutral deprotonated was responsible for the difference in re values of regenerated hszsm 5 at different ph values the dissociated hydrogen presents in the p aminophenyl sulfonamide so2nh group at ph pka2 promoted the reactivity of smx 19 fig s4 the deprotonated smx smx as the main species was more likely to react with ozone than neutral smx molecules as shown in fig s5 owing to the deprotonation effect the electron donating intensity of the sulfonamide nh group of smx increased correspondingly with the increase of solution ph 20 which may be the reason for the favorable removal of adsorbed smx from the loaded hszsm 5 by ozone at higher ph o3 molecules in water are unstable at ph of 10 and they dissolve and decompose rapidly and then produce hydroxyl radicals 7 it could be inferred that at base condition smx may be further mineralized by hydroxyl radicals into small molecular organic matter or even inorganic matter which destroyed the isoxazole structure of smx and released its adsorption sites as will be discussed in the following section nevertheless as above mentioned the removal of smx in aqueous solution mainly depended on the direct reaction with o3 molecules rather than the indirect reaction of hydroxyl radical 21 22 according to the adsorption analysis of smx on zeolites by blasioli et al 12 the isoxazole ring of smx extended into the sinusoidal channel of the zeolite and the aniline ring of smx located at the center of the intersection of the straight and sinusoidal channel fig s6 hence to remove the adsorbed smx on hszsm 5 it was necessary to destroy the structure of isoxazole many degradation products of smx by ozone still had the structure of isoxazole 23 meaning that they still occupied the adsorption sites of hszsm 5 reducing the adsorption performance this was one of the possible reasons for the low adsorption efficiency and decreased recovery ratio of regenerated hszsm 5 3 3 smx adsorption kinetics in different cycles table 1 shows the adsorption kinetics of smx by regenerated zeolites the adsorption kinetics fitted very well with the pseudo second order model fig s7 the equilibrium adsorption capacity of regenerated hszsm 5 followed the decrement trend suggesting that the loaded hszsm 5 had no complete regeneration the determination coefficient r2 for almost all linear regressions were 0 99 ph appeared to be a similar influence on the rate constants of regenerated hszsm 5 the rate constant of regenerated hszsm 5 decreased compared with the pristine hszsm 5 with the increasing operation cycle the adsorption capacity decreased and the corresponding rate constants increased 3 4 ftir xrd and tga analysis 3 4 1 ftir fig 6 shows the ftir spectra of the raw materials hszsm 5 and smx hszsm 5 loaded with smx hszsm 5 smx and hszsm 5 smx regenerated at ph of 6 and 10 respectively in the hszsm 5 spectrum the bands at 3430 and 1630 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of oh corresponding to the water molecules in the interlayer space the bands at 1097 and 805 cm 1 were associated to the antisymmetric and symmetric stretching si o of the zeolites respectively the characteristic bands of the smx observed at 3465 and 3377 cm 1 were ascribed to the nh aniline stretching the band at 3298 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching of the sulfonamide group the band at 3143 cm 1 was assigned to the c h valence vibration of the aromatic ring and the heterocycle the bands between 1550 and 1350 cm 1 can be assigned to isoxazole ring c n vibrations the band at 1150 cm 1 was associated to the symmetric stretching of the sulfonyl group hszsm 5 smx spectra displayed characteristic bands of smx between 1550 and 1350 cm 1 which confirmed its presence in the loaded hszsm 5 the typical bands of hszsm 5 appear overlapped with the smx bands particularly in the regions of 3465 3143 1089 833 687 580 cm 1 there was no significant shift in the bands of the raw materials revealing that a weak zeolites drug interaction through van der waals forces and or hydrophobic interaction the spectrum of hszsm 5 smx regenerated by o3 produced a difference in subtle places as indicated in fig 6 comparing the hszsm 5 smx spectrum with regeneration conditions at ph 6 and 10 it is clear that the spectra of hszsm 5 smx after regeneration at ph of 10 was close to that of the hszsm 5 with no bands between 1550 and 1350 cm 1 suggesting that the isoxazole ring of smx was removed after regeneration the spectra of hszsm 5 smx after regeneration at ph of 6 was close to that of hszsm 5 smx which still had the peaks of the isoxazole ring suggesting that adsorbed smx was not effectively removed by ozone at ph of 6 3 4 2 xrd fig 7 shows the xrd patterns of origin hszsm 5 and hszsm 5 smx at different regeneration cycles the patterns of all the zeolites had the representative peaks at 8 9 and 22 24 which showed that the virgin hszsm 5 had mfi structure 24 the structure of hszsm 5 smx after regeneration was similar as the pristine hszsm 5 meaning that the structure of the hszsm 5 was not destroyed during regeneration the 2θ value at 7 8 corresponded to 020 and 200 of sinusoidal channels which were the main filling channels of hszsm 5 the intensity of the peak at 2θ 7 8 decreased with the increase of regeneration cycle this was explained by that the sinusoidal channels of hszsm 5 were filled by smx which was responsible for the decrease of the equilibrium adsorption capacity and its recovery ratio of loaded hszsm 5 after regeneration y is the ratio of the peak area of regenerated hszsm 5 to the peak area of pristine hszsm 5 at 2θ 7 8 it was found that y values of hszsm 5 smx hszsm 5 smx regenerated at ph of 6 and 10 were 58 6 76 3 and 93 6 respectively as shown in table s1 this meant that the larger the y value the closer the regenerated sample was to pristine one the result indicated that smx adsorbed by hszsm 5 was removed effectively by ozonation particularly at ph of 10 the pore filling degree of regenerated samples was much closer to the pristine hszsm 5 3 4 3 tg dtg the thermal stability of the zeolites were investigated by tg dtg and the diagrams obtained are presented in fig 8 two regions of mass loss were observed the first weight loss occurred around 100 c which was ascribed to the loss of absorbed water molecules in the hszsm 5 the second weight loss region from 300 to 400 c corresponded to the decomposition of smx 25 except the pristine hszsm 5 the prominent peak of mass loss can be identified in the dtg curves the intensity of the peaks at 316 326 c increased meaning that much more smx existed in the zeolites this result could explain the decreased re values of regenerated hszsm 5 moreover the thermal stability of the regenerated hszsm 5 decreased due to residual smx in the hszsm 5 4 conclusions almost a complete smx removal 97 and totally recovered hszsm 5 was obtained under batch experiment conditions higher ph pka 2 was favorable for the regeneration of hszsm 5 loaded with smx by water dissolved ozone the adsorbed isoxazole ring of smx on hszsm 5 was removed due to ozone at ph of 10 demonstrated by ftir analysis the adsorption of regenerated hszsm 5 still followed the pseudo second order model tga dtg and xrd studies further confirmed that much more sinusoidal channels of hszsm 5 were filled by residual smx in the regenerated hszsm 5 with continuous adsorption ozonation cycles this study established the feasibility of a sequential process combining smx adsorption with ozone in situ

14264,this paper presents an event triggered nonlinear model predictive control nmpc to improve the performance of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp the goal of this paper is to design a simplified event triggered nmpc etnmpc suitable for practical implementation unlike the conventional nmpc where an optimisation problem is solved at each sampling instant in the proposed event based formulation of nmpc the optimisation problem is re evaluated only when a certain triggering condition is satisfied a triggering condition is designed based on deviation of error or one step ahead prediction of error from a predefined threshold value if one of these goes beyond the predefined threshold limit or the time gap from the triggering of last event crosses the maximum allowable time limit a new event is triggered the controller is designed to improve the overall performance of a wwtp by regulating two significant variables i e nitrate and dissolved oxygen concentrations at some specified set points a conventional nmpc is also designed the performances of the proposed controller is compared with a conventional nmpc and pi controller both nmpc and etnmpc are able to improve effluent quality and overall cost index of the wwtp when compared with pi controller but a significant reduction in computation and communication almost 50 is achieved in the case of etnmpc when compared with the conventional nmpc keywords event triggered control nonlinear model predictive control waste water treatment process bsm1 1 introduction wastewater treatment is indispensable for smooth operation of today s civilisation biological wastewater treatment plant is the most preferred one for municipal wastewater treatment it is a process which involves complex nonlinear dynamics with large perturbations in influent moreover strict environmental regulations are to be met by the effluent at a reasonable operating cost an automatic control structure design is required to improve the performance of such a vital plant designing of a control structure fulfilling all these requirements makes the control task of wastewater treatment process wwtp challenging one this paper is not aimed to design a new wastewater treatment plant to meet all the needs rather emphasis is given to meet the effluent quality regulations at reasonable economic expenses by designing a suitable control structure of the existing plant in the literature various approaches are available for the enhancement of performances of a wwtp 1 4 different control attempts are also made to improve the performance of existing wwtp but wide variations of the considered processes and influent data make the comparison of the designed controllers very difficult benchmark simulation model no 1 bsm1 developed by the international water association iwa 5 has given the researchers a standard platform for designing and testing their new control techniques 6 7 a simple activated sludge model containing single anoxic and aerobic tank is considered in 8 a control law based on dissipativity property of the entire plant is proposed for carbon and nitrogen removal from the plant in 9 mpc is designed based on both linear and nonlinear model for control of ammonia of a wwtp a linear mpc is designed to control dissolved oxygen do in an activated sludge process in 10 in 11 an adaptive fuzzy controller is proposed for do control in bsm1 a fuzzy mpc is designed for do control in 12 santin et al 13 proposed a two level hierarchical control strategy applying variable do set point most of these papers focused on control of dissolved oxygen of wwtp but zeng et al 6 came up with the idea of designing an economic mpc for bsm1 after that one more paper 14 came out where a pure economic mpc and a hybrid economic mpc are proposed combining both economic and tracking objectives this is indeed a promising research direction in control of wwtp but our present paper reveals another interesting research direction application of event triggered nmpc in control of wwtp the interest for the event triggered control etc has been growing up during last few years because of its edges over the time driven control the classical control theory is mainly governed by periodic sampling time as it is easy to implement in a computer based control framework here the continuously measured signal is sampled with a constant time period and the control signal is implemented in a periodic manner without bothering the dynamical features of the system but if we look around we will find many situations where such periodic sampling is actually not logical there exists situations where it is either not required to examine the process output continuously or to compute control actions periodically since all systems in real world do not follow any strict periodic patterns this may result in superfluous sampling and control actions wasting computation and communication resources 15 for these reasons an event based sampling and an event based control are very attractive alternative and gaining popularity in the control fraternity during recent years 16 21 unlike time driven control strategies in these approaches sampling is intermittent and control signal is calculated in a sporadic manner the event triggered control considers the system behaviours e g when system error goes beyond a certain limit uses this information to trigger a control signal and results into a control structure which behaves in an asynchronous manner etc works only when it is really necessary etc offers a couple of advantages such as resource utilisation by reducing computational load increases actuator life by minimising actuator load etc even it is seen that an event triggered control strategy sometimes outperforms the time triggered one in distributed control systems it can lower the data exchange rate among various control agents significantly 22 23 in a network control system where mode of communication between sensors controllers and actuators is through communication networks an etc can save communication cost significantly therefore the application of event based control in a network control system constitutes a major portion of the literature in event triggered control 24 28 model predictive control mpc may be considered as a bridge between theory and practice perhaps it is the only control strategy which is popular among both academics and industries the reason for its popularity is the explicit constraint handling capability these constraints may include actuator constraint process limitation or safety related constraints in the presence of these constraints mpc provides an optimal solution nonlinear model predictive control nmpc calculates the control signal by solving an optimisation problem online for large systems solving an optimisation problem at each sampling instant increases computational load which hinders the real life implementation of nmpc in many situations if we can develop a nmpc where optimisation problem is not required to be solved at each sampling instant yet maintains a good performance it will open a new door to the enhancement of practical applications of nmpc in various fields this has given birth to the idea of an event triggered nmpc and is the main motivation behind this work a few researchers have attempted to extend the event based concept in mpc reference 29 proposed a concept of generalised predictive control gpc considering event based sampling the same concept has been applied in ph control of photo bioreactors 30 an event based concept in nmpc was proposed by 31 32 the contribution of this paper mainly lies on to design and investigate the scope of an event triggered nonlinear model predictive control in a real application like waste water treatment process so far as authors knowledge is concerned paper regarding application of event triggered nmpc is hardly found in the existing literature here a simplified event triggered nonlinear mpc etnmpc is proposed and waste water treatment process bsm1 is used to validate the proposed controller the concept behind the proposed etnmpc is to utilise the tail of already calculated optimal control trajectory until a certain triggering condition is satisfied instead of solving the optimisation problem at every sampling instant first a conventional nonlinear mpc is designed to keep two significant controlled variables of bsm1 the nitrate concentration in the second anoxic tank s no 2 and do concentration in the fifth tank s o 5 at specified set points by manipulating internal recycle flow rate q a and oxygen transfer coefficient in the fifth tank k l a 5 then our proposed etnmpc is also designed for the same purpose the performance of the proposed controller is compared with the conventional nmpc and also with default pi it is observed that our proposed etnmpc is able to improve effluent quality eq and reduce overall cost index oci compared to existing controllers and also lessen the computational load of conventional nmpc the organisation of the remaining part of the paper is as follows in section 2 a brief description of the waste water treatment process bsm1 considered in the present work is given in section 3 first an introduction of nmpc is given for novice readers then the proposed event triggered nmpc is described the results of the designed controller along with comparison with other controllers are given in section 4 to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller finally section 5 draws the conclusions of the proposed work 2 benchmark simulation model 1 bsm1 the simulation and evaluation of the proposed control strategy is conducted using benchmark simulation model 1 bsm1 the schematic diagram of bsm1 is shown in fig 1 it is comprised of five compartments activated sludge reactor and a secondary settler next to it the first two compartments of the reactor are anoxic having a volume of 1000 m 3 each and the last three compartments are aerobic and have a volume of 1333 m 3 each wastewater enters the first anoxic tank with a flow rate of q o and concentration z o wastewater consists of thirteen different components shown in table 1 aim of the bsm1 is to remove nitrogen related species from wastewater since municipal wastewater mainly contains these components it is achieved through certain biological reactions done by some special microorganisms nitrification reaction in which bacteria converts ammonia into nitrate takes place in aerated tanks denitrification where nitrate is converted to nitrogen takes place in the first two anoxic compartments an internal recycle q a z a from the fifth tank is fed back to supply nitrate rich water to the first anoxic tank where denitrification occurs remaining water is supplied to the secondary settler which is a nonreactive unit with 10 layers out of which 6 th layer from base is the feed layer here settling is done by gravity the total volume of the secondary settler is 6000 m 3 an external recycle q r z r from the bottom of the settler is also fed back to the first tank this recycle maintains the concentrations of autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria in the reactors so that the reactions are not interrupted excess sludge is taken out at flow rate q w and concentrations z w from lowermost layer of settler

problem at each sampling instant demands a rigorous computational need in nmpc implementation which is often not necessary when a system operates in its nominal conditions in order to get rid of this an event triggered mpc algorithm is designed an event based controller is generally composed of two main components an event detector and a controller 2 the structure of the event triggered controlled system is depicted in fig 2 when a new event occurs the event detector sends the information to the controller and then only controller calculates a new control sequence the new calculated control sequence is sent to the actuator which is connected through communication network dashed line with the event triggered controller since control values are updated only at the triggering instances it is possible to transmit the whole control sequence as shown in the fig 2 in one packet at the triggering instant the need to send the next packet comes only at the next triggering instant because control signal are applied in open loop fashion during inter event times this way this scheme reduces the transmission cost the greatest advantage of implementation of this event based concept is it reduces the frequency of solving the optimisation problem in nmpc so it reduces the computational load involved in nmpc here a simplified event triggered nmpc algorithm 1 is designed to be suitable

optimisation problem and x k is the corresponding state values here we have considered both prediction and control horizon as n p n c n when no event is triggered then the tail of the optimal control sequence calculated in previous instant is used as new control input as shown in the algorithm it is assumed that buffered actuator preserves the most recent values of control horizon and applies the corresponding values of control signal to the plant when no new evaluation is carried out control signal is applied using zero order hold between two sampling instant triggering condition at the very first sampling instant a new event is generated after that at every other sampling instants i e k 1 the triggering conditions are checked three different conditions are used to check the occurrence of a new event if one of these conditions is satisfied a new event will be generated the first condition is associated with the process output if the absolute value of output error i e the absolute difference between the current measurement of process output and the desired setpoint y set t y t exceeds a predefined threshold limit an event is triggered the deviation of one step ahead predicted output from the desired set point de dt is also checked if this deviation exceeds the predefined threshold value then also a new event is generated to prevent possible future limit violation these conditions are designed to ensure the fact that the controller maintains a good tracking performance the third triggering condition is fulfilled if the time gap from the triggering of last event crosses the maximum allowable time limit between two consecutive events here the maximum time limit is n where is the sampling time and n is the control horizon the triggering condition can be expressed as if y set t y t γ or de dt σ or t t e n event 1 else event 0 t e is the time when the last event was triggered the triggering conditions available in the existing literature are very complex and therefore difficult to implement in practice thus our main motive of the current paper is to design a simplified event triggered nmpc suitable for practical implementation remark 1 the triggering condition is checked at every sampling instant k k 1 2 3 and optimal control trajectory is recalculated only when new event is triggered let triggering instant is denoted by tr i i 1 2 3 then tr i k 4 simulation results discussion in this section results obtained by applying a nonlinear model predictive controller and the proposed event triggered nmpc are evaluated and compared three influent disturbances representing three different weather conditions i e dry weather rain and storm weather are considered for evaluation of the designed controller each weather file contains 14 days of influent data at a sampling interval of 15 minutes prediction and control horizon n 5 is used for both nmpc and event triggered nmpc in our design the data files used in this work are taken from iwa website first the plant is simulated for 150 days under constant inputs then the different weather files are applied all influent files contain 14 days of data and performances are evaluated for last 7 days all simulations are realised using matlab r2015b 4 1 performance criteria the performance is checked at two levels first level is set point tracking performance of s no 2 and s o 5 which is evaluated by integral of absolute error iae and integral of squared error ise defined as iae t 7 days t 14 days e i dt ise t 7 days t 14 days e i 2 dt where e i is the error between the set point and measured value second level administers the effect of controller at the plant performance it includes effluent quality eq index and overall cost index oci effluent quality it is a measure of quality of the effluent it expresses the levies or fines to be paid because of discharging pollutants eq is the average of weighted summation of effluent loads of different components that have a considerable impact on quality of the water 9 eq 1 1000 t t 7 days t 14 days 2 tss e t cod e t 30 s nkj e t 10 s no e t 2 bod e t q e t dt where t is the total observation period last 7 days for each weather file here tss refers to total suspended solids cod denotes chemical oxygen demand s nkj is the kjeldahl nitrogen concentration bod is the biological oxygen demand and subscript e is used to represent effluent for the detailed description of the variables readers are requested to refer to alex et al 2008 overall cost index this is one of the most important index related to the operating cost of the plant as defined in alex et al 2008 it is calculated as follows 10 oci ae pe 5 sp me for different operations of a wwtp energy is required aeration energy ae is the energy involved in aeration process which is calculated as 11 ae 8 1 8 1000 t t 7 days t 14 days i 1 5 v i k l a i t dt here v i is the volume of i th tank of the bioreactor the pumping energy pe is the energy used for different flows through pumps and is calculated as 12 pe 1 t t 7 days t 14 days 0 004 q a t 0 008 q r t 0 05 q w t dt the sludge production sp is determined by accounting solid from the wastage flow

effluent should obey certain limits which are given in table 2 tracking results of nitrate concentration in the second tank s no 2 and the corresponding control input q a for dry weather using conventional nmpc are shown in fig 3 dissolved oxygen concentration in the fifth tank s o 5 and control input k l a 5 using conventional nmpc under dry influent are shown in fig 4 similarly tracking results using nmpc for both s no 2 and s o 5 are shown in fig 5 fig 6 under rain weather and fig 7 fig 8 under storm weather case tracking results of s no 2 and s o 5 along with their manipulated variable q a and k l a 5 under our proposed event triggered nmpc for dry influent are shown in fig 9 the last plot of fig 9 shows the event generated throughout the considered simulation period from day 7 to day 14 the dashed lines indicate the allowed tolerance bound γ used for s no 2 and s o 5 similarly overall tracking results of both the controlled variables with control inputs and events with our designed event triggered nmpc are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 under rain and storm influent respectively for better vision and understanding the tracking performance of event triggered nmpc etnmpc with events generated for dry weather between day 10 to day 11 are shown in fig 12 the dashed lines show the allowed tolerance band on controlled variables if a new event is generated then event 1 and in case of no event generation event 0 are used it is noticed from this figure that density of the events is more when the controlled output goes beyond the threshold limit dashed line it is because in order to recover the performance controller tries to bring back the output within the limit as fast as possible by generating faster events if performance is within the limit then a new event is generated when it exceeds the maximum time limit from the last event generation thus we can say that event based nmpc is more logical than conventional one because it avoids the redundant computation by reducing the frequency of solving optimisation problem and hence reduces computational cost still maintains acceptable performance though tracking result of the proposed etnmpc is not better compared with a conventional nmpc but effluent quality and overall cost index are almost same to that of nmpc which are the main target of a wwtp due to widely varying disturbances in the wwtp tracking does not seem to be perfect but almost close to the desired set points throughout the operation time it may be noted that the perfect tracking is not the main objective of a wwtp the main objective of a wwtp is to improve the overall performance of the plant and to maintain the required environmental regulations with the proposed controller overall plant performance i e effluent quality eq and overall cost index oci are improved and also we are able to maintain the required effluent quality limits as mentioned in table 2 the performance of the proposed etnmpc is compared with a conventional nmpc and also with the default pi controller and is shown in table 3 for better visual comparison of tracking performance of day 10 to 11 is shown in fig 13 from table 3 it is observed that tracking performance of etnmpc in terms of iae and ise is better than default pi controller but iae and ise are higher compared to conventional nmpc but no of events generated in case of etnmpc is drastically reduced than the conventional nmpc in case of dry weather no of event generated in our designed etnmpc is reduced to 55 82 and 41 19 and 45 37 in case of rain and storm influent respectively i e almost all the cases computational burden of etnmpc is reduced to half of that of conventional nmpc it is found that the plant level performances effluent quality eq and oci using etnmpc are similar to that of conventional nmpc and sufficiently good compared with pi controller but in the case of etnmpc the computational burden is significantly low compared with the conventional nmpc in a large plant like wwtp the controller may not be situated in the site i e near the plant now considering a network based control i e the communication between controller and actuator or sensor and controller happens through a network there is a benefit of considerable reduction of data flow with the proposed event based formulation it is observed that the average values of the significant effluent variables are also able to maintain their required standard limits mentioned in table 2 by both the designed controllers nmpc and etnmpc tracking performance of etnmpc can be adjusted by setting different threshold limit here we have selected threshold value γ and σ to maintain an acceptable performance these are design parameters if some specific performance limits are to be maintained in real wwtps to satisfy environmental regulations one can select these values to meet those requirements a much smaller threshold limit will improve the tracking performance but computational burden will also increase by increasing no of events so we have the flexibility to select threshold limit based on our requirement whether we want to give emphasis on control accuracy or the computational cost or a trade off between these two 5 conclusion in this work a simplified nonlinear event triggered model predictive controller is proposed to control a waste water treatment process the proposed controller is suitable for practical implementation a conventional nmpc is also designed the performance of the proposed controller is compared with nmpc and pi controllers from the simulation results we conclude that both the nmpc and etnmpc are able to improve the tracking performance of nitrate and dissolved oxygen concentration of bsm1 when compared with that of a pi controller the proposed etnmpc is able to significantly reduce the computational burden of nmpc it is almost 50 here so etnmpc may be a promising solution considering computational complexity for a large system like a waste water treatment process control overall plant performance of a wwtp i e effluent quality and overall cost index are found to be almost same in case of etnmpc and nmpc the individual standard of effluent regulations are also met by the proposed controller the tracking performance of s no 2 and s o 5 is not good in case of etnmpc when compared with that of the nmpc however in case of a wastewater treatment process the accuracy of this tracking result may not be that much critical compared to overall plant performance the plant performance indices i e eq oci and meeting the standard environmental regulations of significant variables are well achieved by the proposed etnmpc which are the main goals of a wwtp finally it can be concluded that the application of the proposed etnmpc may be a promising solution to control a waste water treatment process 
14264,this paper presents an event triggered nonlinear model predictive control nmpc to improve the performance of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp the goal of this paper is to design a simplified event triggered nmpc etnmpc suitable for practical implementation unlike the conventional nmpc where an optimisation problem is solved at each sampling instant in the proposed event based formulation of nmpc the optimisation problem is re evaluated only when a certain triggering condition is satisfied a triggering condition is designed based on deviation of error or one step ahead prediction of error from a predefined threshold value if one of these goes beyond the predefined threshold limit or the time gap from the triggering of last event crosses the maximum allowable time limit a new event is triggered the controller is designed to improve the overall performance of a wwtp by regulating two significant variables i e nitrate and dissolved oxygen concentrations at some specified set points a conventional nmpc is also designed the performances of the proposed controller is compared with a conventional nmpc and pi controller both nmpc and etnmpc are able to improve effluent quality and overall cost index of the wwtp when compared with pi controller but a significant reduction in computation and communication almost 50 is achieved in the case of etnmpc when compared with the conventional nmpc keywords event triggered control nonlinear model predictive control waste water treatment process bsm1 1 introduction wastewater treatment is indispensable for smooth operation of today s civilisation biological wastewater treatment plant is the most preferred one for municipal wastewater treatment it is a process which involves complex nonlinear dynamics with large perturbations in influent moreover strict environmental regulations are to be met by the effluent at a reasonable operating cost an automatic control structure design is required to improve the performance of such a vital plant designing of a control structure fulfilling all these requirements makes the control task of wastewater treatment process wwtp challenging one this paper is not aimed to design a new wastewater treatment plant to meet all the needs rather emphasis is given to meet the effluent quality regulations at reasonable economic expenses by designing a suitable control structure of the existing plant in the literature various approaches are available for the enhancement of performances of a wwtp 1 4 different control attempts are also made to improve the performance of existing wwtp but wide variations of the considered processes and influent data make the comparison of the designed controllers very difficult benchmark simulation model no 1 bsm1 developed by the international water association iwa 5 has given the researchers a standard platform for designing and testing their new control techniques 6 7 a simple activated sludge model containing single anoxic and aerobic tank is considered in 8 a control law based on dissipativity property of the entire plant is proposed for carbon and nitrogen removal from the plant in 9 mpc is designed based on both linear and nonlinear model for control of ammonia of a wwtp a linear mpc is designed to control dissolved oxygen do in an activated sludge process in 10 in 11 an adaptive fuzzy controller is proposed for do control in bsm1 a fuzzy mpc is designed for do control in 12 santin et al 13 proposed a two level hierarchical control strategy applying variable do set point most of these papers focused on control of dissolved oxygen of wwtp but zeng et al 6 came up with the idea of designing an economic mpc for bsm1 after that one more paper 14 came out where a pure economic mpc and a hybrid economic mpc are proposed combining both economic and tracking objectives this is indeed a promising research direction in control of wwtp but our present paper reveals another interesting research direction application of event triggered nmpc in control of wwtp the interest for the event triggered control etc has been growing up during last few years because of its edges over the time driven control the classical control theory is mainly governed by periodic sampling time as it is easy to implement in a computer based control framework here the continuously measured signal is sampled with a constant time period and the control signal is implemented in a periodic manner without bothering the dynamical features of the system but if we look around we will find many situations where such periodic sampling is actually not logical there exists situations where it is either not required to examine the process output continuously or to compute control actions periodically since all systems in real world do not follow any strict periodic patterns this may result in superfluous sampling and control actions wasting computation and communication resources 15 for these reasons an event based sampling and an event based control are very attractive alternative and gaining popularity in the control fraternity during recent years 16 21 unlike time driven control strategies in these approaches sampling is intermittent and control signal is calculated in a sporadic manner the event triggered control considers the system behaviours e g when system error goes beyond a certain limit uses this information to trigger a control signal and results into a control structure which behaves in an asynchronous manner etc works only when it is really necessary etc offers a couple of advantages such as resource utilisation by reducing computational load increases actuator life by minimising actuator load etc even it is seen that an event triggered control strategy sometimes outperforms the time triggered one in distributed control systems it can lower the data exchange rate among various control agents significantly 22 23 in a network control system where mode of communication between sensors controllers and actuators is through communication networks an etc can save communication cost significantly therefore the application of event based control in a network control system constitutes a major portion of the literature in event triggered control 24 28 model predictive control mpc may be considered as a bridge between theory and practice perhaps it is the only control strategy which is popular among both academics and industries the reason for its popularity is the explicit constraint handling capability these constraints may include actuator constraint process limitation or safety related constraints in the presence of these constraints mpc provides an optimal solution nonlinear model predictive control nmpc calculates the control signal by solving an optimisation problem online for large systems solving an optimisation problem at each sampling instant increases computational load which hinders the real life implementation of nmpc in many situations if we can develop a nmpc where optimisation problem is not required to be solved at each sampling instant yet maintains a good performance it will open a new door to the enhancement of practical applications of nmpc in various fields this has given birth to the idea of an event triggered nmpc and is the main motivation behind this work a few researchers have attempted to extend the event based concept in mpc reference 29 proposed a concept of generalised predictive control gpc considering event based sampling the same concept has been applied in ph control of photo bioreactors 30 an event based concept in nmpc was proposed by 31 32 the contribution of this paper mainly lies on to design and investigate the scope of an event triggered nonlinear model predictive control in a real application like waste water treatment process so far as authors knowledge is concerned paper regarding application of event triggered nmpc is hardly found in the existing literature here a simplified event triggered nonlinear mpc etnmpc is proposed and waste water treatment process bsm1 is used to validate the proposed controller the concept behind the proposed etnmpc is to utilise the tail of already calculated optimal control trajectory until a certain triggering condition is satisfied instead of solving the optimisation problem at every sampling instant first a conventional nonlinear mpc is designed to keep two significant controlled variables of bsm1 the nitrate concentration in the second anoxic tank s no 2 and do concentration in the fifth tank s o 5 at specified set points by manipulating internal recycle flow rate q a and oxygen transfer coefficient in the fifth tank k l a 5 then our proposed etnmpc is also designed for the same purpose the performance of the proposed controller is compared with the conventional nmpc and also with default pi it is observed that our proposed etnmpc is able to improve effluent quality eq and reduce overall cost index oci compared to existing controllers and also lessen the computational load of conventional nmpc the organisation of the remaining part of the paper is as follows in section 2 a brief description of the waste water treatment process bsm1 considered in the present work is given in section 3 first an introduction of nmpc is given for novice readers then the proposed event triggered nmpc is described the results of the designed controller along with comparison with other controllers are given in section 4 to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller finally section 5 draws the conclusions of the proposed work 2 benchmark simulation model 1 bsm1 the simulation and evaluation of the proposed control strategy is conducted using benchmark simulation model 1 bsm1 the schematic diagram of bsm1 is shown in fig 1 it is comprised of five compartments activated sludge reactor and a secondary settler next to it the first two compartments of the reactor are anoxic having a volume of 1000 m 3 each and the last three compartments are aerobic and have a volume of 1333 m 3 each wastewater enters the first anoxic tank with a flow rate of q o and concentration z o wastewater consists of thirteen different components shown in table 1 aim of the bsm1 is to remove nitrogen related species from wastewater since municipal wastewater mainly contains these components it is achieved through certain biological reactions done by some special microorganisms nitrification reaction in which bacteria converts ammonia into nitrate takes place in aerated tanks denitrification where nitrate is converted to nitrogen takes place in the first two anoxic compartments an internal recycle q a z a from the fifth tank is fed back to supply nitrate rich water to the first anoxic tank where denitrification occurs remaining water is supplied to the secondary settler which is a nonreactive unit with 10 layers out of which 6 th layer from base is the feed layer here settling is done by gravity the total volume of the secondary settler is 6000 m 3 an external recycle q r z r from the bottom of the settler is also fed back to the first tank this recycle maintains the concentrations of autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria in the reactors so that the reactions are not interrupted excess sludge is taken out at flow rate q w and concentrations z w from lowermost layer of settler

conditions are designed to ensure the fact that the controller maintains a good tracking performance the third triggering condition is fulfilled if the time gap from the triggering of last event crosses the maximum allowable time limit between two consecutive events here the maximum time limit is n where is the sampling time and n is the control horizon the triggering condition can be expressed as if y set t y t γ or de dt σ or t t e n event 1 else event 0 t e is the time when the last event was triggered the triggering conditions available in the existing literature are very complex and therefore difficult to implement in practice thus our main motive of the current paper is to design a simplified event triggered nmpc suitable for practical implementation remark 1 the triggering condition is checked at every sampling instant k k 1 2 3 and optimal control trajectory is recalculated only when new event is triggered let triggering instant is denoted by tr i i 1 2 3 then tr i k 4 simulation results discussion in this section results obtained by applying a nonlinear model predictive controller and the proposed event triggered nmpc are evaluated and compared three influent disturbances representing three different weather conditions i e dry weather rain and storm weather are considered for evaluation of the designed controller each weather file contains 14 days of influent data at a sampling interval of 15 minutes prediction and control horizon n 5 is used for both nmpc and event triggered nmpc in our design the data files used in this work are taken from iwa website first the plant is simulated for 150 days under constant inputs then the different weather files are applied all influent files contain 14 days of data and performances are evaluated for last 7 days all simulations are realised using matlab r2015b 4 1 performance criteria the performance is checked at two levels first level is set point tracking performance of s no 2 and s o 5 which is evaluated by integral of absolute error iae and integral of squared error ise defined as iae t 7 days t 14 days e i dt ise t 7 days t 14 days e i 2 dt where e i is the error between the set point and measured value second level administers the effect of controller at the plant performance it includes effluent quality eq index and overall cost index oci effluent quality it is a measure of quality of the effluent it expresses the levies or fines to be paid because of discharging pollutants eq is the average of weighted summation of effluent loads of different components that have a considerable impact on quality of the water 9 eq 1 1000 t t 7 days t 14 days 2 tss e t cod e t 30 s nkj e t 10 s no e t 2 bod e t q e t dt where t is the total observation period last 7 days for each weather file here tss refers to total suspended solids cod denotes chemical oxygen demand s nkj is the kjeldahl nitrogen concentration bod is the biological oxygen demand and subscript e is used to represent effluent for the detailed description of the variables readers are requested to refer to alex et al 2008 overall cost index this is one of the most important index related to the operating cost of the plant as defined in alex et al 2008 it is calculated as follows 10 oci ae pe 5 sp me for different operations of a wwtp energy is required aeration energy ae is the energy involved in

effluent should obey certain limits which are given in table 2 tracking results of nitrate concentration in the second tank s no 2 and the corresponding control input q a for dry weather using conventional nmpc are shown in fig 3 dissolved oxygen concentration in the fifth tank s o 5 and control input k l a 5 using conventional nmpc under dry influent are shown in fig 4 similarly tracking results using nmpc for both s no 2 and s o 5 are shown in fig 5 fig 6 under rain weather and fig 7 fig 8 under storm weather case tracking results of s no 2 and s o 5 along with their manipulated variable q a and k l a 5 under our proposed event triggered nmpc for dry influent are shown in fig 9 the last plot of fig 9 shows the event generated throughout the considered simulation period from day 7 to day 14 the dashed lines indicate the allowed tolerance bound γ used for s no 2 and s o 5 similarly overall tracking results of both the controlled variables with control inputs and events with our designed event triggered nmpc are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 under rain and storm influent respectively for better vision and understanding the tracking performance of event triggered nmpc etnmpc with events generated for dry weather between day 10 to day 11 are shown in fig 12 the dashed lines show the allowed tolerance band on controlled variables if a new event is generated then event 1 and in case of no event generation event 0 are used it is noticed from this figure that density of the events is more when the controlled output goes beyond the threshold limit dashed line it is because in order to recover the performance controller tries to bring back the output within the limit as fast as possible by generating faster events if performance is within the limit then a new event is generated when it exceeds the maximum time limit from the last event generation thus we can say that event based nmpc is more logical than conventional one because it avoids the redundant computation by reducing the frequency of solving optimisation problem and hence reduces computational cost still maintains acceptable performance though tracking result of the proposed etnmpc is not better compared with a conventional nmpc but effluent quality and overall cost index are almost same to that of nmpc which are the main target of a wwtp due to widely varying disturbances in the wwtp tracking does not seem to be perfect but almost close to the desired set points throughout the operation time it may be noted that the perfect tracking is not the main objective of a wwtp the main objective of a wwtp is to improve the overall performance of the plant and to maintain the required environmental regulations with the proposed controller overall plant performance i e effluent quality eq and overall cost index oci are improved and also we are able to maintain the required effluent quality limits as mentioned in table 2 the performance of the proposed etnmpc is compared with a conventional nmpc and also with the default pi controller and is shown in table 3 for better visual comparison of tracking performance of day 10 to 11 is shown in fig 13 from table 3 it is observed that tracking performance of etnmpc in terms of iae and ise is better than default pi controller but iae and ise are higher compared to conventional nmpc but no of events generated in case of etnmpc is drastically reduced than the conventional nmpc in case of dry weather no of event generated in our designed etnmpc is reduced to 55 82 and 41 19 and 45 37 in case of rain and storm influent respectively i e almost all the cases computational burden of etnmpc is reduced to half of that of conventional nmpc it is found that the plant level performances effluent quality eq and oci using etnmpc are similar to that of conventional nmpc and sufficiently good compared with pi controller but in the case of etnmpc the computational burden is significantly low compared with the conventional nmpc in a large plant like wwtp the controller may not be situated in the site i e near the plant now considering a network based control i e the communication between controller and actuator or sensor and controller happens through a network there is a benefit of considerable reduction of data flow with the proposed event based formulation it is observed that the average values of the significant effluent variables are also able to maintain their required standard limits mentioned in table 2 by both the designed controllers nmpc and etnmpc tracking performance of etnmpc can be adjusted by setting different threshold limit here we have selected threshold value γ and σ to maintain an acceptable performance these are design parameters if some specific performance limits are to be maintained in real wwtps to satisfy environmental regulations one can select these values to meet those requirements a much smaller threshold limit will improve the tracking performance but computational burden will also increase by increasing no of events so we have the flexibility to select threshold limit based on our requirement whether we want to give emphasis on control accuracy or the computational cost or a trade off between these two 5 conclusion in this work a simplified nonlinear event triggered model predictive controller is proposed to control a waste water treatment process the proposed controller is suitable for practical implementation a conventional nmpc is also designed the performance of the proposed controller is compared with nmpc and pi controllers from the simulation results we conclude that both the nmpc and etnmpc are able to improve the tracking performance of nitrate and dissolved oxygen concentration of bsm1 when compared with that of a pi controller the proposed etnmpc is able to significantly reduce the computational burden of nmpc it is almost 50 here so etnmpc may be a promising solution considering computational complexity for a large system like a waste water treatment process control overall plant performance of a wwtp i e effluent quality and overall cost index are found to be almost same in case of etnmpc and nmpc the individual standard of effluent regulations are also met by the proposed controller the tracking performance of s no 2 and s o 5 is not good in case of etnmpc when compared with that of the nmpc however in case of a wastewater treatment process the accuracy of this tracking result may not be that much critical compared to overall plant performance the plant performance indices i e eq oci and meeting the standard environmental regulations of significant variables are well achieved by the proposed etnmpc which are the main goals of a wwtp finally it can be concluded that the application of the proposed etnmpc may be a promising solution to control a waste water treatment process
