4080,proper understanding of rainfall variability is of essential importance for meteorological and hydrological modelling this study examines whether a variety of nonlinear dynamic concepts can yield additional insights in the rainfall variability in the uk daily rainfall data recorded over a 30 yr period 1989 2018 from 32 meteorological stations across the uk are analysed using recurrence plots recurrence quantification analysis techniques and phase space reconstructions the results of this analysis underscore the complex processes and variability that are associated with the uk s rainfall data the existence of chaos in uk rainfall data was identified and the extent of complexity in rainfall dynamics exhibited apparent geographic variability in general rainfall dynamics associated with stations on the eastern coast and in central england tend to be more complex than those at other regions rainfall dynamics in western and northern scotland were found to reveal marked long term variability moreover likewise to the rainfall total seasonal variability in rainfall dynamics was also evident keywords rainfall variability chaos theory nonlinear dynamics phase space reconstruction

local climate adaption planning and policy making etc brand et al 1984 wu et al 2010 gil alana 2012 jones et al 2013 nayak et al 2013 unnikrishnan and jothiprakash 2015 mohammadi et al 2020a mohammadi et al 2020b rainfall characteristics in the uk have long been a major focus of concern and have been extensively investigated in several previous studies faulkner and prudhomme 1998 osborn et al 2000 alexander and jones 2000 osborn et al 2000 fowler and kilsby 2003 maraun et al 2008 2009 jenkins et al 2008 blenkinsop et al 2017 it was shown that the uk rainfall data is subjected to distinct geographic variability in which the mountainous areas of wales northern and western scotland as well as south west and north west england are typically the wettest regions across the country whereas the south east coast and further inland regions of england tend to be comparatively drier in addition to the inhomogeneous spatial distribution the temporal variability of rainfall and its characteristics within an annual cycle are also apparent in general heavy rainfall events occur mostly during autumn and winter months blenkinsop et al 2017 reported that different spatial distribution patterns of rainfall may be observed in the uk due to the changes in seasonality which is fundamentally associated with the rainfall generating mechanism at different temporal scales at different times throughout the year in particular a west east pattern of decreasing rainfall can often be identified from autumn to spring which coincides well with the dominant pattern of the north atlantic depression track osborn et al 2000 osborn et al 2000 in contrast the distribution of summer rainfall is characterized by a somewhat less well defined northeast southwest pattern with heavy rainfall extending across central and southern england this is mainly because summer rainfall is less likely to be associated with mesoscale depression systems but instead depends on convection at more localised scales blenkinsop et al 2017 there is strong evidence showing that heavy rainfall events have occurred more frequently over the past few decades in the uk thompson et al 2017 for example the uk encountered an exceptional series of storms in the winter of 2013 14 which resulted in a substantial increase in the rainfall in january 2014 with a monthly total 30 higher than any previous january for over a century matthews et al 2014 kendon and mccarthy 2015 schaller et al 2016 such events caused 18 700 insurance claims associated with flooding across the uk costing an estimated 451 m thompson et al 2017 furthermore thompson et al 2017 highlighted that december 2015 was the wettest on record since 1910 in northern england and october 2000 was likewise the wettest on the record since 1903 across england subsequently statistics have shown that february 2020 was the wettest february on record for england wales and northern ireland and the second wettest for scotland met office 2020a inevitably the more frequent occurrence of these extreme rainfall events may pose multi dimensional hazards to critical infrastructures and the most vulnerable sectors of society jones et al 2014 the uk climate change risk assessment defra 2012 has reported that the estimated domestic and commercial insurance claims associated with flood related damage may be tripled by the 2050s on this account it is of paramount importance to diagnose and characterize the rainfall behaviour across the uk with a view to establishing appropriate risk management strategies and facilitate climate adaption decision making unfortunately precise modelling and quantification of rainfall data is not an easy task due to its highly variable nature rainfall is usually highly intermittent emmanuel et al 2012 and as such exhibits variability over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales sivakumar et al 1999 sivakumar 2000 sivakumar 2001 roux et al 2009 nayak et al 2013 ramana et al 2013 this makes rainfall one of the most difficult components of the hydrological cycle to forecast french et al 1992 toth et al 2000 gil alana 2012 furthermore the difficulty is enhanced due to the limitation in the availability of appropriate mathematical tools to investigate the structure underlying the rainfall processes sivakumar 2000 panagoulia and vlahogianni 2014 emphasized that the most critical issue in modelling the complex time dependent behaviour of rainfall is the treatment of non linearity and the temporal persistence either being long or short in the rainfall time series traditional rainfall time series analysis techniques e g the coefficient of variation of interannual rainfall variability and auto regressive integrated moving average arima analysis salas et al 1980 delsole and shukla 2002 li and zeng 2008 nayagam et al 2008 generally incorporate several constraints in terms of linearity and independence while the rainfall time series in real world situation are mostly nonlinear coles et al 2003 once noted that most classical methods for rainfall modelling do not take into account the uncertainties in the temporal evolution of rainfall time series which are therefore bounded to produce an over optimistic appraisal of anticipated rainfall extreme that is contradicted by real measured data frequently the process connecting rainfall is considered as a stochastic process however there has been growing interest in nonlinear dynamics and also chaos theory in which rainfall is considered as a chaotic system that is sensitive to initial conditions and is predictable on short term basis dhanya and kumar 2010 jothiprakash and fathima 2013 panagoulia and vlahogianni 2014 pointed out that nonlinear dynamic methods are preferred due to its flexibility in modelling complex and temporally oscillating behaviour of rainfall as well as modelling the uncertainty in the temporal evolution of rainfall sivakumar et al 1999 addressed that the most distinct difference between a stochastic system and a chaotic system is the number of variables needed to characterize the system if a system is chaotic in nature i e dominated by a low dimension attractor the system dynamics can be described by only a few modes and hence a small system of ordinary differential equations by contrast if the behavior of a system is dominated by a very large number of excited modes it is in general better described by stochastic models it is also noted that the framework of deterministic chaos appears to exhibit greater potential than the stochastic methods in terms of constructing the connection between the structure of the model and the underlying physics of rainfall process koutsoyiannis and pachakis 1996 sivakumar et al 2001 chaos theory has been used in many branches of science to take into account the random behaviour that can arise due to the inherent nonlinearity present in the system lorenz 1963 ghil et al 1991 the existence of chaotic behaviour in hydrological data especially rainfall has been documented and discussed in numerous previous studies for example the correlation dimension d the dynamic attractor of rainfall systems has been determined in several studies as a quantitative representation of the number of variables controlling the underlying dynamics rodríguez iturbe 1991 berndtsson et al 1994 jayawardena and lai 1994 puente and obregón 1996 sivakumar 2001 sivakumar et al 1999 sivakumar et al 2006 sivakumar et al 2014 kyoung et al 2011 chaos theory and nonlinear dynamic analysis have shown their ability to provide more satisfactory modelling and prediction of hydrological data than other existing methods coulibaly and baldwin 2005 laio et al 2003 compared the performance of nonlinear dynamic analysis and artificial neural networks ann in forecasting hydrological time series in which nonlinear dynamic analysis tends to exhibit slightly better performance in short term forecasting whereas ann shows better performance for long term forecasts lisi and villi 2001 reported that the nonlinear dynamic analysis by means of nearest neighbour prediction could yield more satisfactory prediction results than the classic linear arima models particularly for relatively short forecast times jayawardena and gurung 2000 highlighted that the nonlinear phase space method appeared to outperform the linear stochastic arima model with regard to synthetic and hydro meteorological time series modelling reflected by a higher correlation between the observed and predicted values sivakumar et al 2002 focused on 1 day and 7 day lead time series forecasts of river flow using both phase space reconstruction psr and ann the results showed that nonlinear dynamic analysis by psr generally provides better performance than ann the psr analysis not only captures the major trends well but also preserves the minor fluctuations in river flow series such difference is mainly attributed to the fact that the local approximation method involved in nonlinear dynamic analysis represents the system dynamics in the phase space step by step in local neighbourhoods which could capture the most important features of system dynamics in a more satisfactory manner than the global approximation method used in ann sivakumar et al 2002 this is particularly important when the time series under consideration exhibits low dimension chaotic behaviour such as rainfall in order to facilitate rainfall modelling and prediction several different nonlinear methods have been applied in previous studies to elucidate the rainfall variability by investigating the hidden structures in the underlying dynamics these have focused on the correlation dimension method e g sivakumar et al 2006 sivakumar et al 2014 the lyapunov exponent method e g rodríguez iturbe 1991 jayawardena and lai 1994 dhanya and kumar 2010 and phase space reconstruction e g waelbroeck et al 1994 ouyang et al 2016 in this study the rainfall dynamics are investigated by alternative means which to our knowledge have never previously been applied to rainfall in order to determine their capability of providing useful information on the rainfall variability from a qualitative point of view it has been underlined that investigating the nonlinear and chaotic aspects of rainfall offers additional insights into rainfall dynamics which could help improve water resources planning and management sivakumar et al 2014 moreover previous studies on rainfall dynamics are often limited to one or a few stations at the most however for water resources planning and management at national levels knowledge of rainfall dynamics over a much greater spatial extent are strongly required sharifi et al 1990 also highlighted that understanding the nonlinear dynamics has an important implication for reliable long term prediction of rainfall behaviour given the above overview it is evident that accurate rainfall modelling and prediction are subjected to a number of uncertainties while most traditional methods are incapable of effectively resolving the nonlinearity in rainfall processes it is reported e g jayawardena and lai 1994 sivakumar et al 2006 sivakumar et al 2014 that nonlinear dynamic analysis offers a new avenue to diagnose the underlying structure in rainfall process which has important implications in understanding rainfall behaviour and thus help improve rainfall modelling and prediction on this account the motivation of this paper is to determine whether techniques developed for the study of chaotic systems can be adapted to the analysis of rainfall and thus provide additional insights into the modelling of rainfall dynamics in the uk underpinning this aim are essentially three objectives the application of phase space reconstruction psr to uk rainfall data the application of recurrence plot rp to uk rainfall data the application of recurrence quantification analysis rqa to uk rainfall data to aid in the evaluation of these objectives the paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the information related to measurement site and data collection section 3 provides interpretation on the methodologies employed in this study section 4 presents the results and relevant discussion from nonlinear dynamic analysis and section 5 summarizes the major conclusions 2 data collection and site description the dataset involved in this study consists of daily rainfall data recorded over a 30 yr period spanning from 1989 to 2018 at 32 rain gauge stations see fig 1 these stations are scattered across the uk to cover a reasonably large spatial extent the rainfall data are extracted from the uk met office integrated data archive system midas archived in the british atmospheric data centre the completeness of data over the considered measurement period at each station has been examined which allows comprehensive and representative mapping of the uk rainfall characteristics rigorous quality control has been applied to the midas data by ukmo such that data errors are identified and marked before being transmitted basic quality control measures such as data range and self consistency checks are implemented with a view to ensure that meteorological values lie within the long term climatological extremes blenkinsop et al 2017 in particular the midas data contain a built in quality flag with ones and zeros which allows easy identification and exclusion of suspicious and erroneous data essentially a value of one implies the data have passed the quality checks while a value of zero is indicative of possible errors accordingly a non zero quality flag criterion is adopted in this study to ensure the fidelity of the considered data fig 2 demonstrates the typical annual time series of daily rainfall recorded at selected stations across the observation network the rainfall in the uk is largely associated with the atlantic depression or with convection hence differences in terms of the proximity to the track of the atlantic depression may lead to notable variability in spatial distribution of rainfall in addition the orographic effect i e the existence of upland and mountainous terrain may further complicate the geographic pattern of uk rainfall as shown in fig 3 the rainfall characteristics are subject to site to site variability the network average total annual rainfall is approximately 1051 mm with the largest value of 2534 mm obtained at station 25 and the lowest value of 578 mm obtained at station 12 in terms of regional rainfall totals western scotland is found to be wettest with an estimated mean annual total of more than 167 of the network average followed by north west england 136 5 south west england 131 6 and wales 111 4 the considerable rainfall recorded in these regions is primarily attributed to the combination of close exposure to the westerly or south westerly maritime air masses and the extensive area of high ground met office 2020b in contrast the midlands eastern england and southern england are comparatively much drier with an annual total generally less than 67 of the network average this is mainly because much of the midlands is sheltered from the rain bearing westerly winds due to the welsh mountains while eastern england and southern england are relatively distant from the route of major atlantic depressions on the other hand the distribution of the number of rainy days per year across the observation network is more or less similar to that of the annual total the network average of the number of rainy days per year defined as a day with rainfall greater than 0 1 mm is estimated to be 214 30 with the largest value of 275 at station 32 and the lowest value of 147 42 at station 6 overall the rainfall characteristics given here are consistent with those documented in the existing literature and represent a fairly typical pattern in the uk 3 nonlinear analysis of rainfall data 3 1 phase space reconstruction dynamic analysis of a nonlinear system often consists of reconstructing the phase space a graphical representation of the variables needed to describe the state of the system at any moment in which the entire system dynamics can be represented by a single time series bradley and kantz 2015 ali shah et al 2019 shu et al 2021a b c yan et al 2021 frequently the variable being analysed the rainfall in this case will trace a path over the phase space this path is referred to as the phase trajectory the phase trajectories in the phase space diagram are indicative of how the system evolves from its initial conditions the region of attraction i e the area in the phase space where these trajectories frequently overlap can provide useful qualitative information of the nature of the system dynamics such as the degree of complexity or variability sivakumar et al 2007 from a practical point of view the most common method for reconstructing the phase space of a single variable time series e g the rainfall over time at a particular location x1 x2 x3 xn is given by an equation of the type takens 1981 1 y j x j x j τ x j 2 τ x j m 1 τ j 1 2 n m 1 τ where n is the number of points in the time series y j represents an m dimensional phase space and is simply a vector of m dimensions j is an integer which represents the time in the phase space i e j 1 2 n m 1 τ x j represents the state of the system at time j and τ represents the time delay i e the average time over which the phase evolves the memory of the phase space the embedding dimension m is essentially the minimum number of state variables needed to characterize the system for a detailed discussion the reader is referred to dhanya and kumar 2010 fig 3 depicts a collection of phase space reconstruction diagrams at selected stations with an embedding dimension of 2 and a time delay of 3 i e the projection of the time series onto the space x i x i 3 overall fig 4 appears to exhibit similar shapes albeit with some variations what is clear from fig 4 is that there is no well defined pattern in the phase space i e no distinct attractor e g lorenz attractor lorenz 1963 fig 4 also shows that the trajectories are not scattered over the entire the phase space these two findings imply that the rainfall dynamics for these four stations are neither associated with a completely stochastic nor deterministic process but rather exhibit an intermediate level of complexity this further supports the necessity and importance of characterising rainfall variability using nonlinear dynamic analysis previous studies li et al 2010 ma and han 2006 have highlighted that a suitable pair of m and τ is required in order to understand and describe the relevant phase space and any attractors which may be contained therein for example if a too large time delay is selected that this could result in vectors whose components are much less correlated and there would be no or little dynamic correlation evident however if τ is too small the phase space coordinates would not be independent leading to the loss of information about the characteristics of the attractor structure camplani and cannas 2009 dhanya and kumar 2010 equally important is the selection of embedding dimension the proper embedding dimension is of essential importance not only for the phase space reconstruction but also for nonlinear prediction takens 1981 shu et al 2021a there are several different methods for selecting the time delay τ such as the autocorrelation function the mutual information method and the correlation integral method among which the mutual information method has been commonly used strozzi et al 2002 in the current work the mutual information method was adopted for further details please see fraser and swinney 1986 unlike other existing methods the mutual information takes into account the nonlinear correlation which is important for analysing time series with inherent nonlinearity takens 1981 fraser and swinney 1986 proposed using the position of the first local minimum in the mutual information function as an appropriate criterion for choosing the optimal time delay τ as shown in fig 5 a the most popular methods for determining the embedding dimension include the false nearest neighbour fnn method kennel et al 1992 and the grassberger procaccia approach grassberger and procaccia 2004 fnn assumes that two points close to one another in terms of their trajectories should continue to remain close as the dimension increases as the dimension increases there is the possibility to include false neighbours i e points whose trajectories are not close and can be classed as false fig 5b illustrates the results of such an analysis and the arrow in the figure indicates the first percentage of fnn at which it approaches zero it should be noted that given the highly variable nature of rainfall data the optimal time delay and embedding dimension may vary depending on the time series under consideration in this study a time delay of 3 and an embedding dimension of 5 were used for all time series unless otherwise specified 3 2 recurrence analysis the recurrence of a state is a fundamental property of deterministic dynamic systems and implies that if at any time we deviate from that state location on a phase space we will return to it in the future eckmann et al 1987 first extended the concept of recurrence into time series analysis by introducing the recurrence plot rp which can be used to visualize the recurring patterns in system dynamics the rp is a well established nonlinear analysis technique which consists of a two dimensional binary diagram these diagrams illustrate how likely it is that the behaviour observed in an m dimensional phase space is recurrent the benefit of using an rp is that it converts an m dimensional phase space into a 2 dimensional binary space and thus makes any patterns easier to visualise in order to use these a threshold variable ε is defined which represents the level of recurrence which is visualized the greater the value of ε the more likely the system is deterministic mathematically this can be expressed as 2 r ij θ ε i x i x j i j 1 n where r ij is a two dimensional squared matrix with ones and zeros θ x is the heaviside function n is the number of measured states x i and ε i is the user defined threshold distance see eckmann et al 1987 for further details the ones in the two dimensional matrix reflect the reoccurrence of state xi at time j while the zeros indicate that the states at times i and j are different i e the rp reveals the collection of pairs of time at which the states of the dynamic system recur each non zero rij is graphically depicted by a black dot in the position i j in the rp marwan et al 2002 as a consequence these black dots may create various structural patterns in rp which are representative of different system behaviours for example a homogenous distribution of isolated points in an rp indicates a stationary stochastic process e g gaussian or uniform white noise whereas the rps associated with oscillating processes are generally characterized by diagonally orientated periodic recurrent structures e g diagonal lines or checkboard patterns in addition the structural patterns at a more localised scale may also reveal important information about system dynamics a single point indicates that the state of system dynamics does not persist for a long time while the short scale diagonal lines indicate that the trajectory in phase space visits the same place at different times implying the possible presence of deterministic components comprehensive reviews and interpretation of different structural patterns in rp can be found in mocenni et al 2011 and marwan 2003 note that the rp is particularly attractive for diagnosing the dynamics of relatively short or nonstationary time series data however it is worth noting that the rp is a visualization tool which mainly characterizes the system dynamics from a qualitative perspective the interpretation of an rp can be somewhat subjective which depends largely on the experience of the investigator this to some extent has limited its practical application to mitigate this limitation recurrence quantification analysis rqa was developed which serves as a powerful quantitative analysis tool to characterize the underlying dynamics of systems zbilut and webber 1992 zbilut et al 2002 essentially rqa focuses on identifying and diagnosing the recurrence point density and small scale diagonal structures in rp zbilut et al 2002 estimating several different rqa quantities such as the recurrence rate rr the maximal length of diagonal structures l max and the entropy ent the rr is defined as 3 rr 1 n 2 i j 1 n r ij where n is the number of measured states rr is a density measure of the rp which quantifies the fraction of recurrence points with respect to the total number of possible recurrence mocenni et al 2011 typically higher recurrence indicates lower system variability the maximal length of diagonal structures l max is defined as 4 l max max l i i 1 n where l i is the length of the i th diagonal line in the rp the entropy ent also known as the shannon entropy is defined as 5 ent l l min n p l log p l where p l is the frequency distribution of the diagonal line lengths l is the length of the diagonal line structure note that these rqa quantities are closely tied with the diagonal line structures in rps which can therefore be used as a useful measure to describe the complexity of the system dynamics theoretically the larger the rqa quantities the higher the likelihood of the recurrence of states which in consequence is indicative of lower degree of complexity of underlying dynamics in this study rp and rqa are carried out using the matlab toolbox by marwan 2010 it is important to note from eq 2 that the determination of the two dimension recurrence matrix i e the recurrent characteristics of the considered system depends largely on the threshold distance ε several different methods such as 10 of mean space diameter 25 of standard deviation 5 6 of maximal space diameter or a fixed percentage of recurrence points rr have been standardly utilized to estimate the threshold distance in recurrence analysis schlenker et al 2016 socha et al 2016 notably among which the method of a fixed percentage of recurrence points with rr spanning from 1 5 to 15 ding et al 2008 is most commonly used in this study a fixed threshold rr of 10 is adopted throughout the recurrence analysis following the recommendation of marwan 2010 4 results and discussion the existence of chaos in rainfall dynamics is clearly shown in the recurrence plots fig 6 in which the recurrence points are neither distributed homogeneously nor do they form some clear periodic patterns it is apparent that the rp associated with different stations tends to be somewhat diverse to illustrate recurrence points at station 1 are mostly congested within the low rainfall period spanning from march to october which represents higher likelihood of recurrence and thus lower system variability during the corresponding period the distribution of recurrence points within such period are relatively uniform implying a more or less persistent underlying dynamic structure in addition such centre located structures of recurrence points are also indicative of pronounced variation within an annual cycle seasonal variations of rainfall are also observed at station 4 and station 14 albeit not to such a significant extent clusters of recurrence points occur primarily between late march and october meanwhile in comparison with that at station1 the main clusters of recurrence points at station 4 and station 14 are found to be disrupted by vertical horizontal white ribbons which represents transition in the dynamic structure on the other hand the rainfall time series recorded at station 12 exhibits little seasonal variation which can also be seen in the associated rp as the distribution of recurrence points is more scattered with no clear shift in the pattern however a marked vertical horizontal white ribbon can be found between july to september which indicates higher system variability in the rainfall in addition to the visualization of rainfall dynamics using recurrence plots recurrence quantification analysis rqa is also carried out to characterize the rainfall dynamics by quantifying the structural patterns in rps as illustrated in fig 7 it is shown that the estimated rqa quantities at nearby stations are overall similar in magnitude which to some extent reflects the reliability of rqa for rainfall data the distribution of lmax and ent are more or less consistent with larger values occurring more frequently in regions of northern and western scotland and the western and southern coast of england the eastern coast of uk including eastern scotland north east and eastern england and midlands generally have lower rqa values this implies that the rainfall dynamics in the regions of western and southern coasts of england and scotland are less complex than their counterparts on the eastern coast and inland region of uk this is largely because these regions tend to be dominated by relatively large scale climate process north atlantic depressions which travel across the atlantic on average every three four days in contrast the rainfall on the eastern coast and inland region of the uk is more likely to be affected by localised and short lived convection events e g land sea thermal contrast which appear to be more stochastic in addition although the eastern coast sites and inland regions may also be influenced by the north atlantic depression especially during autumn and winter months the sheltering effect resulting from pronounced orographic effects in the prevailing westerly or south westerly directions may also lead to higher degrees of complexity in the rainfall dynamics for example much of the west midlands is well located within the rain shadow of the welsh mountains which tends to complicate the characteristics of rainfall it is noteworthy that the uk rainfall is closely tied with the north atlantic oscillation nao which is subjected to marked inter annual variability fowler and kilsby 2002 as a consequence the annual rainfall total at each of the observation stations is subject to considerable year to year variability as illustrated in fig 8 a study by jenkins et al 2008 found that the overall annual rainfall over much of england and wales has not changed significantly on a long term basis similar results are also observed in this study see fig 8 in which the annual rainfall total i e solid blue lines measured at stations located in england and wales remains relatively stable in contrast the annual rainfall total at more northerly stations particularly those in the western and northern scotland tends to exhibit a pronounced increasing trend which has also been reported by afzal et al 2015 and werritty and sugden 2012 such an increase in total rainfall at these stations is associated primarily with the change in the north atlantic oscillation massei et al 2010 and hurrell and van loon 1997 reported that the occurrence frequency as well as the amplitude of positive nao phases have been shown to increase particularly during autumn and winter months such weather patterns tend to result in more frequent heavy rainfall events particularly over scotland conway et al 1996 likewise werritty and sugden 2012 and west et al 2019 highlighted that the strong increase in rainfall in western and northern scotland coincided well with the period during which the nao index was strongly positive which brings frequent rain bearing storms from the atlantic similarly the most significant variation in ent can be observed in these scottish stations which generally demonstrates a steady downward trend the variation in ent can also be found in other regions across the uk but not to such a significant extent the declining ent is a reflection of more complex dynamics in rainfall data which could possibly lead to more irregular behaviour of rainfall similar patterns have also been observed in other northern european regions jenkins et al 2008 apart from the year to year variability the seasonal dependence of rainfall within an annual cycle is also of great importance to illustrate the availability of accurate seasonal rainfall information has benefits for assessing agricultural and hydrological impacts understandably an increase in mean rainfall during the growing season is likely to increase the agricultural yield but an extreme rainfall may damage crops especially in the juvenile stage moreover grain crops tend to be highly vulnerable to flooding and the intensity and duration of rainfall could influence the persistence and efficiency of pesticides rosenzweig et al 2001 for the uk in particular understanding and forecasting of seasonal rainfall variability is of considerable necessity given that lodging i e crops stem breakage or uprooting which is frequently experienced in the uk mohammadi et al 2020b joseph et al 2020 is closely tied with the interaction of strong wind and heavy rain berry et al 2004 baker et al 2014 as shown in fig 9 in the regions of south west england wales northern ireland western and northern scotland the seasonal rainfall pattern typically reveals a maximum during the period of late autumn and winter and a minimum during summer which is a consequence of a high frequency of winter atlantic depressions and the relatively low frequency of summer convective thunderstorms in contrast the monthly rainfall at eastern and inland stations appears to be more uniformly distributed this possibly indicates that summer rainfall produced by convective events are contributing as much as the autumn winter atlantic depression the consequent distribution of seasonal rainfall is depicted in fig 10 the geographic variability of spring and summer rainfall is more or less similar which is notably dry across most of the regions in the uk the network average of seasonal rainfall total is 144 mm in spring and 150 mm in summer the seasonal rainfall is likely to increase substantially during autumn and winter resulting in a network average of respectively 196 mm and 208 mm in which much of the increase occur at south west england north west england and western and northern scotland the increase of rainfall in these regions is a reflection of more the vigorous atlantic depression activities in comparison with the distribution of seasonal rainfall total the seasonal variability of the estimated rqa quantity i e ent appears to be much less well defined as can be seen from fig 11 in spring lower values of ent occur mostly at eastern and northern scotland as well as western coast of wales whereas larger ent values can be observed near the central lowlands in the southern scotland and parts of midlands and north east england the summer ent is relatively small across most of the uk and clearly regionalized since much of the lower values lie in the scotland and northern ireland this implies that the summer rainfall dynamics in these regions are more complex than those in other regions of the uk which could result in higher variability and more irregular behavior in rainfall data in autumn larger ent values can be found in the south west england and midlands whereas southern england north west england and northern scotland generally possess relative lower values in contrast the largest winter ent is observed in the southern scotland and lowest values are found in the northern scotland and midlands it is anticipated that the distribution of seasonal ent is a combination of seasonal variability of northern atlantic depression and localized convection as well as distinct topographic effect 5 summary and conclusions reliable rainfall modelling and forecasting is important in a wide range of science and engineering practices which depends largely on proper understanding of the inherent variability in rainfall data the present study investigated the rainfall dynamics across the uk based on the concepts from chaos theory and nonlinear dynamic analysis the main goal of this study is to examine if a number of techniques developed for the study of chaotic systems can be adapted to the analysis of rainfall and thus provide additional insights into the modelling of rainfall dynamics in the uk hence three novel methods in hydrology namely phase space reconstruction recurrence plot and recurrence quantification analysis were applied to daily rainfall data recorded at 32 observation stations during a 30 yr period from 1989 to 2018 the major conclusions from this study can be summarized as follows the existence of chaos in uk rainfall data can be clearly identified however the extent of complexity in rainfall dynamics is subjected to apparent geographic variability in general rainfall dynamics associated with stations on the eastern coast and in central england tend to be more complex than those at other regions rainfall dynamics at northerly stations especially those in western and northern scotland are found to reveal marked long term variability reflected by a significant downward trend in the annual rqa quantity this implies that the rainfall dynamics at these stations tend to become increasing complex in contrast long term variability in rainfall dynamics is also observed in other regions but not to such a significant extent similar to the rainfall total evident seasonal variability is also depicted with respect to rainfall dynamics in which different seasonal pattern of the rqa quantity is revealed it should be mentioned that this study is focused on identifying the rainfall variability from a nonlinear dynamic analysis point of view and comparing the level of complexity of rainfall dynamics across different regions in the uk rather than providing a distinction between chaotic and stochastic behaviour and estimating the exact dimension of rainfall dynamics towards identifying the appropriate type of rainfall model it is shown that the analysis techniques applied in the current study are capable of providing a different approach in order to interpret the data it should be highlighted that to our knowledge this is the first application of chaos theory and nonlinear dynamic analysis of the rainfall data across the uk which provides a comprehensive assessment of the rainfall dynamics by means of quantifying the degree of complexity in rainfall time series in the context of chaos theory and nonlinear dynamic analysis the results in this study are expected to be useful in terms of facilitating not only the identification and establishment of appropriate rainfall prediction modelling but also the determination of proper means to couple and integrate the concept of nonlinear dynamic analysis with other available methods e g ann and linear stochastic models for example the quantification of nonlinear rainfall dynamics can be well integrated into existing rainfall models with a view to enhancing its overall accuracy and reliability in addition the identification of geographic long term and seasonal variability in rainfall dynamics could also provide additional insights into the customization and modification of rainfall models at different regions in conclusion for future analysis it is highly recommended that a study of a more extensive network of rainfall observation stations be undertaken with a view to providing a better mapping of rainfall variability across the uk in a more detailed manner in addition the inclusion of rainfall data recorded at a higher resolution than that used herein would be

4080,proper understanding of rainfall variability is of essential importance for meteorological and hydrological modelling this study examines whether a variety of nonlinear dynamic concepts can yield additional insights in the rainfall variability in the uk daily rainfall data recorded over a 30 yr period 1989 2018 from 32 meteorological stations across the uk are analysed using recurrence plots recurrence quantification analysis techniques and phase space reconstructions the results of this analysis underscore the complex processes and variability that are associated with the uk s rainfall data the existence of chaos in uk rainfall data was identified and the extent of complexity in rainfall dynamics exhibited apparent geographic variability in general rainfall dynamics associated with stations on the eastern coast and in central england tend to be more complex than those at other regions rainfall dynamics in western and northern scotland were found to reveal marked long term variability moreover likewise to the rainfall total seasonal variability in rainfall dynamics was also evident keywords rainfall variability chaos theory nonlinear dynamics phase space reconstruction

local climate adaption planning and policy making etc brand et al 1984 wu et al 2010 gil alana 2012 jones et al 2013 nayak et al 2013 unnikrishnan and jothiprakash 2015 mohammadi et al 2020a mohammadi et al 2020b rainfall characteristics in the uk have long been a major focus of concern and have been extensively investigated in several previous studies faulkner and prudhomme 1998 osborn et al 2000 alexander and jones 2000 osborn et al 2000 fowler and kilsby 2003 maraun et al 2008 2009 jenkins et al 2008 blenkinsop et al 2017 it was shown that the uk rainfall data is subjected to distinct geographic variability in which the mountainous areas of wales northern and western scotland as well as south west and north west england are typically the wettest regions across the country whereas the south east coast and further inland regions of england tend to be comparatively drier in addition to the inhomogeneous spatial distribution the temporal variability of rainfall and its characteristics within an annual cycle are also apparent in general heavy rainfall events occur mostly during autumn and winter months blenkinsop et al 2017 reported that different spatial distribution patterns of rainfall may be observed in the uk due to the changes in seasonality which is fundamentally associated with the rainfall generating mechanism at different temporal scales at different times throughout the year in particular a west east pattern of decreasing rainfall can often be identified from autumn to spring which coincides well with the dominant pattern of the north atlantic depression track osborn et al 2000 osborn et al 2000 in contrast the distribution of summer rainfall is characterized by a somewhat less well defined northeast southwest pattern with heavy rainfall extending across central and southern england this is mainly because summer rainfall is less likely to be associated with mesoscale depression systems but instead depends on convection at more localised scales blenkinsop et al 2017 there is strong evidence showing that heavy rainfall events have occurred more frequently over the past few decades in the uk thompson et al 2017 for example the uk encountered an exceptional series of storms in the winter of 2013 14 which resulted in a substantial increase in the rainfall in january 2014 with a monthly total 30 higher than any previous january for over a century matthews et al 2014 kendon and mccarthy 2015 schaller et al 2016 such events caused 18 700 insurance claims associated with flooding across the uk costing an estimated 451 m thompson et al 2017 furthermore thompson et al 2017 highlighted that december 2015 was the wettest on record since 1910 in northern england and october 2000 was likewise the wettest on the record since 1903 across england subsequently statistics have shown that february 2020 was the wettest february on record for england wales and northern ireland and the second wettest for scotland met office 2020a inevitably the more frequent occurrence of these extreme rainfall events may pose multi dimensional hazards to critical infrastructures and the most vulnerable sectors of society jones et al 2014 the uk climate change risk assessment defra 2012 has reported that the estimated domestic and commercial insurance claims associated with flood related damage may be tripled by the 2050s on this account it is of paramount importance to diagnose and characterize the rainfall behaviour across the uk with a view to establishing appropriate risk management strategies and facilitate climate adaption decision making unfortunately precise modelling and quantification of rainfall data is not an easy task due to its highly variable nature rainfall is usually highly intermittent emmanuel et al 2012 and as such exhibits variability over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales sivakumar et al 1999 sivakumar 2000 sivakumar 2001 roux et al 2009 nayak et al 2013 ramana et al 2013 this makes rainfall one of the most difficult components of the hydrological cycle to forecast french et al 1992 toth et al 2000 gil alana 2012 furthermore the difficulty is enhanced due to the limitation in the availability of appropriate mathematical tools to investigate the structure underlying the rainfall processes sivakumar 2000 panagoulia and vlahogianni 2014 emphasized that the most critical issue in modelling the complex time dependent behaviour of rainfall is the treatment of non linearity and the temporal persistence either being long or short in the rainfall time series traditional rainfall time series analysis techniques e g the coefficient of variation of interannual rainfall variability and auto regressive integrated moving average arima analysis salas et al 1980 delsole and shukla 2002 li and zeng 2008 nayagam et al 2008 generally incorporate several constraints in terms of linearity and independence while the rainfall time series in real world situation are mostly nonlinear coles et al 2003 once noted that most classical methods for rainfall modelling do not take into account the uncertainties in the temporal evolution of rainfall time series which are therefore bounded to produce an over optimistic appraisal of anticipated rainfall extreme that is contradicted by real measured data frequently the process connecting rainfall is considered as a stochastic process however there has been growing interest in nonlinear dynamics and also chaos theory in which rainfall is considered as a chaotic system that is sensitive to initial conditions and is predictable on short term basis dhanya and kumar 2010 jothiprakash and fathima 2013 panagoulia and vlahogianni 2014 pointed out that nonlinear dynamic methods are preferred due to its flexibility in modelling complex and temporally oscillating behaviour of rainfall as well as modelling the uncertainty in the temporal evolution of rainfall sivakumar et al 1999 addressed that the most distinct difference between a stochastic system and a chaotic system is the number of variables needed to characterize the system if a system is chaotic in nature i e dominated by a low dimension attractor the system dynamics can be described by only a few modes and hence a small system of ordinary differential equations by contrast if the behavior of a system is dominated by a very large number of excited modes it is in general better described by stochastic models it is also noted that the framework of deterministic chaos appears to exhibit greater potential than the stochastic methods in terms of constructing the connection between the structure of the model and the underlying physics of rainfall process koutsoyiannis and pachakis 1996 sivakumar et al 2001 chaos theory has been used in many branches of science to take into account the random behaviour that can arise due to the inherent nonlinearity present in the system lorenz 1963 ghil et al 1991 the existence of chaotic behaviour in hydrological data especially rainfall has been documented and discussed in numerous previous studies for example the correlation dimension d the dynamic attractor of rainfall systems has been determined in several studies as a quantitative representation of the number of variables controlling the underlying dynamics rodríguez iturbe 1991 berndtsson et al 1994 jayawardena and lai 1994 puente and obregón 1996 sivakumar 2001 sivakumar et al 1999 sivakumar et al 2006 sivakumar et al 2014 kyoung et al 2011 chaos theory and nonlinear dynamic analysis have shown their ability to provide more satisfactory modelling and prediction of hydrological data than other existing methods coulibaly and baldwin 2005 laio et al 2003 compared the performance of nonlinear dynamic analysis and artificial neural networks ann in forecasting hydrological time series in which nonlinear dynamic analysis tends to exhibit slightly better performance in short term forecasting whereas ann shows better performance for long term forecasts lisi and villi 2001 reported that the nonlinear dynamic analysis by means of nearest neighbour prediction could yield more satisfactory prediction results than the classic linear arima models particularly for relatively short forecast times jayawardena and gurung 2000 highlighted that the nonlinear phase space method appeared to outperform the linear stochastic arima model with regard to synthetic and hydro meteorological time series modelling reflected by a higher correlation between the observed and predicted values sivakumar et al 2002 focused on 1 day and 7 day lead time series forecasts of river flow using both phase space reconstruction psr and ann the results showed that nonlinear dynamic analysis by psr generally provides better performance than ann the psr analysis not only captures the major trends well but also preserves the minor fluctuations in river flow series such difference is mainly attributed to the fact that the local approximation method involved in nonlinear dynamic analysis represents the system dynamics in the phase space step by step in local neighbourhoods which could capture the most important features of system dynamics in a more satisfactory manner than the global approximation method used in ann sivakumar et al 2002 this is particularly important when the time series under consideration exhibits low dimension chaotic behaviour such as rainfall in order to facilitate rainfall modelling and prediction several different nonlinear methods have been applied in previous studies to elucidate the rainfall variability by investigating the hidden structures in the underlying dynamics these have focused on the correlation dimension method e g sivakumar et al 2006 sivakumar et al 2014 the lyapunov exponent method e g rodríguez iturbe 1991 jayawardena and lai 1994 dhanya and kumar 2010 and phase space reconstruction e g waelbroeck et al 1994 ouyang et al 2016 in this study the rainfall dynamics are investigated by alternative means which to our knowledge have never previously been applied to rainfall in order to determine their capability of providing useful information on the rainfall variability from a qualitative point of view it has been underlined that investigating the nonlinear and chaotic aspects of rainfall offers additional insights into rainfall dynamics which could help improve water resources planning and management sivakumar et al 2014 moreover previous studies on rainfall dynamics are often limited to one or a few stations at the most however for water resources planning and management at national levels knowledge of rainfall dynamics over a much greater spatial extent are strongly required sharifi et al 1990 also highlighted that understanding the nonlinear dynamics has an important implication for reliable long term prediction of rainfall behaviour given the above overview it is evident that accurate rainfall modelling and prediction are subjected to a number of uncertainties while most traditional methods are incapable of effectively resolving the nonlinearity in rainfall processes it is reported e g jayawardena and lai 1994 sivakumar et al 2006 sivakumar et al 2014 that nonlinear dynamic analysis offers a new avenue to diagnose the underlying structure in rainfall process which has important implications in understanding rainfall behaviour and thus help improve rainfall modelling and prediction on this account the motivation of this paper is to determine whether techniques developed for the study of chaotic systems can be adapted to the analysis of rainfall and thus provide additional insights into the modelling of rainfall dynamics in the uk underpinning this aim are essentially three objectives the application of phase space reconstruction psr to uk rainfall data the application of recurrence plot rp to uk rainfall data the application of recurrence quantification analysis rqa to uk rainfall data to aid in the evaluation of these objectives the paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the information related to measurement site and data collection section 3 provides interpretation on the methodologies employed in this study section 4 presents the results and relevant discussion from nonlinear dynamic analysis and section 5 summarizes the major conclusions 2 data collection and site description the dataset involved in this study consists of daily rainfall data recorded over a 30 yr period spanning from 1989 to 2018 at 32 rain gauge stations see fig 1 these stations are scattered across the uk to cover a reasonably large spatial extent the rainfall data are extracted from the uk met office integrated data archive system midas archived in the british atmospheric data centre the completeness of data over the considered measurement period at each station has been examined which allows comprehensive and representative mapping of the uk rainfall characteristics rigorous quality control has been applied to the midas data by ukmo such that data errors are identified and marked before being transmitted basic quality control measures such as data range and self consistency checks are implemented with a view to ensure that meteorological values lie within the long term climatological extremes blenkinsop et al 2017 in particular the midas data contain a built in quality flag with ones and zeros which allows easy identification and exclusion of suspicious and erroneous data essentially a value of one implies the data have passed the quality checks while a value of zero is indicative of possible errors accordingly a non zero quality flag criterion is adopted in this study to ensure the fidelity of the considered data fig 2 demonstrates the typical annual time series of daily rainfall recorded at selected stations across the observation network the rainfall in the uk is largely associated with the atlantic depression or with convection hence differences in terms of the proximity to the track of the atlantic depression may lead to notable variability in spatial distribution of rainfall in addition the orographic effect i e the existence of upland and mountainous terrain may further complicate the geographic pattern of uk rainfall as shown in fig 3 the rainfall characteristics are subject to site to site variability the network average total annual rainfall is approximately 1051 mm with the largest value of 2534 mm obtained at station 25 and the lowest value of 578 mm obtained at station 12 in terms of regional rainfall totals western scotland is found to be wettest with an estimated mean annual total of more than 167 of the network average followed by north west england 136 5 south west england 131 6 and wales 111 4 the considerable rainfall recorded in these regions is primarily attributed to the combination of close exposure to the westerly or south westerly maritime air masses and the extensive area of high ground met office 2020b in contrast the midlands eastern england and southern england are comparatively much drier with an annual total generally less than 67 of the network average this is mainly because much of the midlands is sheltered from the rain bearing westerly winds due to the welsh mountains while eastern england and southern england are relatively distant from the route of major atlantic depressions on the other hand the distribution of the number of rainy days per year across the observation network is more or less similar to that of the annual total the network average of the number of rainy days per year defined as a day with rainfall greater than 0 1 mm is estimated to be 214 30 with the largest value of 275 at station 32 and the lowest value of 147 42 at station 6 overall the rainfall characteristics given here are consistent with those documented in the existing literature and represent a fairly typical pattern in the uk 3 nonlinear analysis of rainfall data 3 1 phase space reconstruction dynamic analysis of a nonlinear system often consists of reconstructing the phase space a graphical representation of the variables needed to describe the state of the system at any moment in which the entire system dynamics can be represented by a single time series bradley and kantz 2015 ali shah et al 2019 shu et al 2021a b c yan et al 2021 frequently the variable being analysed the rainfall in this case will trace a path over the phase space this path is referred to as the phase trajectory the phase trajectories in the phase space diagram are indicative of how the system evolves from its initial conditions the region of attraction i e the area in the phase space where these trajectories frequently overlap can provide useful qualitative information of the nature of the system dynamics such as the degree of complexity or variability sivakumar et al 2007 from a practical point of view the most common method for reconstructing the phase space of a single variable time series e g the rainfall over time at a particular location x1 x2 x3 xn is given by an equation of the type takens 1981 1 y j x j x j τ x j 2 τ x j m 1 τ j 1 2 n m 1 τ where n is the number of points in the time series y j represents an m dimensional phase space and is simply a vector of m dimensions j is an integer which represents the time in the phase space i e j 1 2 n m 1 τ x j represents the state of the system at time j and τ represents the time delay i e the average time over which the phase evolves the memory of the phase space the embedding dimension m is essentially the minimum number of state variables needed to characterize the system for a detailed discussion the reader is referred to dhanya and kumar 2010 fig 3 depicts a collection of phase space reconstruction diagrams at selected stations with an embedding dimension of 2 and a time delay of 3 i e the projection of the time series onto the space x i x i 3 overall fig 4 appears to exhibit similar shapes albeit with some variations what is clear from fig 4 is that there is no well defined pattern in the phase space i e no distinct attractor e g lorenz attractor lorenz 1963 fig 4 also shows that the trajectories are not scattered over the entire the phase space these two findings imply that the rainfall dynamics for these four stations are neither associated with a completely stochastic nor deterministic process but rather exhibit an intermediate level of complexity this further supports the necessity and importance of characterising rainfall variability using nonlinear dynamic analysis previous studies li et al 2010 ma and han 2006 have highlighted that a suitable pair of m and τ is required in order to understand and describe the relevant phase space and any attractors which may be contained therein for example if a too large time delay is selected that this could result in vectors whose components are much less correlated and there would be no or little dynamic correlation evident however if τ is too small the phase space coordinates would not be independent leading to the loss of information about the characteristics of the attractor structure camplani and cannas 2009 dhanya and kumar 2010 equally important is the selection of embedding dimension the proper embedding dimension is of essential importance not only for the phase space reconstruction but also for nonlinear prediction takens 1981 shu et al 2021a there are several different methods for selecting the time delay τ such as the autocorrelation function the mutual information method and the correlation integral method among which the mutual information method has been commonly used strozzi et al 2002 in the current work the mutual information method was adopted for further details please see fraser and swinney 1986 unlike other existing methods the mutual information takes into account the nonlinear correlation which is important for analysing time series with inherent nonlinearity takens 1981 fraser and swinney 1986 proposed using the position of the first local minimum in the mutual information function as an appropriate criterion for choosing the optimal time delay τ as shown in fig 5 a the most popular methods for determining the embedding dimension include the false nearest neighbour fnn method kennel et al 1992 and the grassberger procaccia approach grassberger and procaccia 2004 fnn assumes that two points close to one another in terms of their trajectories should continue to remain close as the dimension increases as the dimension increases there is the possibility to include false neighbours i e points whose trajectories are not close and can be classed as false fig 5b illustrates the results of such an analysis and the arrow in the figure indicates the first percentage of fnn at which it approaches zero it should be noted that given the highly variable nature of rainfall data the optimal time delay and embedding dimension may vary depending on the time series under consideration in this study a time delay of 3 and an embedding dimension of 5 were used for all time series unless otherwise specified 3 2 recurrence analysis the recurrence of a state is a fundamental property of deterministic dynamic systems and implies that if at any time we deviate from that state location on a phase space we will return to it in the future eckmann et al 1987 first extended the concept of recurrence into time series analysis by introducing the recurrence plot rp which can be used to visualize the recurring patterns in system dynamics the rp is a well established nonlinear analysis technique which consists of a two dimensional binary diagram these diagrams illustrate how likely it is that the behaviour observed in an m dimensional phase space is recurrent the benefit of using an rp is that it converts an m dimensional phase space into a 2 dimensional binary space and thus makes any patterns easier to visualise in order to use these a threshold variable ε is defined which represents the level of recurrence which is visualized the greater the value of ε the more likely the system is deterministic mathematically this can be expressed as 2 r ij θ ε i x i x j i j 1 n where r ij is a two dimensional squared matrix with ones and zeros θ x is the heaviside function n is the number of measured states x i and ε i is the user defined threshold distance see eckmann et al 1987 for further details the ones in the two dimensional matrix reflect the reoccurrence of state xi at time j while the zeros indicate that the states at times i and j are different i e the rp reveals the collection of pairs of time at which the states of the dynamic system recur each non zero rij is graphically depicted by a black dot in the position i j in the rp marwan et al 2002 as a consequence these black dots may create various structural patterns in rp which are representative of different system behaviours for example a homogenous distribution of isolated points in an rp indicates a stationary stochastic process e g gaussian or uniform white noise whereas the rps associated with oscillating processes are generally characterized by diagonally orientated periodic recurrent structures e g diagonal lines or checkboard patterns in addition the structural patterns at a more localised scale may also reveal important information about system dynamics a single point indicates that the state of system dynamics does not persist for a long time while the short scale diagonal lines indicate that the trajectory in phase space visits the same place at different times implying the possible presence of deterministic components comprehensive reviews and interpretation of different structural patterns in rp can be found in mocenni et al 2011 and marwan 2003 note that the rp is particularly attractive for diagnosing the dynamics of relatively short or nonstationary time series data however it is worth noting that the rp is a visualization tool which mainly characterizes the system dynamics from a qualitative perspective the interpretation of an rp can be somewhat subjective which depends largely on the experience of the investigator this to some extent has limited its practical application to mitigate this limitation recurrence quantification analysis rqa was developed which serves as a powerful quantitative analysis tool to characterize the underlying dynamics of systems zbilut and webber 1992 zbilut et al 2002 essentially rqa focuses on identifying and diagnosing the recurrence point density and small scale diagonal structures in rp zbilut et al 2002 estimating several different rqa quantities such as the recurrence rate rr the maximal length of diagonal structures l max and the entropy ent the rr is defined as 3 rr 1 n 2 i j 1 n r ij where n is the number of measured states rr is a density measure of the rp which quantifies the fraction of recurrence points with respect to the total number of possible recurrence mocenni et al 2011 typically higher recurrence indicates lower system variability the maximal length of diagonal structures l max is defined as 4 l max max l i i 1 n where l i is the length of the i th diagonal line in the rp the entropy ent also known as the shannon entropy is defined as 5 ent l l min n p l log p l where p l is the frequency distribution of the diagonal line lengths l is the length of the diagonal line structure note that these rqa quantities are closely tied with the diagonal line structures in rps which can therefore be used as a useful measure to describe the complexity of the system dynamics theoretically the larger the rqa quantities the higher the likelihood of the recurrence of states which in consequence is indicative of lower degree of complexity of underlying dynamics in this study rp and rqa are carried out using the matlab toolbox by marwan 2010 it is important to note from eq 2 that the determination of the two dimension recurrence matrix i e the recurrent characteristics of the considered system depends largely on the threshold distance ε several different methods such as 10 of mean space diameter 25 of standard deviation 5 6 of maximal space diameter or a fixed percentage of recurrence points rr have been standardly utilized to estimate the threshold distance in recurrence analysis schlenker et al 2016 socha et al 2016 notably among which the method of a fixed percentage of recurrence points with rr spanning from 1 5 to 15 ding et al 2008 is most commonly used in this study a fixed threshold rr of 10 is adopted throughout the recurrence analysis following the recommendation of marwan 2010 4 results and discussion the existence of chaos in rainfall dynamics is clearly shown in the recurrence plots fig 6 in which the recurrence points are neither distributed homogeneously nor do they form some clear periodic patterns it is apparent that the rp associated with different stations tends to be somewhat diverse to illustrate recurrence points at station 1 are mostly congested within the low rainfall period spanning from march to october which represents higher likelihood of recurrence and thus lower system variability during the corresponding period the distribution of recurrence points within such period are relatively uniform implying a more or less persistent underlying dynamic structure in addition such centre located structures of recurrence points are also indicative of pronounced variation within an annual cycle seasonal variations of rainfall are also observed at station 4 and station 14 albeit not to such a significant extent clusters of recurrence points occur primarily between late march and october meanwhile in comparison with that at station1 the main clusters of recurrence points at station 4 and station 14 are found to be disrupted by vertical horizontal white ribbons which represents transition in the dynamic structure on the other hand the rainfall time series recorded at station 12 exhibits little seasonal variation which can also be seen in the associated rp as the distribution of recurrence points is more scattered with no clear shift in the pattern however a marked vertical horizontal white ribbon can be found between july to september which indicates higher system variability in the rainfall in addition to the visualization of rainfall dynamics using recurrence plots recurrence quantification analysis rqa is also carried out to characterize the rainfall dynamics by quantifying the structural patterns in rps as illustrated in fig 7 it is shown that the estimated rqa quantities at nearby stations are overall similar in magnitude which to some extent reflects the reliability of rqa for rainfall data the distribution of lmax and ent are more or less consistent with larger values occurring more frequently in regions of northern and western scotland and the western and southern coast of england the eastern coast of uk including eastern scotland north east and eastern england and midlands generally have lower rqa values this implies that the rainfall dynamics in the regions of western and southern coasts of england and scotland are less complex than their counterparts on the eastern coast and inland region of uk this is largely because these regions tend to be dominated by relatively large scale climate process north atlantic depressions which travel across the atlantic on average every three four days in contrast the rainfall on the eastern coast and inland region of the uk is more likely to be affected by localised and short lived convection events e g land sea thermal contrast which appear to be more stochastic in addition although the eastern coast sites and inland regions may also be influenced by the north atlantic depression especially during autumn and winter months the sheltering effect resulting from pronounced orographic effects in the prevailing westerly or south westerly directions may also lead to higher degrees of complexity in the rainfall dynamics for example much of the west midlands is well located within the rain shadow of the welsh mountains which tends to complicate the characteristics of rainfall it is noteworthy that the uk rainfall is closely tied with the north atlantic oscillation nao which is subjected to marked inter annual variability fowler and kilsby 2002 as a consequence the annual rainfall total at each of the observation stations is subject to considerable year to year variability as illustrated in fig 8 a study by jenkins et al 2008 found that the overall annual rainfall over much of england and wales has not changed significantly on a long term basis similar results are also observed in this study see fig 8 in which the annual rainfall total i e solid blue lines measured at stations located in england and wales remains relatively stable in contrast the annual rainfall total at more northerly stations particularly those in the western and northern scotland tends to exhibit a pronounced increasing trend which has also been reported by afzal et al 2015 and werritty and sugden 2012 such an increase in total rainfall at these stations is associated primarily with the change in the north atlantic oscillation massei et al 2010 and hurrell and van loon 1997 reported that the occurrence frequency as well as the amplitude of positive nao phases have been shown to increase particularly during autumn and winter months such weather patterns tend to result in more frequent heavy rainfall events particularly over scotland conway et al 1996 likewise werritty and sugden 2012 and west et al 2019 highlighted that the strong increase in rainfall in western and northern scotland coincided well with the period during which the nao index was strongly positive which brings frequent rain bearing storms from the atlantic similarly the most significant variation in ent can be observed in these scottish stations which generally demonstrates a steady downward trend the variation in ent can also be found in other regions across the uk but not to such a significant extent the declining ent is a reflection of more complex dynamics in rainfall data which could possibly lead to more irregular behaviour of rainfall similar patterns have also been observed in other northern european regions jenkins et al 2008 apart from the year to year variability the seasonal dependence of rainfall within an annual cycle is also of great importance to illustrate the availability of accurate seasonal rainfall information has benefits for assessing agricultural and hydrological impacts understandably an increase in mean rainfall during the growing season is likely to increase the agricultural yield but an extreme rainfall may damage crops especially in the juvenile stage moreover grain crops tend to be highly vulnerable to flooding and the intensity and duration of rainfall could influence the persistence and efficiency of pesticides rosenzweig et al 2001 for the uk in particular understanding and forecasting of seasonal rainfall variability is of considerable necessity given that lodging i e crops stem breakage or uprooting which is frequently experienced in the uk mohammadi et al 2020b joseph et al 2020 is closely tied with the interaction of strong wind and heavy rain berry et al 2004 baker et al 2014 as shown in fig 9 in the regions of south west england wales northern ireland western and northern scotland the seasonal rainfall pattern typically reveals a maximum during the period of late autumn and winter and a minimum during summer which is a consequence of a high frequency of winter atlantic depressions and the relatively low frequency of summer convective thunderstorms in contrast the monthly rainfall at eastern and inland stations appears to be more uniformly distributed this possibly indicates that summer rainfall produced by convective events are contributing as much as the autumn winter atlantic depression the consequent distribution of seasonal rainfall is depicted in fig 10 the geographic variability of spring and summer rainfall is more or less similar which is notably dry across most of the regions in the uk the network average of seasonal rainfall total is 144 mm in spring and 150 mm in summer the seasonal rainfall is likely to increase substantially during autumn and winter resulting in a network average of respectively 196 mm and 208 mm in which much of the increase occur at south west england north west england and western and northern scotland the increase of rainfall in these regions is a reflection of more the vigorous atlantic depression activities in comparison with the distribution of seasonal rainfall total the seasonal variability of the estimated rqa quantity i e ent appears to be much less well defined as can be seen from fig 11 in spring lower values of ent occur mostly at eastern and northern scotland as well as western coast of wales whereas larger ent values can be observed near the central lowlands in the southern scotland and parts of midlands and north east england the summer ent is relatively small across most of the uk and clearly regionalized since much of the lower values lie in the scotland and northern ireland this implies that the summer rainfall dynamics in these regions are more complex than those in other regions of the uk which could result in higher variability and more irregular behavior in rainfall data in autumn larger ent values can be found in the south west england and midlands whereas southern england north west england and northern scotland generally possess relative lower values in contrast the largest winter ent is observed in the southern scotland and lowest values are found in the northern scotland and midlands it is anticipated that the distribution of seasonal ent is a combination of seasonal variability of northern atlantic depression and localized convection as well as distinct topographic effect 5 summary and conclusions reliable rainfall modelling and forecasting is important in a wide range of science and engineering practices which depends largely on proper understanding of the inherent variability in rainfall data the present study investigated the rainfall dynamics across the uk based on the concepts from chaos theory and nonlinear dynamic analysis the main goal of this study is to examine if a number of techniques developed for the study of chaotic systems can be adapted to the analysis of rainfall and thus provide additional insights into the modelling of rainfall dynamics in the uk hence three novel methods in hydrology namely phase space reconstruction recurrence plot and recurrence quantification analysis were applied to daily rainfall data recorded at 32 observation stations during a 30 yr period from 1989 to 2018 the major conclusions from this study can be summarized as follows the existence of chaos in uk rainfall data can be clearly identified however the extent of complexity in rainfall dynamics is subjected to apparent geographic variability in general rainfall dynamics associated with stations on the eastern coast and in central england tend to be more complex than those at other regions rainfall dynamics at northerly stations especially those in western and northern scotland are found to reveal marked long term variability reflected by a significant downward trend in the annual rqa quantity this implies that the rainfall dynamics at these stations tend to become increasing complex in contrast long term variability in rainfall dynamics is also observed in other regions but not to such a significant extent similar to the rainfall total evident seasonal variability is also depicted with respect to rainfall dynamics in which different seasonal pattern of the rqa quantity is revealed it should be mentioned that this study is focused on identifying the rainfall variability from a nonlinear dynamic analysis point of view and comparing the level of complexity of rainfall dynamics across different regions in the uk rather than providing a distinction between chaotic and stochastic behaviour and estimating the exact dimension of rainfall dynamics towards identifying the appropriate type of rainfall model it is shown that the analysis techniques applied in the current study are capable of providing a different approach in order to interpret the data it should be highlighted that to our knowledge this is the first application of chaos theory and nonlinear dynamic analysis of the rainfall data across the uk which provides a comprehensive assessment of the rainfall dynamics by means of quantifying the degree of complexity in rainfall time series in the context of chaos theory and nonlinear dynamic analysis the results in this study are expected to be useful in terms of facilitating not only the identification and establishment of appropriate rainfall prediction modelling but also the determination of proper means to couple and integrate the concept of nonlinear dynamic analysis with other available methods e g ann and linear stochastic models for example the quantification of nonlinear rainfall dynamics can be well integrated into existing rainfall models with a view to enhancing its overall accuracy and reliability in addition the identification of geographic long term and seasonal variability in rainfall dynamics could also provide additional insights into the customization and modification of rainfall models at different regions in conclusion for future analysis it is highly recommended that a study of a more extensive network of rainfall observation stations be undertaken with a view to providing a better mapping of rainfall variability across the uk in a more detailed manner in addition the inclusion of rainfall data recorded at a higher resolution than that used herein would be useful in order to gain additional information on rainfall variability at different timescales credit authorship contribution statement zhenru shu writing original draft conceptualization methodology

4081,the soil moisture in the surface layer 1 or 2 m interacts with the atmosphere through evapotranspiration and influences land atmosphere interactions impacts rainfall runoff processes regulates net ecosystem exchange and constrains food security thus the accurate measurement with high depth resolution of surface soil moisture is of great significance to hydrology meteorology and agriculture the nuclear magnetic resonance nmr logging technology has the ability to study hydrogen containing fluid dynamics in porous media and is expected to achieve in situ detection for soil moisture in this paper we propose a new design of a small diameter nmr logging probe based on compensating magnets which increases the signal to noise ratio snr and have high depth resolution 1 cm the uniform design

and can also give the proportion of free water and bound water which has been verified with the results of the lab nmr experiments finally the factors that have an important influence on the measurement effect such as the uniformity of the excitation magnetic field the radial depth of investigation and the echo time have been fully discussed keywords soil moisture nmr logging probe compensating magnets uniform design high depth resolution 1 introduction the soil moisture in the surface layer is of great significance to hydrology meteorology and agriculture which influences land atmosphere interactions impacts rainfall runoff processes regulates net ecosystem exchange and constrains food security ochsner et al 2013 all these disciplines are mainly concentrated in the soil root zone which can interact with the atmosphere through evapotranspiration and the thickness of this layer depends upon the type and stage of the soil s plant cover typically about 1 or 2 m schmugge et al 1980 additionally the soil moisture changes dynamically with changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration thus accurate accessment of the soil moisture with high depth resolution plays an essential role in the research of the above disciplines some in situ measurement techniques such as time domain reflectometry robinson et al 2003 ground penetrating radar lunt et al 2005 and direct current resistivity samouëlian et al 2005 have demonstrated their utility however these methods only use the dielectric conductivity or resistivity of the soil to indirectly measure the moisture and are insufficient in accuracy and depth resolution as a powerful method the nuclear magnetic resonance nmr logging technology has the ability to study the dynamics of fluids hydrogen containing in porous media and characterize the hydrological parameters of the reservoir coates et al 1999 at the same time in the field of soil moisture detection nmr technology is evaluated as a promising technical method robinson et al 2008 some studies have proved the effective application of the nmr logging method in soil moisture detection perlo et al 2013 sucre et al 2011 moreover the nmr probe can distinguish the content of free water and bound water in soil shen et al 2019 the modern nmr logging tools originated from the inside out concept proposed by jackson which uses the permanent magnet s magnetic field to establish a resonance region burnettt and jackson 1980 cooper and jackson 1980 jackson et al 1980 inspired by this concept different arrays of permanent magnets were developed and combined with suitable radio frequency rf coils to excite samples and detect signals sun et al 2019 according to the static magnetic field profile the nmr logging probes can be divided into saddle point type and gradient type in general jackson s nmr probe design scheme is a typical saddle point type which consists of two cylindrical magnets that are arranged coaxially and magnetized along the axis in opposite directions hürlimann 2012 the opposing magnetic fields combine to form a toroidal region of relatively homogeneous in the central plane between them the advantage of this scheme is that it has high depth resolution however it has the disadvantage that the resonance region is too small and the signal to noise ratio snr of the observed signal is very low in order to obtain a high snr signal another probe design scheme of gradient type is proposed by strikman et al 1988 this probe consists of a long cylindrical magnet magnetized perpendicular to its axis and form an azimuthally symmetric resonant region of a thin cylindrical shell 1 2 mm although the resonant region is very thin it can increase the volume of it by increasing the length of the magnet so a higher snr signal can be obtained later inspired by the strikman s scheme some complex nmr probe design schemes composed of multiple magnets were proposed allen et al 2000 hürlimann 2012 they are similar to the strikman s scheme that is increase the volume of the resonance region by increasing the length of the resonance region so as to improve the snr however the length of the resonance region is defined as the depth resolution of the nmr probe walsh et al 2013 therefore the drawback of these probes is that their depth resolution is low compared with the probes designed by jackson s scheme a notable problem is that the early nmr logging tools are designed for petroleum exploration and operated under extreme conditions in deep boreholes with high temperatures up to 170 and high pressures up to 138 mpa an example of one such instrument is the halliburton mril xl which is 13 64 m long weighs more than 726 kg and operates in boreholes from 20 to 40 cm the size and cost of these instruments limit their use in shallow groundwater and soil moisture measurements this problem has been paid attention and a variety of small diameter nmr logging tools have been designed to meet such measurement needs perlo et al 2013 sucre et al 2011 walsh et al 2013 however the reduction in the size of the nmr probe further reduces the volume of the resonance region which reduces the snr of the signal equally therefore these small diameter nmr probes are mostly designed based on strikman s scheme or the similar schemes to ensure that a high quality signal can be obtained and their depth resolutions are 50 cm walsh et al 2013 10 cm perlo et al 2013 and 5 cm sucre et al 2011 respectively in this paper we propose a small diameter nmr logging probe which is an optimized design of jackson s scheme it retains the advantage of high depth resolution and the volume of the resonance region is enlarged by the magnetic field of the compensation magnets which improves the snr of the signal the diameter of the new nmr probe is 6 cm and its depth resolution is 1 cm a soil moisture experiment of three group samples is conducted and the results are compared with that of a low field lab nmr analysis instrument which proved the accuracy of its measurement results including the successful detection of the proportion of free water and bound water the detailed design process and verification experiments are demonstrated as follows 2 theory of nmr logging for soil moisture measurement the nmr logging technology uses the physical property of the spin of hydrogen protons which is an intrinsic and fundamental property of an atom ristic et al 2014 these protons have angular momentum and magnetic moments when the magnetic moments are exposed to a static magnetic field b 0 they precess about b 0 at larmor frequency f l which can be calculated as 1 f l γ b 0 2 π where γ 0 2675 1 0 9 s 1 t 1 is the proton gyromagnetic ratio at thermal equilibrium these magnetic moments form a net magnetic moment and the direction of it is consistent with b 0 according to curie s law the net magnetization vector per unit volume can be described as following 2 m 0 n γ 2 h 2 4 k b t b 0 where n is the number of protons per unit volume h is the reduced plank s constant t is the temperature and k b is the boltzmann s constant fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of a typical small diameter nmr logging probe for soil moisture detection at the beginning of the measurement an nmr probe is inserted into a borehole or directly pushed into the soil kendrick et al 2021 walsh et al 2013 then the detection region is established by the magnetic field of the permanent magnets and an rf coil is used to generate the carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence which consists of a 90 and multiple 180 pulses carr and purcell 1954 meiboom and gill 1958 under the control of cpmg pulse sequence the hydrogen protons in the detection region are excited from the thermal equilibrium state to the excited state and the nmr echo signal is produced by precession in the plane perpendicular to the direction of b 0 with relaxation time denoted by t 2 for geologic materials they may contain a distribution of pores with different t 2 thus the recorded nmr signal e t is usually expressed as walsh et al 2013 3 e t e 0 i p 2 i e t t 2 i where e 0 is the initial signal magnitude and is proportional to the number of protons i e soil moisture in the resonance region p 2 i is the proportion of the magnetic field relaxing in the transverse direction with relaxation time t 2 i for nmr logging measurement there is an assumption that the free water resides in large pores whereas the bound water resides in small pores shen et al 2019 because the t 2 value is proportional to pore size thus it is possible to distinguish the content of free water and bound water by partitioning t 2 distribution usually a fixed value t 2 is selected that divides the t 2 distribution into two components one consisting of small pore containing bound water and the other consisting of large pore containing free water coates et al 1999 and the total soil moisture can be obtained by calculating the total area of t 2 distribution fig 2 3 high resolution design of nmr logging probe based on compensating magnets 3 1 briefly review of jackson s scheme in this section we briefly review the nmr probe design based on jackson s scheme the schematic diagram of this scheme is shown in fig 3 two permanent magnets are arranged coaxially with poles opposite each other and an rf coil is coaxial with the magnets and placed on the central plane to generate the excitation field and receive the nmr signals for jackson s scheme the magnetic field produced by the permanent magnets has azimuthal symmetry this means that the magnetic field has the same distribution along any radius in the central plane the field strength starts at zero at the center point rises to a maximum saddle point and then decreases as the distance increases thus a relatively homogeneous magnetic field with azimuthal symmetry in a toroidal region selected as resonant region can be established in the central plane however the height and ring width of this toroidal region is very small and this determines the characteristics of this scheme high depth resolution and low snr another feature of this scheme is that the position of the toroidal region and the magnetic field strength in it can be changed by adjusting the parameters of the magnets and the distance between them fig 4 shows the distribution of magnetic field along radius r at different magnet spacing h 0 normalized to magnet radius r 0 3 2 compensating magnets layout optimization by using uniform design for jackson s scheme it can be seen from fig 4 that changing the magnets parameters and their layout can adjust the position of the saddle point and change its field strength in this section we introduce an optimization design of an nmr probe based on compensating magnets the compensating magnets are added to form a new saddle point distribution which is superimposed with the original magnetic field to expand the scope of the homogeneous region the schematic diagram of the arrangement of the magnets in the new probe is shown in fig 5 the concept of this design is to increase the volume of the resonance region by increasing the ring width of it while the height of it remains unchanged so that the high depth resolution advantage of the original jackson s scheme can be maintained such an nmr logging probe will be more suitable for the measurement of shallow soil moisture with high depth resolution firstly we preset the parameters of the main magnets and determine their layout to build a small diameter nmr logging probe the diameter of the main magnets is 50 mm and the height is 90 mm and the distance between them is 160 mm we choose neodymium iron boron ndfeb as the material of the main magnets because it has a high residual flux density b r 1 15 t meribout 2019 then an rf coil made of copper wire with a diameter of 56 mm and turns of 24 is designed coaxial with the main magnets and placed on the central plane the compensation magnets are also made of ndfeb then we need to determine the optimum parameters of the compensation magnets including the diameter d c the height h c and the distance l c between them to enhance the resonance region and improve the snr as much as possible for this kind of multi parameter optimization problem the simplest solution is to traverse all possible values within a reasonable range of parameters to find the best result however if there are 50 values to be selected for each parameter then there is a total of 503 125 000 value combinations which leads to high computing costs to improve the optimization efficiency we use the method called uniform design proposed by fang et al fang et al 2000 the uniform design ud is a space filling design method which aims to select the designed points that representative and uniformly scattered in the given points for the compensation magnets layout optimization problem all the possible combinations of the related three parameters d c h c and l c are the given points when using ud method as an optimization strategy the analysis of all value combinations can be simplified to the analysis of the selected combinations called as designed points and the optimization efficiency can be greatly improved the specific implementation process of ud method is as follows 1 determine the reasonable value range of all parameters and then set a suitable number of subdivisions of the parameters defined as q which means that each parameter has the number of q values 2 according to the number of parameters to be optimized defined as m and the number of designed points to be selected defined as n choose a suitable ud table which can be easily done by visiting the website http www math hkbu edu hk uniformdesign according to the ud theory the ud table is expressed as u n qm 3 obtain the designed points by using the u n qm table in fact if we regard all the values of the parameters to be optimized as a matrix this ud table records the index coordinates of the designed points 4 use these designed points to calculate the objective function of the problem to be optimized and find the best designed point 5 according to the best designed point in 4 reduce the value range of the parameters and carry out the next round of ud finally a combination of approximate optimal values can be obtained in this paper we set the value range of the 3 parameters m 3 d c h c and l c as 5 50 mm 1 10 mm and 5 95 mm respectively the values of variables q and m are both 10 thus the ud table can be described as u10 103 the u10 103 and corresponding representative value combinations of the parameters designed points are listed in table 1 an example is given to explain how the value of the parameter is determined according to the ud table the first combination under heading 1 2 3 is 6 7 1 which represent that d c should take the 6th value of the 10 equal parts of 5 50 mm which is exactly 30 mm in the same way h c should take the 7th value of the 10 equal parts of 1 10 mm and l c should take the 1st value of the 10 equal parts of 5 95 mm improving the snr is the target of the optimization for simplicity we use simplified snr as the objective function to evaluate the performance of compensation magnets layout perlo et al 2013 which is named as ssnr and shown as 4 s s n r v b 0 2 b 1 s i n α i c r d v where v is the volume of the resonance region i c is the current through the rf coil r is the ac resistance of the rf coil and α is the angle between b 0 and b 1 in the implementation process the region where the magnetic field is not less than 99 of the maximum value is defined as the homogenous region it is noteworthy that considering the actual size of the probe the space 30 mm away from the probe axis is regarded as the effective potential resonance region this is because the space within 30 mm is occupied by the support material of the probe then three rounds of ud optimization have been completed by using the magnet magnetic field calculation method introduced in the appendix a and the objective function of 4 and the normalized ssnr gradually stabilized and reached the maximum fig 6 the optimal parameters d c h c and l c of the compensation magnets correspond to the maximum ssnr in the third round ud are 20 mm 3 1 mm and 45 mm respectively according to these parameters we implemented the probe design as shown in fig 7 the housing material of the probe is unsaturated polyester resin which has a very short t 2 0 04 ms for hydrogen proton nmr hietalahti et al 1997 therefore the nmr signal generated by this material will decay quickly and will not affect the measurement results of pore water in the soil in addition the permanent magnets and the housing material adopt an interference fit to keep the relative position of the magnets unchanged in this way the final magnetic field distribution will be more stable and will not be easily changed due to vibrations and other reasons to evaluate the optimization effect we use the comsol multiphysics finite element simulation software to simulate the magnetic field distribution and used a high precision magnetic field measurement system f w bell 8030 a three dimensional gaussian meter to test the nmr probe fig 8 shows the simulation and measurement results of the magnetic field distribution of the new probe the ring with and the height of the final optimized resonance region are 23 mm and 10 mm respectively since the height of the resonance area is regarded as the depth resolution of the nmr probe therefore we can conclude that the depth resolution of the new probe can reach 10 mm to compare the difference in the resonance region with or without compensating magnets the magnetic field generated by the main magnets and compensating magnets and their combined magnetic field along a radius in the central plane are shown in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that the introduction of the compensating magnets expands the size of the resonance region by approximately 2 1 times besides the magnetic field strength b 0 in the resonance region also increased slightly from 17 mt to 18 mt moreover the optimized resonance area is closer to the rf coil which also improves the transmission efficiency b 1 i c of the coil by simulating the magnetic field of the rf coil this item is approximately 2 2 times as the original in summary the optimized design scheme will increase the snr from three aspects increasing the volume of the resonance region the strength of the magnetic field and the efficiency of the coil theoretically the snr of the data obtained by the new probe is 5 2 times that of the original 4 experimental results to verify the effect of the new probe a soil moisture measurement experiment has been conducted the sample under study is the coarse sand the main component is sio2 with a diameter in the range of 0 2 to 2 mm and the mass water content w c is defined as 5 w c m w m w m s where m w is the mass of water and m s is the mass of sands we make three groups of samples with a different mass water content of 10 15 and 20 respectively for readers who are more concerned with volumetric water content we also convert the above mass water content to volumetric water content which is also the quantity measured by nmr in doing this calculation we used the value 1 6 g cm3 as the density of coarse sand the volumetric water content of these three samples were 15 1 22 0 and 28 6 respectively these samples have been sealed and allowed to stand for 24 h before being measured to achieve equilibrium of the diffusion of water inside then we use the new probe and the nmr spectrometer system developed by our team to measure these samples fig 10 the sample tank is a hollow container with a length of 15 cm a width of 15 cm and a height of 6 cm and the wall thickness is 1 mm in addition there is a 6 cm diameter hole in the middle of the container so that the new probe can pass through it the container is also made of unsaturated polyester resin therefore it will not affect the measurement results it is worth noting that in order to reduce the interference of electromagnetic noise in the space this experiment was completed in a shielded room the cpmg pulse sequence is adopted as the measurement sequence because it can obtain both water content and t 2 distribution in our experiment the duration of the 90 pules is 200 μs the duration of the 180 pules is 400 μs the inter echo spacing is 2 ms the total echo number of one cpmg pulse is 250 and the recovery time is 5 s the lamor frequency is 769 khz the sampling frequency is 10 mhz and the final nmr signal is obtained by 200 times of data average stacks fig 11 a shows the cpmg spin echo measured from the three samples and fig 11b is the fitting curve of them then we use the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique sirt as the inversion algorithm ge et al 2017 and the t 2 distribution spectrum inversed from the fitting curve is shown in fig 11c the measurement snr has been calculated as the ratio between the average magnitude of the first three echoes and the standard deviation of the last ten echoes ross et al 2021 and the snr are 15 5 13 2 and 12 9 for the sample of 28 6 22 0 and 15 1 respectively we also calculated the area enclosed by the long t 2 peak and the short t 2 peak divided by the t 2 50 ms of the inversion result the normalized peak area of long and short t 2 are proportional to the content of free water and bound water and they are shown in fig 12 a it can be seen from fig 12a that the bound water content of the three groups of samples is the same while the free water content is significantly different this means that the space of the small pores has been fully filled and the difference in water content is mainly determined by the free water content in the large pores simultaneously we extract the normalized initial amplitude e 0 from the cpmg spin echo fitting curve and draw them and their fitting curves in fig 12a it can be seen that the normalized initial amplitude and the normalized total peak area are proportional to the moisture content of the sample and the fitting curve of e 0 is an important reference for the calibration of the nmr logging system measurement results to verify the accuracy of the measurement results obtained by the new probe we also use a low field lab nmr analyzer system mini mr produced by suzhou niumag analytical instrument corporation to measure the three samples again for these experiments we still use the cpmg sequence as the measurement sequence the duration of the 90 pules is 20 μs and the duration of the 180 pules is 40 μs and other parameters such as the echo time spacing is also 2 ms the total echo number of one cpmg pulse is also 250 and the recovery time is also 5 s due to the high snr of this lab nmr analyzer the final nmr signal is obtained only by 5 times of data average stacks the corresponding normalized e 0 normalized peak area and their fitting curve are shown in fig 12b comparing fig 12a and b it can be seen that the measurement results of the new probe are basically consistent with the results measured by the lab nmr instrument one small difference is that the proportion of bound water obtained by the nmr probe is a little higher than that of the low field instrument this may be that different t 2 values and or different t 2 spectrum inversion algorithms have been adopted despite this their normalized initial amplitude normalized total peak area and their fitting curve are basically the same thus this is enough to accurately obtain the moisture of the soil and this comparative experiment proves the effectiveness of the new nmr probe further more to exam the heterogeneity of the probe with or without compensation magnets we remove the compensating magnest in the probe and measure the above three samples again the cpmg pulse is still used as the detection sequence it should be noted that the intensity of the magnetic field in the resonance area is reduced and the center position of the resonance area is farther from the rf coil therefore the lamor frequency at this time is 720 khz correspondingly the duration of the 90 pules is 240 μs and the duration of the 180 pules is 480 μs and the other parameters are consistent with the experiment conducted by the new probe with compensating magnets the measurement results are shown in fig 13 it can be seen from the fig 13 that there is no attenuation trend in the cpmg echo data we obtained what s more the amplitude of the echo signal is consistent with the noise floor of the system therefore we can conclude that the introduction of the compensation magnets is significant for improving the data quality 5 discussion although our test experiments in the laboratory have achieved good measurement results there are also some questions worthy of attention and discussion here firstly the core idea of the optimized design of the probe based on the compensation magnets is that increasing the volume of the resonance region by increasing the ring width of it so as to increasing the snr however the expansion of the resonance area in the radial direction should not be excessively increased this is because the rf field is required to have a high uniformity in the resonance region so that the excitation pulse has the same effect on the hydrogen protons in the whole resonance region unless there are some new technologies that can expand the uniformity region of the rf magnetic field it is inevitable that the rf magnetic field will decay with distance therefore subject to the influence of the above factors simply expanding the resonance area in the radial direction may not expand the actual effective detection area it should be noted that the probe we designed can ignore the impact of rf magnetic field uniformity this is because the resonance area of the new probe is not too wide and it is also very close to the rf coil and in the resonance region the rf magnetic field can still reach 85 uniformity which meets the requirements of the nmr method for the uniformity of the rf field secondly for the nmr logging probe used for soil moisture detection the depth of investigation doi in the radial direction is an important factor that affects the actual measurement effect this is because whether pushing the probe directly into the soil or drilling a borehole the soil layer near the probe or the borehole will shake and form a so called interference zone if the nmr probe has a large radial doi the influence of the interference zone on the measurement results can be avoided however increasing the doi will inevitably reduce the strength of the magnetic field in the resonance area and reduce the transmission efficiency of the rf coil which will result in a decrease in the snr of the measurement data therefore the conflict between the radial doi and data quality should be balanced when designing nmr logging probe the detection area of the new probe we designed is close to the outer wall of the probe therefore in the practical application the new probe is more suitable for measuring a special borehole which has the following characteristics the just right diameter the thin borehole wall and the disturbance zone has been restored to the same condition as the original formation after a long period of natural action finally for the nmr detection the echo time of the cpmg pulse sequence is another important factor for the water in the medium with small pores in the formation it has a faster relaxation time such as clay t 2 is about 4 6 ms if the echo time of the nmr system is too long the signal from the medium with small pores will not be measured therefore the pursuit of a shorter echo time is an important goal in designing an nmr system it should be noted that the echo time of the nmr system is mainly affected by the power of the transmitting system the ring down times of the rf coil and the strategy of energy release nacher et al 2020 thus these elements are the important considerations for designing the nmr system 6 conclusion an nmr logging probe design scheme based on compensating magnets is proposed which is mainly used to detect the soil moisture of the root zone it retains the advantage of high depth resolution in the original jackson s scheme of 1 cm to increase the volume of the resonance region and improve the snr we adopt the uniform design method to obtain the optimal compensation magnet parameters including magnet diameter thickness and magnet spacing the simulation results show that compared with the traditional non compensation magnet scheme the new nmr probe can achieve advantages in increasing the volume of the resonance region increasing the magnetic field strength and improving the efficiency of the rf coil theoretically the new probe can obtain an snr of 5 2 times that of the traditional scheme the measurement results of three groups of samples with different water content show that the new probe can obtain accurate measurement results of soil moisture and can also give the proportion of free water and bound water these results have also been verified by low field lab nmr experiments which shows that the design of this probe is effective finally the factors that have an important influence on the measurement effect such as the uniformity of the rf field the radial doi and the echo time have been fully discussed and these discussions and analyses could provide some references for the further design of the small diameter nmr loging system used for soil moisture detection credit authorship contribution statement jinbao zhu

appendix a calculation of the magnetic field distribution accurately calculating the distribution of the magnetic field is the prerequisite for the optimization of the magnet layout in this section we

et al 1980 additionally the soil moisture changes dynamically with changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration thus accurate accessment of the soil moisture with high depth resolution plays an essential role in the research of the above disciplines some in situ measurement techniques such as time domain reflectometry robinson et al 2003 ground penetrating radar lunt et al 2005 and direct current resistivity samouëlian et al 2005 have demonstrated their utility however these methods only use the dielectric conductivity or resistivity of the soil to indirectly measure the moisture and are insufficient in accuracy and depth resolution as a powerful method the nuclear magnetic resonance nmr logging technology has the ability to study the dynamics of fluids hydrogen containing in porous media and characterize the hydrological parameters of the reservoir coates et al 1999 at the same time in the field of soil moisture detection nmr technology is evaluated as a promising technical method robinson et al 2008 some studies have proved the effective application of the nmr logging method in soil moisture detection perlo et al 2013 sucre et al 2011 moreover the nmr probe can distinguish the content of free water and bound water in soil shen et al 2019 the modern nmr logging tools originated from the inside out concept proposed by jackson which uses the permanent magnet s magnetic field to establish a resonance region burnettt and jackson 1980 cooper and jackson 1980 jackson et al 1980 inspired by this concept different arrays of permanent magnets were developed and combined with suitable radio frequency rf coils to excite samples and detect signals sun et al 2019 according to the static magnetic field profile the nmr logging probes can be divided into saddle point type and gradient type in general jackson s nmr probe design scheme is a typical saddle point type which consists of two cylindrical magnets that are arranged coaxially and magnetized along the axis in opposite directions hürlimann 2012 the opposing magnetic fields combine to form a toroidal region of relatively homogeneous in the central plane between them the advantage of this scheme is that it has high depth resolution however it has the disadvantage that the resonance region is too small and the signal to noise ratio snr of the observed signal is very low in order to obtain a high snr signal another probe design scheme of gradient type is proposed by strikman et al 1988 this probe consists of a long cylindrical magnet magnetized perpendicular to its axis and form an azimuthally symmetric resonant region of a thin cylindrical shell 1 2 mm although the resonant region is very thin it can increase the volume of it by increasing the length of the magnet so a higher snr signal can be obtained later inspired by the strikman s scheme some complex nmr probe design schemes composed of multiple magnets were proposed allen et al 2000 hürlimann 2012 they are similar to the strikman s scheme that is increase the volume of the resonance region by increasing the length of the resonance region so as to improve the snr however the length of the resonance region is defined as the depth resolution of the nmr probe walsh et al 2013 therefore the drawback of these probes is that their depth resolution is low compared with the probes designed by jackson s scheme a notable problem is that the early nmr logging tools are designed for petroleum exploration and operated under extreme conditions in deep boreholes with high temperatures up to 170 and high pressures up to 138 mpa an example of one such instrument is the halliburton mril xl which is 13 64 m long weighs more than 726 kg and operates in boreholes from 20 to 40 cm the size and cost of these instruments limit their use in shallow groundwater and soil moisture measurements this problem has been paid attention and a variety of small diameter nmr logging tools have been designed to meet such measurement needs perlo et al 2013 sucre et al 2011 walsh et al 2013 however the reduction in the size of the nmr probe further reduces the volume of the resonance region which reduces the snr of the signal equally therefore these small diameter nmr probes are mostly designed based on strikman s scheme or the similar schemes to ensure that a high quality signal can be obtained and their depth resolutions are 50 cm walsh et al 2013 10 cm perlo et al 2013 and 5 cm sucre et al 2011 respectively in this paper we propose a small diameter nmr logging probe which is an optimized design of jackson s scheme it retains the advantage of high depth resolution and the volume of the resonance region is enlarged by the magnetic field of the compensation magnets which improves the snr of the signal the diameter of the new nmr probe is 6 cm and its depth resolution is 1 cm a soil moisture experiment of three group samples is conducted and the results are compared with that of a low field lab nmr analysis instrument which proved the accuracy of its measurement results including the successful detection of the proportion of free water and bound water the detailed design process and verification experiments are demonstrated as follows 2 theory of nmr logging for soil moisture measurement the nmr logging technology uses the physical property of the spin of hydrogen protons which is an intrinsic and fundamental property of an atom ristic et al 2014 these protons have angular momentum and magnetic moments when the magnetic moments are exposed to a static magnetic field b 0 they precess about b 0 at larmor frequency f l which can be calculated as 1 f l γ b 0 2 π where γ 0 2675 1 0 9 s 1 t 1 is the proton gyromagnetic ratio at thermal equilibrium these magnetic moments form a net magnetic moment and the direction of it is consistent with b 0 according to curie s law the net magnetization vector per unit volume can be described as following 2 m 0 n γ 2 h 2 4 k b t b 0 where n is the number of protons per unit volume h is the reduced plank s constant t is the temperature and k b is the boltzmann s constant fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of a typical small diameter nmr logging probe for soil moisture detection at the beginning of the measurement an nmr probe is inserted into a borehole or directly pushed into the soil kendrick et al 2021 walsh et al 2013 then the detection region is established by the magnetic field of the permanent magnets and an rf coil is used to generate the carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence which consists of a 90 and multiple 180 pulses carr and purcell 1954 meiboom and gill 1958 under the control of cpmg pulse sequence the hydrogen protons in the detection region are excited from the thermal equilibrium state to the excited state and the nmr echo signal is produced by precession in the plane perpendicular to the direction of b 0 with relaxation time denoted by t 2 for geologic materials they may contain a distribution of pores with different t 2 thus the recorded nmr signal e t is usually expressed as walsh et al 2013 3 e t e 0 i p 2 i e t t 2 i where e 0 is the initial signal magnitude and is proportional to the number of protons i e soil moisture in the resonance region p 2 i is the proportion of the magnetic field relaxing in the transverse direction with relaxation time t 2 i for nmr logging measurement there is an assumption that the free water resides in large pores whereas the bound water resides in small pores shen et al 2019 because the t 2 value is proportional to pore size thus it is possible to distinguish the content of free water and bound water by partitioning t 2 distribution usually a fixed value t 2 is selected that divides the t 2 distribution into two components one consisting of small pore containing bound water and the other consisting of large pore containing free water coates et al 1999 and the total soil moisture can be obtained by calculating the total area of t 2 distribution fig 2 3 high resolution design of nmr logging probe based on compensating magnets 3 1 briefly review of jackson s scheme in this section we briefly review the nmr probe design based on jackson s scheme the schematic diagram of this scheme is shown in fig 3 two permanent magnets are arranged coaxially with poles opposite each other and an rf coil is coaxial with the magnets and placed on the central plane to generate the excitation field and receive the nmr signals for jackson s scheme the magnetic field produced by the permanent magnets has azimuthal symmetry this means that the magnetic field has the same distribution along any radius in the central plane the field strength starts at zero at the center point rises to a maximum saddle point and then decreases as the distance increases thus a relatively homogeneous magnetic field with azimuthal symmetry in a toroidal region selected as resonant region can be established in the central plane however the height and ring width of this toroidal region is very small and this determines the characteristics of this scheme high depth resolution and low snr another feature of this scheme is that the position of the toroidal region and the magnetic field strength in it can be changed by adjusting the parameters of the magnets and the distance between them fig 4 shows the distribution of magnetic field along radius r at different magnet spacing h 0 normalized to magnet radius r 0 3 2 compensating magnets layout optimization by using uniform design for jackson s scheme it can be seen from fig 4 that changing the magnets parameters and their layout can adjust the position of the saddle point and change its field strength in this section we introduce an optimization design of an nmr probe based on compensating magnets the compensating magnets are added to form a new saddle point distribution which is superimposed with the original magnetic field to expand the scope of the homogeneous region the schematic diagram of the arrangement of the magnets in the new probe is shown in fig 5 the concept of this design is to increase the volume of the resonance region by increasing the ring width of it while the height of it remains unchanged so that the high depth resolution advantage of the original jackson s scheme can be maintained such an nmr logging probe will be more suitable for the measurement of shallow soil moisture with high depth resolution firstly we preset the parameters of the main magnets and determine their layout to build a small diameter nmr logging probe the diameter of the main magnets is 50 mm and the height is 90 mm and the distance between them is 160 mm we choose neodymium iron boron ndfeb as the material of the main magnets because it has a high residual flux density b r 1 15 t meribout 2019 then an rf coil made of copper wire with a diameter of 56 mm and turns of 24 is designed coaxial with the main magnets and placed on the central plane the compensation magnets are also made of ndfeb then we need to determine the optimum parameters of the compensation magnets including the diameter d c the height h c and the distance l c between them to enhance the resonance region and improve the snr as much as possible for this kind of multi parameter optimization problem the simplest solution is to traverse all possible values within a reasonable range of parameters to find the best result however if there are 50 values to be selected for each parameter then there is a total of 503 125 000 value combinations which leads to high computing costs to improve the optimization efficiency we use the method called uniform design proposed by fang et al fang et al 2000 the uniform design ud is a space filling design method which aims to select the designed points that representative and uniformly scattered in the given points for the compensation magnets layout optimization problem all the possible combinations of the related three parameters d c h c and l c are the given points when using ud method as an optimization strategy the analysis of all value combinations can be simplified to the analysis of the selected combinations called as designed points and the optimization efficiency can be greatly improved the specific implementation process of ud method is as follows 1 determine the reasonable value range of all parameters and then set a suitable number of subdivisions of the parameters defined as q which means that each parameter has the number of q values 2 according to the number of parameters to be optimized defined as m and the number of designed points to be selected defined as n choose a suitable ud table which can be easily done by visiting the website http www math hkbu edu hk uniformdesign according to the ud theory the ud table is expressed as u n qm 3 obtain the designed points by using the u n qm table in fact if we regard all the values of the parameters to be optimized as a matrix this ud table records the index coordinates of the designed points 4 use these designed points to calculate the objective function of the problem to be optimized and find the best designed point 5 according to the best designed point in 4 reduce the value range of the parameters and carry out the next round of ud finally a combination of approximate optimal values can be obtained in this paper we set the value range of the 3 parameters m 3 d c h c and l c as 5 50 mm 1 10 mm and 5 95 mm respectively the values of variables q and m are both 10 thus the ud table can be described as u10 103 the u10 103 and corresponding representative value combinations of the parameters designed points are listed in table 1 an example is given to explain how the value of the parameter is determined according to the ud table the first combination under heading 1 2 3 is 6 7 1 which represent that d c should take the 6th value of the 10 equal parts of 5 50 mm which is exactly 30 mm in the same way h c should take the 7th value of the 10 equal parts of 1 10 mm and l c should take the 1st value of the 10 equal parts of 5 95 mm improving the snr is the target of the optimization for simplicity we use simplified snr as the objective function to evaluate the performance of compensation magnets layout perlo et al 2013 which is named as ssnr and shown as 4 s s n r v b 0 2 b 1 s i n α i c r d v where v is the volume of the resonance region i c is the current through the rf coil r is the ac resistance of the rf coil and α is the angle between b 0 and b 1 in the implementation process the region where the magnetic field is not less than 99 of the maximum value is defined as the homogenous region it is noteworthy that considering the actual size of the probe the space 30 mm away from the probe axis is regarded as the effective potential resonance region this is because the space within 30 mm is occupied by the support material of the probe then three rounds of ud optimization have been completed by using the magnet magnetic field calculation method introduced in the appendix a and the objective function of 4 and the normalized ssnr gradually stabilized and reached the maximum fig 6 the optimal parameters d c h c and l c of the compensation magnets correspond to the maximum ssnr in the third round ud are 20 mm 3 1 mm and 45 mm respectively according to these parameters we implemented the probe design as shown in fig 7 the housing material of the probe is unsaturated polyester resin which has a very short t 2 0 04 ms for hydrogen proton nmr hietalahti et al 1997 therefore the nmr signal generated by this material will decay quickly and will not affect the measurement results of pore water in the soil in addition the permanent magnets and the housing material adopt an interference fit to keep the relative position of the magnets unchanged in this way the final magnetic field distribution will be more stable and will not be easily changed due to vibrations and other reasons to evaluate the optimization effect we use the comsol multiphysics finite element simulation software to simulate the magnetic field distribution and used a high precision magnetic field measurement system f w bell 8030 a three dimensional gaussian meter to test the nmr probe fig 8 shows the simulation and measurement results of the magnetic field distribution of the new probe the ring with and the height of the final optimized resonance region are 23 mm and 10 mm respectively since the height of the resonance area is regarded as the depth resolution of the nmr probe therefore we can conclude that the depth resolution of the new probe can reach 10 mm to compare the difference in the resonance region with or without compensating magnets the magnetic field generated by the main magnets and compensating magnets and their combined magnetic field along a radius in the central plane are shown in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that the introduction of the compensating magnets expands the size of the resonance region by approximately 2 1 times besides the magnetic field strength b 0 in the resonance region also increased slightly from 17 mt to 18 mt moreover the optimized resonance area is closer to the rf coil which also improves the transmission efficiency b 1 i c of the coil by simulating the magnetic field of the rf coil this item is approximately 2 2 times as the original in summary the optimized design scheme will increase the snr from three aspects increasing the volume of the resonance region the strength of the magnetic field and the efficiency of the coil theoretically the snr of the data obtained by the new probe is 5 2 times that of the original 4 experimental results to verify the effect of the new probe a soil moisture measurement experiment has been conducted the sample under study is the coarse sand the main component is sio2 with a diameter in the range of 0 2 to 2 mm and the mass water content w c is defined as 5 w c m w m w m s where m w is the mass of water and m s is the mass of sands we make three groups of samples with a different mass water content of 10 15 and 20 respectively for readers who are more concerned with volumetric water content we also convert the above mass water content to volumetric water content which is also the quantity measured by nmr in doing this calculation we used the value 1 6 g cm3 as the density of coarse sand the volumetric water content of these three samples were 15 1 22 0 and 28 6 respectively these samples have been sealed and allowed to stand for 24 h before being measured to achieve equilibrium of the diffusion of water inside then we use the new probe and the nmr spectrometer system developed by our team to measure these samples fig 10 the sample tank is a hollow container with a length of 15 cm a width of 15 cm and a height of 6 cm and the wall thickness is 1 mm in addition there is a 6 cm diameter hole in the middle of the container so that the new probe can pass through it the container is also made of unsaturated polyester resin therefore it will not affect the measurement results it is worth noting that in order to reduce the interference of electromagnetic noise in the space this experiment was completed in a shielded room the cpmg pulse sequence is adopted as the measurement sequence because it can obtain both water content and t 2 distribution in our experiment the duration of the 90 pules is 200 μs the duration of the 180 pules is 400 μs the inter echo spacing is 2 ms the total echo number of one cpmg pulse is 250 and the recovery time is 5 s the lamor frequency is 769 khz the sampling frequency is 10 mhz and the final nmr signal is obtained by 200 times of data average stacks fig 11 a shows the cpmg spin echo measured from the three samples and fig 11b is the fitting curve of them then we use the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique sirt as the inversion algorithm ge et al 2017 and the t 2 distribution spectrum inversed from the fitting curve is shown in fig 11c the measurement snr has been calculated as the ratio between the average magnitude of the first three echoes and the standard deviation of the last ten echoes ross et al 2021 and the snr are 15 5 13 2 and 12 9 for the sample of 28 6 22 0 and 15 1 respectively we also calculated the area enclosed by the long t 2 peak and the short t 2 peak divided by the t 2 50 ms of the inversion result the normalized peak area of long and short t 2 are proportional to the content of free water and bound water and they are shown in fig 12 a it can be seen from fig 12a that the bound water content of the three groups of samples is the same while the free water content is significantly different this means that the space of the small pores has been fully filled and the difference in water content is mainly determined by the free water content in the large pores simultaneously we extract the normalized initial amplitude e 0 from the cpmg spin echo fitting curve and draw them and their fitting curves in fig 12a it can be seen that the normalized initial amplitude and the normalized total peak area are proportional to the moisture content of the sample and the fitting curve of e 0 is an important reference for the calibration of the nmr logging system measurement results to verify the accuracy of the measurement results obtained by the new probe we also use a low field lab nmr analyzer system mini mr produced by suzhou niumag analytical instrument corporation to measure the three samples again for these experiments we still use the cpmg sequence as the measurement sequence the duration of the 90 pules is 20 μs and the duration of the 180 pules is 40 μs and other parameters such as the echo time spacing is also 2 ms the total echo number of one cpmg pulse is also 250 and the recovery time is also 5 s due to the high snr of this lab nmr analyzer the final nmr signal is obtained only by 5 times of data average stacks the corresponding normalized e 0 normalized peak area and their fitting curve are shown in fig 12b comparing fig 12a and b it can be seen that the measurement results of the new probe are basically consistent with the results measured by the lab nmr instrument one small difference is that the proportion of bound water obtained by the nmr probe is a little higher than that of the low field instrument this may be that different t 2 values and or different t 2 spectrum inversion algorithms have been adopted despite this their normalized initial amplitude normalized total peak area and their fitting curve are basically the same thus this is enough to accurately obtain the moisture of the soil and this comparative experiment proves the effectiveness of the new nmr probe further more to exam the heterogeneity of the probe with or without compensation magnets we remove the compensating magnest in the probe and measure the above three samples again the cpmg pulse is still used as the detection sequence it should be noted that the intensity of the magnetic field in the resonance area is reduced and the center position of the resonance area is farther from the rf coil therefore the lamor frequency at this time is 720 khz correspondingly the duration of the 90 pules is 240 μs and the duration of the 180 pules is 480 μs and the other parameters are consistent with the experiment conducted by the new probe with compensating magnets the measurement results are shown in fig 13 it can be seen from the fig 13 that there is no attenuation trend in the cpmg echo data we obtained what s more the amplitude of the echo signal is consistent with the noise floor of the system therefore we can conclude that the introduction of the compensation magnets is significant for improving the data quality 5 discussion although our test experiments in the laboratory have achieved good measurement results there are also some questions worthy of attention and discussion here firstly the core idea of the optimized design of the probe based on the compensation magnets is that increasing the volume of the resonance region by increasing the ring width of it so as to increasing the snr however the expansion of the resonance area in the radial direction should not be excessively increased this is because the rf field is required to have a high uniformity in the resonance region so that the excitation pulse has the same effect on the hydrogen protons in the whole resonance region unless there are some new technologies that can expand the uniformity region of the rf magnetic field it is inevitable that the rf magnetic field will decay with distance therefore subject to the influence of the above factors simply expanding the resonance area in the radial direction may not expand the actual effective detection area it should be noted that the probe we designed can ignore the impact of rf magnetic field uniformity this is because the resonance area of the new probe is not too wide and it is also very close to the rf coil and in the resonance region the rf magnetic field can still reach 85 uniformity which meets the requirements of the nmr method for the uniformity of the rf field secondly for the nmr logging probe used for soil moisture detection the depth of investigation doi in the radial direction is an important factor that affects the actual measurement effect this is because whether pushing the probe directly into the soil or drilling a borehole the soil layer near the probe or the borehole will shake and form a so called interference zone if the nmr probe has a large radial doi the influence of the interference zone on the measurement results can be avoided however increasing the doi will inevitably reduce the strength of the magnetic field in the resonance area and reduce the transmission efficiency of the rf coil which will result in a decrease in the snr of the measurement data therefore the conflict between the radial doi and data quality should be balanced when designing nmr logging probe the detection area of the new probe we designed is close to the outer wall of the probe therefore in the practical application the new probe is more suitable for measuring a special borehole which has the following characteristics the just right diameter the thin borehole wall and the disturbance zone has been restored to the same condition as the original formation after a long period of natural action finally for the nmr detection the echo time of the cpmg pulse sequence is another important factor for the water in the medium with small pores in the formation it has a faster relaxation time such as clay t 2 is about 4 6 ms if the echo time of the nmr system is too long the signal from the medium with small pores will not be measured therefore the pursuit of a shorter echo time is an important goal in designing an nmr system it should be noted that the echo time of the nmr system is mainly affected by the power of the transmitting system the ring down times of the rf coil and the strategy of energy release nacher et al 2020 thus these elements are the important considerations for designing the nmr system 6 conclusion an nmr logging probe design scheme based on compensating magnets is proposed which is mainly used to detect the soil moisture of the root zone it retains the advantage of high depth resolution in the original jackson s scheme of 1 cm to increase the volume of the resonance region and improve the snr we adopt the uniform design method to obtain the optimal compensation magnet parameters including magnet diameter thickness and magnet spacing the simulation results show that compared with the traditional non compensation magnet scheme the new nmr probe can achieve advantages in increasing the volume of the resonance region increasing the magnetic field strength and improving the efficiency of the rf coil theoretically the new probe can obtain an snr of 5 2 times that of the traditional scheme the measurement results of three groups of samples with different water content show that the new probe can obtain accurate measurement results of soil moisture and can also give the proportion of free water and bound water these results have also been verified by low field lab nmr experiments which shows that the design of this probe is effective finally the factors that have an important influence on the measurement effect such as the uniformity of the rf field the radial doi and the echo time have been fully discussed and these discussions and analyses could provide some references for the further design of the small diameter nmr loging system used for soil moisture detection credit authorship contribution statement jinbao zhu

appendix a calculation of the magnetic field distribution accurately calculating the distribution of the magnetic field is the prerequisite for the optimization of the magnet layout in this section we introduce a method for calculating the magnetic field of a cylindrical permanent magnet when the magnet is magnetized uniformly the magnetic field of a cylindrical permanent magnet can be equivalent to that generated by the current on the side surface of cylinder fig a 1 the surface current density j s is given as a1 j s b r μ 0 where b r is the residual flux density of the permanent magnet and μ

4082,of particular importance in a world of increasing water scarcity is the temporal and spatial relationship between a shortage in rainfall meteorological drought and a shortage in available water or hydrological drought propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought should be calculated at a higher sub monthly temporal resolution with considerations for spatial expansion a new framework for propagation time calculation from one index to another is established that uses the run theory high resolution remote sensing data on a daily time step the framework is demonstrated using standardized drought indices representing precipitation runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture in the central asian subcontinent to measure the temporal shift propagation time in affected drought area bringing a new perspective to contemporary drought analysis several variables from the water cycle are chosen to provide hydrological context for different propagation times correlation analyses for propagation time are shown to be ambiguous in interpretation and precision when compared to the temporal shift which is clearly defined and calculated on a daily time step moreover the results of temporal shift analyses indicate that deficits in evapotranspiration and runoff can precede deficits in precipitation while soil moisture deficit almost always follows highlighting the effects of additional influencing factors aside from precipitation on types of hydrological drought while it is limited by current understanding of drought definition techniques availability and quality of remote sensing products and selection of characteristics for observation use of the temporal shift over the correlation analysis provides a sub monthly estimate of drought propagation time that may prove useful for detailed analyses particularly in rapidly developing flash drought events keywords drought propagation time hydrological drought standardized indices remote sensing 1 introduction drought is commonly understood as a shortage of water for an extended duration however despite decades of research there are still many questions about what precisely should be considered drought scientists have studied drought primarily through drought indices that attempt to quantify degrees of drought using different observed variables and calculation methods which are usually defined in three dimensions space time and intensity drought can be classified based on impact as meteorological hydrological agricultural or socioeconomic drought hao and singh 2015 zargar et al 2011 more recent drought classification types include flash drought commonly understood as a rapid intensification of dryness due to increased evapotranspiration resulting in drought lisonbee et al 2021 otkin et al 2018 pendergrass et al 2020 and ecological drought crausbay et al 2017 which describes water deficits that affect ecosystem functions and services in the environment meteorological drought indices can be only reliant on precipitation such as in the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 while other meteorological indices such as the modified spi variant the standard precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei beguería et al 2014 and the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 can include the effects of evapotranspiration using temperature inputs mishra and singh 2010 zargar et al 2011 hydrological drought broadly describes shortages in surface and subsurface water van loon 2015 such as water levels in lakes and discharge in rivers this could include soil moisture which depending on the researcher is also considered an agricultural drought indicator mishra and singh 2010 van loon 2015 zargar et al 2011 it is generally assumed that these different types of drought can affect each other but that ultimately meteorological drought is considered the driving force van loon 2015 zargar et al 2011 many contemporary studies seek to understand how types of droughts move from one to the other guo et al 2020 huang et al 2017 jehanzaib et al 2019 orth and destouni 2018 wang et al 2016 xu et al 2019 with particular importance on spatio temporal characteristics guo et al 2018a guo et al 2018b mishra and singh 2011 orth and destouni 2018 one such improvement is the need to identify the propagation time or the amount of time it takes for effects of a drought event to appear in a different type of drought the successful management of water resources in the impending climate change crisis demands improvement in prediction and identification of hydrological extreme events such as floods and droughts making an understanding of this propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought a critical priority model based analyses of drought propagation have been attempted on the catchment scale tallaksen et al 2009 van loon et al 2012 while useful such catchment scale studies are restrained by local influencing factors like topography and are therefore limited in their ability for generalization continental and sub continental studies are therefore necessary to understand propagation mechanics and trends in an increasingly warmer world large study regions pose new problems the broad range of catchment types in a continental scale region mean that potential models must be selected with care to ensure representation of key processes trambauer et al 2013 however many regions of the world have insufficient data to support such detailed physically or semi physically based models especially in low flow regions making it necessary to investigate statistical methods for identifying drought van loon 2015 current approaches to approximate propagation time generally involve a correlation analysis between two indices calculated at different time scales correlations have previously been calculated between indices for comparative analyses mishra and singh 2010 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 shukla and wood 2008 but barker et al 2016 were among the first to explicitly use it as a method to calculate propagation time since then their claim of a connection between correlated time scales and propagation time have been used in several studies gevaert et al 2018 huang et al 2017 jehanzaib et al 2019 wu et al 2021 xu et al 2019 though the interpretation of this relation in other words the derivation of the approximate propagation time from the highest correlated time scales is still unclear for example barker et al 2016 mention that it provides an indication of the time where the spi accumulation period with the strongest correlation with the standardized streamflow index of one month ssi 1 was used as an indicator for drought propagation it is unclear how this indicator should be understood if the hydrological index time scale is not 1 month studies using this connection do not provide detailed interpretation or analysis of it huang et al 2017 wu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 correlation analyses also lack the ability to describe characteristics of drought such as spatial extent onset and peak moreover their application in large study areas is limited the correlation between precipitation and streamflow at an outlet may provide an idea of the relationship between those variables but does not describe the spatial variability within that region a comparison of three propagation time techniques the correlation method a run theory method and a non linear response method by wu et al 2021 shows that there is little concurrence between results from current methods indicating that further development and innovation in this field is necessary there have been few if any attempts to calculate propagation time with higher sub monthly precision which would improve understanding of drought development and recovery time series analyses for this are possible mishra and singh 2011 but the success of such studies is as in most fields of hydrology limited by observed data the widespread availability of coarser monthly data results in analyses that lack precision on a sub monthly scale while such a scale might be relevant for multi year slowly developing drought events the recent recognition of rapidly developing flash drought events will require sub monthly analyses ideally daily to sufficiently describe these processes otkin et al 2018 pendergrass et al 2020 recent advances in remote sensing technology have enabled analysis of hydrological processes in increasingly finer temporal and spatial resolution particularly in low data catchments across the globe but these high resolution products have not yet been applied for drought propagation time calculation of propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought also remains complex due to the multivariate nature of drought many researchers have discussed the inability of any single index to properly capture drought hao and aghakouchak 2013 hao and singh 2015 li et al 2017 rajsekhar et al 2015 wang et al 2016 streamflow and runoff are commonly used as hydrologic indices barker et al 2016 mishra and singh 2010 shukla and wood 2008 van loon 2015 zargar et al 2011 however other hydrological variables in conjunction with precipitation can provide more insight into changes in runoff hao and aghakouchak 2013 hao and singh 2015 rajsekhar et al 2015 precedent soil moisture conditions are a strong indicator for runoff van loon 2015 likewise evapotranspiration can greatly affect soil moisture conditions otkin et al 2018 pendergrass et al 2020 van loon 2015 and is often monitored alongside precipitation via indices like spi and spei bayissa et al 2018 beguería et al 2014 nicolai shaw et al 2017 spinoni et al 2019 zargar et al 2011 zhu et al 2016 thus soil moisture and evapotranspiration have been included in multivariate studies for their relevance in the hydrologic cycle keyantash and dracup 2004 li et al 2017 nicolai shaw et al 2017 because drought is multivariate and complex an analysis of propagation time should also be multivariate and complex studying precipitation runoff soil moisture and evapotranspiration in parallel could provide hydrological context for propagation time water resources management decisions are influenced by the availability and monitoring of surface water which is a primary victim of hydrological drought van loon 2015 van loon and van lanen 2012 wang et al 2016 proper responses to hydrological drought propagation however require a holistic and multivariate approach to understand the influence factors behind propagation time in this study our objectives are twofold first to establish a new framework for investigating propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought to overcome the limitations of the correlation method and second to compare the new methods with previously established methods for further understanding of the relationship between highest correlated drought time scales we use one drought index representing meteorological drought and three drought indices reflecting hydrological drought to contextualize the reasons behind different propagation times these objectives are part of a larger effort to understand spatial and temporal drought propagation 2 methodology 2 1 study area central asia the study area central asia fig 1 is an arid to semi arid sub continental region consisting of countries specifically kazakhstan uzbekistan kyrgyzstan turkmenistan tajikistan and the xinjiang province in northwest china with strong dependencies on agriculture precipitation in this region is dominated by snow in the higher mountainous regions in the winter while hot and dry conditions prevail in the summer drought conditions occur regularly and can stretch across the entire region with aggravated effects from poor water distribution desertification salinization and unsustainable land use practices patrick 2017 stream gage data is scarce making analysis of hydrological conditions difficult without the use of remote sensing technology much of the study area is dominated by deserts and sparsely vegetated steppes klein et al 2012 yang et al 2014 forests exist in the mountainous regions of tajikistan and kyrgyzstan and in the northern parts of kazakhstan where more steady precipitation falls throughout the year as well as in areas closer to the seas and lakes little land is cultivated outside of these regions irrigated cropland is sparse mostly near the various water bodies and mountains which act as freshwater reservoirs during the dry months of the year 2 2 the temporal shift drought analysis framework the proposed framework in this paper is an approach to finding propagation time with sub monthly timescales from meteorological drought to hydrological drought fig 2 this approach uses the run theory to describe the propagation through different types of drought in space and time its usefulness is demonstrated in this study using three different hydrological variables representing different parts of the water balance equation runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture the method is as follows 1 this method is concerned with finding the spatial propagation time the difference in time between maximum spatial extent in different drought variables thus a daily fine scale remote sensing product for each variable is required this study uses a spatial resolution of 0 25 by 0 25 though coarser spatial resolutions can be applied 2 a univariate standardized index is then calculated for each 0 25 by 0 25 pixel and each variable over the record creating several one for each variable time series of drought intensity for each pixel observing the most rapid changes as this study aimed to do required the use of one month time scales for all indices 3 these times series are used to define meteorological drought events however there is no universal definition of drought events lloyd hughes 2013 mishra and singh 2010 van loon 2015 zargar et al 2011 for this study we use a run theory filter but different drought definition methods can be substituted if it is possible to identify every pixel undergoing drought conditions at any time step 4 for each event selected for analysis the run theory with intensity standardized index 1 area number of adjacent pixels and duration thresholds is used to reconstruct the spatial expansion of the event 5 the temporal shifts were then calculated between the peak times or the time at which the most pixels experience drought between each hydrologic index and the spi 1 t shift t hydro m a x t meteo m a x this temporal shift reflects the response time propagation time of maximum hydrological drought area to maximum meteorological drought area if the peak in the hydrologic index occurs before the spi i e the shift is negative it is considered a lead time whereas if it occurs in the hydrological index first i e the shift is positive it is considered a lag time the definition of characteristics to determine temporal shift can affect the outcome choosing only the absolute maximum spi peak time may not be as descriptive as choosing the individual peaks however choosing the individual peaks is also problematic because it would then be difficult to ascribe hydrologic peaks to a particular spi peak since the number of peaks is often unequal we therefore calculate temporal shift based on the absolute maximums in the observation window as they are the most easily identifiable characteristics 2 2 1 selected drought indices standardized indices use a fitted probability distribution to calculate the number of standard deviations a value is from the average mckee et al 1993 a technique that is applicable across different variables and produces meaningful easily interpreted results this makes standardized indices reasonable choices for cross variable comparisons farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 hao and aghakouchak 2013 moreover many studies suggest using a variety of hydrological indicators hao and singh 2015 li et al 2017 rajsekhar et al 2015 such as pairings of streamflow and soil moisture to represent different aspects of the hydrologic cycle to this end this study utilizes a total of four standardized and univariate indices spi as a meteorological index and hydrological indices sri sedi and ssmi hereafter referred to collectively as si to evaluate the propagation of drought in different stages of the water cycle these indices were calculated using the following remote sensing data sets from the period february 1 2003 to december 31 2018 on a daily time step at a resolution of 0 25 by 0 25 table 1 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 measures the anomaly in precipitation and has been recommended by the world meteorological organization as a primary index to characterize such drought hayes et al 2011 it was calculated using persiann cdr precipitation data braithwaite et al 2015 nguyen et al 2019 which is based on satellite observations the standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 measures the anomaly in generated runoff which includes both surface runoff and baseflow and is not routed through a river network runoff is therefore inclusive of processes that moderate the hydrologic response such as snow accumulation and melt and is less sensitive than the spi in shorter timescales longer time scales e g 12 months despite their higher correlations with longer scale spi are not recommended as they risk integrating values that are beyond the effects of normal hydrologic responses shukla and wood 2008 the sri was calculated using the total surface runoff surface qs and subsurface runoff qsb excluding snowmelt qsm from the gldas v2 2 catchment land surface model li et al 2018 li et al 2019 which is simulated based on meteorological forcing with data assimilation from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi vicente serrano et al 2018 measures the evaporative deficit ed anomaly where ed is the difference between the potential evapotranspiration pet and the actual evapotranspiration aet this definition quantifies the drought stress primarily as lack of water consumed by plants among other factors and has low sensitivity to the methodology used to calculate aet sedi is characterized as a short timescale drought index with sensitivity to high frequency climate variations with intended applications in crop and vegetative drought assessment vicente serrano et al 2018 this was calculated using global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 3a products specifically the actual evapotranspiration e and potential evapotranspiration ep martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 gleam 3 3a is based on both satellite and reanalysis datasets the standardized soil moisture index ssmi aghakouchak 2014 measures the deficit anomaly in soil moisture accumulated soil moisture deficit is shown to be more persistent than precipitation deficit has a high autocorrelation factor indicating strong reliance on previous values and is less sensitive to rapid developments resulting in delayed responses to precipitation aghakouchak 2014 hao and aghakouchak 2013 nicolai shaw et al 2017 2016 and potentially more persistent drought this was calculated using gleam v3 3a root zone soil moisture data martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 because the goal of the study is to investigate the propagation time of drought as it expands in space data is required on sub monthly time scales with a spatial resolution that does not sacrifice detail future studies may substitute similar datasets of finer or coarser spatial resolution based on availability however records at a daily time step are highly recommended for the successful application of the method proposed in this paper while many standardized indices require 30 years of data to reliably fit a probability distribution certain empirical plotting positions such as the one used in this study have demonstrated acceptable quality with a sample size of less than 20 gringorten 1963 these can be considered suitable substitutions until enough data is available 2 2 1 1 calculation of drought indices the standardized drought analysis toolbox the variety of viable distribution curves for standardized indices represents a challenge for computationally efficient calculations that are justifiable across parameters bayissa et al 2018 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 hao and aghakouchak 2013 stagge et al 2015 the method proposed in the standardized drought analysis toolbox sdat eliminates these drawbacks by calculating standardized indices based on the empirical probability which produces similarly valid results in spi calculation compared to values calculated using the currently accepted probability distributions farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 the sdat uses the empirical gringorten plotting position to find the probability of occurrence of an observation 2 p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 i is the rank of the observation when ordered from smallest to largest and n is the number of observations gringorten 1963 the resulting probability is used instead of fitted probability distribution functions to calculate the standardized index via the normal inverse 3 si ϕ 1 p more details on the sdat method can be found in farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 in arid and semiarid regions like central asia where little to no rainfall or runoff is expected most of the year it is particularly important to consider the effects of time steps where the accumulated precipitation or runoff is zero as it increases in frequency the zero data condition becomes increasingly problematic because it is impossible for a drier precipitation or runoff value than zero to occur using the probability of its occurrence whether via empirical or fitted distributions results in an increasingly higher si this would falsely imply that the zero rainfall condition is wetter than usual to compensate for this error stagge et al 2015 demonstrated that using a piecewise function with the weibull non exceedance probability to calculate the center of probability mass of multiple zeros results in more statistically meaningful si values in this study we modify the sdat source to accommodate zero data occurrences as in stagge et al 2015 to calculate each of the standardized indices in table 1 the inclusion of the weibull non exceedance probability which uses the number of zero data occurrences n0 to calculate the probability center of mass results in a piecewise function to calculate the probability 4 p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 f o r x 0 n 0 1 2 n 1 f o r x 0 we also modify the sdat to accommodate daily scale remote sensing data fig 3 while commonly calculated for 12 months in a year the flexibility of the standardized indicator algorithm makes it possible to calculate these indices for every day of the year values for each day in the accumulation period the time scale leading up to and including the current day are added months are assumed to have 30 days each an accumulation period for a three month period for example would be the previous 90 days with these adjustments to the source code the total sum of the observed variable for the accumulation period is calculated then compared with the same day on a 365 day return period using the combined weibull non exceedance probability and empirical gringorten plotting position the recommended dataset length for most standardized indices is 30 years at a monthly time step which should be sufficient to gather enough data to avoid misleading probabilities mckee et al 1993 stagge et al 2015 the use of the gringorten empirical plotting position similarly recommends sample sizes of 20 or more in this context 20 years of data or more but can still produce adequate results with fewer data points gringorten 1963 this length and quality of record is currently not possible for all remote sensing products especially on such fine temporal and spatial resolutions thus the calculation uncertainty of the probability and resulting standardized index is noted but currently unavoidable however further development of daily scale methods and analyses despite these challenges will be necessary to investigate seasonal to sub seasonal flash drought events pendergrass et al 2020 2 3 definition of drought events using the run theory the run theory was first adapted for use in analysis of drought by yevjevich 1967 to describe large continental hydrologic droughts this theory defines a drought event as a period or run over which the observation of a variable meets a minimum threshold in an area depending on what parameters or approaches are selected additional factors should be considered this application allows identification of descriptors such as starting time duration and peak time making possible the calculation of different temporal shifts despite frequent usage of the run theory for drought composite analyses keyantash and john 2002 tallaksen et al 2009 van loon et al 2012 zhu et al 2016 it has very seldom if ever been used to calculate drought propagation time on a sub monthly scale to determine and define drought events for analysis we employ a run theory algorithm which exists separately from the proposed framework and uses a clustering algorithm similar to the one defined by andreadis et al 2005 a run begins when a cluster appears that breaches a spatial and intensity threshold however unlike in andreadis et al 2005 cluster cells must share sides cells sharing corners are not considered each day may have multiple clusters throughout the study area and these clusters may have oblong shapes if 30 consecutive days have drought clusters that grouping of days is considered a drought candidate then from each drought candidate an event is reconstructed by selecting the largest cluster and pulling from each day in the candidate all other clusters that contain at least one pixel from that largest cluster spatial thresholds vary between drought identification studies particularly in response to the size of the study area and the study objectives in their study over the conterminous u s andreadis et al 2005 used a minimum cluster size of 10 pixels on a 0 5 degree resolution roughly 30 000 km2 meanwhile a study over china by wang et al 2011 uses an area of 150 000 km2 to identify previous events when searching on a global context sheffield et al 2009 found that a minimum area of 500 000 km2 minimized improper drought event persistence across continents lloyd hughes 2012 uses this same area threshold in their study over europe however these studies searched for large drought events in this study we are interested in observing a drought event from its beginning to end regardless of its size future studies may use size thresholds that are more suited to their desired objectives thus we follow the example of andreadis et al 2005 each cluster must consist of an area larger than 10 pixels spatial threshold with spi 1 intensity threshold more sophisticated algorithms and theories exist for defining and identifying drought events and can be used with this proposed propagation time calculation as long as it is possible to find all pixels experiencing drought at each time step guo et al 2018b developed a three dimensional drought clustering system to define other events in central asia while li et al 2020 proposed a method unique to flash droughts that could be modified for normal droughts a study by bayissa et al 2018 showed that of six drought indices no single index could capture every onset in a basin in ethiopia indicating that more variables could be included in future improvements to drought identification algorithms however furthering the discussion of defining drought is beyond the scope of our study 2 4 the correlation method the classical approach to finding the propagation time from one index to another which is to find the highest correlated time scales was applied to individual drought events standardized indices at various time scales were considered for this index correlation analysis using the pearson correlation coefficient all indices and time scales were cropped to the maximum area extent and duration of each spi event the long medium short and very short events this ensured that we were only observing pixels that were involved in the drought event and compared exclusively during the duration of the event the pearson correlation coefficient was then calculated for each pixel in the event and filtered for only significant p 0 05 correlations and the median was calculated across the event s extent as the final value the median was chosen because of the sensitivity of the average to the existence of high correlations and anticorrelations which were present for individual pixels in the event this method is based on two assumptions first that the meteorological drought is the driver of hydrological drought and that the propagation time is the hydrological index time scale that is highest correlated in the literature this analysis is typically performed with the hydrological index fixed at one month si 1 with spi calculated at different time scales however correlations with si 1 can be inconclusive therefore we broadened the analysis to include correlations with si at different time scales to observe the effects of meteorological droughts on other types of drought it is necessary that the second index has a time scale that is less than or equal to the spi time scale si n spi m this is because of the way that the standardized indices are calculated a longer time scale means a longer period before the current day is considered that means that for an analysis showing the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought we should only include correlations for which the meteorological index includes more time than the hydrological index correlation analysis is commonly applied in research of all disciplines making its limitations well known schober et al 2018 taylor 1990 though there are commonly accepted ranges for goodness of fit criteria including correlation in the field of hydrological modeling they are typically applied for calibration and validation evaluation from this perspective then a selection of two well correlated time scales could mean a calibration of one index to another however such a perspective must also consider the risks of blindly choosing the highest correlated indices overfitting especially when considering the existence of several comparably high correlation coefficients there are additional issues specific to application of correlation analysis in propagation time because correlation between time series is independent of order it does not matter if the spi peaked before another index or vice versa an assumption must be made for which drought event comes first we assumed as many in the literature did that precipitation drought drives other forms of drought barker et al 2016 huang et al 2017 van loon 2015 xu et al 2019 hence propagation times calculated using the correlation method are assumed to be from meteorological drought to hydrological drought 3 results discussion 3 1 drought identification 3 1 1 drought events while a detailed discussion of the merits of a particular identification approach are beyond the scope of this paper it is still necessary to ensure that the results generally agree with historical drought conditions the run theory definition in this paper produced 21 unique drought events of varying lengths and maximum area extents table 2 of which seven loosely agree in time and space with events found in the european commission s development of a global drought observatory gdo spinoni et al 2019 identified droughts in this study are not expected to be in strong agreement with the literature due to different drought definition criteria the gdo uses both the spi and the spei at the 3 6 and 12 month levels between 1951 and 2016 and removed any drought events that did not last for at least two months that occurred too close to the end of a previous drought event and that did not grow sufficiently large spinoni et al 2019 in contrast our droughts are simply defined with a small spatial threshold a minimum length of 30 days and on a 1 month time scale with no further filtering criterion of particular importance was the identification of the 2008 2010 drought in central asia which was noted as one of the world s most extreme by several studies guo et al 2018a spinoni et al 2019 that this drought identification algorithm was able to identify key events allows for further analysis of its results most identified drought events were between 30 and 180 days drought events were then classified as very short short medium or long events based on their duration table 3 the largest drought of each length category was selected as a representative for further visual analysis of spatial and temporal propagation the largest events would have the most easily identifiable characteristics using this method since it is based on affected area larger events will have more exaggerated characteristics however this method can be applied for smaller events as well the maximum spatial extents of each representative event can be seen in fig 4 because this method aims to look at the spatial propagation time drought selection criteria must be able to consider the size of the drought event and be flexible enough to accommodate changing sizes plots of drought intensity averaged over the event s area fig 5 can demonstrate the relationships between the magnitude of different indices however this lacks the consideration of spatial variability as an average or even sum of values eventually assigns a single value to the study area intensity is therefore only applied in this study as a binary filter for determining if a cell is experiencing drought however because it is one of the main dimensions of drought future studies in spatial propagation may consider adding an additional factor for intensity 3 2 propagation time 3 2 1 correlation a heat map of statistically significant correlations between all relevant time scales for the representative events can be seen in fig 6 if the spi time scale that correlates the strongest to si 1 is the propagation time as many studies have assumed then the propagation times for sri would be 3 months for the very short event 1 month for the short event 1 month for the medium event and 1 month for the long event for ssmi it would be 6 months 3 months 3 months and 6 months respectively and for sedi it would be 6 months 1 month 3 months and 3 months the strength or lack thereof of the sedi correlations indicate that this analysis could be insufficient though the trend of higher correlations at longer timescales is consistent with the literature kim et al 2019 it is therefore difficult to decisively say that a single pair of highly correlated time scales is a propagation time rather a range of time scales could be considered furthermore as medians these values ignore the spatial variability of the catchment individual cells may have had extremely high correlation or anticorrelation that was lost when calculating the median value future investigation could discern why certain pixels had high correlation while others did not overall the highest correlated time scales for the very short event are spi 3 and sri 3 spi 6 and ssmi 3 and spi 6 and sedi 1 for the short event spi 1 and sri 1 spi 3 and ssmi 1 and spi 9 and sedi 9 for the medium event spi 9 and sri 9 spi 12 and ssmi 9 and spi 15 and sedi 15 and for the long event spi 12 and sri 12 spi 6 and ssmi 3 and spi 15 and sedi 12 despite the inclusion of more data points there is still no clear highest correlation in some of the drought events rather there are several high median correlation coefficients which could be similarly effective analyses of these pairs should consider however that longer time scales generally result in higher correlation as discussed in shukla and wood 2008 additional time scale considerations include relevancy to the index the sri and sedi are shorter time scale indices by virtue of their observed variable while evaporative deficits calculated over longer time scales can be indicative of agricultural productivity kim et al 2019 the extreme volatility of evaporative conditions can make it very useful at short time scales vicente serrano et al 2018 especially in cases of rapidly developing flash drought li et al 2020 generated runoff is a valuable index because generated runoff includes hydrological attenuating processes but time scales that are too long run the risk of including processes that are no longer relevant for current runoff shortages however this also depends on climate and precipitation regimes as precipitation as snowmelt could affect runoff generation later in the year shukla and wood 2008 root zone soil moisture observations however show high autocorrelation higher persistence and are less volatile aghakouchak 2014 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 nicolai shaw et al 2017 2016 here it could be important to consider longer time scales these considerations are not always reflected in the results in general as the length of the event increases the highest correlated time scales also increase this is rather expected for soil moisture drought as a persistence based drought index would presumably correlate higher at longer accumulation periods regardless of event length the supposedly short term nature of the sedi makes its highest correlated indices in all but the very short event surprising this could be the byproduct of increasing scale as shukla and wood 2008 noted since increasing the scale of the index smooths the resulting time series curves as the accumulation period increases the curves converge this could also be a reason why the sri s highest correlated time scales jump from sub seasonal to almost yearly scales in longer events 3 2 2 temporal shift final plots of each run theory analysis for the representative events can be seen in fig 7 with the corresponding temporal shifts in table 4 the spi area black is plotted for only the duration of the event while the hydrological time series include additional time windows for visual context only the very short drought event demonstrates a simple run of drought area with only one peak as expected the sri and sedi in this event seem to respond quickly to the increase in spi area while the ssmi lags in both spatial extent and time the short event shows more complexity as it expands and contracts during the duration of the event while the sri again shows quick responses to changes in spi and the ssmi a more muted response the sedi demonstrates surprising behavior by peaking while the spi event contracts the difference is also not a lag but a lead time from sri and sedi peaks to an spi peak such an expansion in area in a hydrologic index before a meteorological index signals that hydrological drought in various forms may not always be driven by rainfall deficit hydrological drought may as with many hydrologic phenomena be influenced by additional variables a finding corroborated by studies in flash drought ford and labosier 2017 mo and lettenmaier 2015 otkin et al 2018 these could be for example a heat wave flash drought causing an increase in evapotranspiration mo and lettenmaier 2015 and reducing generated runoff despite a precipitation event indicated by the decrease in spi a likely scenario in this study area this underscores the importance of a holistic view of drought no single index can capture all of these changes this complex behavior becomes more apparent in the medium length and long drought events these events are marked by strong successive signals that contract and almost disappear before expanding again indicating that long drought events can be a series of smaller drought events such signals could be broken into smaller drought events using for example a higher drought area threshold or a different clustering algorithm the results of temporal shift analyses for almost all identified events sorted by length category are summarized in fig 8 for clarity separate axes are used for each length category because standardized indices require a period of observation before the date of calculation this acts as a warm up period for calculation fig 3 for this warm up period the drought conditions are unknown thus it is unclear when the first observed drought event which begins at the beginning of the record actually begins and is therefore excluded from this analysis because of the potential skew on the data in general the range of temporal shifts increase in proportion to the length category this general increase is expected as a longer event length means potentially more drought subpeaks and therefore more chances for a larger area to occur closer inspection of the results by observed variable can assist the identification of factors influencing drought propagation in space and time the ssmi almost exclusively exhibits lag times the single exception is a short event that occurs almost immediately after a long event event 2 in table 2 soil moisture and the ssmi exhibits high autocorrelation aghakouchak 2014 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 in other words its current value is strongly dependent on historical values and changes slowly in comparison to the other hydrological variables in this study area long lag times are likely due to the lack of dense vegetation cover accelerating desertification and increasing evaporation from the bare soil li et al 2017 patrick 2017 however because root zone soil moisture shows high persistence aghakouchak 2014 nicolai shaw et al 2016 this could cause long drought development periods and a delayed peak recovery of deficits in the root zone will also take longer than surface soil moisture nicolai shaw et al 2017 the resultant persistent nature of ssmi in this study region could therefore mean that the beginning of the event as defined by the spi coincides with the preceding event s recovery and should be viewed critically while prevention of similar instances can be achieved using additional filters when determining drought in comparison the sri is less predictable as it can be either a lead or a lag time when it is a lead time it is within 20 days of an spi peak when it is a lag time however its duration is highly variable that its median remains close to zero is an indication of the strong relationship between runoff and precipitation though this could change as more events are analyzed the wide range of values reflects the impact that factors aside from precipitation such as land cover soil type and initial conditions can have on runoff generation increases in surface evaporation through high temperatures or low humidity for example could decrease the surface soil moisture dry antecedent conditions can decrease runoff from precipitation requiring more moisture to saturate the top soil layer before becoming runoff castillo et al 2003 kirchner 2009 this could create runoff deficits when decreases in spi would indicate a recovery period as in the short representative event fig 7 in general though the tendency of sri to have lag rather than lead times indicates that runoff drought propagates largely from precipitation drought like the sri the median sedi propagation time fluctuates however the sedi is even less predictable with a broader range of propagation times this is likely a reflection of the various factors on which evapotranspiration is dependent unlike soil moisture and runoff evapotranspiration and its deficit are not explicitly dependent on a precipitation input typical evapotranspiration estimation models use temperature humidity radiation and even vegetation cover as input in this context precipitation as available water provides an upper limit for evapotranspiration but is not one of the main influencing factors thus it can be said that evaporative deficits are influenced by but not necessarily derived from precipitation deficits these findings are consistent with recent literature on flash drought ford and labosier 2017 hobbins et al 2016 mo and lettenmaier 2015 otkin et al 2018 where precipitation is not identified as a main driver instead a combination of high temperatures low humidity and increased solar radiation are likely candidates for increases in evaporative deficits independent of precipitation ford and labosier 2017 mo and lettenmaier 2015 in contrast to the range trends in the precise propagation time as duration increases are not as straightforward a scatter plot of the temporal shift y axis and the event duration x axis is given in fig 9 in addition to the event excluded in the previous analysis two other events were excluded because they were the only two events that lasted more than 450 days 697 and 1015 days in length they can reasonably be considered outliers a linear regression analysis of the 18 remaining points indicates there is a slight trend in propagation time as drought duration increases however the low correlation indicates the length and temporal shift are largely unrelated it is important to note that the sample size is low thus further experimentation with this method is needed to reach a decisive conclusion on trends between drought length and propagation time 3 2 3 differences between the temporal shift and correlation methods the estimates from the temporal shift and correlation methods differ greatly indicating that they describe different processes the time scale correlation is the median of the correlations in all cells the drought affected area which effectively ignores the spatial variability of the study area in a continental scale study area like central asia this assumption of spatial uniformity is not valid even after narrowing down the region to specific drought areas such analysis demands a single correlation per drought which can extend over more than half the region fig 4 thus the correlation method is incapable of producing a spatial propagation time however because it is a comparison between two intensity time series it may describe the propagation of drought intensity aside from the validity of this spatial generalization the meaning of the highest correlated time scales is unintuitive the extraction of the propagation time from this method is still unclear moreover it would be an estimate on a monthly scale fig 6 in contrast the temporal shift analysis offers a more straightforward interpretation of propagation that includes a higher precision and consideration of spatial variability such precision is valuable when trying to find trends in propagation time which are necessary to develop a better understanding of propagation mechanics and for rapidly developing flash drought events where a monthly resolution would result in a significant lack of detail otkin et al 2018 pendergrass et al 2020 moreover runoff and evapotranspiration drought often preceded meteorological drought fig 8 indicating that the assumption of meteorological drought propagating into hydrological drought is not always valid thus the temporal shift method provides a clearer and finer resolution estimate of propagation time that avoids the problematic assumptions of the correlation method 3 2 4 limitations of the temporal shift a major limitation is the definition and selection of drought events though this is again a limitation that is not unique to this study in this study we do not consider the lingering effects of drought events that occur shortly after another which could potentially accelerate certain processes or affect the temporal shift an example of this is events 1 2 in table 2 which resulted in the sole negative temporal shift in ssmi other studies have used complex algorithms to refine selection of drought events to exclude such events with this filtering an application of the drought propagation time methods in this paper may produce clearer results as noted in yevjevich 1967 proper selection of a minimum threshold will also greatly affect results in other words a proper selection of drought events through filtering strategies and time windows for study can minimize the lingering effects of one drought event onto another the temporal shift approach is heavily dependent on the observed characteristics fig 7 demonstrates that longer drought events are made of smaller sub droughts this complicates the issue of determining which characteristics of the run to observe choosing the largest peaks as in this study is a straightforward and universally applicable strategy however the rapid responses of sedi and sri to spi indicate that it could be possible to pair sub peaks in those indices this requires further research to improve justification of which peaks to pair our analysis demonstrates that hydrological expansion before meteorological expansion is possible so simply choosing the next subsequent sub peak may not be logical 4 conclusion the framework proposed in this paper is among the first to attempt to determine the spatial propagation time with higher sub monthly precision for sub continental regions this method leverages recently developed high resolution remote sensing data to apply the run theory to determine the propagation time for individual drought events the framework was applied to propagation in runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture droughts to provide hydrological context for different propagation times in some events relating to runoff and evapotranspiration deficits hydrological drought persists and even increases despite precipitation events indicating that precipitation alone does not always drive hydrological drought events the varying lag or lead times for evapotranspiration and runoff drought reflect that many other factors impact these processes aside from precipitation for example land cover soil type temperature and humidity and that these factors give important contextual information about how drought develops in contrast soil moisture drought quite consistently shows a delayed response to meteorological conditions a reflection of the prominent role that precipitation plays in root zone soil moisture levels and the strong dependence on soil moisture from the previous day the temporal shift can be understood as the interval during which the affected area of one hydrological variable s deficit responds to another or the spatial propagation time in contrast the traditional correlation analysis may describe propagation of other drought elements such as intensity however the assumption of spatial uniformity inherent from the correlation analysis may not be valid for sub continental and continental scale regions and can result in poorly correlated results moreover the results of the temporal shift analyses demonstrate that the correlation method s assumption of precipitation driven drought may not always hold in this context the temporal shift method presents key advantages over the correlation analysis such as consideration of spatial variability precision different drivers and ease of interpretation while the framework in this study presents new clarity into drought propagation through different hydrologic variables it requires resolution of several challenges the uncertainty in standardized index calculation for example should be reduced with longer periods of observation further investigation should advise considerations on what characteristics of a run are most descriptive for determining propagation advanced drought identification techniques can reduce interference of potentially unrelated events during the analysis the standardization of such algorithms will prove incredibly useful for application of this method in different studies however the novel application of a run theory analysis on univariate standardized drought indices calculated on a daily scale presents new

4082,of particular importance in a world of increasing water scarcity is the temporal and spatial relationship between a shortage in rainfall meteorological drought and a shortage in available water or hydrological drought propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought should be calculated at a higher sub monthly temporal resolution with considerations for spatial expansion a new framework for propagation time calculation from one index to another is established that uses the run theory high resolution remote sensing data on a daily time step the framework is demonstrated using standardized drought indices representing precipitation runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture in the central asian subcontinent to measure the temporal shift propagation time in affected drought area bringing a new perspective to contemporary drought analysis several variables from the water cycle are chosen to provide hydrological context for different propagation times correlation analyses for propagation time are shown to be ambiguous in interpretation and precision when compared to the temporal shift which is clearly defined and calculated on a daily time step moreover the results of temporal shift analyses indicate that deficits in evapotranspiration and runoff can precede deficits in precipitation while soil moisture deficit almost always follows highlighting the effects of additional influencing factors aside from precipitation on types of hydrological drought while it is limited by current understanding of drought definition techniques availability and quality of remote sensing products and selection of characteristics for observation use of the temporal shift over the correlation analysis provides a sub monthly estimate of drought propagation time that may prove useful for detailed analyses particularly in rapidly developing flash drought events keywords drought propagation time hydrological drought standardized indices remote sensing 1 introduction drought is commonly understood as a shortage of water for an extended duration however despite decades of research there are still many questions about what precisely should be considered drought scientists have studied drought primarily through drought indices that attempt to quantify degrees of drought using different observed variables and calculation methods which are usually defined in three dimensions space time and intensity drought can be classified based on impact as meteorological hydrological agricultural or socioeconomic drought hao and singh 2015 zargar et al 2011 more recent drought classification types include flash drought commonly understood as a rapid intensification of dryness due to increased evapotranspiration resulting in drought lisonbee et al 2021 otkin et al 2018 pendergrass et al 2020 and ecological drought crausbay et al 2017 which describes water deficits that affect ecosystem functions and services in the environment meteorological drought indices can be only reliant on precipitation such as in the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 while other meteorological indices such as the modified spi variant the standard precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei beguería et al 2014 and the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 can include the effects of evapotranspiration using temperature inputs mishra and singh 2010 zargar et al 2011 hydrological drought broadly describes shortages in surface and subsurface water van loon 2015 such as water levels in lakes and discharge in rivers this could include soil moisture which depending on the researcher is also considered an agricultural drought indicator mishra and singh 2010 van loon 2015 zargar et al 2011 it is generally assumed that these different types of drought can affect each other but that ultimately meteorological drought is considered the driving force van loon 2015 zargar et al 2011 many contemporary studies seek to understand how types of droughts move from one to the other guo et al 2020 huang et al 2017 jehanzaib et al 2019 orth and destouni 2018 wang et al 2016 xu et al 2019 with particular importance on spatio temporal characteristics guo et al 2018a guo et al 2018b mishra and singh 2011 orth and destouni 2018 one such improvement is the need to identify the propagation time or the amount of time it takes for effects of a drought event to appear in a different type of drought the successful management of water resources in the impending climate change crisis demands improvement in prediction and identification of hydrological extreme events such as floods and droughts making an understanding of this propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought a critical priority model based analyses of drought propagation have been attempted on the catchment scale tallaksen et al 2009 van loon et al 2012 while useful such catchment scale studies are restrained by local influencing factors like topography and are therefore limited in their ability for generalization continental and sub continental studies are therefore necessary to understand propagation mechanics and trends in an increasingly warmer world large study regions pose new problems the broad range of catchment types in a continental scale region mean that potential models must be selected with care to ensure representation of key processes trambauer et al 2013 however many regions of the world have insufficient data to support such detailed physically or semi physically based models especially in low flow regions making it necessary to investigate statistical methods for identifying drought van loon 2015 current approaches to approximate propagation time generally involve a correlation analysis between two indices calculated at different time scales correlations have previously been calculated between indices for comparative analyses mishra and singh 2010 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 shukla and wood 2008 but barker et al 2016 were among the first to explicitly use it as a method to calculate propagation time since then their claim of a connection between correlated time scales and propagation time have been used in several studies gevaert et al 2018 huang et al 2017 jehanzaib et al 2019 wu et al 2021 xu et al 2019 though the interpretation of this relation in other words the derivation of the approximate propagation time from the highest correlated time scales is still unclear for example barker et al 2016 mention that it provides an indication of the time where the spi accumulation period with the strongest correlation with the standardized streamflow index of one month ssi 1 was used as an indicator for drought propagation it is unclear how this indicator should be understood if the hydrological index time scale is not 1 month studies using this connection do not provide detailed interpretation or analysis of it huang et al 2017 wu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 correlation analyses also lack the ability to describe characteristics of drought such as spatial extent onset and peak moreover their application in large study areas is limited the correlation between precipitation and streamflow at an outlet may provide an idea of the relationship between those variables but does not describe the spatial variability within that region a comparison of three propagation time techniques the correlation method a run theory method and a non linear response method by wu et al 2021 shows that there is little concurrence between results from current methods indicating that further development and innovation in this field is necessary there have been few if any attempts to calculate propagation time with higher sub monthly precision which would improve understanding of drought development and recovery time series analyses for this are possible mishra and singh 2011 but the success of such studies is as in most fields of hydrology limited by observed data the widespread availability of coarser monthly data results in analyses that lack precision on a sub monthly scale while such a scale might be relevant for multi year slowly developing drought events the recent recognition of rapidly developing flash drought events will require sub monthly analyses ideally daily to sufficiently describe these processes otkin et al 2018 pendergrass et al 2020 recent advances in remote sensing technology have enabled analysis of hydrological processes in increasingly finer temporal and spatial resolution particularly in low data catchments across the globe but these high resolution products have not yet been applied for drought propagation time calculation of propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought also remains complex due to the multivariate nature of drought many researchers have discussed the inability of any single index to properly capture drought hao and aghakouchak 2013 hao and singh 2015 li et al 2017 rajsekhar et al 2015 wang et al 2016 streamflow and runoff are commonly used as hydrologic indices barker et al 2016 mishra and singh 2010 shukla and wood 2008 van loon 2015 zargar et al 2011 however other hydrological variables in conjunction with precipitation can provide more insight into changes in runoff hao and aghakouchak 2013 hao and singh 2015 rajsekhar et al 2015 precedent soil moisture conditions are a strong indicator for runoff van loon 2015 likewise evapotranspiration can greatly affect soil moisture conditions otkin et al 2018 pendergrass et al 2020 van loon 2015 and is often monitored alongside precipitation via indices like spi and spei bayissa et al 2018 beguería et al 2014 nicolai shaw et al 2017 spinoni et al 2019 zargar et al 2011 zhu et al 2016 thus soil moisture and evapotranspiration have been included in multivariate studies for their relevance in the hydrologic cycle keyantash and dracup 2004 li et al 2017 nicolai shaw et al 2017 because drought is multivariate and complex an analysis of propagation time should also be multivariate and complex studying precipitation runoff soil moisture and evapotranspiration in parallel could provide hydrological context for propagation time water resources management decisions are influenced by the availability and monitoring of surface water which is a primary victim of hydrological drought van loon 2015 van loon and van lanen 2012 wang et al 2016 proper responses to hydrological drought propagation however require a holistic and multivariate approach to understand the influence factors behind propagation time in this study our objectives are twofold first to establish a new framework for investigating propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought to overcome the limitations of the correlation method and second to compare the new methods with previously established methods for further understanding of the relationship between highest correlated drought time scales we use one drought index representing meteorological drought and three drought indices reflecting hydrological drought to contextualize the reasons behind different propagation times these objectives are part of a larger effort to understand spatial and temporal drought propagation 2 methodology 2 1 study area central asia the study area central asia fig 1 is an arid to semi arid sub continental region consisting of countries specifically kazakhstan uzbekistan kyrgyzstan turkmenistan tajikistan and the xinjiang province in northwest china with strong dependencies on agriculture precipitation in this region is dominated by snow in the higher mountainous regions in the winter while hot and dry conditions prevail in the summer drought conditions occur regularly and can stretch across the entire region with aggravated effects from poor water distribution desertification salinization and unsustainable land use practices patrick 2017 stream gage data is scarce making analysis of hydrological conditions difficult without the use of remote sensing technology much of the study area is dominated by deserts and sparsely vegetated steppes klein et al 2012 yang et al 2014 forests exist in the mountainous regions of tajikistan and kyrgyzstan and in the northern parts of kazakhstan where more steady precipitation falls throughout the year as well as in areas closer to the seas and lakes little land is cultivated outside of these regions irrigated cropland is sparse mostly near the various water bodies and mountains which act as freshwater reservoirs during the dry months of the year 2 2 the temporal shift drought analysis framework the proposed framework in this paper is an approach to finding propagation time with sub monthly timescales from meteorological drought to hydrological drought fig 2 this approach uses the run theory to describe the propagation through different types of drought in space and time its usefulness is demonstrated in this study using three different hydrological variables representing different parts of the water balance equation runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture the method is as follows 1 this method is concerned with finding the spatial propagation time the difference in time between maximum spatial extent in different drought variables thus a daily fine scale remote sensing product for each variable is required this study uses a spatial resolution of 0 25 by 0 25 though coarser spatial resolutions can be applied 2 a univariate standardized index is then calculated for each 0 25 by 0 25 pixel and each variable over the record creating several one for each variable time series of drought intensity for each pixel observing the most rapid changes as this study aimed to do required the use of one month time scales for all indices 3 these times series are used to define meteorological drought events however there is no universal definition of drought events lloyd hughes 2013 mishra and singh 2010 van loon 2015 zargar et al 2011 for this study we use a run theory filter but different drought definition methods can be substituted if it is possible to identify every pixel undergoing drought conditions at any time step 4 for each event selected for analysis the run theory with intensity standardized index 1 area number of adjacent pixels and duration thresholds is used to reconstruct the spatial expansion of the event 5 the temporal shifts were then calculated between the peak times or the time at which the most pixels experience drought between each hydrologic index and the spi 1 t shift t hydro m a x t meteo m a x this temporal shift reflects the response time propagation time of maximum hydrological drought area to maximum meteorological drought area if the peak in the hydrologic index occurs before the spi i e the shift is negative it is considered a lead time whereas if it occurs in the hydrological index first i e the shift is positive it is considered a lag time the definition of characteristics to determine temporal shift can affect the outcome choosing only the absolute maximum spi peak time may not be as descriptive as choosing the individual peaks however choosing the individual peaks is also problematic because it would then be difficult to ascribe hydrologic peaks to a particular spi peak since the number of peaks is often unequal we therefore calculate temporal shift based on the absolute maximums in the observation window as they are the most easily identifiable characteristics 2 2 1 selected drought indices standardized indices use a fitted probability distribution to calculate the number of standard deviations a value is from the average mckee et al 1993 a technique that is applicable across different variables and produces meaningful easily interpreted results this makes standardized indices reasonable choices for cross variable comparisons farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 hao and aghakouchak 2013 moreover many studies suggest using a variety of hydrological indicators hao and singh 2015 li et al 2017 rajsekhar et al 2015 such as pairings of streamflow and soil moisture to represent different aspects of the hydrologic cycle to this end this study utilizes a total of four standardized and univariate indices spi as a meteorological index and hydrological indices sri sedi and ssmi hereafter referred to collectively as si to evaluate the propagation of drought in different stages of the water cycle these indices were calculated using the following remote sensing data sets from the period february 1 2003 to december 31 2018 on a daily time step at a resolution of 0 25 by 0 25 table 1 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 measures the anomaly in precipitation and has been recommended by the world meteorological organization as a primary index to characterize such drought hayes et al 2011 it was calculated using persiann cdr precipitation data braithwaite et al 2015 nguyen et al 2019 which is based on satellite observations the standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 measures the anomaly in generated runoff which includes both surface runoff and baseflow and is not routed through a river network runoff is therefore inclusive of processes that moderate the hydrologic response such as snow accumulation and melt and is less sensitive than the spi in shorter timescales longer time scales e g 12 months despite their higher correlations with longer scale spi are not recommended as they risk integrating values that are beyond the effects of normal hydrologic responses shukla and wood 2008 the sri was calculated using the total surface runoff surface qs and subsurface runoff qsb excluding snowmelt qsm from the gldas v2 2 catchment land surface model li et al 2018 li et al 2019 which is simulated based on meteorological forcing with data assimilation from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi vicente serrano et al 2018 measures the evaporative deficit ed anomaly where ed is the difference between the potential evapotranspiration pet and the actual evapotranspiration aet this definition quantifies the drought stress primarily as lack of water consumed by plants among other factors and has low sensitivity to the methodology used to calculate aet sedi is characterized as a short timescale drought index with sensitivity to high frequency climate variations with intended applications in crop and vegetative drought assessment vicente serrano et al 2018 this was calculated using global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 3a products specifically the actual evapotranspiration e and potential evapotranspiration ep martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 gleam 3 3a is based on both satellite and reanalysis datasets the standardized soil moisture index ssmi aghakouchak 2014 measures the deficit anomaly in soil moisture accumulated soil moisture deficit is shown to be more persistent than precipitation deficit has a high autocorrelation factor indicating strong reliance on previous values and is less sensitive to rapid developments resulting in delayed responses to precipitation aghakouchak 2014 hao and aghakouchak 2013 nicolai shaw et al 2017 2016 and potentially more persistent drought this was calculated using gleam v3 3a root zone soil moisture data martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 because the goal of the study is to investigate the propagation time of drought as it expands in space data is required on sub monthly time scales with a spatial resolution that does not sacrifice detail future studies may substitute similar datasets of finer or coarser spatial resolution based on availability however records at a daily time step are highly recommended for the successful application of the method proposed in this paper while many standardized indices require 30 years of data to reliably fit a probability distribution certain empirical plotting positions such as the one used in this study have demonstrated acceptable quality with a sample size of less than 20 gringorten 1963 these can be considered suitable substitutions until enough data is available 2 2 1 1 calculation of drought indices the standardized drought analysis toolbox the variety of viable distribution curves for standardized indices represents a challenge for computationally efficient calculations that are justifiable across parameters bayissa et al 2018 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 hao and aghakouchak 2013 stagge et al 2015 the method proposed in the standardized drought analysis toolbox sdat eliminates these drawbacks by calculating standardized indices based on the empirical probability which produces similarly valid results in spi calculation compared to values calculated using the currently accepted probability distributions farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 the sdat uses the empirical gringorten plotting position to find the probability of occurrence of an observation 2 p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 i is the rank of the observation when ordered from smallest to largest and n is the number of observations gringorten 1963 the resulting probability is used instead of fitted probability distribution functions to calculate the standardized index via the normal inverse 3 si ϕ 1 p more details on the sdat method can be found in farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 in arid and semiarid regions like central asia where little to no rainfall or runoff is expected most of the year it is particularly important to consider the effects of time steps where the accumulated precipitation or runoff is zero as it increases in frequency the zero data condition becomes increasingly problematic because it is impossible for a drier precipitation or runoff value than zero to occur using the probability of its occurrence whether via empirical or fitted distributions results in an increasingly higher si this would falsely imply that the zero rainfall condition is wetter than usual to compensate for this error stagge et al 2015 demonstrated that using a piecewise function with the weibull non exceedance probability to calculate the center of probability mass of multiple zeros results in more statistically meaningful si values in this study we modify the sdat source to accommodate zero data occurrences as in stagge et al 2015 to calculate each of the standardized indices in table 1 the inclusion of the weibull non exceedance probability which uses the number of zero data occurrences n0 to calculate the probability center of mass results in a piecewise function to calculate the probability 4 p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 f o r x 0 n 0 1 2 n 1 f o r x 0 we also modify the sdat to accommodate daily scale remote sensing data fig 3 while commonly calculated for 12 months in a year the flexibility of the standardized indicator algorithm makes it possible to calculate these indices for every day of the year values for each day in the accumulation period the time scale leading up to and including the current day are added months are assumed to have 30 days each an accumulation period for a three month period for example would be the previous 90 days with these adjustments to the source code the total sum of the observed variable for the accumulation period is calculated then compared with the same day on a 365 day return period using the combined weibull non exceedance probability and empirical gringorten plotting position the recommended dataset length for most standardized indices is 30 years at a monthly time step which should be sufficient to gather enough data to avoid misleading probabilities mckee et al 1993 stagge et al 2015 the use of the gringorten empirical plotting position similarly recommends sample sizes of 20 or more in this context 20 years of data or more but can still produce adequate results with fewer data points gringorten 1963 this length and quality of record is currently not possible for all remote sensing products especially on such fine temporal and spatial resolutions thus the calculation uncertainty of the probability and resulting standardized index is noted but currently unavoidable however further development of daily scale methods and analyses despite these challenges will be necessary to investigate seasonal to sub seasonal flash drought events pendergrass et al 2020 2 3 definition of drought events using the run theory the run theory was first adapted for use in analysis of drought by yevjevich 1967 to describe large continental hydrologic droughts this theory defines a drought event as a period or run over which the observation of a variable meets a minimum threshold in an area depending on what parameters or approaches are selected additional factors should be considered this application allows identification of descriptors such as starting time duration and peak time making possible the calculation of different temporal shifts despite frequent usage of the run theory for drought composite analyses keyantash and john 2002 tallaksen et al 2009 van loon et al 2012 zhu et al 2016 it has very seldom if ever been used to calculate drought propagation time on a sub monthly scale to determine and define drought events for analysis we employ a run theory algorithm which exists separately from the proposed framework and uses a clustering algorithm similar to the one defined by andreadis et al 2005 a run begins when a cluster appears that breaches a spatial and intensity threshold however unlike in andreadis et al 2005 cluster cells must share sides cells sharing corners are not considered each day may have multiple clusters throughout the study area and these clusters may have oblong shapes if 30 consecutive days have drought clusters that grouping of days is considered a drought candidate then from each drought candidate an event is reconstructed by selecting the largest cluster and pulling from each day in the candidate all other clusters that contain at least one pixel from that largest cluster spatial thresholds vary between drought identification studies particularly in response to the size of the study area and the study objectives in their study over the conterminous u s andreadis et al 2005 used a minimum cluster size of 10 pixels on a 0 5 degree resolution roughly 30 000 km2 meanwhile a study over china by wang et al 2011 uses an area of 150 000 km2 to identify previous events when searching on a global context sheffield et al 2009 found that a minimum area of 500 000 km2 minimized improper drought event persistence across continents lloyd hughes 2012 uses this same area threshold in their study over europe however these studies searched for large drought events in this study we are interested in observing a drought event from its beginning to end regardless of its size future studies may use size thresholds that are more suited to their desired objectives thus we follow the example of andreadis et al 2005 each cluster must consist of an area larger than 10 pixels spatial threshold with spi 1 intensity threshold more sophisticated algorithms and theories exist for defining and identifying drought events and can be used with this proposed propagation time calculation as long as it is possible to find all pixels experiencing drought at each time step guo et al 2018b developed a three dimensional drought clustering system to define other events in central asia while li et al 2020 proposed a method unique to flash droughts that could be modified for normal droughts a study by bayissa et al 2018 showed that of six drought indices no single index could capture every onset in a basin in ethiopia indicating that more variables could be included in future improvements to drought identification algorithms however furthering the discussion of defining drought is beyond the scope of our study 2 4 the correlation method the classical approach to finding the propagation time from one index to another which is to find the highest correlated time scales was applied to individual drought events standardized indices at various time scales were considered for this index correlation analysis using the pearson correlation coefficient all indices and time scales were cropped to the maximum area extent and duration of each spi event the long medium short and very short events this ensured that we were only observing pixels that were involved in the drought event and compared exclusively during the duration of the event the pearson correlation coefficient was then calculated for each pixel in the event and filtered for only significant p 0 05 correlations and the median was calculated across the event s extent as the final value the median was chosen because of the sensitivity of the average to the existence of high correlations and anticorrelations which were present for individual pixels in the event this method is based on two assumptions first that the meteorological drought is the driver of hydrological drought and that the propagation time is the hydrological index time scale that is highest correlated in the literature this analysis is typically performed with the hydrological index fixed at one month si 1 with spi calculated at different time scales however correlations with si 1 can be inconclusive therefore we broadened the analysis to include correlations with si at different time scales to observe the effects of meteorological droughts on other types of drought it is necessary that the second index has a time scale that is less than or equal to the spi time scale si n spi m this is because of the way that the standardized indices are calculated a longer time scale means a longer period before the current day is considered that means that for an analysis showing the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought we should only include correlations for which the meteorological index includes more time than the hydrological index correlation analysis is commonly applied in research of all disciplines making its limitations well known schober et al 2018 taylor 1990 though there are commonly accepted ranges for goodness of fit criteria including correlation in the field of hydrological modeling they are typically applied for calibration and validation evaluation from this perspective then a selection of two well correlated time scales could mean a calibration of one index to another however such a perspective must also consider the risks of blindly choosing the highest correlated indices overfitting especially when considering the existence of several comparably high correlation coefficients there are additional issues specific to application of correlation analysis in propagation time because correlation between time series is independent of order it does not matter if the spi peaked before another index or vice versa an assumption must be made for which drought event comes first we assumed as many in the literature did that precipitation drought drives other forms of drought barker et al 2016 huang et al 2017 van loon 2015 xu et al 2019 hence propagation times calculated using the correlation method are assumed to be from meteorological drought to hydrological drought 3 results discussion 3 1 drought identification 3 1 1 drought events while a detailed discussion of the merits of a particular identification approach are beyond the scope of this paper it is still necessary to ensure that the results generally agree with historical drought conditions the run theory definition in this paper produced 21 unique drought events of varying lengths and maximum area extents table 2 of which seven loosely agree in time and space with events found in the european commission s development of a global drought observatory gdo spinoni et al 2019 identified droughts in this study are not expected to be in strong agreement with the literature due to different drought definition criteria the gdo uses both the spi and the spei at the 3 6 and 12 month levels between 1951 and 2016 and removed any drought events that did not last for at least two months that occurred too close to the end of a previous drought event and that did not grow sufficiently large spinoni et al 2019 in contrast our droughts are simply defined with a small spatial threshold a minimum length of 30 days and on a 1 month time scale with no further filtering criterion of particular importance was the identification of the 2008 2010 drought in central asia which was noted as one of the world s most extreme by several studies guo et al 2018a spinoni et al 2019 that this drought identification algorithm was able to identify key events allows for further analysis of its results most identified drought events were between 30 and 180 days drought events were then classified as very short short medium or long events based on their duration table 3 the largest drought of each length category was selected as a representative for further visual analysis of spatial and temporal propagation the largest events would have the most easily identifiable characteristics using this method since it is based on affected area larger events will have more exaggerated characteristics however this method can be applied for smaller events as well the maximum spatial extents of each representative event can be seen in fig 4 because this method aims to look at the spatial propagation time drought selection criteria must be able to consider the size of the drought event and be flexible enough to accommodate changing sizes plots of drought intensity averaged over the event s area fig 5 can demonstrate the relationships between the magnitude of different indices however this lacks the consideration of spatial variability as an average or even sum of values eventually assigns a single value to the study area intensity is therefore only applied in this study as a binary filter for determining if a cell is experiencing drought however because it is one of the main dimensions of drought future studies in spatial propagation may consider adding an additional factor for intensity 3 2 propagation time 3 2 1 correlation a heat map of statistically significant correlations between all relevant time scales for the representative events can be seen in fig 6 if the spi time scale that correlates the strongest to si 1 is the propagation time as many studies have assumed then the propagation times for sri would be 3 months for the very short event 1 month for the short event 1 month for the medium event and 1 month for the long event for ssmi it would be 6 months 3 months 3 months and 6 months respectively and for sedi it would be 6 months 1 month 3 months and 3 months the strength or lack thereof of the sedi correlations indicate that this analysis could be insufficient though the trend of higher correlations at longer timescales is consistent with the literature kim et al 2019 it is therefore difficult to decisively say that a single pair of highly correlated time scales is a propagation time rather a range of time scales could be considered furthermore as medians these values ignore the spatial variability of the catchment individual cells may have had extremely high correlation or anticorrelation that was lost when calculating the median value future investigation could discern why certain pixels had high correlation while others did not overall the highest correlated time scales for the very short event are spi 3 and sri 3 spi 6 and ssmi 3 and spi 6 and sedi 1 for the short event spi 1 and sri 1 spi 3 and ssmi 1 and spi 9 and sedi 9 for the medium event spi 9 and sri 9 spi 12 and ssmi 9 and spi 15 and sedi 15 and for the long event spi 12 and sri 12 spi 6 and ssmi 3 and spi 15 and sedi 12 despite the inclusion of more data points there is still no clear highest correlation in some of the drought events rather there are several high median correlation coefficients which could be similarly effective analyses of these pairs should consider however that longer time scales generally result in higher correlation as discussed in shukla and wood 2008 additional time scale considerations include relevancy to the index the sri and sedi are shorter time scale indices by virtue of their observed variable while evaporative deficits calculated over longer time scales can be indicative of agricultural productivity kim et al 2019 the extreme volatility of evaporative conditions can make it very useful at short time scales vicente serrano et al 2018 especially in cases of rapidly developing flash drought li et al 2020 generated runoff is a valuable index because generated runoff includes hydrological attenuating processes but time scales that are too long run the risk of including processes that are no longer relevant for current runoff shortages however this also depends on climate and precipitation regimes as precipitation as snowmelt could affect runoff generation later in the year shukla and wood 2008 root zone soil moisture observations however show high autocorrelation higher persistence and are less volatile aghakouchak 2014 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 nicolai shaw et al 2017 2016 here it could be important to consider longer time scales these considerations are not always reflected in the results in general as the length of the event increases the highest correlated time scales also increase this is rather expected for soil moisture drought as a persistence based drought index would presumably correlate higher at longer accumulation periods regardless of event length the supposedly short term nature of the sedi makes its highest correlated indices in all but the very short event surprising this could be the byproduct of increasing scale as shukla and wood 2008 noted since increasing the scale of the index smooths the resulting time series curves as the accumulation period increases the curves converge this could also be a reason why the sri s highest correlated time scales jump from sub seasonal to almost yearly scales in longer events 3 2 2 temporal shift final plots of each run theory analysis for the representative events can be seen in fig 7 with the corresponding temporal shifts in table 4 the spi area black is plotted for only the duration of the event while the hydrological time series include additional time windows for visual context only the very short drought event demonstrates a simple run of drought area with only one peak as expected the sri and sedi in this event seem to respond quickly to the increase in spi area while the ssmi lags in both spatial extent and time the short event shows more complexity as it expands and contracts during the duration of the event while the sri again shows quick responses to changes in spi and the ssmi a more muted response the sedi demonstrates surprising behavior by peaking while the spi event contracts the difference is also not a lag but a lead time from sri and sedi peaks to an spi peak such an expansion in area in a hydrologic index before a meteorological index signals that hydrological drought in various forms may not always be driven by rainfall deficit hydrological drought may as with many hydrologic phenomena be influenced by additional variables a finding corroborated by studies in flash drought ford and labosier 2017 mo and lettenmaier 2015 otkin et al 2018 these could be for example a heat wave flash drought causing an increase in evapotranspiration mo and lettenmaier 2015 and reducing generated runoff despite a precipitation event indicated by the decrease in spi a likely scenario in this study area this underscores the importance of a holistic view of drought no single index can capture all of these changes this complex behavior becomes more apparent in the medium length and long drought events these events are marked by strong successive signals that contract and almost disappear before expanding again indicating that long drought events can be a series of smaller drought events such signals could be broken into smaller drought events using for example a higher drought area threshold or a different clustering algorithm the results of temporal shift analyses for almost all identified events sorted by length category are summarized in fig 8 for clarity separate axes are used for each length category because standardized indices require a period of observation before the date of calculation this acts as a warm up period for calculation fig 3 for this warm up period the drought conditions are unknown thus it is unclear when the first observed drought event which begins at the beginning of the record actually begins and is therefore excluded from this analysis because of the potential skew on the data in general the range of temporal shifts increase in proportion to the length category this general increase is expected as a longer event length means potentially more drought subpeaks and therefore more chances for a larger area to occur closer inspection of the results by observed variable can assist the identification of factors influencing drought propagation in space and time the ssmi almost exclusively exhibits lag times the single exception is a short event that occurs almost immediately after a long event event 2 in table 2 soil moisture and the ssmi exhibits high autocorrelation aghakouchak 2014 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 in other words its current value is strongly dependent on historical values and changes slowly in comparison to the other hydrological variables in this study area long lag times are likely due to the lack of dense vegetation cover accelerating desertification and increasing evaporation from the bare soil li et al 2017 patrick 2017 however because root zone soil moisture shows high persistence aghakouchak 2014 nicolai shaw et al 2016 this could cause long drought development periods and a delayed peak recovery of deficits in the root zone will also take longer than surface soil moisture nicolai shaw et al 2017 the resultant persistent nature of ssmi in this study region could therefore mean that the beginning of the event as defined by the spi coincides with the preceding event s recovery and should be viewed critically while prevention of similar instances can be achieved using additional filters when determining drought in comparison the sri is less predictable as it can be either a lead or a lag time when it is a lead time it is within 20 days of an spi peak when it is a lag time however its duration is highly variable that its median remains close to zero is an indication of the strong relationship between runoff and precipitation though this could change as more events are analyzed the wide range of values reflects the impact that factors aside from precipitation such as land cover soil type and initial conditions can have on runoff generation increases in surface evaporation through high temperatures or low humidity for example could decrease the surface soil moisture dry antecedent conditions can decrease runoff from precipitation requiring more moisture to saturate the top soil layer before becoming runoff castillo et al 2003 kirchner 2009 this could create runoff deficits when decreases in spi would indicate a recovery period as in the short representative event fig 7 in general though the tendency of sri to have lag rather than lead times indicates that runoff drought propagates largely from precipitation drought like the sri the median sedi propagation time fluctuates however the sedi is even less predictable with a broader range of propagation times this is likely a reflection of the various factors on which evapotranspiration is dependent unlike soil moisture and runoff evapotranspiration and its deficit are not explicitly dependent on a precipitation input typical evapotranspiration estimation models use temperature humidity radiation and even vegetation cover as input in this context precipitation as available water provides an upper limit for evapotranspiration but is not one of the main influencing factors thus it can be said that evaporative deficits are influenced by but not necessarily derived from precipitation deficits these findings are consistent with recent literature on flash drought ford and labosier 2017 hobbins et al 2016 mo and lettenmaier 2015 otkin et al 2018 where precipitation is not identified as a main driver instead a combination of high temperatures low humidity and increased solar radiation are likely candidates for increases in evaporative deficits independent of precipitation ford and labosier 2017 mo and lettenmaier 2015 in contrast to the range trends in the precise propagation time as duration increases are not as straightforward a scatter plot of the temporal shift y axis and the event duration x axis is given in fig 9 in addition to the event excluded in the previous analysis two other events were excluded because they were the only two events that lasted more than 450 days 697 and 1015 days in length they can reasonably be considered outliers a linear regression analysis of the 18 remaining points indicates there is a slight trend in propagation time as drought duration increases however the low correlation indicates the length and temporal shift are largely unrelated it is important to note that the sample size is low thus further experimentation with this method is needed to reach a decisive conclusion on trends between drought length and propagation time 3 2 3 differences between the temporal shift and correlation methods the estimates from the temporal shift and correlation methods differ greatly indicating that they describe different processes the time scale correlation is the median of the correlations in all cells the drought affected area which effectively ignores the spatial variability of the study area in a continental scale study area like central asia this assumption of spatial uniformity is not valid even after narrowing down the region to specific drought areas such analysis demands a single correlation per drought which can extend over more than half the region fig 4 thus the correlation method is incapable of producing a spatial propagation time however because it is a comparison between two intensity time series it may describe the propagation of drought intensity aside from the validity of this spatial generalization the meaning of the highest correlated time scales is unintuitive the extraction of the propagation time from this method is still unclear moreover it would be an estimate on a monthly scale fig 6 in contrast the temporal shift analysis offers a more straightforward interpretation of propagation that includes a higher precision and consideration of spatial variability such precision is valuable when trying to find trends in propagation time which are necessary to develop a better understanding of propagation mechanics and for rapidly developing flash drought events where a monthly resolution would result in a significant lack of detail otkin et al 2018 pendergrass et al 2020 moreover runoff and evapotranspiration drought often preceded meteorological drought fig 8 indicating that the assumption of meteorological drought propagating into hydrological drought is not always valid thus the temporal shift method provides a clearer and finer resolution estimate of propagation time that avoids the problematic assumptions of the correlation method 3 2 4 limitations of the temporal shift a major limitation is the definition and selection of drought events though this is again a limitation that is not unique to this study in this study we do not consider the lingering effects of drought events that occur shortly after another which could potentially accelerate certain processes or affect the temporal shift an example of this is events 1 2 in table 2 which resulted in the sole negative temporal shift in ssmi other studies have used complex algorithms to refine selection of drought events to exclude such events with this filtering an application of the drought propagation time methods in this paper may produce clearer results as noted in yevjevich 1967 proper selection of a minimum threshold will also greatly affect results in other words a proper selection of drought events through filtering strategies and time windows for study can minimize the lingering effects of one drought event onto another the temporal shift approach is heavily dependent on the observed characteristics fig 7 demonstrates that longer drought events are made of smaller sub droughts this complicates the issue of determining which characteristics of the run to observe choosing the largest peaks as in this study is a straightforward and universally applicable strategy however the rapid responses of sedi and sri to spi indicate that it could be possible to pair sub peaks in those indices this requires further research to improve justification of which peaks to pair our analysis demonstrates that hydrological expansion before meteorological expansion is possible so simply choosing the next subsequent sub peak may not be logical 4 conclusion the framework proposed in this paper is among the first to attempt to determine the spatial propagation time with higher sub monthly precision for sub continental regions this method leverages recently developed high resolution remote sensing data to apply the run theory to determine the propagation time for individual drought events the framework was applied to propagation in runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture droughts to provide hydrological context for different propagation times in some events relating to runoff and evapotranspiration deficits hydrological drought persists and even increases despite precipitation events indicating that precipitation alone does not always drive hydrological drought events the varying lag or lead times for evapotranspiration and runoff drought reflect that many other factors impact these processes aside from precipitation for example land cover soil type temperature and humidity and that these factors give important contextual information about how drought develops in contrast soil moisture drought quite consistently shows a delayed response to meteorological conditions a reflection of the prominent role that precipitation plays in root zone soil moisture levels and the strong dependence on soil moisture from the previous day the temporal shift can be understood as the interval during which the affected area of one hydrological variable s deficit responds to another or the spatial propagation time in contrast the traditional correlation analysis may describe propagation of other drought elements such as intensity however the assumption of spatial uniformity inherent from the correlation analysis may not be valid for sub continental and continental scale regions and can result in poorly correlated results moreover the results of the temporal shift analyses demonstrate that the correlation method s assumption of precipitation driven drought may not always hold in this context the temporal shift method presents key advantages over the correlation analysis such as consideration of spatial variability precision different drivers and ease of interpretation while the framework in this study presents new clarity into drought propagation through different hydrologic variables it requires resolution of several challenges the uncertainty in standardized index calculation for example should be reduced with longer periods of observation further investigation should advise considerations on what characteristics of a run are most descriptive for determining propagation advanced drought identification techniques can reduce interference of potentially unrelated events during the analysis the standardization of such algorithms will prove incredibly useful for application of this method in different studies however the novel application of a run theory analysis on univariate standardized drought indices calculated on a daily scale presents new

4083,the second phase of the north america multi model ensemble nmme 2 provides globally available subseasonal to seasonal s2s precipitation forecasts with a daily resolution the s2s precipitation forecasts are getting increasing attention for their potentials in providing hydrometeorological forcing information for water resources planning at an extended range however the forecast skills of many existing s2s forecast products will significantly decrease when the lead time increases hindering their applicability for watershed scale hydrologic modeling therefore forecast validation and large scale evaluation are of great importance for water resources planning and hydrological applications in this study we comprehensively evaluate the s2s precipitation forecasts from the nmme 2 dataset over the contiguous united states conus and during the study period from 1982 to 2011 three aspects of precipitation forecast capabilities are compared and analyzed bias skill scores and the ability to predict extreme precipitation events the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism is used as ground truth reference differs from other regional forecast validation study we further examined and analyzed the dependences of nmme 2 precipitation forecast skills according to different seasonality geographical locations and lead times results show that the forecast biases are not sensitive to lead times but are seasonally dependent of all nmme 2 models overestimations are found in the western u s in cooler seasons while underestimations are observed in the central regions of the u s in warmer seasons the forecast skill of all individual nmme 2 models generally decreases as increases of lead times the simple model averaging sma of five nmme 2 models demonstrates a higher forecast skill than any individual nmme 2 models spatially the highest forecast skill scores are observed at coastal areas in the western u s with an one week lead time as compared to the historical resampled forecasts nmme 2 also shows better performance in predicting extreme precipitation events above 99 percentiles and below 1 percentiles with higher probability of detections and lower false alarm ratios the obtained results suggest the great potentials of nmme 2 precipitation forecasts in assisting ensemble hydrologic forecasts at the s2s scale over the conus keywords nmme 2 subseasonal to seasonal precipitation forecast conus forecast validation forecast bias extreme precipitation 1 introduction precipitation is one of the most important components in the hydrologic cycle sorooshian et al 2011 accurate and reliable precipitation forecasts with certain lead times could be beneficial in planning and managing social economic activities preventing financial and life losses from water related disasters akbari asanjan et al 2018 palmer 2002 different precipitation forecast products can be categorized by the available lead times such as short medium and long range forecast products at the short and or medium ranges i e 2 3 days and 7 10 days respectively numerical weather prediction nwp models can provide reliable and skillful forecasts globally bauer et al 2015 especially at the short and or medium ranges nwp models could generate skillful precipitation forecasts by taking advantages of the high predictability of rainfall from initial atmospheric states various types of observations and advanced data assimilation techniques however one common critique on the nwp model is that its forecast skill decreases rapidly and the associated forecast uncertainty increases dramatically when the forecast lead time extends two weeks and beyond alley et al 2019 berner et al 2011 hamill and juras 2006 lin et al 2005 palmer et al 2004 ritter and geleyn 1992 shrestha et al 2013 sun et al 2014a this is because nwp model heavily relies on the initial states of atmosphere and the predictability coming from the initial states dissipates rapidly over lead time at long ranges i e months seasons years and even decades earth system models esms and general circulation models gcms coupled with dynamic oceanic and land surface components are reliable alternatives both esms and gcms produce more skillful and informative climate outlooks than the nwp models at longer forecast lead times because by design they are able to incorporate both the local land surface conditions and sea surface temperature sst circulations into the computation for future weather and climate predictions vitart et al 2017 a forecast gap lies in the transitional period between the medium range weather forecasts and longer range seasonal climate outlooks this transitional period is also referred to as the subseasonal to seasonal s2s timescale which defines a specific time range beyond 10 days and up to 30 days into the future white et al 2017 at the s2s time range the forecast lead time is sufficiently long that most of the predictability from the initial conditions would be lost but it is also too short for the variability of the ocean to have a strong influence upon local weather vitart et al 2017 this unique physical feature of weather predictability made precipitation forecast at the s2s range notoriously challenging and also makes s2s forecast often considered as a desert of predictability white et al 2017 the s2s hydrometeorological forecasts are important information and have a great potential in providing seamless streamflow and flood forecasts at the s2s range traditionally river forecast centers and weather service centers over the globe issue probabilistic seasonal streamflow forecasts forced by seasonal and or monthly climate outlooks wood and lettenmaier 2006 however this kind of seasonal streamflow forecasts can only reflect an increased or decreased risks of flooding but do not have the ability to predict floods at the s2s range meanwhile the s2s hydrometeorological forecasts provide an opportunity in assisting streamflow forecasts which not only reflects the flooding risks but also provides additional information regarding the timing frequency or severity of potential floods within seasons white et al 2015 accurate s2s hydrometeorological forecasts could also help the operation of reservoirs in scheduling optimal water supplies and hydropower generations given foreseeable dry and wet water conditions sankarasubramanian et al 2009 yang et al 2020 2021 despite the potential benefits of s2s ensemble forecasts in water energy system operation ding et al 2021 it also appears to be a new research area to extend our existing knowledge about weather and climate forecasts in different space and time vitart and robertson 2018 previous studies concluded that the predictability of s2s forecast comes from several sources including initial atmospheric conditions cohen et al 2010 stockdale et al 2015 initial land surface soil moisture asoka and mishra 2015 guo et al 2011 initial snow conditions thomas et al 2016 and initial sea surface temperatures chelton and wentz 2005 in some recent studies the planetary scale oceanic patterns are found to be the main predictability source of s2s forecasts and these interconnection climate indices include the el niño southern oscillation enso madden julian oscillation mjo quasi biennial oscillation qbo nardi et al 2020 pan et al 2019b yang et al 2017 there are many existing efforts and programs that focus on the hydrometeorological forecasts at the s2s timescales such as the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the environment canada ec the japan meteorological agency jma the china meteorological administration cma etc each of those agencies uses different coupled gcms and esms to obtain the precipitation forecasts at the s2s range with different temporal and spatial resolutions the north america multi model ensemble nmme is a multi agency initiated and collaborative program that provides a variety of hydrometeorological forecasts at the s2s timescale kirtman et al 2014a the nmme consists of the outputs from multiple coupled gcms and esms each providing independent retrospective forecasts hereafter referred to as hindcasts and real time forecasts the nmme phase 1 project nmme 1 was initially launched in 2014 and further transitioned into phase 2 nmme 2 in more recent years both nmme 1 and nmme 2 datasets provide monthly initialized hindcasts and forecasts with lead time up to 12 months the major advancement of nmme 2 over the nmme 1 dataset is the provision of dynamically downscaled forecasts in which the new dataset provides daily precipitation forecasts at the s2s range while the outputs from the nmme 1 dataset only provides forecasts with monthly resolution kirtman et al 2014b there is a good number of existing research that investigated the quality and accuracy of the hydrometeorological forecasts from nmme 1 dataset for example becker et al 2014 and krakauer 2019 evaluated the skill of precipitation and temperature forecasts from nmme 1 globally and they found that the simple model averaging sma of nmme 1 models shows better forecast skill than any individual nmme 1 models and the forecast skills vary depending on geographical regions and seasons similar evaluation studies upon nmme 1 monthly hydrometeorological forecasts have been carried out in different regions for example cash et al 2019 observed significant systematic error in both precipitation and temperature forecasts from nmme 1 in two southern asia regions and found the highest forecast skills are observed at the shortest lead times shukla et al 2019 found the skill of precipitation forecasts from nmme 1 is higher during enso years over east africa slater et al 2019 evaluated the skill of precipitation and temperature forecasts from nmme 1 over seven geological regions of the continental united states slater et al 2019 found the highest forecast skill is generally observed at the shortest lead time and the performances of nmme 1 forecast are spatially and seasonally dependent the study from slater et al 2019 also consistently shows that higher forecast skills can be gained by averaging multiple nmme 1 models and the skill of hydrometeorological forecast from nmme 1 quickly declines to marginal levels as lead time increases to address the low forecast accuracies issue associated with the nmme 1 dataset many follow on studies focused on improving precipitation forecast from nmme 1 dataset for example slater et al 2017 deployed different multi model weighting techniques to improve the skill of nmme 1 monthly precipitation forecast across europe xu et al 2019 applied several machine learning and wavelet approaches to bias correct and downscale the monthly precipitation forecast from the nmme 1 dataset over china khajehei et al 2018 developed a bayesian ensemble approach based on a copula function to bias correct the nmme 1 monthly precipitation forecast over the conus as compared to the studies on nmme 1 dataset there is fewer studies that investigate the quality of s2s precipitation forecasts from the newer nmme 2 dataset among a limited number of studies wanders and wood 2016 evaluated the precipitation forecast from nmme 2 globally on a bi weekly basis by aggregating the evaluation result into three global regions including the tropics extratropic and northern latitudes they found the forecasts skill decreases over lead time as well as performance discrepancies between different nmme 2 models zhou and kim 2018 evaluated the ability of nmme 2 in predicting the wintertime atmospheric rivers ar and moisture flux over the northeast pacific in response to enso they found nmme 2 dataset has significant regional biases in anomalous landfalling ar frequency which underlining challenges in forecasting regional precipitation events more recently baker et al 2019 studied the precipitation forecasts of climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 from the nmme 2 dataset over the entire conus on a bi weekly basis and they found the forecast skill of cfsv2 decreases over lead time rapidly but the forecast biases are insensitive to lead times guo and nie 2020 evaluated the daily precipitation forecasts of cfsv2 over east china their result indicates the raw precipitation forecasts of cfsv2 are substantially biased and the extreme precipitation events over east china have been underestimated by cfsv2 becker et al 2020 studied the performances of precipitation forecasts from nmme 2 globally however becker et al 2020 aggregated the daily forecast values from nmme 2 into monthly values since their study focus on seasonal scale and is more focused on proving the improvement of forecast quality corresponding to the iteration of nmme models to summarize the existing studies focusing on precipitation forecasts from nmme 2 existing research either 1 targeted the evaluation of nmme 2 at a spatial scale that is too large to provide a useful reference for regional hydrologic studies or 2 are only focusing on monthly forecast values and overlook the s2s forecasts from nmme 2 or 3 have only included a certain member of nmme 2 into the study and did not comprehensively evaluate all nmme 2 members as a whole with the consideration of lead times seasonality and precipitation s geographical characteristics thus more inclusive and comprehensive evaluation of the s2s precipitation forecast from the nmme 2 data across conus is still critically needed according to the conclusion of many existing studies although the evaluation results of the seasonal precipitation forecast from nmme over conus may have some consistency and similarities it is still unknown how exactly does precipitation forecast from different nmme 2 models perform at the s2s range over the entire conus in addition the merit of the s2s precipitation forecast from nmme 2 in forecasting extreme events has not been verified at large scales and these missing pieces of research in return limits further hydrologic applications of the nmme 2 dataset since potential maximum streamflow prediction is one of the most important and desired outcomes of hydrologic forecasts at the s2s range day 1985 gobena and gan 2010 to fill the gap as well as to provide valuable reference information and knowledge for future hydrologic research on nmme 2 this study aims to answer the following research questions 1 how does the s2s precipitation forecast from nmme 2 perform over the entire conus 2 what are the differences between s2s precipitation forecasts from different nmme 2 models in terms of their performances over conus 3 what is the forecast skill of the individual nmme 2 models at different regions over the conus 4 do certain nmme 2 models outperform others with the consideration of certain regions lead times and seasons and 5 what are the nmme 2 model s performances in predicting extreme precipitation events over the conus to answer these research questions in this study we evaluated the s2s precipitation forecasts from five nmme 2 models and their grand ensemble i e all five nmme 2 models as a whole set is collected and analyzed over the conus the study period is from 1982 to 2011 all five nmme 2 models selected in this study provide daily s2s precipitation forecast except for the cfsv2 which was already studied by baker et al 2019 the an81d dataset generated from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism is used as the reference dataset the forecast bias and forecast skill are examined since forecast bias and poor forecast skill are two major obstacles in applying precipitation forecasts to hydrologic simulations zalachori et al 2012 in addition the ability of s2s precipitation forecasts from nmme 2 in predicting extreme precipitation events are further evaluated and compared to the benchmark performances of the historical resampled precipitation forecasts during our evaluation study the forecast lead time is considered on a weekly basis i e from week 1 to week 4 to cover the whole s2s range comparison and analysis on the forecast data quality are further conducted over nine national centers for environmental information ncei climate regions and four seasons which are more inclusive and detailed as compared to the existing nmme 2 evaluation studies mentioned above for example this study extends the existing studies from baker et al 2019 and wanders and wood 2016 specifically our study conducts a more representative validation of five nmme 2 models emphasizing on the forecast performance evaluation at the weekly scale and over the entire conus in other words our study provides a temporally finer and spatially larger evaluation as compared to that from baker et al 2019 and wanders and wood 2016 lastly besides the traditional evaluation of forecast biases and skill scores we also included extensive validation experiments focusing on the extreme rainfall performance and compared the forecast accuracy on different percentile thresholds of dry and wet extremes the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present data and study regions section 3 describes the evaluation metrics and methodologies sections 4 and 5 present the results and discussions respectively the main conclusions and findings are summarized in section 6 2 data and study regions there is a total of seven different models available in the nmme 2 dataset among them we select five nmme 2 models that provide daily precipitation forecasts covering the s2s range table 1 presents the basic information of the selected five nmme 2 models including the canadian coupled climate model version 3 and 4 cancm3 cancm4 from the canada s climate model center cmc the community climate system model 4 0 ccsm4 from the national center for atmospheric research ncar the forecast oriented low ocean resolution model using parameter set b florb01 from the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl and the goddard earth observing system version 5 model geos5 from the national astronautics and space administration nasa each nmme 2 model generates ensemble forecasts through perturbed physics strategy and or under different initial conditions the cancm3 cancm4 ccsm4 and geos5 models consist of 10 ensemble members and the florb01 model consists of 12 ensemble members the study period was set from 01 01 1982 to 12 31 2011 30 years which overlaps with the hindcast forecast period for all five nmme 2 models all nmme 2 hindcast forecast datasets are available at https www earthsystemgrid org search html project nmme the daily precipitation dataset an81d generated from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model hereafter referred to as prism is used as a reference precipitation dataset in this study the prism data is available from 1981 to near present in gridded format with a spatial resolution of 4 km 0 04 across the conus the prism data combines surface observations with a digital elevation model to account for the orographic enhancement of precipitation in addition to rain gauge records the prism data also incorporates the radar measurement into account when producing corrected data over the central and eastern u s regions daly and bryant 2013 since the prism dataset does not incorporate assimilated information from numerical weather forecasting models or meteorological reanalysis it represents an independent dataset suitable for hydrologic studies radcliffe and mukundan 2017 numerous hydrologic studies have used prism precipitation data as a reliable reference for model evaluation bias correction for remotely sensed precipitation estimation products and forecast verification studies ashfaq et al 2016 oubeidillah et al 2014 prat and nelson 2015 widmann and bretherton 2000 figure 1 shows nine different climate regions across the conus which are defined by the national centers for environmental information ncei karl and koss 1984 these nine climatic regions separate the conus into northwest west north central east north central northeast central west southwest south and southeast regions within the neci climate regions the sierra nevada mountain and the rocky mountain are across the northwest west southeast and west north central regions and the appalachian mountain covers parts of the northeast and southeast regions in this study we evaluate the precipitation forecast of the nmme 2 at each pixel across the conus and obtain the spatially averaged results over these nine climate regions for regional analysis in this study we analyze the results based on these nine climatic regions because rainfall presents different physical and dynamical features and patterns over different regions over the conus i e orographic elevation induced rainfall frontal precipitation and or convective systems 3 methodology procedures and evaluation metrics in this study we first collected the nmme 2 precipitation forecasts and prism dataset and then conducted initial data pre processing the nmme 2 precipitation forecasts are produced at the beginning of each month and the forecast lead time are up to 1 year 365 or 366 days into the future we truncated all collected nmme 2 precipitation forecasts to 28 days 4 weeks and then aggregated them into weekly forecast values e g day 1 to 7 as of week 1 day 8 to 14 as of week 2 day 15 to 21 as of week 3 and day 22 to 28 as of week 4 both nmme 2 and prism datasets were re gridded into 0 25 resolution using the same nearest neighbor method for consistency the grand ensemble of all selected nmme 2 models i e a total of 52 different realizations in table 1 was also constructed after the data pre processing we also re organized the collected precipitation forecasts from both individual nmme 2 models and the 52 member grand ensemble into different seasons i e december january february djf march april may mam june july august jja and september october november son in other words the evaluation experiment comprehensively considers the forecast skill and model bias by different climate regions forecast lead times as well as the seasonality over the conus in this study we use the commonly accepted approaches of pixel based and spatial forecast evaluation metrics four evaluation metrics are included i e the percentage bias pbias anomaly correlation coefficient acc quantile probability of detection qpod and quantile false alarm ratios qfar the pbias and acc of i the ensemble means of individual nmme 2 models and ii the sma of the grand ensemble are computed to evaluate forecast bias and forecast skill quantitatively the qpod and qfar metrics are used to evaluate the capabilities of individual nmme 2 model in predicting extreme precipitation events at weekly scales the evaluation of extreme precipitation is as important as forecast bias and forecast skill because the s2s precipitation forecasts potentially serve as inputs to the ensemble streamflow prediction esp approach which are the official approach used in each national weather service s river forecast centers for estimating river stages and potential floods over the conus within the esp framework the extreme streamflow values associated with extreme precipitation events are one of the most important outcomes regarding flood predictions day 1985 gobena and gan 2010 with this understanding in this study the ensemble spreads of individual nmme 2 models and the grand ensemble of five nmme 2 models are employed to compute the qpod and qfar for extreme precipitation evaluation while there is no golden standard for defining extreme precipitation events we chose 99 and 95 percentiles and 5 and 1 percentiles as the thresholds of extreme precipitation events corresponding to flood and drought events respectively note that we only present the qpod and qfar results for extreme events above 99 and below 1 in the main article for conciseness and the 95 and 5 events results are included in the supplementary material for interested readers detailed descriptions for the four employed evaluation metrics are presented as follows 3 1 percentage bias pbias the pbias measurement reflects the degree of the under and or over estimations of precipitation forecast that are vital for potential future hydrologic applications to quantify the bias pattern of nmme 2 precipitation forecasts over the conus the pbias of the ensemble means of single nmme 2 models and the sma of the grand ensemble are computed with equation 1 1 pbias x y y 100 where x is long term mean value of precipitation forecasts at a certain location over conus y is the long term mean reference precipitation at a certain location over conus and pbias is the percentage differences between mean forecast values and mean reference values over the study period positive pbias values indicate overestimations by forecasts while negative pbias values indicate underestimations by forecasts 3 2 anomaly correlation coefficient acc the acc is a widely used metric in the climate prediction community it measures the degree of association between forecast and observed deviation from the climatology the advantage of acc over some other metrics is that acc can separate effects due to the existence of forecast bias in evaluating forecast skill the acc score of 1 indicates that the forecast provides perfect information and a score of zero means the forecast contains no information at all the acc skill scores of the ensemble mean of each individual nmme 2 model and the sma of the grand ensemble are calculated following equation 2 murphy and epstein 1989 2 acc n x y x y n x 2 x 2 n y 2 y 2 where x is the forecast hindcast precipitation anomalies at a certain lead time and y is reference precipitation anomalies at the same lead time n is the total number of hindcasts forecast values made for that lead time and acc is the anomaly correlation coefficient skill score for the forecasts hindcasts 3 3 quantile probability of detection qpod quantile false alarm ratio qfar 3 3 1 quantile probability of detection qpod the qpod is a statistical evaluation measurement which is defined as the probability of detection pod above a certain quantile threshold aghakouchak et al 2011 wilks 2011 in this study we used the whole ensemble spreads of nmme 2 models to compute the qpod taking the cancm3 model and extreme events above 99 percentiles as an example cancm3 model produces ten forecast values at a certain time step and if any one of the ten forecast values has successfully forecasted an extreme event exceeded 99 quantile according to its own model output statistics it will be count as a hit the qpod has the advantage of ignoring the effect of forecast bias as it is a quantile based evaluation metric compared to the conventional probability of detection pod aghakouchak et al 2011 wilks 2011 the qpod ranges from 0 to 1 and the value of 1 is ideal indicating all extreme events above below a certain percentile threshold are successfully forecasted the qpod of single nmme 2 models and the grand ensemble of five nmme 2 models considering their whole ensemble spreads can be calculated with the following equation 3 3 qpod i 1 n j 1 m i x ij x j 99 i y i y 99 i 1 n i y i y 99 where n is the length of the forecast time series and m is the ensemble size of a certain forecast model x ij is the forecast value by j th ensemble member of a model at time step i and x j 99 is the 99 threshold of the j th ensemble member according to its own statistics similarly y i is the reference value at time step i and y 99 is the 99 threshold of the reference precipitation according to its own statistics i is the indicator function e g i t r u e 1 i f a l s e 0 and represent set operations e g 1 1 1 0 1 1 3 3 2 quantile false alarm ratio qfar the qfar is a categorical evaluation measurement which is defined as the false alarm ratio far above a certain quantile threshold mehran and aghakouchak 2014 in this study we used the whole ensemble spreads of nmme 2 models to compute the qfar again taking the cancm3 model as an example which has ten ensemble members the cancm3 model produces ten forecast values at a certain time step and if any one of the ten forecast values has made a forecast exceeded 99 quantile according to its own model output statistics while there s no extreme event happened according to the reference it will be count as a false alarm since adopting quantile thresholds the qfar also has the advantage of ignoring the effect of forecast bias compared to the conventional false alarm ratio far aghakouchak et al 2011 wilks 2011 the qfar ranges from 0 to 1 and the value of 0 is ideal indicating there s no false alarm at all the qfar of single nmme 2 models and the grand ensemble of five nmme 2 models considering their whole ensemble spreads can be calculated with the following equation 4 4 qfar i 1 n j 1 m i x ij x j 99 i y i y 99 i 1 n i y i y 99 where n is the length of the forecast time series and m is the ensemble size of a certain forecast model x ij is the forecast value by j th ensemble member of a model at time step i and x j 99 is the 99 threshold of the j th ensemble member according to its own statistics similarly y i is the reference value at time step i and y 99 is the 99 threshold of the reference precipitation according to its own statistics i is the indicator function e g i t r u e 1 i f a l s e 0 and represent set operations e g 1 1 1 0 1 1 3 3 3 benchmarking qpod and qfar in this study we benchmark the qpod and qfar values of historical resampled precipitation forecasts in predicting extreme precipitation events the historical resampled forecasts are commonly used as hydrometeorological inputs to the esp framework for hydrologic forecasts at s2s range assuming historical resampled precipitation forecast with an ensemble size of m if any single randomly drawn forecast values out of m forecasts values have successfully predicted an extreme event above below a certain threshold according to the historical statistics it will be counted as a hit similarly if any single randomly drawn forecast values out of m forecasts values contain a value above below a certain threshold while there s no such extreme events happened according to the reference it will be counted as a false alarm since historical resampled forecasts are randomly drawn values from historical records they are totally independent of the actual weather happened in the real world thus theoretically for any true positive and or true negative events the qpod and or qfar of historical resampled forecasts are the same and can be computed with equation 5 5 qpod resampledforecasts qfar resampledforecasts 1 0 99 m according to equation 5 the qpod resampledforecasts and qfar resampledforecasts with an ensemble size of 10 cancm3 cancm4 geos5 ccsm4 12 florb01 and 52 the grand ensemble of nmme 2 are 0 10 0 11 0 40 respectively for the extreme precipitation events above 99 or below 1 percentiles since the historical resampled forecasts randomly draw values from historical records their performances are only affected by the ensemble size but are independent of forecast lead times 4 results 4 1 forecast bias figure 2 presents the overall pbias of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts over conus it consists of the results from five individual nmme 2 models cancm3 cancm4 florb01 geos5 and ccsm4 and the sma of the grand ensemble of five nmme 2 models in fig 2 the positive bias in cooler colors blue is associated with overestimation and the negative bias in warmer colors red is associated with underestimation according to fig 2 the highest level of model pbias of the nmme 2 dataset appears in central and western u s and the forecast biases are relatively lower in eastern regions than that over the western regions this similar spatial variability of overall pbias can be observed across individual nmme 2 models and the sma in addition we notice that all five nmme 2 models demonstrate both positive and negative pbias with a mosaic like pattern over the northwest west west north central and southwest regions fig 2a e where the sierra nevada mountains and the rocky mountains ranges on the contrary across the northwest and southeast regions where appalachian mountain is located the geos5 model fig 2d demonstrates a significant level of overestimation while other nmme 2 models show a relatively smaller level of biases in the south region all five nmme 2 models are consistently underestimating precipitation the sma fig 2f has a very similar pattern of spatial variability in the overall pattern of pbias compared to the five individual single nmme 2 models the following fig 3 presents the pbias of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts across conus at different lead times i e week 1 to week 4 according to fig 3 only some minor differences are observed in different climate regions and no obvious lead time dependences of pbias are observed for all nmme 2 members at all lead times the spatial pattern of weekly pbias is very similar to the overall pattern of pbias observed in fig 2 the sma also shows similar behavior to the five individual nmme 2 models at all lead times combining the results from both figs 2 and 3 we observe that the overall model biases are not sensitive to lead times though individual model could be associated with different levels of pbias and the model errors are also spatially varying across the conus in the following fig 4 we present the seasonal pbias of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts over conus according to fig 4 both the individual nmme 2 model and the sma exhibit a strong pbias variation in different seasons over the conus and the individual model biases may demonstrate significant changes from positive to negative or vice versa when the season changes specifically in djf all nmme 2 models show significant overestimation at most parts of the northwest west west north central and southwest regions in mam the general behavior of the model overestimation is improved and the level of overestimation of all individual models decreased comparing to that in djf in mam we also notice that the spatial patterns of the obtained pbias are very similar to the overall patterns of pbias as shown in prior fig 2 suggesting the mam is the most representative season to show model s error variability in space in jja all nmme 2 models show a significant level of underestimation at the northwest west southwest south and west north central regions in son the level of the underestimation by all models are smaller than that in jja while the level of overestimation increased in the northwest region the results in fig 4 indicate that there are strong seasonal dependences of model pbias at different regions across conus especially in djf and jja some noticeable model discrepancies are observed in different seasons for example in son the cancm4 model exhibits a more significant level of underestimation than other nmme 2 models in the southeast south southwest and west north central regions in mam the geos5 model demonstrates a higher level of overestimation than other nmme 2 models in the west north central region while a higher level of underestimation is observed with the same geos5 model comparing to other models in the southwest south and southeast regions to better illustrate the large scale spatial patterns of model biases with a joint consideration of seasonality and lead time dependences we further computed and presented the regional averaged pbias values of nmme 2 over nine ncei climate regions for different seasons djf mam jja and son and lead times weeks 1 4 in the following fig 5 in fig 5 the cooler colors indicate overestimation while the warmer colors indicate underestimation the numbers in each cell of fig 5 indicate the actual pbias values obtained for each model lead time and season according to the heat map of fig 5 the largest overestimations made by all nmme 2 models occur in the west north central region in djf and significant underestimations are observed in the warmer seasons of son and jja at most of the regions over conus except for the northwest the layout pattern of nine ncei climate regions in fig 5 from left to right is consistent with the geographic patterns of those regions in the real world layout from west to east according to the quantitative values presented in fig 5 from left to right there is an obvious decreasing trend of pbias from west to east this numerical trend and decreasing pattern are more obvious than that of different seasonality and lead times specifically the overall overestimation in the northwest west and west north central regions observed in fig 2 appears to be mainly contributed by the overestimations that occurred in djf and the underestimation observed in fig 2 appears to be mainly contributed by the underestimations that occurred in warmer seasons of jja and son in terms of the different lead times we found that the pbias values are not sensitive to the lead times since the colors of grid boxes in fig 5 remain rather consistent along the x axis within most of the subplots in jja and son only cancm4 florb01 ccsm4 and sma models show some noticeable variations of pbias over lead times in the west the west north central and the southwest regions 4 2 forecast skill to evaluate the forecast skills of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts at different lead times week 1 to week 4 across conus we calculated the acc values of the ensemble means of five nmme 2 models and the sma of the grand ensemble of nmme 2 the results are presented in fig 6 in fig 6 warmer colors indicate higher acc scores and cooler colors indicate lower acc scores the red colored numbers on the lower right corners of each subplot in fig 6 are the spatially averaged acc value over the entire conus according to the results in fig 6 except for the florb01 the forecast skill of all other nmme 2 models shows a decreasing trend over lead times as their conus averaged acc values decrease rapidly from week 1 0 34 to 0 43 to week 2 0 19 to 0 26 and the skill score remains at a marginal level at week 3 0 10 to 0 17 and week 4 0 09 to 0 10 the conus averaged acc values of florb01 are consistently lower than other nmme 2 models especially at week 1 and week 2 the sma shows a higher forecast skill than any other individual nmme 2 models at all lead times over the entire conus in addition the results in fig 6 also indicate that spatially all nmme 2 models have the highest forecast skill over the coastal areas in the northwest and west regions as compared to other regions in conus higher acc values can be observed in the northwest west west north central and some part of the southwest central regions as compared with the conus averaged acc values however the acc values in the south central some parts of the southwest and northeast regions are consistently lower than in other regions especially at the longer lead times i e week 2 to week 4 in the following fig 7 we present the acc values in different seasons of a djf b mam c jja and d son at different lead times week 1 to week 4 the difference between fig 7 and fig 6 is that the prior fig 6 differentiated the forecast lead times but did not separate the forecasts made in different seasons in fig 7 we further grouped the forecasts into different seasons and lead times for evaluation the warmer colors in fig 7 indicate higher acc scores and cooler colors in fig 7 indicate lower acc scores and the red colored numbers on the lower right corners of each subplot in fig 7 are the spatially averaged acc value over the entire conus in fig 7 the weekly pattern of the acc values in all seasons generally follows similar behaviors as that shown in fig 6 the acc values of the nmme 2 models decrease rapidly from week 1 to week 2 and show marginal forecast skill in week 3 and week 4 in all seasons the florb01 is still an outlier compared with the other nmme 2 models as it continuously presents lower conus averaged acc values the sma of nmme 2 shows the highest conus averaged acc values at almost all lead times in all seasons it is also found that there are seasonal dependences in the forecast skills according to the lead times taking sma results as an example the highest acc values at week 1 and week 3 are observed in djf and mam respectively although overall marginal forecast skill is observed at week 3 and week 4 in all seasons a moderate forecast skill 0 3 to 0 4 can be observed at some areas within different seasons in addition at week 3 and week 4 moderate forecast skills are observed i over the south southwest some parts of the west the west north central and the southeast in djf ii over the north central the south and the coastal area of the west regions in mam iii over the southwest and the west north central regions in jja and iv over the northwest and the coastal areas of the west regions in son respectively figure 8 presents the regionally averaged acc scores of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts in different seasons djf mam jja and son and at different lead times week 1 to week 4 over nine ncei climate regions in fig 8 the lighter colors indicate lower acc values and the darker colors indicate higher acc values the numbers in the figure are the actual acc scores similar to the presentation of fig 5 fig 8 follows the pattern that the layout of nine ncei climate regions from left to right in fig 8 corresponds to the real world geography from western to eastern u s per the real world layout the results in fig 8 indicate a spatially varying pattern of the precipitation forecast skill of nmme 2 models when the seasonality and lead time dependences are jointly considered specifically in fig 8 there is a significant decreasing trend of acc values from the west to the east especially in mam and jja in addition we observe that the acc values are relatively higher at the shortest lead time i e week 1 as compared to that at longer lead times i e week 2 to week 4 across all regions and seasons according to fig 8 in general the highest overall acc value is likely to appear in the winter season i e djf on the contrary the nmme 2 models tend to produce the lowest forecast skill in the summer season i e jja except for the northwest and southwest regions except for the florb01 model all other nmme 2 models show similar behaviors in most of the neci climate regions and the different models show similar performances over most of the lead times the sma shows the highest acc values than any single nmme 2 models under most of the scenarios which is expected as the sma approach can eliminate the outliners and produce a more conservative forecast as compared to each single nmme 2 model as a summary of this section 3 2 the following three important findings are evidenced by the presented results 1 the nmme 2 precipitation forecast skill consistently decreases over the lead times across the conus in all seasons 2 the raw forecast skill of nmme 2 dataset is generally higher in cooler seasons than that in warmer seasons and 3 spatially the raw forecast skill of all five employed nmme 2 models tends to be higher in western regions than in eastern regions across the conus and the performance of different models is similar to each other except for the florb01 model 4 3 capability in predicting extreme precipitation events we evaluate the nmme 2 models capabilities in predicting extreme precipitation events using the qpod and qfar here we obtain and analyze the nmme 2 models capabilities in predicting extreme precipitation events above 99 and below 1 percentiles respectively the results for extreme precipitation events above 95 and below 5 percentiles are available in the supplementary materials for interested readers 4 3 1 extreme events above 99 threshold the following fig 9 presents the qpod of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts in predicting extreme precipitation events above 99 threshold over conus at different lead times in fig 9 the warmer colors indicate higher qpod values and red colored numbers at the lower right corners of each subplot is the spatially averaged qpod values over the entire conus the results from fig 9 indicate that the qpod patterns of different nmme 2 models are generally similar to each other with only minor discrepancies at forecast lead time of week 1 both the geos5 and ccsm4 model generally show higher qpod values than other nmme 2 models at week 1 according to the numerical qpod values on each subplot rows all nmme 2 models except for the florb01 exhibit a decreasing trend of qpod value over the lead times the florb01 model produces the lowest qpod value in week 1 but the qpod value increases from 0 11 to 0 20 over lead time spatially the qpod values at the coastal areas of the northwest and the west regions are higher than those over other regions at all lead times this result is consistent with the acc evaluation result presented in the previous section 3 2 the qpod values of the grand ensemble of 5 nmme 2 models a total of 52 ensemble members are presented in the last row in fig 9 the ensemble results show that there is a significant increase in the qpod values of the grand ensemble compared to individual nmme 2 models with smaller ensemble sizes figure 10 presents the qfar of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts in predicting extreme precipitation events above 99 percentiles over conus at different lead times in fig 10 the cooler colors indicate higher qfar values and red colored numbers at the lower right corners of each subplot is the spatially averaged qfar values over the entire conus note that in contrary to qpod lower qfar values indicate more superior performance in terms of predicting extremes according to fig 10 all single nmme 2 models qfar values are around or less than 0 1 across the conus the geos5 and ccsm4 model which shows slightly higher qpod values than other nmme 2 models also demonstrate relatively higher qfar values comparing to the spatially averaged qfar values within different rows in fig 10 all nmme 2 models exhibit an increasing trend of qfar value over the lead times spatially qfar values are lower than average over the coastal areas of the northwest and the west regions at all lead times this result is consistent with the acc evaluation result presented in the previous section 3 2 the qfar values of the grand ensemble of five nmme 2 models a total of 52 ensemble members are presented in the last row in fig 10 the result shows that with a larger ensemble size the false alarm ratios of the grand ensemble of nmme 2 are significantly larger than any single nmme 2 models we also compare the qpod and qfar of nmme 2 models five nmme 2 models and grand ensemble with the benchmark values from resampled forecasts as presented in table 2 by comparing the nmme 2 qpod and qfar values with the benchmark values of the historical resampled forecasts we can see all individual nmme 2 models and the grand ensemble of nmme 2 have shown superior performances in predicting extreme events exceeded 99 percentiles all nmme 2 models have shown higher qpod and lower qfar than the benchmarks although larger ensemble sizes may bring higher qpod values it also increases qfar values higher qpod values indicate higher chances of coverages of extreme precipitation events above 99 percentiles by the ensemble spreads of precipitation forecasts nmme 2 or historical resampled forecasts lower qfar values indicate that when the ensemble spreads of precipitation forecasts reached above 99 percentiles there are higher chances of such extreme events eventually happen 4 3 2 extreme events below 1 threshold figure 11 presents the qpod of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts in predicting extreme precipitation events below 1 percentiles over conus at different lead times in fig 11 the warmer colors indicate higher qpod values and red colored numbers at the lower right corners of each subplot is the spatially averaged qpod values over the entire conus according to fig 11 for all individual nmme 2 models marginal qpod values are observed at most regions of conus relatively higher qpod values are only observed for certain models in certain regions and at certain lead times for example cancm4 model shows higher qpod values in the southwest region at all lead times geos 5 also presents slightly higher qpod values at some locations in the southwest southeast and northeast regions at week 1 and week 2 the qpod of the grand ensemble of nmme 2 presented at the last row of fig 11 shows significantly higher qpod compared to single nmme 2 models over the entire conus at all lead times figure 12 below presents the qfar with a 1 percentile threshold of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts over conus at different lead times in fig 12 the cooler colors indicate higher qfar values and red colored numbers at the lower right corners of each subplot is the spatially averaged qfar values over the entire conus the overall qfar patterns are similar to the overall qpod patterns shown in fig 11 marginal qfar values are observed at most of regions in conus for all individual nmme 2 models higher qfar values are only found for certain models and at certain regions mirroring fig 11 cancm4 and geos5 show higher qfar values at some locations in the southwest region at all lead times the qfar value of the grand ensemble of nmme 2 which is presented at the last row of fig 11 is significantly higher than that of each individual nmme 2 models over the conus we also compare the qpod and qfar of nmme 2 models five nmme 2 models and grand ensemble in predicting extreme events below 1 percentile thresholds with the benchmark values from resampled forecasts as presented in table 3 comparing the nmme 2 qpod and qfar values with the benchmark values of the historical resampled forecasts from table 3 all individual nmme 2 models show higher qpod values than the benchmark however the qpod values of the grand ensemble of nmme 2 are slightly lower than but still comparable to the benchmarks higher qpod values indicate higher chances of coverages of extreme precipitation events below 1 percentiles by the ensemble spreads of precipitation forecasts nmme 2 or historical resampled forecasts and vice versa lower qfar values indicated that when the ensemble spreads of precipitation forecasts fall below 1 percentiles that there are higher chances that such extreme events may eventually happen considering both qpod and qfar values it is reasonable to say that the nmme 2 still presents overall better performances in predicting extreme events below 1 percentiles than the benchmark does 5 discussion the pbias result shown in prior sections 3 1 and 3 2 can be explained along with the geographical characteristics and rainfall mechanisms of the conus the overall pattern of pbias in the winter djf season showed significant overestimations in the northwest the west and west north central regions for these regions precipitation events are dominated by synoptic scale extratropical cyclones ecs and atmospheric rivers ars related weathers in cooler seasons zhang et al 2019 a number of previous studies have reported that gcms tend to produce too much low volume precipitation in comparison with reference also known as the drizzle effect when simulating synoptic precipitation events hill 1993 maraun 2013 thus the authors suspect the observed overestimations at the above mentioned regions in cooler seasons are largely due to the drizzle effect however other studies also suggest gcms tend to underestimate high volume precipitations related to convective weather systems in the western us e g norris et al 2021 in this regard our evaluation is limited as it only reflects aggregated biases of precipitation forecasts from nmme 2 which entangles all potential affecting factors thus more detailed examinations of nmme 2 at regions in the western u s should be carried out to attribute the sources of bias in a more rigorous way although significant overestimation was generally observed in the djf there were also underestimations in some areas within the same regions in djf these mixed behaviors of over and under estimations could be attributed to the complex terrains brought by the sierra nevada mountain and the rocky mountain which are likely to trigger orographic precipitations with the nearby climatic regions this also suggests that the raw coarse spatial resolution of nmme 2 should be considered through proper bias corrections and downscaling before any further hydrologic applications in contrast the pbias patterns in djf an overall underestimation of precipitation from nmme 2 was observed in the south the southwest and part of the west north central regions in warmer seasons especially in jja these regions lie in the middle of the continent with nearly half of the precipitation contributed by mesoscale convective systems mcss in warmer seasons easterling et al 2017 fritsch et al 1986 nesbitt et al 2006 however the convection systems are neither perfectly parameterized nor resolved for most of the gcms moncrieff 2019 moreover mcss with even smaller spatial scales normally operate within typical gcm grids which surpass the capability of gcms and esms eden et al 2012 as a result it is reasonable to suspect the observed underestimations at the south the southwest and part of the west north central regions in warmer seasons are associated with sub grid convective precipitation events regarding the obtained forecast skill results one major discrepancy was identified between florb01 and other nmme 2 models as shown in fig 6 the florb01 model showed consistently lower forecast skill throughout all lead times while other nmme 2 models showed higher forecast skill at week 1 and rapidly decreased to marginal levels at week 3 and week 4 this result agrees with the previous evaluation study upon monthly nmme 1 precipitation forecasts by slater et al 2019 in which the authors found the florb01 model sometimes does not display higher skill at the shortest lead time one month the obtained result in our study further shown that within the one month lead time i e week 1 to week 4 the florb01 model still presents poorer performances compared with other nmme models our obtained results fig 9 also exhibit that the application of the grand ensemble with larger ensemble sizes generally shows better statistics than individual nmme 2 models with smaller ensemble sizes this observation strongly supports the hypothesis that creating a grand model ensemble with a larger ensemble size through multiple techniques e g multi model perturbed physics and perturbed initial conditions etc will effectively increase precipitation forecast skill and reliability the spatial dependences of forecast skill of all employed nmme 2 model are evident higher acc values were observed over the coastal areas of the northwest the west and west north central regions at all lead times within these regions the winter precipitation is mainly associated with cyclonic synoptic scale weathers cayan and roads 1984 because of the life cycle of cyclones and their large spatial scales the corresponding precipitation events are generally easier for gcms to predict compared to other types of precipitation events i e convective and orographic kumar et al 2011 zhu et al 2014 even at longer lead times week 2 to week 4 the acc values at these regions are still higher than at other regions it is also noticeable that the regions and seasons observed overestimations seem more likely to achieve higher forecast skills if cross observing fig 5 and fig 8 our results regarding the extreme events suggest that there is a good potential of nmme 2 forecasts to be used for hydrologic applications at the s2s range at the s2s range precipitation forecasts generally do not show reliable forecast skills and cannot be used deterministically and for this reason ensemble precipitation forecasts with the ability to cover the extreme events with their ensemble spreads are widely used thus from a practical point of view the abilities of ensemble precipitation forecasts in predicting extreme events become extremely important according to table 2 and table 3 most nmme 2 models show superior qpod and qfar values compared to the benchmark when predicting extreme precipitation events above 99 percentiles and below 1 percentiles nmme 2 show less dominant performances when predicting events below 1 percentiles compared to predicting events above 99 percentiles which indicates that nmme 2 may be better at predicting floods than predicting droughts but overall speaking nmme 2 still appears to be a better option with generally higher probabilities of detections and lower false alarm ratios of predicting extreme events than the historical resampled forecasts this finding suggests that nmme 2 may be a better fit to the esp framework than historical resample forecasts in terms of hydrologic predictions at the s2s range it is also noteworthy to mention that the grand ensemble of nmme 2 models should provide more information for water resources planning at the s2s range to mitigate the impacts from floods and droughts compared to individual nmme 2 models nonetheless many challenges remain when applying the nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecast on hydrologic modeling and real world water resources planning the first issue that needs to be addressed is the substantial forecast bias although our result has demonstrated good potentials of nmme 2 in predicting extreme events the raw forecast values need to be bias corrected before assisting real world flood predictions brown and seo 2010 tiwari et al 2021 currently most of the popular bias correction approaches heavily rely on the stationary assumption where statistical moments are generalized from the historical records and will be used to correct the raw forecast values teutschbein and seibert 2012 however some recent studies have identified trends in not only frequencies but also magnitudes of extreme precipitation events in various regions over the globe madsen et al 2014 miao et al 2015 sun et al 2014b which likely undermines the efficacy of existing approaches in bias correcting extreme precipitation forecast values and the authors believe properly considering the non stationary in bias correction especially for extreme values might be a major challenge for future studies great efforts have also been made to to improve the marginal forecast skill of the s2s precipitation forecasts by utilizing hydrometeorological forecasts from multiple sources and models to assist ensemble hydrologic forecasting we believe that one promising direction is to construct a super nmme 2 ensemble and further apply more sophisticated multi model averaging techniques to improve the forecast data quality ji et al 2020 sloughter et al 2007 yang et al 2018 multi model ensemble with proper data quality control could further increase the precipitation forecast skill across different temporal and spatial resolutions based on the obtained results in this study we observe that in most of the cases the sma method can produce slightly higher forecast skills than any individual nmme 2 models at all lead times nevertheless the improvements of sma are still limited over individual models authors believe that advanced model ensemble technique needs to be used together with the fundamental enhancements of the gcms and esms which provide better precipitation predictability and less system and random errors in the s2s forecasts for example this could be done by advancing the current land surface components of gcms dirmeyer et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 or through better sub grid convective parameterizations eden et al 2012 from the perspective of hydrology community exploiting the benefits of deep learning techniques to post process s2s precipitation forecasts might be another feasible alternative akbari asanjan et al 2018 weyn et al 2021 given the slow advances in fundamentally enhancing the physical dynamics of coupled gcms or esms most of the previous studies have tried to correct the bias of gcm generated precipitation forecast separately without considering the forecast skill however our study implies that the forecasts bias and forecast skill are somehow connected with each other the performance of precipitation forecasts can essentially be attributed to different climate and weather patterns and mechanisms eden et al 2012 kirtman et al 2014a only correcting bias may lead to degradation of forecast skills mendoza et al 2017 recently it has been reported that taking the advantage of deep learning techniques to handle additional resolved atmospheric forecast variables to improve the s2s precipitation forecast skills first then correcting the bias may provide some major improvements miao et al 2019 pan et al 2019a given the recent development of artificial intelligence and other statistical tools from computer science the uses of machine learning methods to improve the nmme 2 s2s daily precipitation forecasts may provide a variable way leading to successful forecast adaptations for hydrologic applications these new machine learning approaches allow auxiliary information to be considered during the bias correction process such as the forecast lead times seasonality regional factors and relevant atmospheric forecast variables which are all found to be important factors in improving the accuracy of s2s precipitation forecasts pertinent to the presented sensitivity analysis in our study over the conus last but not least it is also important for hydrologists to apply the improved and corrected s2s precipitation forecasts for hydrologic forecasts at watersheds with different hydrometeorological conditions spatial and temporal resolutions cao et al 2021 li et al 2019 after the necessary post processing and bias corrections we encourage practitioners to apply other popular metrics such as the mean squared error the ranked probabilistic skill score rpss the continuous rpss crpss and other categorical skill metrics including the false alarm ratio far the probability of detection pod the critical success index csi and equitable threat score etc and etc to conduct more detailed examinations of s2s precipitation forecasts on daily basis for regional studies this would overcome the limitation of our study in which only the nmme 2 s2s forecasts on a weekly basis are studied with a limited number of evaluation metrics one of the major motivations for our study is to identify trends and quantify the data quality of the nmme 2 forecasts over the entire conus and therefore the streamflow simulation capabilities and forecast data improvements will be investigated in future studies to summary the authors believe future studies on nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecasts may include 1 proper bias corrections and downscaling of the nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecasts at different regions across the conus 2 application of deep learning approaches to provide more accurate and reliable nmme 2 precipitation forecasts especially at longer lead times 3 hydrologic applications of the nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecasts with esp framework to further investigate the efficacy of nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecasts over traditional historical resample forecasts in streamflow forecasting 6 conclusion in this study the s2s precipitation forecasts of nmme 2 are comprehensively evaluated across conus and during a hindcast period of 1982 2011 both deterministic evaluations of forecast bias pbias and forecast skill acc and probabilistic evaluations aiming at the extreme precipitation events qpod qfar have been conducted the spatial seasonal and lead time dependence of the performances of nmme 2 daily precipitation forecasts have been analyzed over nine ncei climate regions the extreme precipitation performances of five nmme 2 models are also evaluated against benchmark resampled historical forecasts our results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecast and its potential for hydrologic applications the major findings and conclusions of this study are summarized below 1 the nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecasts show substantial biases across conus the forecast biases also demonstrate strong spatial and seasonal dependences but we found the biases are not sensitive to forecast lead times five individual nmme 2 models and the sma of their grand ensemble show similar spatial bias patterns across the conus based on our spatial analysis significant overestimations of the nmme 2 forecasts are observed in the western northwest west and west north central regions in djf season and significant model underestimations are identified in the south region of conus in warmer seasons of jja and son 2 in terms of forecast skill a major discrepancy exists between the florb01 and the rest of nmme 2 models specifically the florb01 model consistently shows a lower precipitation forecast skill especially at week 1 and week 2 lead times as compared to other nmme 2 models the forecast skill of the rest of nmme 2 models is the highest at week 1 tends to decrease rapidly from week 1 to week 2 and remains at a marginal level at week 3 and week 4 across all regions and in all seasons spatially all nmme 2 models show higher forecast skills in the western areas northwest and west regions the sma of five nmme 2 members shows better deterministic forecast skill than any single nmme 2 model under most comparison scenarios 3 the nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecasts also show better potentials in predicting extreme above 99 and below 1 precipitation events at all lead times compared to historical resampled forecasts in addition the formation of a grand ensemble of nmme 2 with a bigger ensemble size can further increase the performance of nmme 2 in predicting extreme events therefore we believe the grand ensemble of nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecasts is a good alternative to the historical resampled forecast within the esp framework for hydrologic applications 4 our study has presented more detailed evaluations of the precipitation forecasts from nmme 2 within one month week 1 to week 4 compared to previous evaluations of nmme 1 monthly precipitation forecasts across the entire conus and our evaluation results should be able to serve as an important reference for future hydrologic related studies utilizing nmme 2 at watershed scales

4083,the second phase of the north america multi model ensemble nmme 2 provides globally available subseasonal to seasonal s2s precipitation forecasts with a daily resolution the s2s precipitation forecasts are getting increasing attention for their potentials in providing hydrometeorological forcing information for water resources planning at an extended range however the forecast skills of many existing s2s forecast products will significantly decrease when the lead time increases hindering their applicability for watershed scale hydrologic modeling therefore forecast validation and large scale evaluation are of great importance for water resources planning and hydrological applications in this study we comprehensively evaluate the s2s precipitation forecasts from the nmme 2 dataset over the contiguous united states conus and during the study period from 1982 to 2011 three aspects of precipitation forecast capabilities are compared and analyzed bias skill scores and the ability to predict extreme precipitation events the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism is used as ground truth reference differs from other regional forecast validation study we further examined and analyzed the dependences of nmme 2 precipitation forecast skills according to different seasonality geographical locations and lead times results show that the forecast biases are not sensitive to lead times but are seasonally dependent of all nmme 2 models overestimations are found in the western u s in cooler seasons while underestimations are observed in the central regions of the u s in warmer seasons the forecast skill of all individual nmme 2 models generally decreases as increases of lead times the simple model averaging sma of five nmme 2 models demonstrates a higher forecast skill than any individual nmme 2 models spatially the highest forecast skill scores are observed at coastal areas in the western u s with an one week lead time as compared to the historical resampled forecasts nmme 2 also shows better performance in predicting extreme precipitation events above 99 percentiles and below 1 percentiles with higher probability of detections and lower false alarm ratios the obtained results suggest the great potentials of nmme 2 precipitation forecasts in assisting ensemble hydrologic forecasts at the s2s scale over the conus keywords nmme 2 subseasonal to seasonal precipitation forecast conus forecast validation forecast bias extreme precipitation 1 introduction precipitation is one of the most important components in the hydrologic cycle sorooshian et al 2011 accurate and reliable precipitation forecasts with certain lead times could be beneficial in planning and managing social economic activities preventing financial and life losses from water related disasters akbari asanjan et al 2018 palmer 2002 different precipitation forecast products can be categorized by the available lead times such as short medium and long range forecast products at the short and or medium ranges i e 2 3 days and 7 10 days respectively numerical weather prediction nwp models can provide reliable and skillful forecasts globally bauer et al 2015 especially at the short and or medium ranges nwp models could generate skillful precipitation forecasts by taking advantages of the high predictability of rainfall from initial atmospheric states various types of observations and advanced data assimilation techniques however one common critique on the nwp model is that its forecast skill decreases rapidly and the associated forecast uncertainty increases dramatically when the forecast lead time extends two weeks and beyond alley et al 2019 berner et al 2011 hamill and juras 2006 lin et al 2005 palmer et al 2004 ritter and geleyn 1992 shrestha et al 2013 sun et al 2014a this is because nwp model heavily relies on the initial states of atmosphere and the predictability coming from the initial states dissipates rapidly over lead time at long ranges i e months seasons years and even decades earth system models esms and general circulation models gcms coupled with dynamic oceanic and land surface components are reliable alternatives both esms and gcms produce more skillful and informative climate outlooks than the nwp models at longer forecast lead times because by design they are able to incorporate both the local land surface conditions and sea surface temperature sst circulations into the computation for future weather and climate predictions vitart et al 2017 a forecast gap lies in the transitional period between the medium range weather forecasts and longer range seasonal climate outlooks this transitional period is also referred to as the subseasonal to seasonal s2s timescale which defines a specific time range beyond 10 days and up to 30 days into the future white et al 2017 at the s2s time range the forecast lead time is sufficiently long that most of the predictability from the initial conditions would be lost but it is also too short for the variability of the ocean to have a strong influence upon local weather vitart et al 2017 this unique physical feature of weather predictability made precipitation forecast at the s2s range notoriously challenging and also makes s2s forecast often considered as a desert of predictability white et al 2017 the s2s hydrometeorological forecasts are important information and have a great potential in providing seamless streamflow and flood forecasts at the s2s range traditionally river forecast centers and weather service centers over the globe issue probabilistic seasonal streamflow forecasts forced by seasonal and or monthly climate outlooks wood and lettenmaier 2006 however this kind of seasonal streamflow forecasts can only reflect an increased or decreased risks of flooding but do not have the ability to predict floods at the s2s range meanwhile the s2s hydrometeorological forecasts provide an opportunity in assisting streamflow forecasts which not only reflects the flooding risks but also provides additional information regarding the timing frequency or severity of potential floods within seasons white et al 2015 accurate s2s hydrometeorological forecasts could also help the operation of reservoirs in scheduling optimal water supplies and hydropower generations given foreseeable dry and wet water conditions sankarasubramanian et al 2009 yang et al 2020 2021 despite the potential benefits of s2s ensemble forecasts in water energy system operation ding et al 2021 it also appears to be a new research area to extend our existing knowledge about weather and climate forecasts in different space and time vitart and robertson 2018 previous studies concluded that the predictability of s2s forecast comes from several sources including initial atmospheric conditions cohen et al 2010 stockdale et al 2015 initial land surface soil moisture asoka and mishra 2015 guo et al 2011 initial snow conditions thomas et al 2016 and initial sea surface temperatures chelton and wentz 2005 in some recent studies the planetary scale oceanic patterns are found to be the main predictability source of s2s forecasts and these interconnection climate indices include the el niño southern oscillation enso madden julian oscillation mjo quasi biennial oscillation qbo nardi et al 2020 pan et al 2019b yang et al 2017 there are many existing efforts and programs that focus on the hydrometeorological forecasts at the s2s timescales such as the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the environment canada ec the japan meteorological agency jma the china meteorological administration cma etc each of those agencies uses different coupled gcms and esms to obtain the precipitation forecasts at the s2s range with different temporal and spatial resolutions the north america multi model ensemble nmme is a multi agency initiated and collaborative program that provides a variety of hydrometeorological forecasts at the s2s timescale kirtman et al 2014a the nmme consists of the outputs from multiple coupled gcms and esms each providing independent retrospective forecasts hereafter referred to as hindcasts and real time forecasts the nmme phase 1 project nmme 1 was initially launched in 2014 and further transitioned into phase 2 nmme 2 in more recent years both nmme 1 and nmme 2 datasets provide monthly initialized hindcasts and forecasts with lead time up to 12 months the major advancement of nmme 2 over the nmme 1 dataset is the provision of dynamically downscaled forecasts in which the new dataset provides daily precipitation forecasts at the s2s range while the outputs from the nmme 1 dataset only provides forecasts with monthly resolution kirtman et al 2014b there is a good number of existing research that investigated the quality and accuracy of the hydrometeorological forecasts from nmme 1 dataset for example becker et al 2014 and krakauer 2019 evaluated the skill of precipitation and temperature forecasts from nmme 1 globally and they found that the simple model averaging sma of nmme 1 models shows better forecast skill than any individual nmme 1 models and the forecast skills vary depending on geographical regions and seasons similar evaluation studies upon nmme 1 monthly hydrometeorological forecasts have been carried out in different regions for example cash et al 2019 observed significant systematic error in both precipitation and temperature forecasts from nmme 1 in two southern asia regions and found the highest forecast skills are observed at the shortest lead times shukla et al 2019 found the skill of precipitation forecasts from nmme 1 is higher during enso years over east africa slater et al 2019 evaluated the skill of precipitation and temperature forecasts from nmme 1 over seven geological regions of the continental united states slater et al 2019 found the highest forecast skill is generally observed at the shortest lead time and the performances of nmme 1 forecast are spatially and seasonally dependent the study from slater et al 2019 also consistently shows that higher forecast skills can be gained by averaging multiple nmme 1 models and the skill of hydrometeorological forecast from nmme 1 quickly declines to marginal levels as lead time increases to address the low forecast accuracies issue associated with the nmme 1 dataset many follow on studies focused on improving precipitation forecast from nmme 1 dataset for example slater et al 2017 deployed different multi model weighting techniques to improve the skill of nmme 1 monthly precipitation forecast across europe xu et al 2019 applied several machine learning and wavelet approaches to bias correct and downscale the monthly precipitation forecast from the nmme 1 dataset over china khajehei et al 2018 developed a bayesian ensemble approach based on a copula function to bias correct the nmme 1 monthly precipitation forecast over the conus as compared to the studies on nmme 1 dataset there is fewer studies that investigate the quality of s2s precipitation forecasts from the newer nmme 2 dataset among a limited number of studies wanders and wood 2016 evaluated the precipitation forecast from nmme 2 globally on a bi weekly basis by aggregating the evaluation result into three global regions including the tropics extratropic and northern latitudes they found the forecasts skill decreases over lead time as well as performance discrepancies between different nmme 2 models zhou and kim 2018 evaluated the ability of nmme 2 in predicting the wintertime atmospheric rivers ar and moisture flux over the northeast pacific in response to enso they found nmme 2 dataset has significant regional biases in anomalous landfalling ar frequency which underlining challenges in forecasting regional precipitation events more recently baker et al 2019 studied the precipitation forecasts of climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 from the nmme 2 dataset over the entire conus on a bi weekly basis and they found the forecast skill of cfsv2 decreases over lead time rapidly but the forecast biases are insensitive to lead times guo and nie 2020 evaluated the daily precipitation forecasts of cfsv2 over east china their result indicates the raw precipitation forecasts of cfsv2 are substantially biased and the extreme precipitation events over east china have been underestimated by cfsv2 becker et al 2020 studied the performances of precipitation forecasts from nmme 2 globally however becker et al 2020 aggregated the daily forecast values from nmme 2 into monthly values since their study focus on seasonal scale and is more focused on proving the improvement of forecast quality corresponding to the iteration of nmme models to summarize the existing studies focusing on precipitation forecasts from nmme 2 existing research either 1 targeted the evaluation of nmme 2 at a spatial scale that is too large to provide a useful reference for regional hydrologic studies or 2 are only focusing on monthly forecast values and overlook the s2s forecasts from nmme 2 or 3 have only included a certain member of nmme 2 into the study and did not comprehensively evaluate all nmme 2 members as a whole with the consideration of lead times seasonality and precipitation s geographical characteristics thus more inclusive and comprehensive evaluation of the s2s precipitation forecast from the nmme 2 data across conus is still critically needed according to the conclusion of many existing studies although the evaluation results of the seasonal precipitation forecast from nmme over conus may have some consistency and similarities it is still unknown how exactly does precipitation forecast from different nmme 2 models perform at the s2s range over the entire conus in addition the merit of the s2s precipitation forecast from nmme 2 in forecasting extreme events has not been verified at large scales and these missing pieces of research in return limits further hydrologic applications of the nmme 2 dataset since potential maximum streamflow prediction is one of the most important and desired outcomes of hydrologic forecasts at the s2s range day 1985 gobena and gan 2010 to fill the gap as well as to provide valuable reference information and knowledge for future hydrologic research on nmme 2 this study aims to answer the following research questions 1 how does the s2s precipitation forecast from nmme 2 perform over the entire conus 2 what are the differences between s2s precipitation forecasts from different nmme 2 models in terms of their performances over conus 3 what is the forecast skill of the individual nmme 2 models at different regions over the conus 4 do certain nmme 2 models outperform others with the consideration of certain regions lead times and seasons and 5 what are the nmme 2 model s performances in predicting extreme precipitation events over the conus to answer these research questions in this study we evaluated the s2s precipitation forecasts from five nmme 2 models and their grand ensemble i e all five nmme 2 models as a whole set is collected and analyzed over the conus the study period is from 1982 to 2011 all five nmme 2 models selected in this study provide daily s2s precipitation forecast except for the cfsv2 which was already studied by baker et al 2019 the an81d dataset generated from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism is used as the reference dataset the forecast bias and forecast skill are examined since forecast bias and poor forecast skill are two major obstacles in applying precipitation forecasts to hydrologic simulations zalachori et al 2012 in addition the ability of s2s precipitation forecasts from nmme 2 in predicting extreme precipitation events are further evaluated and compared to the benchmark performances of the historical resampled precipitation forecasts during our evaluation study the forecast lead time is considered on a weekly basis i e from week 1 to week 4 to cover the whole s2s range comparison and analysis on the forecast data quality are further conducted over nine national centers for environmental information ncei climate regions and four seasons which are more inclusive and detailed as compared to the existing nmme 2 evaluation studies mentioned above for example this study extends the existing studies from baker et al 2019 and wanders and wood 2016 specifically our study conducts a more representative validation of five nmme 2 models emphasizing on the forecast performance evaluation at the weekly scale and over the entire conus in other words our study provides a temporally finer and spatially larger evaluation as compared to that from baker et al 2019 and wanders and wood 2016 lastly besides the traditional evaluation of forecast biases and skill scores we also included extensive validation experiments focusing on the extreme rainfall performance and compared the forecast accuracy on different percentile thresholds of dry and wet extremes the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present data and study regions section 3 describes the evaluation metrics and methodologies sections 4 and 5 present the results and discussions respectively the main conclusions and findings are summarized in section 6 2 data and study regions there is a total of seven different models available in the nmme 2 dataset among them we select five nmme 2 models that provide daily precipitation forecasts covering the s2s range table 1 presents the basic information of the selected five nmme 2 models including the canadian coupled climate model version 3 and 4 cancm3 cancm4 from the canada s climate model center cmc the community climate system model 4 0 ccsm4 from the national center for atmospheric research ncar the forecast oriented low ocean resolution model using parameter set b florb01 from the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl and the goddard earth observing system version 5 model geos5 from the national astronautics and space administration nasa each nmme 2 model generates ensemble forecasts through perturbed physics strategy and or under different initial conditions the cancm3 cancm4 ccsm4 and geos5 models consist of 10 ensemble members and the florb01 model consists of 12 ensemble members the study period was set from 01 01 1982 to 12 31 2011 30 years which overlaps with the hindcast forecast period for all five nmme 2 models all nmme 2 hindcast forecast datasets are available at https www earthsystemgrid org search html project nmme the daily precipitation dataset an81d generated from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model hereafter referred to as prism is used as a reference precipitation dataset in this study the prism data is available from 1981 to near present in gridded format with a spatial resolution of 4 km 0 04 across the conus the prism data combines surface observations with a digital elevation model to account for the orographic enhancement of precipitation in addition to rain gauge records the prism data also incorporates the radar measurement into account when producing corrected data over the central and eastern u s regions daly and bryant 2013 since the prism dataset does not incorporate assimilated information from numerical weather forecasting models or meteorological reanalysis it represents an independent dataset suitable for hydrologic studies radcliffe and mukundan 2017 numerous hydrologic studies have used prism precipitation data as a reliable reference for model evaluation bias correction for remotely sensed precipitation estimation products and forecast verification studies ashfaq et al 2016 oubeidillah et al 2014 prat and nelson 2015 widmann and bretherton 2000 figure 1 shows nine different climate regions across the conus which are defined by the national centers for environmental information ncei karl and koss 1984 these nine climatic regions separate the conus into northwest west north central east north central northeast central west southwest south and southeast regions within the neci climate regions the sierra nevada mountain and the rocky mountain are across the northwest west southeast and west north central regions and the appalachian mountain covers parts of the northeast and southeast regions in this study we evaluate the precipitation forecast of the nmme 2 at each pixel across the conus and obtain the spatially averaged results over these nine climate regions for regional analysis in this study we analyze the results based on these nine climatic regions because rainfall presents different physical and dynamical features and patterns over different regions over the conus i e orographic elevation induced rainfall frontal precipitation and or convective systems 3 methodology procedures and evaluation metrics in this study we first collected the nmme 2 precipitation forecasts and prism dataset and then conducted initial data pre processing the nmme 2 precipitation forecasts are produced at the beginning of each month and the forecast lead time are up to 1 year 365 or 366 days into the future we truncated all collected nmme 2 precipitation forecasts to 28 days 4 weeks and then aggregated them into weekly forecast values e g day 1 to 7 as of week 1 day 8 to 14 as of week 2 day 15 to 21 as of week 3 and day 22 to 28 as of week 4 both nmme 2 and prism datasets were re gridded into 0 25 resolution using the same nearest neighbor method for consistency the grand ensemble of all selected nmme 2 models i e a total of 52 different realizations in table 1 was also constructed after the data pre processing we also re organized the collected precipitation forecasts from both individual nmme 2 models and the 52 member grand ensemble into different seasons i e december january february djf march april may mam june july august jja and september october november son in other words the evaluation experiment comprehensively considers the forecast skill and model bias by different climate regions forecast lead times as well as the seasonality over the conus in this study we use the commonly accepted approaches of pixel based and spatial forecast evaluation metrics four evaluation metrics are included i e the percentage bias pbias anomaly correlation coefficient acc quantile probability of detection qpod and quantile false alarm ratios qfar the pbias and acc of i the ensemble means of individual nmme 2 models and ii the sma of the grand ensemble are computed to evaluate forecast bias and forecast skill quantitatively the qpod and qfar metrics are used to evaluate the capabilities of individual nmme 2 model in predicting extreme precipitation events at weekly scales the evaluation of extreme precipitation is as important as forecast bias and forecast skill because the s2s precipitation forecasts potentially serve as inputs to the ensemble streamflow prediction esp approach which are the official approach used in each national weather service s river forecast centers for estimating river stages and potential floods over the conus within the esp framework the extreme streamflow values associated with extreme precipitation events are one of the most important outcomes regarding flood predictions day 1985 gobena and gan 2010 with this understanding in this study the ensemble spreads of individual nmme 2 models and the grand ensemble of five nmme 2 models are employed to compute the qpod and qfar for extreme precipitation evaluation while there is no golden standard for defining extreme precipitation events we chose 99 and 95 percentiles and 5 and 1 percentiles as the thresholds of extreme precipitation events corresponding to flood and drought events respectively note that we only present the qpod and qfar results for extreme events above 99 and below 1 in the main article for conciseness and the 95 and 5 events results are included in the supplementary material for interested readers detailed descriptions for the four employed evaluation metrics are presented as follows 3 1 percentage bias pbias the pbias measurement reflects the degree of the under and or over estimations of precipitation forecast that are vital for potential future hydrologic applications to quantify the bias pattern of nmme 2 precipitation forecasts over the conus the pbias of the ensemble means of single nmme 2 models and the sma of the grand ensemble are computed with equation 1 1 pbias x y y 100 where x is long term mean value of precipitation forecasts at a certain location over conus y is the long term mean reference precipitation at a certain location over conus and pbias is the percentage differences between mean forecast values and mean reference values over the study period positive pbias values indicate overestimations by forecasts while negative pbias values indicate underestimations by forecasts 3 2 anomaly correlation coefficient acc the acc is a widely used metric in the climate prediction community it measures the degree of association between forecast and observed deviation from the climatology the advantage of acc over some other metrics is that acc can separate effects due to the existence of forecast bias in evaluating forecast skill the acc score of 1 indicates that the forecast provides perfect information and a score of zero means the forecast contains no information at all the acc skill scores of the ensemble mean of each individual nmme 2 model and the sma of the grand ensemble are calculated following equation 2 murphy and epstein 1989 2 acc n x y x y n x 2 x 2 n y 2 y 2 where x is the forecast hindcast precipitation anomalies at a certain lead time and y is reference precipitation anomalies at the same lead time n is the total number of hindcasts forecast values made for that lead time and acc is the anomaly correlation coefficient skill score for the forecasts hindcasts 3 3 quantile probability of detection qpod quantile false alarm ratio qfar 3 3 1 quantile probability of detection qpod the qpod is a statistical evaluation measurement which is defined as the probability of detection pod above a certain quantile threshold aghakouchak et al 2011 wilks 2011 in this study we used the whole ensemble spreads of nmme 2 models to compute the qpod taking the cancm3 model and extreme events above 99 percentiles as an example cancm3 model produces ten forecast values at a certain time step and if any one of the ten forecast values has successfully forecasted an extreme event exceeded 99 quantile according to its own model output statistics it will be count as a hit the qpod has the advantage of ignoring the effect of forecast bias as it is a quantile based evaluation metric compared to the conventional probability of detection pod aghakouchak et al 2011 wilks 2011 the qpod ranges from 0 to 1 and the value of 1 is ideal indicating all extreme events above below a certain percentile threshold are successfully forecasted the qpod of single nmme 2 models and the grand ensemble of five nmme 2 models considering their whole ensemble spreads can be calculated with the following equation 3 3 qpod i 1 n j 1 m i x ij x j 99 i y i y 99 i 1 n i y i y 99 where n is the length of the forecast time series and m is the ensemble size of a certain forecast model x ij is the forecast value by j th ensemble member of a model at time step i and x j 99 is the 99 threshold of the j th ensemble member according to its own statistics similarly y i is the reference value at time step i and y 99 is the 99 threshold of the reference precipitation according to its own statistics i is the indicator function e g i t r u e 1 i f a l s e 0 and represent set operations e g 1 1 1 0 1 1 3 3 2 quantile false alarm ratio qfar the qfar is a categorical evaluation measurement which is defined as the false alarm ratio far above a certain quantile threshold mehran and aghakouchak 2014 in this study we used the whole ensemble spreads of nmme 2 models to compute the qfar again taking the cancm3 model as an example which has ten ensemble members the cancm3 model produces ten forecast values at a certain time step and if any one of the ten forecast values has made a forecast exceeded 99 quantile according to its own model output statistics while there s no extreme event happened according to the reference it will be count as a false alarm since adopting quantile thresholds the qfar also has the advantage of ignoring the effect of forecast bias compared to the conventional false alarm ratio far aghakouchak et al 2011 wilks 2011 the qfar ranges from 0 to 1 and the value of 0 is ideal indicating there s no false alarm at all the qfar of single nmme 2 models and the grand ensemble of five nmme 2 models considering their whole ensemble spreads can be calculated with the following equation 4 4 qfar i 1 n j 1 m i x ij x j 99 i y i y 99 i 1 n i y i y 99 where n is the length of the forecast time series and m is the ensemble size of a certain forecast model x ij is the forecast value by j th ensemble member of a model at time step i and x j 99 is the 99 threshold of the j th ensemble member according to its own statistics similarly y i is the reference value at time step i and y 99 is the 99 threshold of the reference precipitation according to its own statistics i is the indicator function e g i t r u e 1 i f a l s e 0 and represent set operations e g 1 1 1 0 1 1 3 3 3 benchmarking qpod and qfar in this study we benchmark the qpod and qfar values of historical resampled precipitation forecasts in predicting extreme precipitation events the historical resampled forecasts are commonly used as hydrometeorological inputs to the esp framework for hydrologic forecasts at s2s range assuming historical resampled precipitation forecast with an ensemble size of m if any single randomly drawn forecast values out of m forecasts values have successfully predicted an extreme event above below a certain threshold according to the historical statistics it will be counted as a hit similarly if any single randomly drawn forecast values out of m forecasts values contain a value above below a certain threshold while there s no such extreme events happened according to the reference it will be counted as a false alarm since historical resampled forecasts are randomly drawn values from historical records they are totally independent of the actual weather happened in the real world thus theoretically for any true positive and or true negative events the qpod and or qfar of historical resampled forecasts are the same and can be computed with equation 5 5 qpod resampledforecasts qfar resampledforecasts 1 0 99 m according to equation 5 the qpod resampledforecasts and qfar resampledforecasts with an ensemble size of 10 cancm3 cancm4 geos5 ccsm4 12 florb01 and 52 the grand ensemble of nmme 2 are 0 10 0 11 0 40 respectively for the extreme precipitation events above 99 or below 1 percentiles since the historical resampled forecasts randomly draw values from historical records their performances are only affected by the ensemble size but are independent of forecast lead times 4 results 4 1 forecast bias figure 2 presents the overall pbias of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts over conus it consists of the results from five individual nmme 2 models cancm3 cancm4 florb01 geos5 and ccsm4 and the sma of the grand ensemble of five nmme 2 models in fig 2 the positive bias in cooler colors blue is associated with overestimation and the negative bias in warmer colors red is associated with underestimation according to fig 2 the highest level of model pbias of the nmme 2 dataset appears in central and western u s and the forecast biases are relatively lower in eastern regions than that over the western regions this similar spatial variability of overall pbias can be observed across individual nmme 2 models and the sma in addition we notice that all five nmme 2 models demonstrate both positive and negative pbias with a mosaic like pattern over the northwest west west north central and southwest regions fig 2a e where the sierra nevada mountains and the rocky mountains ranges on the contrary across the northwest and southeast regions where appalachian mountain is located the geos5 model fig 2d demonstrates a significant level of overestimation while other nmme 2 models show a relatively smaller level of biases in the south region all five nmme 2 models are consistently underestimating precipitation the sma fig 2f has a very similar pattern of spatial variability in the overall pattern of pbias compared to the five individual single nmme 2 models the following fig 3 presents the pbias of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts across conus at different lead times i e week 1 to week 4 according to fig 3 only some minor differences are observed in different climate regions and no obvious lead time dependences of pbias are observed for all nmme 2 members at all lead times the spatial pattern of weekly pbias is very similar to the overall pattern of pbias observed in fig 2 the sma also shows similar behavior to the five individual nmme 2 models at all lead times combining the results from both figs 2 and 3 we observe that the overall model biases are not sensitive to lead times though individual model could be associated with different levels of pbias and the model errors are also spatially varying across the conus in the following fig 4 we present the seasonal pbias of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts over conus according to fig 4 both the individual nmme 2 model and the sma exhibit a strong pbias variation in different seasons over the conus and the individual model biases may demonstrate significant changes from positive to negative or vice versa when the season changes specifically in djf all nmme 2 models show significant overestimation at most parts of the northwest west west north central and southwest regions in mam the general behavior of the model overestimation is improved and the level of overestimation of all individual models decreased comparing to that in djf in mam we also notice that the spatial patterns of the obtained pbias are very similar to the overall patterns of pbias as shown in prior fig 2 suggesting the mam is the most representative season to show model s error variability in space in jja all nmme 2 models show a significant level of underestimation at the northwest west southwest south and west north central regions in son the level of the underestimation by all models are smaller than that in jja while the level of overestimation increased in the northwest region the results in fig 4 indicate that there are strong seasonal dependences of model pbias at different regions across conus especially in djf and jja some noticeable model discrepancies are observed in different seasons for example in son the cancm4 model exhibits a more significant level of underestimation than other nmme 2 models in the southeast south southwest and west north central regions in mam the geos5 model demonstrates a higher level of overestimation than other nmme 2 models in the west north central region while a higher level of underestimation is observed with the same geos5 model comparing to other models in the southwest south and southeast regions to better illustrate the large scale spatial patterns of model biases with a joint consideration of seasonality and lead time dependences we further computed and presented the regional averaged pbias values of nmme 2 over nine ncei climate regions for different seasons djf mam jja and son and lead times weeks 1 4 in the following fig 5 in fig 5 the cooler colors indicate overestimation while the warmer colors indicate underestimation the numbers in each cell of fig 5 indicate the actual pbias values obtained for each model lead time and season according to the heat map of fig 5 the largest overestimations made by all nmme 2 models occur in the west north central region in djf and significant underestimations are observed in the warmer seasons of son and jja at most of the regions over conus except for the northwest the layout pattern of nine ncei climate regions in fig 5 from left to right is consistent with the geographic patterns of those regions in the real world layout from west to east according to the quantitative values presented in fig 5 from left to right there is an obvious decreasing trend of pbias from west to east this numerical trend and decreasing pattern are more obvious than that of different seasonality and lead times specifically the overall overestimation in the northwest west and west north central regions observed in fig 2 appears to be mainly contributed by the overestimations that occurred in djf and the underestimation observed in fig 2 appears to be mainly contributed by the underestimations that occurred in warmer seasons of jja and son in terms of the different lead times we found that the pbias values are not sensitive to the lead times since the colors of grid boxes in fig 5 remain rather consistent along the x axis within most of the subplots in jja and son only cancm4 florb01 ccsm4 and sma models show some noticeable variations of pbias over lead times in the west the west north central and the southwest regions 4 2 forecast skill to evaluate the forecast skills of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts at different lead times week 1 to week 4 across conus we calculated the acc values of the ensemble means of five nmme 2 models and the sma of the grand ensemble of nmme 2 the results are presented in fig 6 in fig 6 warmer colors indicate higher acc scores and cooler colors indicate lower acc scores the red colored numbers on the lower right corners of each subplot in fig 6 are the spatially averaged acc value over the entire conus according to the results in fig 6 except for the florb01 the forecast skill of all other nmme 2 models shows a decreasing trend over lead times as their conus averaged acc values decrease rapidly from week 1 0 34 to 0 43 to week 2 0 19 to 0 26 and the skill score remains at a marginal level at week 3 0 10 to 0 17 and week 4 0 09 to 0 10 the conus averaged acc values of florb01 are consistently lower than other nmme 2 models especially at week 1 and week 2 the sma shows a higher forecast skill than any other individual nmme 2 models at all lead times over the entire conus in addition the results in fig 6 also indicate that spatially all nmme 2 models have the highest forecast skill over the coastal areas in the northwest and west regions as compared to other regions in conus higher acc values can be observed in the northwest west west north central and some part of the southwest central regions as compared with the conus averaged acc values however the acc values in the south central some parts of the southwest and northeast regions are consistently lower than in other regions especially at the longer lead times i e week 2 to week 4 in the following fig 7 we present the acc values in different seasons of a djf b mam c jja and d son at different lead times week 1 to week 4 the difference between fig 7 and fig 6 is that the prior fig 6 differentiated the forecast lead times but did not separate the forecasts made in different seasons in fig 7 we further grouped the forecasts into different seasons and lead times for evaluation the warmer colors in fig 7 indicate higher acc scores and cooler colors in fig 7 indicate lower acc scores and the red colored numbers on the lower right corners of each subplot in fig 7 are the spatially averaged acc value over the entire conus in fig 7 the weekly pattern of the acc values in all seasons generally follows similar behaviors as that shown in fig 6 the acc values of the nmme 2 models decrease rapidly from week 1 to week 2 and show marginal forecast skill in week 3 and week 4 in all seasons the florb01 is still an outlier compared with the other nmme 2 models as it continuously presents lower conus averaged acc values the sma of nmme 2 shows the highest conus averaged acc values at almost all lead times in all seasons it is also found that there are seasonal dependences in the forecast skills according to the lead times taking sma results as an example the highest acc values at week 1 and week 3 are observed in djf and mam respectively although overall marginal forecast skill is observed at week 3 and week 4 in all seasons a moderate forecast skill 0 3 to 0 4 can be observed at some areas within different seasons in addition at week 3 and week 4 moderate forecast skills are observed i over the south southwest some parts of the west the west north central and the southeast in djf ii over the north central the south and the coastal area of the west regions in mam iii over the southwest and the west north central regions in jja and iv over the northwest and the coastal areas of the west regions in son respectively figure 8 presents the regionally averaged acc scores of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts in different seasons djf mam jja and son and at different lead times week 1 to week 4 over nine ncei climate regions in fig 8 the lighter colors indicate lower acc values and the darker colors indicate higher acc values the numbers in the figure are the actual acc scores similar to the presentation of fig 5 fig 8 follows the pattern that the layout of nine ncei climate regions from left to right in fig 8 corresponds to the real world geography from western to eastern u s per the real world layout the results in fig 8 indicate a spatially varying pattern of the precipitation forecast skill of nmme 2 models when the seasonality and lead time dependences are jointly considered specifically in fig 8 there is a significant decreasing trend of acc values from the west to the east especially in mam and jja in addition we observe that the acc values are relatively higher at the shortest lead time i e week 1 as compared to that at longer lead times i e week 2 to week 4 across all regions and seasons according to fig 8 in general the highest overall acc value is likely to appear in the winter season i e djf on the contrary the nmme 2 models tend to produce the lowest forecast skill in the summer season i e jja except for the northwest and southwest regions except for the florb01 model all other nmme 2 models show similar behaviors in most of the neci climate regions and the different models show similar performances over most of the lead times the sma shows the highest acc values than any single nmme 2 models under most of the scenarios which is expected as the sma approach can eliminate the outliners and produce a more conservative forecast as compared to each single nmme 2 model as a summary of this section 3 2 the following three important findings are evidenced by the presented results 1 the nmme 2 precipitation forecast skill consistently decreases over the lead times across the conus in all seasons 2 the raw forecast skill of nmme 2 dataset is generally higher in cooler seasons than that in warmer seasons and 3 spatially the raw forecast skill of all five employed nmme 2 models tends to be higher in western regions than in eastern regions across the conus and the performance of different models is similar to each other except for the florb01 model 4 3 capability in predicting extreme precipitation events we evaluate the nmme 2 models capabilities in predicting extreme precipitation events using the qpod and qfar here we obtain and analyze the nmme 2 models capabilities in predicting extreme precipitation events above 99 and below 1 percentiles respectively the results for extreme precipitation events above 95 and below 5 percentiles are available in the supplementary materials for interested readers 4 3 1 extreme events above 99 threshold the following fig 9 presents the qpod of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts in predicting extreme precipitation events above 99 threshold over conus at different lead times in fig 9 the warmer colors indicate higher qpod values and red colored numbers at the lower right corners of each subplot is the spatially averaged qpod values over the entire conus the results from fig 9 indicate that the qpod patterns of different nmme 2 models are generally similar to each other with only minor discrepancies at forecast lead time of week 1 both the geos5 and ccsm4 model generally show higher qpod values than other nmme 2 models at week 1 according to the numerical qpod values on each subplot rows all nmme 2 models except for the florb01 exhibit a decreasing trend of qpod value over the lead times the florb01 model produces the lowest qpod value in week 1 but the qpod value increases from 0 11 to 0 20 over lead time spatially the qpod values at the coastal areas of the northwest and the west regions are higher than those over other regions at all lead times this result is consistent with the acc evaluation result presented in the previous section 3 2 the qpod values of the grand ensemble of 5 nmme 2 models a total of 52 ensemble members are presented in the last row in fig 9 the ensemble results show that there is a significant increase in the qpod values of the grand ensemble compared to individual nmme 2 models with smaller ensemble sizes figure 10 presents the qfar of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts in predicting extreme precipitation events above 99 percentiles over conus at different lead times in fig 10 the cooler colors indicate higher qfar values and red colored numbers at the lower right corners of each subplot is the spatially averaged qfar values over the entire conus note that in contrary to qpod lower qfar values indicate more superior performance in terms of predicting extremes according to fig 10 all single nmme 2 models qfar values are around or less than 0 1 across the conus the geos5 and ccsm4 model which shows slightly higher qpod values than other nmme 2 models also demonstrate relatively higher qfar values comparing to the spatially averaged qfar values within different rows in fig 10 all nmme 2 models exhibit an increasing trend of qfar value over the lead times spatially qfar values are lower than average over the coastal areas of the northwest and the west regions at all lead times this result is consistent with the acc evaluation result presented in the previous section 3 2 the qfar values of the grand ensemble of five nmme 2 models a total of 52 ensemble members are presented in the last row in fig 10 the result shows that with a larger ensemble size the false alarm ratios of the grand ensemble of nmme 2 are significantly larger than any single nmme 2 models we also compare the qpod and qfar of nmme 2 models five nmme 2 models and grand ensemble with the benchmark values from resampled forecasts as presented in table 2 by comparing the nmme 2 qpod and qfar values with the benchmark values of the historical resampled forecasts we can see all individual nmme 2 models and the grand ensemble of nmme 2 have shown superior performances in predicting extreme events exceeded 99 percentiles all nmme 2 models have shown higher qpod and lower qfar than the benchmarks although larger ensemble sizes may bring higher qpod values it also increases qfar values higher qpod values indicate higher chances of coverages of extreme precipitation events above 99 percentiles by the ensemble spreads of precipitation forecasts nmme 2 or historical resampled forecasts lower qfar values indicate that when the ensemble spreads of precipitation forecasts reached above 99 percentiles there are higher chances of such extreme events eventually happen 4 3 2 extreme events below 1 threshold figure 11 presents the qpod of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts in predicting extreme precipitation events below 1 percentiles over conus at different lead times in fig 11 the warmer colors indicate higher qpod values and red colored numbers at the lower right corners of each subplot is the spatially averaged qpod values over the entire conus according to fig 11 for all individual nmme 2 models marginal qpod values are observed at most regions of conus relatively higher qpod values are only observed for certain models in certain regions and at certain lead times for example cancm4 model shows higher qpod values in the southwest region at all lead times geos 5 also presents slightly higher qpod values at some locations in the southwest southeast and northeast regions at week 1 and week 2 the qpod of the grand ensemble of nmme 2 presented at the last row of fig 11 shows significantly higher qpod compared to single nmme 2 models over the entire conus at all lead times figure 12 below presents the qfar with a 1 percentile threshold of nmme 2 precipitation hindcasts over conus at different lead times in fig 12 the cooler colors indicate higher qfar values and red colored numbers at the lower right corners of each subplot is the spatially averaged qfar values over the entire conus the overall qfar patterns are similar to the overall qpod patterns shown in fig 11 marginal qfar values are observed at most of regions in conus for all individual nmme 2 models higher qfar values are only found for certain models and at certain regions mirroring fig 11 cancm4 and geos5 show higher qfar values at some locations in the southwest region at all lead times the qfar value of the grand ensemble of nmme 2 which is presented at the last row of fig 11 is significantly higher than that of each individual nmme 2 models over the conus we also compare the qpod and qfar of nmme 2 models five nmme 2 models and grand ensemble in predicting extreme events below 1 percentile thresholds with the benchmark values from resampled forecasts as presented in table 3 comparing the nmme 2 qpod and qfar values with the benchmark values of the historical resampled forecasts from table 3 all individual nmme 2 models show higher qpod values than the benchmark however the qpod values of the grand ensemble of nmme 2 are slightly lower than but still comparable to the benchmarks higher qpod values indicate higher chances of coverages of extreme precipitation events below 1 percentiles by the ensemble spreads of precipitation forecasts nmme 2 or historical resampled forecasts and vice versa lower qfar values indicated that when the ensemble spreads of precipitation forecasts fall below 1 percentiles that there are higher chances that such extreme events may eventually happen considering both qpod and qfar values it is reasonable to say that the nmme 2 still presents overall better performances in predicting extreme events below 1 percentiles than the benchmark does 5 discussion the pbias result shown in prior sections 3 1 and 3 2 can be explained along with the geographical characteristics and rainfall mechanisms of the conus the overall pattern of pbias in the winter djf season showed significant overestimations in the northwest the west and west north central regions for these regions precipitation events are dominated by synoptic scale extratropical cyclones ecs and atmospheric rivers ars related weathers in cooler seasons zhang et al 2019 a number of previous studies have reported that gcms tend to produce too much low volume precipitation in comparison with reference also known as the drizzle effect when simulating synoptic precipitation events hill 1993 maraun 2013 thus the authors suspect the observed overestimations at the above mentioned regions in cooler seasons are largely due to the drizzle effect however other studies also suggest gcms tend to underestimate high volume precipitations related to convective weather systems in the western us e g norris et al 2021 in this regard our evaluation is limited as it only reflects aggregated biases of precipitation forecasts from nmme 2 which entangles all potential affecting factors thus more detailed examinations of nmme 2 at regions in the western u s should be carried out to attribute the sources of bias in a more rigorous way although significant overestimation was generally observed in the djf there were also underestimations in some areas within the same regions in djf these mixed behaviors of over and under estimations could be attributed to the complex terrains brought by the sierra nevada mountain and the rocky mountain which are likely to trigger orographic precipitations with the nearby climatic regions this also suggests that the raw coarse spatial resolution of nmme 2 should be considered through proper bias corrections and downscaling before any further hydrologic applications in contrast the pbias patterns in djf an overall underestimation of precipitation from nmme 2 was observed in the south the southwest and part of the west north central regions in warmer seasons especially in jja these regions lie in the middle of the continent with nearly half of the precipitation contributed by mesoscale convective systems mcss in warmer seasons easterling et al 2017 fritsch et al 1986 nesbitt et al 2006 however the convection systems are neither perfectly parameterized nor resolved for most of the gcms moncrieff 2019 moreover mcss with even smaller spatial scales normally operate within typical gcm grids which surpass the capability of gcms and esms eden et al 2012 as a result it is reasonable to suspect the observed underestimations at the south the southwest and part of the west north central regions in warmer seasons are associated with sub grid convective precipitation events regarding the obtained forecast skill results one major discrepancy was identified between florb01 and other nmme 2 models as shown in fig 6 the florb01 model showed consistently lower forecast skill throughout all lead times while other nmme 2 models showed higher forecast skill at week 1 and rapidly decreased to marginal levels at week 3 and week 4 this result agrees with the previous evaluation study upon monthly nmme 1 precipitation forecasts by slater et al 2019 in which the authors found the florb01 model sometimes does not display higher skill at the shortest lead time one month the obtained result in our study further shown that within the one month lead time i e week 1 to week 4 the florb01 model still presents poorer performances compared with other nmme models our obtained results fig 9 also exhibit that the application of the grand ensemble with larger ensemble sizes generally shows better statistics than individual nmme 2 models with smaller ensemble sizes this observation strongly supports the hypothesis that creating a grand model ensemble with a larger ensemble size through multiple techniques e g multi model perturbed physics and perturbed initial conditions etc will effectively increase precipitation forecast skill and reliability the spatial dependences of forecast skill of all employed nmme 2 model are evident higher acc values were observed over the coastal areas of the northwest the west and west north central regions at all lead times within these regions the winter precipitation is mainly associated with cyclonic synoptic scale weathers cayan and roads 1984 because of the life cycle of cyclones and their large spatial scales the corresponding precipitation events are generally easier for gcms to predict compared to other types of precipitation events i e convective and orographic kumar et al 2011 zhu et al 2014 even at longer lead times week 2 to week 4 the acc values at these regions are still higher than at other regions it is also noticeable that the regions and seasons observed overestimations seem more likely to achieve higher forecast skills if cross observing fig 5 and fig 8 our results regarding the extreme events suggest that there is a good potential of nmme 2 forecasts to be used for hydrologic applications at the s2s range at the s2s range precipitation forecasts generally do not show reliable forecast skills and cannot be used deterministically and for this reason ensemble precipitation forecasts with the ability to cover the extreme events with their ensemble spreads are widely used thus from a practical point of view the abilities of ensemble precipitation forecasts in predicting extreme events become extremely important according to table 2 and table 3 most nmme 2 models show superior qpod and qfar values compared to the benchmark when predicting extreme precipitation events above 99 percentiles and below 1 percentiles nmme 2 show less dominant performances when predicting events below 1 percentiles compared to predicting events above 99 percentiles which indicates that nmme 2 may be better at predicting floods than predicting droughts but overall speaking nmme 2 still appears to be a better option with generally higher probabilities of detections and lower false alarm ratios of predicting extreme events than the historical resampled forecasts this finding suggests that nmme 2 may be a better fit to the esp framework than historical resample forecasts in terms of hydrologic predictions at the s2s range it is also noteworthy to mention that the grand ensemble of nmme 2 models should provide more information for water resources planning at the s2s range to mitigate the impacts from floods and droughts compared to individual nmme 2 models nonetheless many challenges remain when applying the nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecast on hydrologic modeling and real world water resources planning the first issue that needs to be addressed is the substantial forecast bias although our result has demonstrated good potentials of nmme 2 in predicting extreme events the raw forecast values need to be bias corrected before assisting real world flood predictions brown and seo 2010 tiwari et al 2021 currently most of the popular bias correction approaches heavily rely on the stationary assumption where statistical moments are generalized from the historical records and will be used to correct the raw forecast values teutschbein and seibert 2012 however some recent studies have identified trends in not only frequencies but also magnitudes of extreme precipitation events in various regions over the globe madsen et al 2014 miao et al 2015 sun et al 2014b which likely undermines the efficacy of existing approaches in bias correcting extreme precipitation forecast values and the authors believe properly considering the non stationary in bias correction especially for extreme values might be a major challenge for future studies great efforts have also been made to to improve the marginal forecast skill of the s2s precipitation forecasts by utilizing hydrometeorological forecasts from multiple sources and models to assist ensemble hydrologic forecasting we believe that one promising direction is to construct a super nmme 2 ensemble and further apply more sophisticated multi model averaging techniques to improve the forecast data quality ji et al 2020 sloughter et al 2007 yang et al 2018 multi model ensemble with proper data quality control could further increase the precipitation forecast skill across different temporal and spatial resolutions based on the obtained results in this study we observe that in most of the cases the sma method can produce slightly higher forecast skills than any individual nmme 2 models at all lead times nevertheless the improvements of sma are still limited over individual models authors believe that advanced model ensemble technique needs to be used together with the fundamental enhancements of the gcms and esms which provide better precipitation predictability and less system and random errors in the s2s forecasts for example this could be done by advancing the current land surface components of gcms dirmeyer et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 or through better sub grid convective parameterizations eden et al 2012 from the perspective of hydrology community exploiting the benefits of deep learning techniques to post process s2s precipitation forecasts might be another feasible alternative akbari asanjan et al 2018 weyn et al 2021 given the slow advances in fundamentally enhancing the physical dynamics of coupled gcms or esms most of the previous studies have tried to correct the bias of gcm generated precipitation forecast separately without considering the forecast skill however our study implies that the forecasts bias and forecast skill are somehow connected with each other the performance of precipitation forecasts can essentially be attributed to different climate and weather patterns and mechanisms eden et al 2012 kirtman et al 2014a only correcting bias may lead to degradation of forecast skills mendoza et al 2017 recently it has been reported that taking the advantage of deep learning techniques to handle additional resolved atmospheric forecast variables to improve the s2s precipitation forecast skills first then correcting the bias may provide some major improvements miao et al 2019 pan et al 2019a given the recent development of artificial intelligence and other statistical tools from computer science the uses of machine learning methods to improve the nmme 2 s2s daily precipitation forecasts may provide a variable way leading to successful forecast adaptations for hydrologic applications these new machine learning approaches allow auxiliary information to be considered during the bias correction process such as the forecast lead times seasonality regional factors and relevant atmospheric forecast variables which are all found to be important factors in improving the accuracy of s2s precipitation forecasts pertinent to the presented sensitivity analysis in our study over the conus last but not least it is also important for hydrologists to apply the improved and corrected s2s precipitation forecasts for hydrologic forecasts at watersheds with different hydrometeorological conditions spatial and temporal resolutions cao et al 2021 li et al 2019 after the necessary post processing and bias corrections we encourage practitioners to apply other popular metrics such as the mean squared error the ranked probabilistic skill score rpss the continuous rpss crpss and other categorical skill metrics including the false alarm ratio far the probability of detection pod the critical success index csi and equitable threat score etc and etc to conduct more detailed examinations of s2s precipitation forecasts on daily basis for regional studies this would overcome the limitation of our study in which only the nmme 2 s2s forecasts on a weekly basis are studied with a limited number of evaluation metrics one of the major motivations for our study is to identify trends and quantify the data quality of the nmme 2 forecasts over the entire conus and therefore the streamflow simulation capabilities and forecast data improvements will be investigated in future studies to summary the authors believe future studies on nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecasts may include 1 proper bias corrections and downscaling of the nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecasts at different regions across the conus 2 application of deep learning approaches to provide more accurate and reliable nmme 2 precipitation forecasts especially at longer lead times 3 hydrologic applications of the nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecasts with esp framework to further investigate the efficacy of nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecasts over traditional historical resample forecasts in streamflow forecasting 6 conclusion in this study the s2s precipitation forecasts of nmme 2 are comprehensively evaluated across conus and during a hindcast period of 1982 2011 both deterministic evaluations of forecast bias pbias and forecast skill acc and probabilistic evaluations aiming at the extreme precipitation events qpod qfar have been conducted the spatial seasonal and lead time dependence of the performances of nmme 2 daily precipitation forecasts have been analyzed over nine ncei climate regions the extreme precipitation performances of five nmme 2 models are also evaluated against benchmark resampled historical forecasts our results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecast and its potential for hydrologic applications the major findings and conclusions of this study are summarized below 1 the nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecasts show substantial biases across conus the forecast biases also demonstrate strong spatial and seasonal dependences but we found the biases are not sensitive to forecast lead times five individual nmme 2 models and the sma of their grand ensemble show similar spatial bias patterns across the conus based on our spatial analysis significant overestimations of the nmme 2 forecasts are observed in the western northwest west and west north central regions in djf season and significant model underestimations are identified in the south region of conus in warmer seasons of jja and son 2 in terms of forecast skill a major discrepancy exists between the florb01 and the rest of nmme 2 models specifically the florb01 model consistently shows a lower precipitation forecast skill especially at week 1 and week 2 lead times as compared to other nmme 2 models the forecast skill of the rest of nmme 2 models is the highest at week 1 tends to decrease rapidly from week 1 to week 2 and remains at a marginal level at week 3 and week 4 across all regions and in all seasons spatially all nmme 2 models show higher forecast skills in the western areas northwest and west regions the sma of five nmme 2 members shows better deterministic forecast skill than any single nmme 2 model under most comparison scenarios 3 the nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecasts also show better potentials in predicting extreme above 99 and below 1 precipitation events at all lead times compared to historical resampled forecasts in addition the formation of a grand ensemble of nmme 2 with a bigger ensemble size can further increase the performance of nmme 2 in predicting extreme events therefore we believe the grand ensemble of nmme 2 s2s precipitation forecasts is a good alternative to the historical resampled forecast within the esp framework for hydrologic applications 4 our study has presented more detailed evaluations of the precipitation forecasts from nmme 2 within one month week 1 to week 4 compared to previous evaluations of nmme 1 monthly precipitation forecasts across the entire conus and our evaluation results should be able to serve as an important reference for future hydrologic related studies utilizing nmme 2 at watershed scales

4084,rapid urbanization has great potential to adversely impact the local hydrological cycle the environment and ecosystems as well as trigger severe problems such as urban flooding waterlogging and water contamination understanding runoff generation mechanisms in urban areas helps identify the impacts of urbanization on runoff response and better simulate urban floods however in most urban hydrological models urban surfaces are coarsely classified into impervious and pervious ones which likely ignores differential rainfall runoff responses of different urban surfaces and leads to large discrepancies between simulated and observed runoff here we developed the tvgm urban model a new urban hydrological model based on the time variant gain model tvgm that represents nonlinear rainfall runoff relationships for different urban surfaces we applied the model to the fenghuangcheng region of shenzhen city china and compared the results to those of two commonly used urban hydrological models the horton infiltration and soil conservation service curve number scscn model for each of these models we conducted model uncertainty analysis using the glue method the results showed that the tvgm urban model outperformed the other two models in terms of total runoff and peak flow this could be due to the consideration of different land covers and both saturation excess and infiltration excess runoff generation in the tvgm urban model in addition the uncertainty analysis indicated better performance of the tvgm urban model in reducing structural uncertainty and prediction uncertainty this study highlights the need to account for detailed land covers and different runoff generation mechanisms in urban hydrological modeling keywords urban floods tvgm urban model horton infiltration model scscn model land cover 1 introduction urbanization is commonly associated with alterations of the land surface resulting in increased impervious surfaces and population density relative to undeveloped conditions voter and loheide 2018 zhao et al 2019 these alterations can profoundly impact the environment and ecosystem by increasing peak flows and the amount of runoff produced across the landscape reducing the time to peak of floods thereby triggering urban floods and accelerating the transport of contaminants into receiving waters hobbie et al 2017 salerno et al 2018 xia et al 2017 yin et al 2016 however the rainfall runoff response relationships are complicated in urban areas with various land covers and changes in land cover areas due to urbanization can largely affect the rainfall runoff relationship in urban areas and increase the possibility of urban flooding liu et al 2020a marjo et al 2014 xia et al 2017 understanding the runoff generation process of different land covers in urban areas can be beneficial for accurately forecasting the volume and peak flow of urban floods which can help identify the possible flooding areas thereby mitigating the losses caused by urban floods qin et al 2013 ren et al 2020 wu 2014 zhang et al 2018b in response to the policy and flood management needs in urban areas many hydrological models have been proposed to improve the scientific understanding of the urban runoff generation process elliott and trowsdale 2007 jacobson 2011 o donnell et al 2020 rossman 2010 one category of urban hydrological models such as the regional hydro ecologic simulation system rhessys parflow clm and the surface urban energy balance scheme suews use physical governing equations to simulate the movement of water including the three dimensional movement of water within the subsurface and the interaction with other hydrological fluxes järvi et al 2017 voter and loheide 2018 these models are not widely used in urban flood simulation and management due to strict requirements for computation and input data another type of urban hydrological models such as the storm water management model swmm mike urban and citycat bisht et al 2016 glenis et al 2018 rossman 2010 use the concept of urban catchments and employ some widely used runoff generation models based on infiltration excess generation such as the horton infiltration model horton 1941 green ampt infiltration model green and ampt 1911 and soil conservation service curve number scscn model bedient and huber 1992 to describe the rainfall runoff response in urban areas these models have been employed by many studies in urban flood simulation because of their convenient application and acceptable performance knighton et al 2016 ren et al 2020 suribabu and bhaskar 2015 wu et al 2016 yin et al 2020 zhang et al 2018a however there are two main shortcomings in the runoff generation of current popular urban hydrological models that may affect the precision of urban flood simulation the first one is that the underlying surface is simply classified into two types i e permeable and impervious areas for runoff generation in most infiltration excess based hydrological models behrouz et al 2019 chen et al 2018 rossman 2010 however this coarse classification may be less accurate for runoff simulation in some urban areas as rainfall runoff relationships may be different in various permeable underlying surfaces ahiablame et al 2012 deepak et al 2016 ozdemir and elbas 2015 for example the rainfall runoff relationships between bare soil and vegetation areas are different as they have different infiltration capacity soil porosity and saturated soil moisture content lim 2016 ren et al 2020 a more detailed classification of underlying surfaces can better capture the characteristics of the rainfall runoff response relationship in urban areas which can improve the performance in flood simulation yu et al 2018 the application of only infiltration excess models for runoff generation is another shortcoming in most current urban hydrological models there is no direct correlation between the runoff generation mode and the type of permeable underlying surface as both infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff can occur in permeable areas hettiarachchi et al 2019 lim 2016 miles and band 2015 for example permeable areas with sufficient antecedent soil moisture have the potential to produce the saturation excess runoff ehsan et al 2019 peel 2009 qin et al 2013 and the infiltration excess runoff can occur in permeable areas with low porosity and hydraulic conductivity gregory et al 2006 pitt et al 2008 thus the application of infiltration excess models may not be capable to accurately describe the rainfall runoff response relationships for urban areas with complicated underlying surfaces a hydrological model that better reflects the rainfall runoff response of different urban surfaces may more accurately describe the urban runoff generation process in this study considering the shortcomings of current urban hydrological models we developed the tvgm urban model a new urban hydrological model that represents rainfall runoff responses for different categories of urban surfaces tvgm urban is based on the time variant gain model tvgm which is a simple but efficient systematic method with a few parameters to describe the nonlinear relationship between rainfall and runoff wang et al 2009 xia 2002 xia et al 1997 many studies have documented that the tvgm can obtain satisfactory flood simulation results in both humid and arid basins ning et al 2016 song et al 2017 wang et al 2009 ye et al 2015 however the original tvgm considers the whole basin as one system and cannot reflect the difference in runoff generation of different land covers the newly proposed tvgm urban model classifies the urban surface into distinct categories for runoff generation simulation thus compared with the tvgm and most urban hydrological models the tvgm urban model can better describe the rainfall runoff relationships of different land covers in urban areas here we tested the tvgm urban model in the fenghuangcheng region of shenzhen city china a humid region with rapid urbanization the study area has experienced severe storms and urban floods during the past several years wu 2016 xiong et al 2018 the objectives of this study are to 1 develop a new urban hydrological model the tvgm urban model that accounts for the effects of different land covers on urban runoff generation 2 evaluate the performance and uncertainties of the tvgm urban model in urban flood simulation for the study area in comparison with two other widely used urban hydrological models and 3 investigate the impacts of land cover changes on runoff generation under the design rainfall event using the tvgm urban model this study presents new ideas and methods for urban hydrological model development and urban flood simulation which can provide scientific support for urban flood forecasting and mitigate the potential economic losses resulting from floods and waterlogging 2 materials and methods 2 1 urban hydrological models the tvgm urban model and two widely used conceptual models the horton infiltration and scscn models were applied to evaluate the performance of urban flood simulation in addition we used the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method to investigate the uncertainties of the three models 2 1 1 hydrological models a the tvgm urban model the tvgm is a conceptual hydrological model that performs acceptably in both humid and arid basins li et al 2010 ning et al 2016 wang et al 2009 xia 2002 ye et al 2015 it considers the entire basin as one system and employs an exponential function to reveal the response relationship between rainfall and runoff for the whole basin the runoff is calculated by 1 r g 1 w w m g 2 p where r mm w mm and p mm are the runoff soil moisture and rainfall respectively wm mm is the saturated soil moisture content g1 and g2 are runoff generation parameters the discharge at the outlet of the basin is usually calculated by the unit hydrograph approach xia 2002 xia et al 1997 however the tvgm cannot be directly applied to the urban areas because it does not consider the complicated land covers in urban areas in addition the unit hydrograph in tvgm is not appropriate for the urban areas with the pipeline network instead of the river network thus we developed the tvgm urban model which addresses these two shortcomings of the tvgm for urban areas compared to the tvgm the tvgm urban model can consider the rainfall runoff relationships of various land covers and the runoff routing in the drainage pipeline network as shown in fig 1 the tvgm urban model comprises two modules surface runoff generation and urban runoff routing in the surface runoff generation module according to the widely used classification of land covers in urban areas chang et al 2015 sarah et al 2017 vercruysse et al 2019 the land cover is classified into four categories buildings roads bare soil and vegetation considering the prevalence of green roofs and other storage infrastructures in buildings in recent years the runoff from buildings is calculated using eq 2 2 r bs α bs m a x 0 d t d m d t d t 1 p r a t i o s bs r bi α bi r a t i o bi p r b r bs r bi where rb mm is the runoff from buildings rbs mm and rbi mm are runoff from buildings with storage infrastructures and buildings with impermeable roofs respectively d t mm is the storage water in the storage infrastructures at time t dm mm is the minimum storage for outflow ratiobi and ratiobs are the ratios of building areas with impervious roofs and storage infrastructures to the total urban catchment area respectively αbi and αbs represent the runoff coefficient of the buildings with impervious roofs and storage infrastructures respectively which both range from 0 to 1 the runoff from roads uses a similar method as the runoff calculation for buildings with impermeable roofs 3 r r α r r a t i o r p where ratior is the ratio of the road area to the total urban catchment area αr represents the runoff coefficient of the road which ranges from 0 to 1 we directly employ the runoff generation module in the tvgm to calculate the runoff generated by vegetated land cover as runoff in the vegetated land cover has a close relationship with changes in soil moisture the runoff from the vegetated land cover is calculated as follows 4 r v g v 1 w v w vm g v 2 p r a t i o v where ratiov is the ratio of the vegetation area to the total urban catchment area wv mm and wvm mm are the soil moisture content and the saturated soil moisture content in the vegetation respectively gv1 and gv2 are runoff generation parameters related to the vegetated land cover compared with vegetated lands bare soils generally have lower porosity and hydraulic conductivity due to construction activities and foot traffic gregory et al 2006 pitt et al 2008 voter and loheide 2018 which implies that the runoff may be closely related to the rainfall intensity jiao et al 2017 pang et al 2020 tasdighi et al 2018 therefore we add rainfall intensity to the original tvgm to represent the impact of rainfall intensity on runoff generated by bare soils 5 r s g s 1 w s w sm g s 2 i i m g s 3 p r a t i o s where ws mm and wsm mm are the soil moisture content and saturated soil moisture content in bare soil areas respectively i mm min and im mm min are the rainfall intensity and the maximum rainfall intensity determined from the historical statistics during the same one month respectively ratios is the ratio of the bare soil area to the total urban catchment area gs1 and gs2 are runoff generation parameters related to the bare soil gs3 is the rainfall intensity adjustment parameter the meanings of parameters in the tvgm urban model are shown in table 1 gv1 and gs1 ranging from 0 to 1 represent the average runoff generation coefficient of the vegetation and the bare soil respectively in general a greater value of gv1 or gs1 represents a higher conversion rate from rainfall to runoff of the vegetation or the bare soil gv2 and gs2 denote the impacts of soil moisture on runoff generation of the vegetation and the bare soil respectively both gv2 and gs2 range from 0 to 1 with 0 representing no soil moisture effect on runoff generation w s w sm 0 1 and 1 representing a linear soil moisture effect on runoff generation r s w s w sm under the same soil moisture condition a higher gv2 or gs2 1 leads to lower surface runoff as w s w sm 1 the exponent gs3 between 0 and 1 reflects the impact of rainfall intensity on runoff similar to gv2 or gs2 when gs3 approaches 0 the effect of rainfall intensity on runoff generation would be neglected whereas a higher gs3 would amplify the importance of rainfall intensity in controlling runoff generation im is employed to normalize the rainfall intensity into the range of 0 to 1 the higher values of αbi αbs and αr mean the more runoff generated by the buildings with impervious roofs the buildings with storage infrastructures and the road respectively the initial soil moisture of the vegetated and bare soils for one flood event is determined by the antecedent precipitation 6 p a t k a p a t 1 p t w vi min w vm p a r a t i o s v w si min w sm p a r a t i o s s where pa t mm indicates the antecedent precipitation at time t wvi mm and wsi mm are the initial soil moisture of the vegetation and the bare soil respectively ka is the dimensionless recession coefficient according to the previous studies fedora and beschta 1989 wang et al 2002 ka is set to 0 9 and the antecedent precipitation for one flood event is calculated by the 72 hour precipitation before the onset of this flood the runoff routing module contains overland flow routing and runoff routing in the drainage pipeline network which are calculated by the manning formula and saint venant equation in most urban hydrological models respectively aryal et al 2016 rossman 2010 however these methods require detailed information on the drainage pipeline network which is difficult to acquire in many cities in china thus we employed the equivalent drainage system routing approach zhang et al 2018b as an alternative runoff routing method when it is difficult to obtain specific drainage system information the flow routing between different types of land covers is ignored in this study because we focus more on the flow at the outlet of the pipeline network thus the total runoff of an urban catchment can be calculated as the sum of the runoff from different land covers 7 r r b r r r v r s where r mm denotes the total runoff of an urban catchment the equivalent drainage system routing approach contains the concepts of both surface flow routing and flow routing in the pipeline network and the flow routing discharge q m3 s at the outlet of the pipeline network can be estimated as follows 8 q k q c p a 86 4 q c p p i r p p i 8 64 167 a 1 1 a 2 l g p r t pcp b n t pcp 1 m 1 t overl where qcp mm day denotes the daily drainage capacity in the urban pipeline network a km2 is the catchment area pi mm day is the design rainfall intensity corresponding to the construction standard of the local pipeline network and pr year is the corresponding return period of the design storm tpcp min and toverl min are the duration of design storm and surface flow routing time respectively a1 mm lg year a2 min n 1 b min and n parameters to be determined the toverl can be determined by the overland slope and length of the catchment as indicated by zhang et al 2018b a1 mm lg year a2 min n 1 b min n and pr are the parameters that can be determined by the storm intensity equation of the study city and the urban drainage system design handbook bmedi 2004 thus only the adjusted parameter of flow routing duration in the drainage network m1 and the coverage factor of drainage network k need further calibration in the flood simulation for a specific catchment b horton infiltration model the horton infiltration model has been widely used for runoff calculations in many urban catchments behrouz et al 2019 li et al 2014 ren et al 2020 wu et al 2016 yao et al 2016 this model assumes an inverse exponential equation for the infiltration capacity as rainfall continues the horton infiltration equation is described as follows 9 f t f c f 0 f c e k d t where f t mm h is the infiltration capacity at time t and kd is the soil decay constant f0 mm h and fc mm h are the initial value of infiltration capacity at the beginning of a rainfall event and the stable infiltration capacity respectively this equation means that the infiltration capacity will gradually decrease to a constant value when the rainfall duration increases to infinity the surface runoff in permeable areas is calculated as the difference between the rainfall rate and the infiltration rate when the rainfall rate is higher than the infiltration rate while the infiltration rate in the impervious areas is set to zero the equivalent drainage system routing approach is also used for runoff routing in the horton infiltration model c scscn model the scscn model is described as follows huang et al 2006 michel et al 2005 mishra and singh 2004 verma et al 2020 10 r p i a 2 p i a s where s mm is the potential maximum retention and ia mm denotes the initial abstraction and equals 0 2s in most applications s can be determined as follows by the curve number cn 11 s 1000 cn 10 where the cn number value varies from 0 to 100 and is closely related to the land use and soil types to reflect the hydrological response of different land covers to rainfall the cn values in the four types of land covers are separately calibrated and used to calculate the regional mean cn value the ranges of cn values of different land covers are referred to the values given in the manual of swmm rossman 2010 according to related studies beck et al 2017 ozdemir and elbas 2015 the regional mean cn value can be calculated by 12 cn i 1 k c n i r a t i o s i where cni denotes the cn value for the ith land cover the regional mean cn value is used in eq 11 for the calculation of s the specific steps to calculate the runoff at each time step by the scscn model are referred to the source codes of swmm https www epa gov water research storm water management model swmm similarly the equivalent drainage system routing approach is also used for runoff routing in the scscn model all parameters in the tvgm urban horton infiltration and scscn models that need calibration are listed in table 1 d model calibration and evaluation four commonly used metrics the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse relative runoff depth error re relative peak flow error pe and time to peak error tpe 5 min are used to quantify the model performance in flood simulations for a specific flood event n the four metrics are defined as 13 ns e n 1 j 1 m q n t s q n t o 2 j 1 m q n t o q n o 2 r e n r n s r n o r n o 100 p e n q max n s q max n o q max n o 100 t p e n t n s t n o where t n s 5 min q max n s m3 s and r n s mm are the simulated peak time peak flow and runoff depth for flood event n respectively t n o 5 min q max n o m3 s and r n o mm are the observed peak time peak flow and runoff depth for flood event n respectively q n t s m3 s and q n t o m3 s are the simulated and observed discharge at time t for flood event n q n o m3 s is the average observed discharge for flood event n according to the definitions of the four metrics the higher nse indicates the better performance the lower absolute values of re pe and tpe indicate the better performance in the total runoff peak flow and time to peak simulation respectively the sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 is applied to model calibration and the objective function is set as the weighted average of the three metrics 14 obj 1 n s e ω 1 re ω 2 pe ω 3 where obj represents the optimal value which ranges from 0 to ω 1 to ω 3 represent the weights which are all set to 1 3 in this study 2 1 2 uncertainty analysis we applied the glue method beven and binley 1992 to analyze the uncertainties of the parameters in the three models the specific steps of the glue method are fully illustrated in li et al 2010 in this study we used a multi objective likelihood function to integrate different calibration criteria metrics 15 l m k y n e 1 n s e 3 e re 3 e pe 3 where l m k y n is the likelihood function of the kth model m and yn is the data of flood n according to the standard for hydrological information and hydrological forecasting gb t22482 2008 and previous studies liu et al 2020b song et al 2017 the following criteria are used to calculate the threshold value nse 0 5 r e 20 p e 20 a parameter set is judged as good behavior one if its likelihood value is larger than the threshold value the total model prediction uncertainty can be decomposed into the structural input data and parametric uncertainties and it can be further simplified to structural and parametric uncertainties when all models use the same input data jin et al 2010 pang et al 2020 based on the results of glue guo et al 2014 introduce the p factor pu to quantify the contribution of parametric uncertainty to total uncertainty which is calculated as the ratio of direct observations in the 95 prediction interval a greater value of pu indicates a higher ratio of parametric uncertainty the structural uncertainty is defined as su which is calculated by 1 pu in the case of the same input data another two indicators proposed by xiong et al 2009 the average asymmetry degree s and average deviation amplitude d m3 s are also applied to evaluate the prediction uncertainty of different models at the 95 confidence level xiong et al 2009 for flood n these four indices are defined as follow 16 p u n n o n n t n s u n 1 p u n s n 1 m t 1 m q n t u q n t o q n t u q n t l 0 5 d n 1 m t 1 m 0 5 q n t u q n t l q n t o where no n and nt n represent the number of observed discharges contained by the 95 prediction bounds and the total number of observed discharges for flood event n respectively q n t u and q n t l denote the upper and lower bounds of the prediction interval at time t respectively as indicated by xiong et al 2009 s and d represent the geometric structure of the prediction bounds and the discrepancy between the trajectory consisting of the middle points of the prediction bounds and the observed flow respectively theoretically smaller values of s and d indicate better prediction performance 2 2 study area shenzhen city 113 46 114 37 22 27 22 52 located in southern china has undergone rapid urbanization and economic development during the past four decades the city has transformed from a small fishing village to one of four first tier cities in china li et al 2015 the percentage of impervious areas of shenzhen city has increased from 19 in 1990 to 43 in 2015 zhou and jia 2016 shenzhen city has a subtropical maritime monsoon climate with an annual average precipitation of 1935 mm and an annual average temperature of 25 c liu et al 2020c wu et al 2020 the rainfall events are concentrated in the monsoon period from april to september and the total rainfall during this period accounts for about 85 of the annual precipitation liu et al 2020c in addition short duration and high intensity rainstorms frequently occur in shenzhen city which often results in severe urban floods liu et al 2020c the study area fenghuangcheng region which belongs to the guangming district is located in the northwestern area of shenzhen city the fenghuangcheng region has an area of approximately 24 6 km2 and the central area of the fenghuangcheng region with flow observations is classified into 10 urban catchments according to the drainage pipeline network and terrain characteristics the annual mean precipitation in this region is approximately 1600 mm and there are approximately 140 days of rain per year peng et al 2018 wu et al 2015 the rainfall is highly variable across the study area as most rainfall events are concentrated in the period from april to september and the rainfall in two different catchments in the study area may exhibit large differences at the same time the main soil types in this region are silty clay and silt the specific information of the study area is displayed in fig 2 and table 2 2 3 data the digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m is obtained from the data center for resource and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn the land cover map and the 5 minute hydrometeorological data are provided by the urban planning and design institute of shenzhen city as shown in fig 2 the land cover of the study area is classified into five types i e vegetation bare soil buildings road and water body in this study the water body is ignored in runoff calculations because there are few areas identified as water body areas in catchments with discharge observations dominant vegetation types comprise grassland and shrubland in all urban catchments the building area with water storage infrastructure is very small and has almost no impact on runoff the specific area ratios of each type of land cover are presented in table 2 there are a total of 6 rainfall gauges in the whole study area which provide the 5 min precipitation series from january 1st 2019 to june 30th 2020 the drainage pipeline and sewage pipeline network are separated in these 10 urban catchments which are designed to collect storm runoff and sewage respectively in addition discharge stations are set on the outlets of the drainage pipeline network of 10 urban catchments which provide 5 min flow discharge data the specific information about the drainage pipeline network is unavailable in the study area the areal average precipitation in each catchment is determined by the thiessen polygon method fiedler 2003 the floods in each catchment are selected by the event selection method introduced in miller and hess 2017 we randomly divide the selected floods in each catchment into two groups with 2 3 and the remaining 1 3 of floods for model calibration and validation respectively the list of the flood events in each catchment is provided in table s1 in the supplemental material in addition according to the information provided by the meteorological bureau of shenzhen municipality http weather sz gov cn qixiangfuwu qihoufuwu qihouguanceyupinggu baoyuqiangdugongshi and urban planning and design institute of shenzhen city some parameters in the equivalent drainage system routing method can be determined as a1 8 684 mm lg year b 11 13 min n 0 555 a2 0 594 min 0 445 and pr 5 years 3 results 3 1 comparison of the simulation performances of the three models the tvgm urban horton infiltration and scscn models are applied to simulate the floods in the calibration and validation periods for each urban catchment fig 3 and table 3 present the boxplots and regional average results of the four evaluation metrics for the three models over each catchment in the calibration period respectively in general the tvgm urban model outperforms the other two models in the calibration period as it has the highest multiple catchment average nse value 0 875 and lowest re 4 21 and pe 6 93 the scscn model outperforms the horton infiltration model in flood simulation especially in the simulation of peak flow the three models present satisfying results in catchments 3 4 5 and 6 as most floods simulated by three models have high nse values and low total runoff and peak flow errors the tvgm urban model presents better total runoff simulation results in catchments 1 2 7 8 9 and 10 than the other two models in addition the tvgm urban model has narrower ranges of nse re and pe than the other two models for most catchments which indicates that the tvgm urban model has more stable performance in the simulation of hydrological processes and total runoff the tvgm urban and scscn models present the lowest regional mean peak flow errors in catchments 1 2 3 4 and 10 and catchments 5 6 7 8 and 9 respectively and these two models both outperform the horton infiltration model in peak flow simulation for most catchments the regional average values and ranges of tpe in the three models in the 10 catchments are similar which indicates that the three models can capture the peak time of floods in these catchments the simulation results of the three models in the validation period table 4 and fig 4 are consistent with those in the calibration period according to the average results of all catchments the tvgm urban model still performs better in the hydrological process runoff volume and peak flow simulations than the other two models while the best performance of the time to peak simulation is found in the scscn model the tvgm urban model has higher average values and narrower ranges of nse than the other two models for all catchments except catchments 1 and 3 in addition the tvgm urban model has the smallest regional average runoff errors in all catchments except catchments 2 and 3 and the total runoff errors of most simulated floods are within the ranges of 20 moreover fig 4 and table 4 also show that the tvgm urban and scscn models both outperform the horton infiltration model in the peak flow simulation while the tvgm urban model has a slightly better peak flow simulation performance than the scscn model the tvgm urban model and scscn model perform best in the peak flow simulation in catchments 2 3 4 5 7 8 and catchments 1 6 9 10 respectively the tpe results indicate that the scscn model performs best in the peak flow time simulation but the differences among the results of the three models are not apparent except for catchments 1 and 2 the similar results of the three models in tpe may be attributed to all three models using the same runoff routing module and optimization algorithm which may result in similar parameters in the runoff routing module in summary the tvgm urban model performs best among the three models in both calibration and validation periods especially in the total runoff simulation which implies a better runoff generation method and model structure in the tvgm urban model the scscn model performs better than the horton infiltration model and the differences between the tvgm urban model and scscn model in peak flow simulation are less significant 3 2 uncertainty analysis and comparison of the three models as discussed in section 2 1 2 we only consider parametric and structural uncertainties under the condition of using the same input data the glue method with a 10000 iteration monte carlo simulation is applied to investigate the uncertainties of the three models in flow simulation the four uncertainty evaluation metrics for each catchment are presented in fig 5 and table 5 in general compared with the horton infiltration and scscn models the parametric uncertainty accounts for the majority of the uncertainty in the tvgm urban model while the structural uncertainty is the main uncertainty of the horton infiltration and scscn models in the study area in detail the tvgm urban model presents the highest parametric uncertainty of the three models for all catchments except catchments 3 and 8 correspondingly the tvgm urban model also has the lowest regional average structural uncertainties in these catchments the uncertainty results are consistent with our anticipation that a model with more parameters will present higher parametric uncertainties it also implies a simpler and more effective structure of the tvgm urban model in flood simulations in addition according to eq 13 the parametric uncertainty is also capable of reflecting the ratio of observations contained in the 95 confidence interval of predictions liu et al 2020b xiong et al 2009 these results also indicate that the 95 prediction interval in the tvgm urban model contains more observed discharge than the other two models in all catchments except catchments 3 and 8 the results of another uncertainty evaluation metric s are similar to those of parametric uncertainty table 5 shows that the asymmetry of the prediction intervals in the tvgm urban model is smaller than that of the horton infiltration and scscn models for all catchments except catchments 3 7 and 8 and the multiple catchment average s of the tvgm urban model is less than that of the horton infiltration and scscn models in addition the tvgm urban model has narrower ranges of s than the other two models for most catchments these results illustrate that compared with the horton infiltration and scscn models the tvgm urban model may have a smaller deviation between the prediction interval and the observations liu et al 2020b xiong et al 2009 the regional average results and the ranges of the d values in the three models are similar for most catchments which indicates that the three models have similar average deviation amplitudes in the prediction intervals for most catchments in summary the comprehensive results of multiple uncertainty evaluation metrics indicate that the tvgm urban model performs better than the horton infiltration and scscn models in reducing the prediction uncertainty 3 3 impacts of urbanization on runoff generation under the design rainfall event the simulation and uncertainty analysis results above demonstrate that the tvgm urban model can accurately simulate the urban floods in the study area in addition the tvgm urban model can provide specific runoff generation processes of different land covers which can help identify impacts of land cover area changes on runoff thus we used the tvgm urban model to investigate the impacts of land cover area changes on runoff generation under a design rainfall event as the study area has suffered severe urban floods due to its rapid urbanization the design 2 hour rainfall event with a 5 year return period is used according to the local drainage pipeline network construction plan six scenarios that represent different combinations of increases in building areas and corresponding decreases in pervious areas are listed in table 6 and are used to analyze the impacts of urbanization on urban runoff generation for four selected catchments of 2 7 8 and 9 which have relatively high levels of urbanization but still have a certain amount of vegetation and bare soil areas fig 6 a shows the average percentages of runoff generated by different land covers compared with the total runoff for all observed floods in these four catchments the ratios of runoff generated by different land covers are consistent with the area ratios in these four urban catchments the runoff generated by buildings accounts for most of the total runoff in all urban catchments the runoff generated by bare soil vegetation areas and roads can also account for a certain amount of the total runoff in catchments 2 and 9 7 and 8 respectively fig 6 b presents the percentages of runoff generated by different land covers compared with the total runoff under the design rainfall event the initial soil moisture is set as the average value across all historical rainfall events the results are consistent with fig 6 a although the proportion of runoff generated by building areas becomes larger under the design rainfall event which indicates that the runoff generated by the buildings is still the main component of total runoff in these four catchments under the design rainfall event fig 7 shows the changes in total runoff of the design rainfall event under six different land cover scenarios for the four selected urban catchments the expansion of building areas can lead to an increase in total runoff although the decrease in pervious areas also causes a reduction in total runoff to a certain extent in addition the impacts of changes in land cover areas on urban runoff generation differ in various urban catchments for catchment 2 the decrease in bare soil areas has a slightly greater negative impact on total runoff than the decrease in vegetation areas compared with catchment 2 the decreases in vegetation and bare soil areas both have a greater restrictive effect on the increase of total runoff in catchment 7 this result also implies that the changes in different land cover areas may not lead to corresponding linear changes in total runoff the results in catchment 8 indicate that the reduction of vegetation areas has a greater negative impact on the total runoff than the reduction of bare soil areas the total runoff is more sensitive to the decrease in bare soil areas than vegetation areas in catchment 9 especially for the scenarios with building areas increasing by 5 in addition the results of four urban catchments indicate that when the total permeable area remains the same the decrease in a single type of land cover area has a greater impact on the total runoff than the combinations of multiple land covers overall the results in fig 7 indicate that the decrease in the area of bare soil and vegetation can effectively reduce the increase in runoff caused by the increase in impervious surfaces for catchments 2 9 and 7 8 respectively which can provide references for policymakers on land planning and city development decisions from the perspectives of reducing flood risk 4 discussion 4 1 urban runoff generation calculation methods a traditional viewpoint in urban runoff generation is that runoff from impervious surfaces plays a dominant role in urban runoff brabec et al 2002 jacobson 2011 shuster et al 2008 while many recent studies point out that permeable surfaces have an equally important role in urban runoff generation berthier et al 2004 lim 2016 miller et al 2014 our results also demonstrate the importance of permeable areas in urban runoff generation figs 6 and 7 some studies suggest that both infiltration excess runoff and saturation excess runoff can occur in pervious urban areas miles and band 2015 voter and loheide 2018 in addition frequent human activities may change soil properties and water content hettiarachchi et al 2018 hettiarachchi et al 2019 ren et al 2020 thereby altering the runoff generation mode for a specific urban catchment thus a single runoff generation mode may be less appropriate for permeable urban areas however it is also difficult to identify the specific areas where infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff generation occur which may be the reason that most current urban hydrological models only use the infiltration excess models for runoff simulation the original tvgm is designed to directly describe the rainfall runoff relationship accounting for both saturation excess and infiltration excess areas xia 2002 xia et al 1997 the tvgm urban model employs a similar runoff generation method as the tvgm for runoff simulation in permeable areas and it directly recognizes the response relationships between rainfall and runoff for each land cover there is no need to identify the specific runoff generation mode for an urban catchment in the tvgm urban model in addition the impacts of different variables on runoff generation can be reflected by calibrated parameters in the tvgm urban model for example compared to the vegetation the bare soil has a slightly higher conversion rate from rainfall to runoff in most catchments according to the calibrated values of gv1 and gs1 in table s2 in the supplemental material the soil moisture has a greater impact on the runoff generation on vegetated lands than that of the bare soil because the calibrated values of gv2 are higher than gs2 values for most catchments as for the bare soil the rainfall intensity effect is higher in catchments 5 and 10 than the other catchments according to the values of gs3 these results of calibrated parameters are consistent with the runoff generation characteristics of different land covers gregory et al 2006 pitt et al 2008 ren et al 2020 voter and loheide 2018 thus compared to current infiltration excess models the tvgm urban model has better adaptability in flood simulation in urban areas with diverse land covers and can reflect the complex runoff generation mechanisms of different land covers 4 2 urban hydrological model structure in this study the detailed classification of land covers is considered in the tvgm urban and scscn models while the horton infiltration can only identify the differences between pervious and impervious areas huang et al 2006 michel et al 2005 the results of the tvgm urban and scscn models are better than those of the horton infiltration model especially in the total runoff simulation which indicates that differences in rainfall runoff responses of various land covers cannot be ignored in the study area this is consistent with previous studies showing that the runoff generation characteristics of various land covers in urban catchments can be different ren et al 2020 voter and loheide 2018 zhang et al 2018b therefore taking all permeable surfaces as a whole for the runoff generation simulation may result in large deviations between simulated and observed flows however the results in table 3 and table 4 indicate a better performance of the tvgm urban model in the hydrological process and total runoff simulations than the scscn model which may be related to the differences in the model structure the scscn model employs the cn values to reflect the rainfall runoff relationship in different land covers jiao et al 2017 michel et al 2005 while the tvgm urban model employs a variety of methods to describe the runoff generation processes of different land covers however the scscn model can only consider infiltration excess runoff generation which may be less accurate for areas with abundant soil moisture jacobson 2011 liu et al 2020b michel et al 2005 correspondingly the tvgm urban can simulate both saturation excess and infiltration excess runoff wang et al 2009 xia 1991 xia 2002 xia et al 1997 xia et al 2005 this may be the main reason for the better performance of the tvgm urban model as the model considering multiple runoff generation modes generally presents better performance than the model with single runoff generation mode for areas with various land covers huo et al 2019 liu et al 2020b qu et al 2003 moreover although the tvgm urban model has more parameters than the other two models the structural and prediction uncertainties in the tvgm urban model are less than those of the other two models indicating the relatively simple structure and the stable urban flood simulation performance of the tvgm urban model 4 3 applicability of the tvgm urban model in this study the land cover is classified into four categories i e buildings roads vegetation and bare soil chang et al 2015 miller and hess 2017 however in some studies zhang et al 2018b zhou et al 2017 the vegetation area can be further divided into grasslands shrublands forests etc the rainfall runoff relationships in grasslands and forests may be different however grasslands and shrublands constitute the main components of the vegetation in the study area as few areas are identified as forests more vegetated land cover types need to be considered for larger urban catchments however a more detailed classification of land covers which is common in some distributed or semi distributed hydrological models such as the swat model sisay et al 2017 and the vic model yang et al 2011 will also increase model complexity and reduce the applicability of the model although it may improve the understanding of runoff generation mechanisms thus the current classification of land covers and the structure in the tvgm urban model remains to be further verified in the larger urban catchments with more complicated land covers in addition the equivalent drainage system routing approach is employed as an alternative method for runoff routing in the three models since the specific information about the drainage pipeline network is unavailable our results and the previous study zhang et al 2018b demonstrate that this method can acquire acceptable results in some urban catchments the performance of all three models in urban flood simulation may be further improved when specific information about the drainage pipeline network is available and the hydraulic equations can be used for flow routing 5 conclusion in this study we developed the tvgm urban model a new urban hydrological model considering nonlinear rainfall runoff responses of various types of urban surfaces the performance and the uncertainty of the tvgm urban model are evaluated in comparison with two widely used urban hydrological runoff generation models the horton infiltration and the scscn models in the fenghuangcheng region of shenzhen city china the main findings of this study are summarized as follows 1 the tvgm urban model performs better in simulating both hydrological processes and total runoff than the other two models for most urban catchments the scscn model outperforms the horton infiltration model especially in the simulation of peak flow 2 though tvgm urban has higher parametric uncertainty for most urban catchments its structural uncertainty is smaller than that of the other two models for almost all catchments indicating a relatively simple but effective structure of the tvgm urban model in addition the prediction intervals of the tvgm urban model are less asymmetric than those of the other two models which indicates its better performance in reducing the flow prediction uncertainty 3 the runoff component analysis of four selected catchments no 2 7 8 and 9 under a 2 hour rainfall event with a return period of 5 years shows that the runoff generated by the impervious areas accounts for the majority of the total runoff in these catchments the scenario analysis considering changes in land cover areas shows that the decrease in the area of bare soil and vegetation both has negative impacts on the increase in runoff caused by the increase in building areas while the influences of changes in bare soil area and vegetation area on runoff are obvious in catchments 2 9 and 7 8 respectively credit authorship contribution

4084,rapid urbanization has great potential to adversely impact the local hydrological cycle the environment and ecosystems as well as trigger severe problems such as urban flooding waterlogging and water contamination understanding runoff generation mechanisms in urban areas helps identify the impacts of urbanization on runoff response and better simulate urban floods however in most urban hydrological models urban surfaces are coarsely classified into impervious and pervious ones which likely ignores differential rainfall runoff responses of different urban surfaces and leads to large discrepancies between simulated and observed runoff here we developed the tvgm urban model a new urban hydrological model based on the time variant gain model tvgm that represents nonlinear rainfall runoff relationships for different urban surfaces we applied the model to the fenghuangcheng region of shenzhen city china and compared the results to those of two commonly used urban hydrological models the horton infiltration and soil conservation service curve number scscn model for each of these models we conducted model uncertainty analysis using the glue method the results showed that the tvgm urban model outperformed the other two models in terms of total runoff and peak flow this could be due to the consideration of different land covers and both saturation excess and infiltration excess runoff generation in the tvgm urban model in addition the uncertainty analysis indicated better performance of the tvgm urban model in reducing structural uncertainty and prediction uncertainty this study highlights the need to account for detailed land covers and different runoff generation mechanisms in urban hydrological modeling keywords urban floods tvgm urban model horton infiltration model scscn model land cover 1 introduction urbanization is commonly associated with alterations of the land surface resulting in increased impervious surfaces and population density relative to undeveloped conditions voter and loheide 2018 zhao et al 2019 these alterations can profoundly impact the environment and ecosystem by increasing peak flows and the amount of runoff produced across the landscape reducing the time to peak of floods thereby triggering urban floods and accelerating the transport of contaminants into receiving waters hobbie et al 2017 salerno et al 2018 xia et al 2017 yin et al 2016 however the rainfall runoff response relationships are complicated in urban areas with various land covers and changes in land cover areas due to urbanization can largely affect the rainfall runoff relationship in urban areas and increase the possibility of urban flooding liu et al 2020a marjo et al 2014 xia et al 2017 understanding the runoff generation process of different land covers in urban areas can be beneficial for accurately forecasting the volume and peak flow of urban floods which can help identify the possible flooding areas thereby mitigating the losses caused by urban floods qin et al 2013 ren et al 2020 wu 2014 zhang et al 2018b in response to the policy and flood management needs in urban areas many hydrological models have been proposed to improve the scientific understanding of the urban runoff generation process elliott and trowsdale 2007 jacobson 2011 o donnell et al 2020 rossman 2010 one category of urban hydrological models such as the regional hydro ecologic simulation system rhessys parflow clm and the surface urban energy balance scheme suews use physical governing equations to simulate the movement of water including the three dimensional movement of water within the subsurface and the interaction with other hydrological fluxes järvi et al 2017 voter and loheide 2018 these models are not widely used in urban flood simulation and management due to strict requirements for computation and input data another type of urban hydrological models such as the storm water management model swmm mike urban and citycat bisht et al 2016 glenis et al 2018 rossman 2010 use the concept of urban catchments and employ some widely used runoff generation models based on infiltration excess generation such as the horton infiltration model horton 1941 green ampt infiltration model green and ampt 1911 and soil conservation service curve number scscn model bedient and huber 1992 to describe the rainfall runoff response in urban areas these models have been employed by many studies in urban flood simulation because of their convenient application and acceptable performance knighton et al 2016 ren et al 2020 suribabu and bhaskar 2015 wu et al 2016 yin et al 2020 zhang et al 2018a however there are two main shortcomings in the runoff generation of current popular urban hydrological models that may affect the precision of urban flood simulation the first one is that the underlying surface is simply classified into two types i e permeable and impervious areas for runoff generation in most infiltration excess based hydrological models behrouz et al 2019 chen et al 2018 rossman 2010 however this coarse classification may be less accurate for runoff simulation in some urban areas as rainfall runoff relationships may be different in various permeable underlying surfaces ahiablame et al 2012 deepak et al 2016 ozdemir and elbas 2015 for example the rainfall runoff relationships between bare soil and vegetation areas are different as they have different infiltration capacity soil porosity and saturated soil moisture content lim 2016 ren et al 2020 a more detailed classification of underlying surfaces can better capture the characteristics of the rainfall runoff response relationship in urban areas which can improve the performance in flood simulation yu et al 2018 the application of only infiltration excess models for runoff generation is another shortcoming in most current urban hydrological models there is no direct correlation between the runoff generation mode and the type of permeable underlying surface as both infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff can occur in permeable areas hettiarachchi et al 2019 lim 2016 miles and band 2015 for example permeable areas with sufficient antecedent soil moisture have the potential to produce the saturation excess runoff ehsan et al 2019 peel 2009 qin et al 2013 and the infiltration excess runoff can occur in permeable areas with low porosity and hydraulic conductivity gregory et al 2006 pitt et al 2008 thus the application of infiltration excess models may not be capable to accurately describe the rainfall runoff response relationships for urban areas with complicated underlying surfaces a hydrological model that better reflects the rainfall runoff response of different urban surfaces may more accurately describe the urban runoff generation process in this study considering the shortcomings of current urban hydrological models we developed the tvgm urban model a new urban hydrological model that represents rainfall runoff responses for different categories of urban surfaces tvgm urban is based on the time variant gain model tvgm which is a simple but efficient systematic method with a few parameters to describe the nonlinear relationship between rainfall and runoff wang et al 2009 xia 2002 xia et al 1997 many studies have documented that the tvgm can obtain satisfactory flood simulation results in both humid and arid basins ning et al 2016 song et al 2017 wang et al 2009 ye et al 2015 however the original tvgm considers the whole basin as one system and cannot reflect the difference in runoff generation of different land covers the newly proposed tvgm urban model classifies the urban surface into distinct categories for runoff generation simulation thus compared with the tvgm and most urban hydrological models the tvgm urban model can better describe the rainfall runoff relationships of different land covers in urban areas here we tested the tvgm urban model in the fenghuangcheng region of shenzhen city china a humid region with rapid urbanization the study area has experienced severe storms and urban floods during the past several years wu 2016 xiong et al 2018 the objectives of this study are to 1 develop a new urban hydrological model the tvgm urban model that accounts for the effects of different land covers on urban runoff generation 2 evaluate the performance and uncertainties of the tvgm urban model in urban flood simulation for the study area in comparison with two other widely used urban hydrological models and 3 investigate the impacts of land cover changes on runoff generation under the design rainfall event using the tvgm urban model this study presents new ideas and methods for urban hydrological model development and urban flood simulation which can provide scientific support for urban flood forecasting and mitigate the potential economic losses resulting from floods and waterlogging 2 materials and methods 2 1 urban hydrological models the tvgm urban model and two widely used conceptual models the horton infiltration and scscn models were applied to evaluate the performance of urban flood simulation in addition we used the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method to investigate the uncertainties of the three models 2 1 1 hydrological models a the tvgm urban model the tvgm is a conceptual hydrological model that performs acceptably in both humid and arid basins li et al 2010 ning et al 2016 wang et al 2009 xia 2002 ye et al 2015 it considers the entire basin as one system and employs an exponential function to reveal the response relationship between rainfall and runoff for the whole basin the runoff is calculated by 1 r g 1 w w m g 2 p where r mm w mm and p mm are the runoff soil moisture and rainfall respectively wm mm is the saturated soil moisture content g1 and g2 are runoff generation parameters the discharge at the outlet of the basin is usually calculated by the unit hydrograph approach xia 2002 xia et al 1997 however the tvgm cannot be directly applied to the urban areas because it does not consider the complicated land covers in urban areas in addition the unit hydrograph in tvgm is not appropriate for the urban areas with the pipeline network instead of the river network thus we developed the tvgm urban model which addresses these two shortcomings of the tvgm for urban areas compared to the tvgm the tvgm urban model can consider the rainfall runoff relationships of various land covers and the runoff routing in the drainage pipeline network as shown in fig 1 the tvgm urban model comprises two modules surface runoff generation and urban runoff routing in the surface runoff generation module according to the widely used classification of land covers in urban areas chang et al 2015 sarah et al 2017 vercruysse et al 2019 the land cover is classified into four categories buildings roads bare soil and vegetation considering the prevalence of green roofs and other storage infrastructures in buildings in recent years the runoff from buildings is calculated using eq 2 2 r bs α bs m a x 0 d t d m d t d t 1 p r a t i o s bs r bi α bi r a t i o bi p r b r bs r bi where rb mm is the runoff from buildings rbs mm and rbi mm are runoff from buildings with storage infrastructures and buildings with impermeable roofs respectively d t mm is the storage water in the storage infrastructures at time t dm mm is the minimum storage for outflow ratiobi and ratiobs are the ratios of building areas with impervious roofs and storage infrastructures to the total urban catchment area respectively αbi and αbs represent the runoff coefficient of the buildings with impervious roofs and storage infrastructures respectively which both range from 0 to 1 the runoff from roads uses a similar method as the runoff calculation for buildings with impermeable roofs 3 r r α r r a t i o r p where ratior is the ratio of the road area to the total urban catchment area αr represents the runoff coefficient of the road which ranges from 0 to 1 we directly employ the runoff generation module in the tvgm to calculate the runoff generated by vegetated land cover as runoff in the vegetated land cover has a close relationship with changes in soil moisture the runoff from the vegetated land cover is calculated as follows 4 r v g v 1 w v w vm g v 2 p r a t i o v where ratiov is the ratio of the vegetation area to the total urban catchment area wv mm and wvm mm are the soil moisture content and the saturated soil moisture content in the vegetation respectively gv1 and gv2 are runoff generation parameters related to the vegetated land cover compared with vegetated lands bare soils generally have lower porosity and hydraulic conductivity due to construction activities and foot traffic gregory et al 2006 pitt et al 2008 voter and loheide 2018 which implies that the runoff may be closely related to the rainfall intensity jiao et al 2017 pang et al 2020 tasdighi et al 2018 therefore we add rainfall intensity to the original tvgm to represent the impact of rainfall intensity on runoff generated by bare soils 5 r s g s 1 w s w sm g s 2 i i m g s 3 p r a t i o s where ws mm and wsm mm are the soil moisture content and saturated soil moisture content in bare soil areas respectively i mm min and im mm min are the rainfall intensity and the maximum rainfall intensity determined from the historical statistics during the same one month respectively ratios is the ratio of the bare soil area to the total urban catchment area gs1 and gs2 are runoff generation parameters related to the bare soil gs3 is the rainfall intensity adjustment parameter the meanings of parameters in the tvgm urban model are shown in table 1 gv1 and gs1 ranging from 0 to 1 represent the average runoff generation coefficient of the vegetation and the bare soil respectively in general a greater value of gv1 or gs1 represents a higher conversion rate from rainfall to runoff of the vegetation or the bare soil gv2 and gs2 denote the impacts of soil moisture on runoff generation of the vegetation and the bare soil respectively both gv2 and gs2 range from 0 to 1 with 0 representing no soil moisture effect on runoff generation w s w sm 0 1 and 1 representing a linear soil moisture effect on runoff generation r s w s w sm under the same soil moisture condition a higher gv2 or gs2 1 leads to lower surface runoff as w s w sm 1 the exponent gs3 between 0 and 1 reflects the impact of rainfall intensity on runoff similar to gv2 or gs2 when gs3 approaches 0 the effect of rainfall intensity on runoff generation would be neglected whereas a higher gs3 would amplify the importance of rainfall intensity in controlling runoff generation im is employed to normalize the rainfall intensity into the range of 0 to 1 the higher values of αbi αbs and αr mean the more runoff generated by the buildings with impervious roofs the buildings with storage infrastructures and the road respectively the initial soil moisture of the vegetated and bare soils for one flood event is determined by the antecedent precipitation 6 p a t k a p a t 1 p t w vi min w vm p a r a t i o s v w si min w sm p a r a t i o s s where pa t mm indicates the antecedent precipitation at time t wvi mm and wsi mm are the initial soil moisture of the vegetation and the bare soil respectively ka is the dimensionless recession coefficient according to the previous studies fedora and beschta 1989 wang et al 2002 ka is set to 0 9 and the antecedent precipitation for one flood event is calculated by the 72 hour precipitation before the onset of this flood the runoff routing module contains overland flow routing and runoff routing in the drainage pipeline network which are calculated by the manning formula and saint venant equation in most urban hydrological models respectively aryal et al 2016 rossman 2010 however these methods require detailed information on the drainage pipeline network which is difficult to acquire in many cities in china thus we employed the equivalent drainage system routing approach zhang et al 2018b as an alternative runoff routing method when it is difficult to obtain specific drainage system information the flow routing between different types of land covers is ignored in this study because we focus more on the flow at the outlet of the pipeline network thus the total runoff of an urban catchment can be calculated as the sum of the runoff from different land covers 7 r r b r r r v r s where r mm denotes the total runoff of an urban catchment the equivalent drainage system routing approach contains the concepts of both surface flow routing and flow routing in the pipeline network and the flow routing discharge q m3 s at the outlet of the pipeline network can be estimated as follows 8 q k q c p a 86 4 q c p p i r p p i 8 64 167 a 1 1 a 2 l g p r t pcp b n t pcp 1 m 1 t overl where qcp mm day denotes the daily drainage capacity in the urban pipeline network a km2 is the catchment area pi mm day is the design rainfall intensity corresponding to the construction standard of the local pipeline network and pr year is the corresponding return period of the design storm tpcp min and toverl min are the duration of design storm and surface flow routing time respectively a1 mm lg year a2 min n 1 b min and n parameters to be determined the toverl can be determined by the overland slope and length of the catchment as indicated by zhang et al 2018b a1 mm lg year a2 min n 1 b min n and pr are the parameters that can be determined by the storm intensity equation of the study city and the urban drainage system design handbook bmedi 2004 thus only the adjusted parameter of flow routing duration in the drainage network m1 and the coverage factor of drainage network k need further calibration in the flood simulation for a specific catchment b horton infiltration model the horton infiltration model has been widely used for runoff calculations in many urban catchments behrouz et al 2019 li et al 2014 ren et al 2020 wu et al 2016 yao et al 2016 this model assumes an inverse exponential equation for the infiltration capacity as rainfall continues the horton infiltration equation is described as follows 9 f t f c f 0 f c e k d t where f t mm h is the infiltration capacity at time t and kd is the soil decay constant f0 mm h and fc mm h are the initial value of infiltration capacity at the beginning of a rainfall event and the stable infiltration capacity respectively this equation means that the infiltration capacity will gradually decrease to a constant value when the rainfall duration increases to infinity the surface runoff in permeable areas is calculated as the difference between the rainfall rate and the infiltration rate when the rainfall rate is higher than the infiltration rate while the infiltration rate in the impervious areas is set to zero the equivalent drainage system routing approach is also used for runoff routing in the horton infiltration model c scscn model the scscn model is described as follows huang et al 2006 michel et al 2005 mishra and singh 2004 verma et al 2020 10 r p i a 2 p i a s where s mm is the potential maximum retention and ia mm denotes the initial abstraction and equals 0 2s in most applications s can be determined as follows by the curve number cn 11 s 1000 cn 10 where the cn number value varies from 0 to 100 and is closely related to the land use and soil types to reflect the hydrological response of different land covers to rainfall the cn values in the four types of land covers are separately calibrated and used to calculate the regional mean cn value the ranges of cn values of different land covers are referred to the values given in the manual of swmm rossman 2010 according to related studies beck et al 2017 ozdemir and elbas 2015 the regional mean cn value can be calculated by 12 cn i 1 k c n i r a t i o s i where cni denotes the cn value for the ith land cover the regional mean cn value is used in eq 11 for the calculation of s the specific steps to calculate the runoff at each time step by the scscn model are referred to the source codes of swmm https www epa gov water research storm water management model swmm similarly the equivalent drainage system routing approach is also used for runoff routing in the scscn model all parameters in the tvgm urban horton infiltration and scscn models that need calibration are listed in table 1 d model calibration and evaluation four commonly used metrics the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse relative runoff depth error re relative peak flow error pe and time to peak error tpe 5 min are used to quantify the model performance in flood simulations for a specific flood event n the four metrics are defined as 13 ns e n 1 j 1 m q n t s q n t o 2 j 1 m q n t o q n o 2 r e n r n s r n o r n o 100 p e n q max n s q max n o q max n o 100 t p e n t n s t n o where t n s 5 min q max n s m3 s and r n s mm are the simulated peak time peak flow and runoff depth for flood event n respectively t n o 5 min q max n o m3 s and r n o mm are the observed peak time peak flow and runoff depth for flood event n respectively q n t s m3 s and q n t o m3 s are the simulated and observed discharge at time t for flood event n q n o m3 s is the average observed discharge for flood event n according to the definitions of the four metrics the higher nse indicates the better performance the lower absolute values of re pe and tpe indicate the better performance in the total runoff peak flow and time to peak simulation respectively the sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 is applied to model calibration and the objective function is set as the weighted average of the three metrics 14 obj 1 n s e ω 1 re ω 2 pe ω 3 where obj represents the optimal value which ranges from 0 to ω 1 to ω 3 represent the weights which are all set to 1 3 in this study 2 1 2 uncertainty analysis we applied the glue method beven and binley 1992 to analyze the uncertainties of the parameters in the three models the specific steps of the glue method are fully illustrated in li et al 2010 in this study we used a multi objective likelihood function to integrate different calibration criteria metrics 15 l m k y n e 1 n s e 3 e re 3 e pe 3 where l m k y n is the likelihood function of the kth model m and yn is the data of flood n according to the standard for hydrological information and hydrological forecasting gb t22482 2008 and previous studies liu et al 2020b song et al 2017 the following criteria are used to calculate the threshold value nse 0 5 r e 20 p e 20 a parameter set is judged as good behavior one if its likelihood value is larger than the threshold value the total model prediction uncertainty can be decomposed into the structural input data and parametric uncertainties and it can be further simplified to structural and parametric uncertainties when all models use the same input data jin et al 2010 pang et al 2020 based on the results of glue guo et al 2014 introduce the p factor pu to quantify the contribution of parametric uncertainty to total uncertainty which is calculated as the ratio of direct observations in the 95 prediction interval a greater value of pu indicates a higher ratio of parametric uncertainty the structural uncertainty is defined as su which is calculated by 1 pu in the case of the same input data another two indicators proposed by xiong et al 2009 the average asymmetry degree s and average deviation amplitude d m3 s are also applied to evaluate the prediction uncertainty of different models at the 95 confidence level xiong et al 2009 for flood n these four indices are defined as follow 16 p u n n o n n t n s u n 1 p u n s n 1 m t 1 m q n t u q n t o q n t u q n t l 0 5 d n 1 m t 1 m 0 5 q n t u q n t l q n t o where no n and nt n represent the number of observed discharges contained by the 95 prediction bounds and the total number of observed discharges for flood event n respectively q n t u and q n t l denote the upper and lower bounds of the prediction interval at time t respectively as indicated by xiong et al 2009 s and d represent the geometric structure of the prediction bounds and the discrepancy between the trajectory consisting of the middle points of the prediction bounds and the observed flow respectively theoretically smaller values of s and d indicate better prediction performance 2 2 study area shenzhen city 113 46 114 37 22 27 22 52 located in southern china has undergone rapid urbanization and economic development during the past four decades the city has transformed from a small fishing village to one of four first tier cities in china li et al 2015 the percentage of impervious areas of shenzhen city has increased from 19 in 1990 to 43 in 2015 zhou and jia 2016 shenzhen city has a subtropical maritime monsoon climate with an annual average precipitation of 1935 mm and an annual average temperature of 25 c liu et al 2020c wu et al 2020 the rainfall events are concentrated in the monsoon period from april to september and the total rainfall during this period accounts for about 85 of the annual precipitation liu et al 2020c in addition short duration and high intensity rainstorms frequently occur in shenzhen city which often results in severe urban floods liu et al 2020c the study area fenghuangcheng region which belongs to the guangming district is located in the northwestern area of shenzhen city the fenghuangcheng region has an area of approximately 24 6 km2 and the central area of the fenghuangcheng region with flow observations is classified into 10 urban catchments according to the drainage pipeline network and terrain characteristics the annual mean precipitation in this region is approximately 1600 mm and there are approximately 140 days of rain per year peng et al 2018 wu et al 2015 the rainfall is highly variable across the study area as most rainfall events are concentrated in the period from april to september and the rainfall in two different catchments in the study area may exhibit large differences at the same time the main soil types in this region are silty clay and silt the specific information of the study area is displayed in fig 2 and table 2 2 3 data the digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m is obtained from the data center for resource and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn the land cover map and the 5 minute hydrometeorological data are provided by the urban planning and design institute of shenzhen city as shown in fig 2 the land cover of the study area is classified into five types i e vegetation bare soil buildings road and water body in this study the water body is ignored in runoff calculations because there are few areas identified as water body areas in catchments with discharge observations dominant vegetation types comprise grassland and shrubland in all urban catchments the building area with water storage infrastructure is very small and has almost no impact on runoff the specific area ratios of each type of land cover are presented in table 2 there are a total of 6 rainfall gauges in the whole study area which provide the 5 min precipitation series from january 1st 2019 to june 30th 2020 the drainage pipeline and sewage pipeline network are separated in these 10 urban catchments which are designed to collect storm runoff and sewage respectively in addition discharge stations are set on the outlets of the drainage pipeline network of 10 urban catchments which provide 5 min flow discharge data the specific information about the drainage pipeline network is unavailable in the study area the areal average precipitation in each catchment is determined by the thiessen polygon method fiedler 2003 the floods in each catchment are selected by the event selection method introduced in miller and hess 2017 we randomly divide the selected floods in each catchment into two groups with 2 3 and the remaining 1 3 of floods for model calibration and validation respectively the list of the flood events in each catchment is provided in table s1 in the supplemental material in addition according to the information provided by the meteorological bureau of shenzhen municipality http weather sz gov cn qixiangfuwu qihoufuwu qihouguanceyupinggu baoyuqiangdugongshi and urban planning and design institute of shenzhen city some parameters in the equivalent drainage system routing method can be determined as a1 8 684 mm lg year b 11 13 min n 0 555 a2 0 594 min 0 445 and pr 5 years 3 results 3 1 comparison of the simulation performances of the three models the tvgm urban horton infiltration and scscn models are applied to simulate the floods in the calibration and validation periods for each urban catchment fig 3 and table 3 present the boxplots and regional average results of the four evaluation metrics for the three models over each catchment in the calibration period respectively in general the tvgm urban model outperforms the other two models in the calibration period as it has the highest multiple catchment average nse value 0 875 and lowest re 4 21 and pe 6 93 the scscn model outperforms the horton infiltration model in flood simulation especially in the simulation of peak flow the three models present satisfying results in catchments 3 4 5 and 6 as most floods simulated by three models have high nse values and low total runoff and peak flow errors the tvgm urban model presents better total runoff simulation results in catchments 1 2 7 8 9 and 10 than the other two models in addition the tvgm urban model has narrower ranges of nse re and pe than the other two models for most catchments which indicates that the tvgm urban model has more stable performance in the simulation of hydrological processes and total runoff the tvgm urban and scscn models present the lowest regional mean peak flow errors in catchments 1 2 3 4 and 10 and catchments 5 6 7 8 and 9 respectively and these two models both outperform the horton infiltration model in peak flow simulation for most catchments the regional average values and ranges of tpe in the three models in the 10 catchments are similar which indicates that the three models can capture the peak time of floods in these catchments the simulation results of the three models in the validation period table 4 and fig 4 are consistent with those in the calibration period according to the average results of all catchments the tvgm urban model still performs better in the hydrological process runoff volume and peak flow simulations than the other two models while the best performance of the time to peak simulation is found in the scscn model the tvgm urban model has higher average values and narrower ranges of nse than the other two models for all catchments except catchments 1 and 3 in addition the tvgm urban model has the smallest regional average runoff errors in all catchments except catchments 2 and 3 and the total runoff errors of most simulated floods are within the ranges of 20 moreover fig 4 and table 4 also show that the tvgm urban and scscn models both outperform the horton infiltration model in the peak flow simulation while the tvgm urban model has a slightly better peak flow simulation performance than the scscn model the tvgm urban model and scscn model perform best in the peak flow simulation in catchments 2 3 4 5 7 8 and catchments 1 6 9 10 respectively the tpe results indicate that the scscn model performs best in the peak flow time simulation but the differences among the results of the three models are not apparent except for catchments 1 and 2 the similar results of the three models in tpe may be attributed to all three models using the same runoff routing module and optimization algorithm which may result in similar parameters in the runoff routing module in summary the tvgm urban model performs best among the three models in both calibration and validation periods especially in the total runoff simulation which implies a better runoff generation method and model structure in the tvgm urban model the scscn model performs better than the horton infiltration model and the differences between the tvgm urban model and scscn model in peak flow simulation are less significant 3 2 uncertainty analysis and comparison of the three models as discussed in section 2 1 2 we only consider parametric and structural uncertainties under the condition of using the same input data the glue method with a 10000 iteration monte carlo simulation is applied to investigate the uncertainties of the three models in flow simulation the four uncertainty evaluation metrics for each catchment are presented in fig 5 and table 5 in general compared with the horton infiltration and scscn models the parametric uncertainty accounts for the majority of the uncertainty in the tvgm urban model while the structural uncertainty is the main uncertainty of the horton infiltration and scscn models in the study area in detail the tvgm urban model presents the highest parametric uncertainty of the three models for all catchments except catchments 3 and 8 correspondingly the tvgm urban model also has the lowest regional average structural uncertainties in these catchments the uncertainty results are consistent with our anticipation that a model with more parameters will present higher parametric uncertainties it also implies a simpler and more effective structure of the tvgm urban model in flood simulations in addition according to eq 13 the parametric uncertainty is also capable of reflecting the ratio of observations contained in the 95 confidence interval of predictions liu et al 2020b xiong et al 2009 these results also indicate that the 95 prediction interval in the tvgm urban model contains more observed discharge than the other two models in all catchments except catchments 3 and 8 the results of another uncertainty evaluation metric s are similar to those of parametric uncertainty table 5 shows that the asymmetry of the prediction intervals in the tvgm urban model is smaller than that of the horton infiltration and scscn models for all catchments except catchments 3 7 and 8 and the multiple catchment average s of the tvgm urban model is less than that of the horton infiltration and scscn models in addition the tvgm urban model has narrower ranges of s than the other two models for most catchments these results illustrate that compared with the horton infiltration and scscn models the tvgm urban model may have a smaller deviation between the prediction interval and the observations liu et al 2020b xiong et al 2009 the regional average results and the ranges of the d values in the three models are similar for most catchments which indicates that the three models have similar average deviation amplitudes in the prediction intervals for most catchments in summary the comprehensive results of multiple uncertainty evaluation metrics indicate that the tvgm urban model performs better than the horton infiltration and scscn models in reducing the prediction uncertainty 3 3 impacts of urbanization on runoff generation under the design rainfall event the simulation and uncertainty analysis results above demonstrate that the tvgm urban model can accurately simulate the urban floods in the study area in addition the tvgm urban model can provide specific runoff generation processes of different land covers which can help identify impacts of land cover area changes on runoff thus we used the tvgm urban model to investigate the impacts of land cover area changes on runoff generation under a design rainfall event as the study area has suffered severe urban floods due to its rapid urbanization the design 2 hour rainfall event with a 5 year return period is used according to the local drainage pipeline network construction plan six scenarios that represent different combinations of increases in building areas and corresponding decreases in pervious areas are listed in table 6 and are used to analyze the impacts of urbanization on urban runoff generation for four selected catchments of 2 7 8 and 9 which have relatively high levels of urbanization but still have a certain amount of vegetation and bare soil areas fig 6 a shows the average percentages of runoff generated by different land covers compared with the total runoff for all observed floods in these four catchments the ratios of runoff generated by different land covers are consistent with the area ratios in these four urban catchments the runoff generated by buildings accounts for most of the total runoff in all urban catchments the runoff generated by bare soil vegetation areas and roads can also account for a certain amount of the total runoff in catchments 2 and 9 7 and 8 respectively fig 6 b presents the percentages of runoff generated by different land covers compared with the total runoff under the design rainfall event the initial soil moisture is set as the average value across all historical rainfall events the results are consistent with fig 6 a although the proportion of runoff generated by building areas becomes larger under the design rainfall event which indicates that the runoff generated by the buildings is still the main component of total runoff in these four catchments under the design rainfall event fig 7 shows the changes in total runoff of the design rainfall event under six different land cover scenarios for the four selected urban catchments the expansion of building areas can lead to an increase in total runoff although the decrease in pervious areas also causes a reduction in total runoff to a certain extent in addition the impacts of changes in land cover areas on urban runoff generation differ in various urban catchments for catchment 2 the decrease in bare soil areas has a slightly greater negative impact on total runoff than the decrease in vegetation areas compared with catchment 2 the decreases in vegetation and bare soil areas both have a greater restrictive effect on the increase of total runoff in catchment 7 this result also implies that the changes in different land cover areas may not lead to corresponding linear changes in total runoff the results in catchment 8 indicate that the reduction of vegetation areas has a greater negative impact on the total runoff than the reduction of bare soil areas the total runoff is more sensitive to the decrease in bare soil areas than vegetation areas in catchment 9 especially for the scenarios with building areas increasing by 5 in addition the results of four urban catchments indicate that when the total permeable area remains the same the decrease in a single type of land cover area has a greater impact on the total runoff than the combinations of multiple land covers overall the results in fig 7 indicate that the decrease in the area of bare soil and vegetation can effectively reduce the increase in runoff caused by the increase in impervious surfaces for catchments 2 9 and 7 8 respectively which can provide references for policymakers on land planning and city development decisions from the perspectives of reducing flood risk 4 discussion 4 1 urban runoff generation calculation methods a traditional viewpoint in urban runoff generation is that runoff from impervious surfaces plays a dominant role in urban runoff brabec et al 2002 jacobson 2011 shuster et al 2008 while many recent studies point out that permeable surfaces have an equally important role in urban runoff generation berthier et al 2004 lim 2016 miller et al 2014 our results also demonstrate the importance of permeable areas in urban runoff generation figs 6 and 7 some studies suggest that both infiltration excess runoff and saturation excess runoff can occur in pervious urban areas miles and band 2015 voter and loheide 2018 in addition frequent human activities may change soil properties and water content hettiarachchi et al 2018 hettiarachchi et al 2019 ren et al 2020 thereby altering the runoff generation mode for a specific urban catchment thus a single runoff generation mode may be less appropriate for permeable urban areas however it is also difficult to identify the specific areas where infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff generation occur which may be the reason that most current urban hydrological models only use the infiltration excess models for runoff simulation the original tvgm is designed to directly describe the rainfall runoff relationship accounting for both saturation excess and infiltration excess areas xia 2002 xia et al 1997 the tvgm urban model employs a similar runoff generation method as the tvgm for runoff simulation in permeable areas and it directly recognizes the response relationships between rainfall and runoff for each land cover there is no need to identify the specific runoff generation mode for an urban catchment in the tvgm urban model in addition the impacts of different variables on runoff generation can be reflected by calibrated parameters in the tvgm urban model for example compared to the vegetation the bare soil has a slightly higher conversion rate from rainfall to runoff in most catchments according to the calibrated values of gv1 and gs1 in table s2 in the supplemental material the soil moisture has a greater impact on the runoff generation on vegetated lands than that of the bare soil because the calibrated values of gv2 are higher than gs2 values for most catchments as for the bare soil the rainfall intensity effect is higher in catchments 5 and 10 than the other catchments according to the values of gs3 these results of calibrated parameters are consistent with the runoff generation characteristics of different land covers gregory et al 2006 pitt et al 2008 ren et al 2020 voter and loheide 2018 thus compared to current infiltration excess models the tvgm urban model has better adaptability in flood simulation in urban areas with diverse land covers and can reflect the complex runoff generation mechanisms of different land covers 4 2 urban hydrological model structure in this study the detailed classification of land covers is considered in the tvgm urban and scscn models while the horton infiltration can only identify the differences between pervious and impervious areas huang et al 2006 michel et al 2005 the results of the tvgm urban and scscn models are better than those of the horton infiltration model especially in the total runoff simulation which indicates that differences in rainfall runoff responses of various land covers cannot be ignored in the study area this is consistent with previous studies showing that the runoff generation characteristics of various land covers in urban catchments can be different ren et al 2020 voter and loheide 2018 zhang et al 2018b therefore taking all permeable surfaces as a whole for the runoff generation simulation may result in large deviations between simulated and observed flows however the results in table 3 and table 4 indicate a better performance of the tvgm urban model in the hydrological process and total runoff simulations than the scscn model which may be related to the differences in the model structure the scscn model employs the cn values to reflect the rainfall runoff relationship in different land covers jiao et al 2017 michel et al 2005 while the tvgm urban model employs a variety of methods to describe the runoff generation processes of different land covers however the scscn model can only consider infiltration excess runoff generation which may be less accurate for areas with abundant soil moisture jacobson 2011 liu et al 2020b michel et al 2005 correspondingly the tvgm urban can simulate both saturation excess and infiltration excess runoff wang et al 2009 xia 1991 xia 2002 xia et al 1997 xia et al 2005 this may be the main reason for the better performance of the tvgm urban model as the model considering multiple runoff generation modes generally presents better performance than the model with single runoff generation mode for areas with various land covers huo et al 2019 liu et al 2020b qu et al 2003 moreover although the tvgm urban model has more parameters than the other two models the structural and prediction uncertainties in the tvgm urban model are less than those of the other two models indicating the relatively simple structure and the stable urban flood simulation performance of the tvgm urban model 4 3 applicability of the tvgm urban model in this study the land cover is classified into four categories i e buildings roads vegetation and bare soil chang et al 2015 miller and hess 2017 however in some studies zhang et al 2018b zhou et al 2017 the vegetation area can be further divided into grasslands shrublands forests etc the rainfall runoff relationships in grasslands and forests may be different however grasslands and shrublands constitute the main components of the vegetation in the study area as few areas are identified as forests more vegetated land cover types need to be considered for larger urban catchments however a more detailed classification of land covers which is common in some distributed or semi distributed hydrological models such as the swat model sisay et al 2017 and the vic model yang et al 2011 will also increase model complexity and reduce the applicability of the model although it may improve the understanding of runoff generation mechanisms thus the current classification of land covers and the structure in the tvgm urban model remains to be further verified in the larger urban catchments with more complicated land covers in addition the equivalent drainage system routing approach is employed as an alternative method for runoff routing in the three models since the specific information about the drainage pipeline network is unavailable our results and the previous study zhang et al 2018b demonstrate that this method can acquire acceptable results in some urban catchments the performance of all three models in urban flood simulation may be further improved when specific information about the drainage pipeline network is available and the hydraulic equations can be used for flow routing 5 conclusion in this study we developed the tvgm urban model a new urban hydrological model considering nonlinear rainfall runoff responses of various types of urban surfaces the performance and the uncertainty of the tvgm urban model are evaluated in comparison with two widely used urban hydrological runoff generation models the horton infiltration and the scscn models in the fenghuangcheng region of shenzhen city china the main findings of this study are summarized as follows 1 the tvgm urban model performs better in simulating both hydrological processes and total runoff than the other two models for most urban catchments the scscn model outperforms the horton infiltration model especially in the simulation of peak flow 2 though tvgm urban has higher parametric uncertainty for most urban catchments its structural uncertainty is smaller than that of the other two models for almost all catchments indicating a relatively simple but effective structure of the tvgm urban model in addition the prediction intervals of the tvgm urban model are less asymmetric than those of the other two models which indicates its better performance in reducing the flow prediction uncertainty 3 the runoff component analysis of four selected catchments no 2 7 8 and 9 under a 2 hour rainfall event with a return period of 5 years shows that the runoff generated by the impervious areas accounts for the majority of the total runoff in these catchments the scenario analysis considering changes in land cover areas shows that the decrease in the area of bare soil and vegetation both has negative impacts on the increase in runoff caused by the increase in building areas while the influences of changes in bare soil area and vegetation area on runoff are obvious in catchments 2 9 and 7 8 respectively credit authorship contribution
