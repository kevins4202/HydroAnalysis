7105,cosmic ray neutron sensing crns is a promising proximal soil sensing technique to estimate soil moisture at intermediate scale and high temporal resolution however the signal shows complex and non unique response to all hydrogen pools near the land surface providing some challenges for soil moisture estimation in practical applications aims of the study were 1 to assess the uncertainty of crns as a stand alone approach to estimate volumetric soil moisture in cropped field 2 to identify the causes of this uncertainty 3 and possible improvements two experimental sites in germany were equipped with a crns probe and point scale soil moisture network additional monitoring activities were conducted during the crop growing season to characterize the soil plant systems this data is used to identify and quantify the different sources of uncertainty factors an uncertainty analysis based on monte carlo approach is applied to propagate these uncertainties to crns soil moisture estimations in addition a sensitivity analysis based on the sobol method is performed to identify the most important factors explaining this uncertainty results show that crns soil moisture compares well to the soil moisture network when these point scale values are weighted to account for the spatial sensitivity of the signal and other sources of hydrogen lattice water and organic carbon are added to the water content however the performance decreases when crns is considered as a stand alone method to retrieve the actual non weighted volumetric soil moisture the support volume penetration depth and radius shows also a considerable uncertainty especially in relatively dry soil moisture conditions four of the seven factors analyzed the vertical soil moisture profile bulk density incoming neutron correction and the calibrated parameter n0 were found to play an important role among the possible improvements identified a simple correction factor based on vertical point scale soil moisture profiles shows to be a promising approach to account for the sensitivity of the crns signal to the upper soil layers keywords soil moisture cosmic ray neutrons uncertainty analysis sensitivity analysis 1 introduction soil moisture plays a crucial role in the water cycle by regulating the water fluxes to the atmosphere and controlling groundwater recharge the knowledge of its dynamics is important for drought and flood forecasting as well as for agricultural water management vereecken et al 2008 several measurement techniques to measure soil moisture have been developed from point scale sensors to remote sensing approaches corradini 2014 robinson et al 2008 in recent years the development of proximal sensors that integrate over field scale is in particular an active field of research bogena et al 2015 in this context cosmic ray neutron sensing crns is a unique method to estimate soil moisture at the intermediate scale of hundreds of meters non invasively and at a high temporal resolution hours zreda et al 2008 this method is based on the inverse relationship between natural neutrons created by cosmic ray fluxes and the presence of hydrogen which is predominantly found as water in the soil the method has shown to be accurate in several studies in a wide variety of environments baatz et al 2014 franz et al 2012 heidbüchel et al 2016 rivera villarreyes et al 2011 for this reason the approach has seen a fast expansion as it is now integrated in national networks evans et al 2016 hawdon et al 2014 zreda et al 2012 and used by several research groups all around the word applications range from inverse vadose zone modelling to estimate field scale soil parameters and fluxes foolad et al 2017 rivera villarreyes et al 2014 data assimilation in land surface models baatz et al 2017 han et al 2016 iwema et al 2017 rosolem et al 2014 validation of remote sensing products dong et al 2014 jana et al 2016 kędzior and zawadzki 2016 montzka et al 2017 and agricultural water management franz et al 2015 2016 however some limitations of the method for monitoring soil moisture have arisen because the signal is affected not only by soil moisture but also by all other hydrogen pools and land surface conditions andreasen et al 2017 in particular prior to calibration atmospheric corrections have been suggested to account for the effects of air pressure air humidity and variations in incoming neutron flux rosolem et al 2013 zreda et al 2012 in addition the standard calibration approach was further extended to account for hydrogen in lattice water and soil organic material bogena et al 2013 franz et al 2012 some corrections were also proposed to account for water in biomass baatz et al 2015 tian et al 2016 hawdon et al 2014 or to isolate the contributions of other dynamic hydrogen pools than soil moisture in the signal e g canopy interception baroni and oswald 2015 or snow schattan et al 2017 sigouin and si 2016 tian et al 2016 moreover the sensitivity of the probe was found to decrease with distance and weighting procedures to calibrate the sensor and to compare independent point scale measurements were introduced franz et al 2012 köhli et al 2015 schrön et al 2017 the same studies showed also how the support volume effective radius and soil penetration depth is not constant in time but it varies as a function of the specific environmental conditions soil moisture and vegetation on the one hand all the mentioned corrections have improved our understanding of the detected signal on the other hand they have revealed the complexity of the signal and the need of additional monitoring activities and data processing therefore they provide additional challenges for the use of crns for soil moisture estimation in specific applications e g validation of remote sensing products or agricultural water management in this study we investigate the use of crns for providing average volumetric soil moisture particular emphasis is given to the analysis and the applicability of the method as a stand alone approach for soil moisture estimation within a specified support volume effective radius and soil penetration depth data was collected at two experimental agricultural sites at one site a crns probe was added to an existing monitoring activity with some additional measurements performed to support the crns the other site is a typical example with a specific monitoring design tailored to crns needs the aims of the study are i to calibrate and evaluate crns based on two well equipped experimental sites and state of the art data processing ii to identify and quantify the sources of uncertainty data and or processing that could be relevant iii to assess their effects on crns soil moisture estimation and support volume iv to quantify the role of the different uncertainties for further developments of the method 2 methods 2 1 experimental sites and monitoring activities measurements were performed at two experimental sites in germany fig 1 both sites are agricultural fields in flat terrain but differing in crop and soil types the first experimental site belongs to the farm katharinentalerhof hereinafter referred to as kat and is located in the region kraichgau north of the city of pforzheim 48 9285 n 8 7028 e at an elevation of 319 m a s l mean annual temperature and precipitation are 9 5 c and 780 mm respectively the field size is 14 ha and during the monitoring period from april to august 2013 the field was cropped with winter wheat triticum aestivum the soils in the area are mostly formed from periglacial loess which accumulated during the last ice age groundwater levels are below 3 m depth the soil class is silt loam usda soil texture classification with soil textures in upper soil layers consisting of 3 4 81 1 and 15 4 of sand silt and clay respectively imukova et al 2016 a crns probe was installed in the middle of the field the probe crs1000 from hydroinnova ltd usa consists of a 3he filled counter tube shielded by polyethylene that serves as moderator to lower the energy of ephitermal neutrons to thermal level and enable their detection see schrön et al 2018 zreda et al 2012 for additional details additionally the volumetric soil water content was measured continuously in 15 min resolution at four depths 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm at sixteen locations with capacitance soil moisture sensors sm1 adcon telemetry austria calibration of the sensors and the crns probe was done by collecting soil samples four times during the growing season in 2013 16th april 3rd june 18th june 30th july the sampling locations did not follow the classical sampling design proposed by zreda et al 2012 as they were chosen by a stratified random design to cover the footprint of the eddy covariance ec station located at the same position as the crns imukova et al 2016 to better cover the full footprint of the crns additional six locations at distances between 185 and 235 m from the probe were sampled fig 1 the soil samples were taken in depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm though for the additional six locations only down to 30 cm the second experimental site is located on an irrigated 12 ha field north of braunschweig hereinafter referred to as bs it is located in the german lowlands 52 3587 n 10 4004 e at an elevation of about 60 m a s l mean annual temperature and precipitation are 9 2 c and 620 mm respectively dwd 2016 crns measurements were conducted from may to october 2014 and the field was cropped with maize zea maize groundwater levels at the field site are 1 8 m 2 m below surface with a slope towards the nearby small river oker in the east the soil parent material is mainly alluvial sand which was deposited by the river oker during the weichsel glacial and soil texture is classified as sand usda soil texture classification with only 9 of silt and 1 of clay the fields in this area are irrigated with an annual amount of about 520 mm of pre treated wastewater bmwa 2016 ingwersen 2001 which amends the low nutrient content and low water holding capacity of the sandy soil the irrigation on the field is via sprinkler irrigation in eight strips from west to east across the field investigated see fig 1 irrigation at the field site takes place several times during the crop season and each time the complete field is irrigated within few subsequent days with a total amount of 35 mm a crns probe was installed in the middle of the field the probe for this experimental site is self assembled and has a 3he filled counter tube canberra industries shielded by polyethylene with size and shape slightly different to the hydroinnova probe but with similar sensitivity to epithermal neutrons unpublished data point scale soil moisture probes were also installed at four different locations ml3 theta probes delta t devices were installed at 5 cm and 15 cm depth whereas 5te sensors decagon devices were installed at 5 cm 15 cm 25 cm 35 cm and 55 cm depth most point scale devices had to be removed before the harvest of maize and remained only at the single position closest to the crns probe for the period from 23rd september to 14th october soil samples for the calibration of the crns probe were taken at the 15th may 23rd july and 14th october at 20 locations within the field at 5 cm intervals down to 35 cm depth fig 1 the sampling locations were chosen adapting the sampling scheme proposed by zreda et al 2012 with distances of the outer locations to the probe slightly reduced and two additional locations sampled one close to the probe itself and one in greater distance at one of the point scale sensor positions for both field sites we measured the gravimetric water content of the soil samples by the oven drying method and we determined from the samples with known volume the bulk density ρ b at each sampling location and depth from mixed samples the lattice water lw and the water equivalent stored in soil organic matter wsoc were determined gravimetric values g g 1 are converted to volumetric values m3 m 3 by use of bulk density ρ b and lw and wsoc in this study refer to the volumetric values lattice water is determined by the loss on ignition method after the removal of organic material from the sample for kat the organic carbon content was measured with a leco carbon analyzer for bs the loss on ignition method was used to determine the organic matter content the water equivalent in soil organic matter wsoc is about the same weight as the soil organic carbon content zreda et al 2012 for the conversion to soil organic carbon the organic matter content is divided by a factor of 2 several studies suggest this factor to be more accurate than the traditional factor of 1 724 blume et al 2010 pribyl 2010 nelson and sommers 1996 this is due to the fact that organic matter does not only consist of cellulose and contains about 50 carbon that has about the same weight percentage as the water equivalent hydrogen and oxygen in organic material finally in both experimental sites crop height and biomass were monitored during the season at kat the average crop height was determined in the near surrounding of the ec station on a weekly basis at bs the crop height was measured on monthly basis until maize reached its maximum height in july at four random locations in the field 10 plants measured at each location data on crop height was interpolated to derive a daily continuous time series biomass water and dry matter was measured at kat seven times and at bs three times throughout the crop season at five kat and three bs random locations a square meter of plants was collected weighed to determine the fresh weight and dried in an oven 70 c for 72 h to constant weight to determine the dry weight the biomass water equivalent bwe accounts for the free water in the plants difference of fresh and dry weight and for the water equivalent hydrogen and oxygen stored in the tissue of the plant the calculation of water equivalent in the biomass tissue follows the stoichiometry assuming that the dry plant biomass consists of celluloses c6h12o6 or equivalent carbohydrates as described by franz et al 2013b 2 2 soil moisture from crns neutron counts were continuously aggregated to hourly intervals in units of cph in post processing mode for both field sites natural neutron radiation n is typically low at low altitudes and under wet conditions zreda et al 2012 since the corresponding counting error scales with n typical lowland applications of crns have to get along with relatively high statistical noise schrön et al 2018 to improve the signal to noise ratio a kernel regression is applied nadaraya watson kernel regression bandwidth 18 härdle et al 2004 this estimator is a weighted local average as opposed to a simple moving average and is still able to show short term reactions as they occur due to precipitation the bandwidth determines the smoothing and was chosen to have a value so that a clear response to irrigation at the field site bs is still visible in crns water content values the neutrons are sensitive to atmospheric conditions and need to be corrected for the variation in incoming neutrons air pressure neutron mitigating factor and air water vapor neutron mitigating factor corrections of the measured count rates follow the procedure described in zreda et al 2012 and rosolem et al 2013 as follows 1a f i n inc n inc 1b f p e p atm p atm λ 1c f h 1 0 0054 h air h air ref 1d n c n r f r f p f h where f represents the correction factor for incoming fi pressure fp and air humidity fh respectively hourly values of incoming neutrons ninc cph are set in relation to their mean over the measurement period n inc the pressure correction is based the hourly atmospheric pressure data patm mbar its mean over the measurement time p atm and the attenuation length λ mbar for calculation refer to dunai 2000 hourly values of absolute air humidity hair g cm 3 and the reference case of a dry atmosphere h air ref 0 g cm 3 are used to correct for water in the atmosphere nr is the raw count rate as measured by the sensor and nc the resulting corrected count rate the neutron monitor database neutron monitor database 2008 provides data on incoming neutrons ninc following recommendations from hawdon et al 2014 and schrön et al 2015 the neutron monitor station closest to each field site was chosen for the correction of the incoming neutron flux accordingly data from station jungfraujoch switzerland was used for kat and data from station kiel germany for bs weather stations provided the data for further atmospheric corrections at kat air pressure absolute humidity and precipitation are provided by sensors installed at the ec station at bs the data of a standard weather station close by 1 km distance was available for the calibration of crns the function proposed by desilets et al 2010 was used 2 θ crns a 0 n c n 0 a 1 a 2 ρ b ρ w where θ crns is volumetric water content estimated by crns m3 m 3 the parameters a0 a1 and a2 are 0 0808 0 372 and 0 115 respectively ρb and ρw are the soil bulk density g cm 3 and density of water assumed to be 1 g cm 3 respectively for calibration equation 2 is solved for the parameter n0 by using the mean corrected neutron count rate nc at the time of calibration during the soil sampling campaign n0 is a free parameter that can be interpreted as the maximum number of neutrons at the site under completely dry conditions zreda et al 2012 more recently the equation was adjusted to account for additional hydrogen pools and specific characteristics of the signal detected in particular lattice water lw and water stored in the soil organic carbon wsoc were explicitly considered dong et al 2014 hawdon et al 2014 in addition the crns signal was found to be more sensitive to the soil moisture in the upper soil layer franz et al 2012 and close to the probe köhli et al 2015 for this reason the water content estimated by crns θ crns more correctly represents a weighted soil moisture value within its support volume this implies also that for calibration and comparison to the crns point scale soil moisture measurements should be weighted for better reflecting their contribution to the signal these changes result in the following modified equation 3a θ crns θ t w t a 0 n c n 0 a 1 a 2 ρ b ρ w with 3b θ t w t θ v l w w soc wt where θ v is the volumetric water content m3 m 3 and the total water content θt is obtained as the sum of θ v lw and wsoc furthermore the values are weighted which results in a depth and distance weighted mean water content θ t wt the weighting approach applied in the present study followed the procedure described in schrön et al 2017 the approach is briefly summarized below by describing to the most important steps and dependencies useful for the discussion of the results obtained in the present study the effective penetration depth d86 θ t ρ b hveg patm is calculated at each sampling location by using the average total water content θ t averaging the total water content over the whole profile and bulk density ρ b the estimation is further corrected to account for the effect of vegetation using vegetation height hveg as a proxy and atmospheric pressure patm based on d86 the weights for each depth are calculated and the vertically weighted average water content at each location is determined these averaged soil moisture values are then horizontally weighted depending on their distance to the sensor using the radial weighting function wr θ t ρ b hveg patm hair this function accounts for all the parameters considered for the estimation of the penetration depth and additionally for the actual air humidity hair neutron mitigating factor then the horizontal footprint radius of the crns r86 is calculated as the radius from within 86 of the neutrons originated the continuous point scale measurements from all the soil moisture sensors are also weighted based on the same approach for each time step hours a total water content is calculated as the sum of θ v lw and wsoc at the specific site data on air pressure air humidity and vegetation height are given for each time step and from all sensor locations a vertically and horizontally weighted average of total water content θt wt is obtained from these continuous measurements also the penetration depth d86 and the footprint radius r86 of the cosmic ray can be determined for each time step based on equations from schrön et al 2017 finally for an overall assessment of the crns the total volume of water vw m3 detected by the crns is calculated as follows 4 v w θ v d 86 100 π r 86 2 where 100 is a converting factor to transform the units of d86 from cm to m 2 3 analysis based on the general probabilistic framework the data collected at both field sites are further analyzed based on the general probabilistic framework proposed in baroni and tarantola 2014 the framework is used 1 for the assessment of the uncertainty in crns estimation 2 to quantify the role of the different sources of uncertainty factors and 3 to identify possible further improvements a general sketch of the approach is illustrated in fig 2 and described below first each source of uncertainty factors is identified and characterized fig 2 step 1 in case of a scalar factor parameters the uncertainty is characterized by a probabilistic distribution function pdf fig 2 factor a to account for non scalar factors e g time series a two steps strategy is defined fig 2 factor b in the first step n possible realizations are defined e g two equally probable time series ts1 and ts2 in the second step the n realizations are associated to a discrete uniform distribution ud in the range 1 n the results of the framework are very sensitive to the definition of these distributions baroni et al 2017 for this reason in the specific case study the factors are not specified a priori instead they are identified and characterized based on the actual measurements and results obtained at the two experimental sites from the distributions of factor a and b a discrete number of samples is selected fig 2 step 2 in the specific case the sampling design is based on the quasi random sequences to cover the input space evenly kucherenko et al 2009 these uncertainties are then propagated based on monte carlo approach to estimate the expected uncertainty in the estimation fig 2 step 3 the approach is similar to the assessment presented by avery et al 2016 also for crns in this present study however the analysis is extended to all the crns estimations namely not only soil moisture θ v eq 3 but also to effective penetration depth d86 footprint radius r86 and total water volume vw eq 4 to assess the propagated uncertainty of the crns estimation the mean standard deviation σ and the mean root mean square error rmse are used as statistical metrics 5 σ 1 t t 1 t 1 n j 1 n y t j y t 2 6 rmse 1 n j 1 n 1 t t 1 t y t j y t 2 where yt j denotes the crns estimation at time step t and realization sample j y t denotes the mean of the crns estimation across all the realizations at time t y t denotes the corresponding observed value from averaged point measurements against which the performance is assessed in eq 5 the standard deviation is averaged over all time steps t to quantify the mean spread of the uncertainty in eq 6 the rmse is averaged over all realizations samples to assess the mean error of the estimation a convergence analysis is also performed to evaluate the actual number of samples used in the monte carlo approach where the analysis is considered stable if the standard deviation does not change by increasing the number of samples in order to identify the most influential factors a sensitivity analysis sa is performed that is able to quantify the contribution of the different sources of uncertainty fig 2 step 4 the approach is based on the variance decomposition proposed by sobol 2001 accordingly two sensitivity indices are defined as follows 7 s i v x i e x i y x i v y 8 s t i e x i v x i y x i v y where xi are the values of the ith input factor x i denotes the array of all input factors except xi v and e denote variance and expectation operators respectively and y is the crns estimation si main effect represents the average reduction in the variance of the crns estimation y when the input factor i would be fully known and fixed sti total effect includes also all the interactions between i and the other factors and can be interpreted as the expected variance that would be left if all factors except for i are fixed si and sti both vary in the range of zero to one with high values indicating high sensitivity important factors the difference between indices indicates strong interactions of the factor i with other factors in case the difference is not negligible the sensitivity of the factor depends on the value assumed by the other factors and the factor is also said to be non identifiable ghasemizade et al 2017 readers interested in further details about these sensitivity indices are referred to saltelli et al 2007 the indices are estimated based on the approach of saltelli et al 2010 since the indices are also estimated by monte carlo approach sampling the probabilistic distribution functions with a specified number of samples they are prone to errors for this reason the estimations are evaluated based on the convergence of the confidence interval ci 95 calculated with the bootstrap method as suggested by sarrazin et al 2016 in this approach the ci is calculated increasing the sample size and the result is considered acceptable if it reaches a specify threshold ci 0 1 finally the results of the sa are discussed to identify the strategies for further improvements fig 2 step 5 this could be achieved in different ways depending on the factor identified in the specific case study new monitoring activities new data processing or modifications of the specific equations are evaluated 3 results 3 1 crns neutron counts and calibration crns provides a continuous time series of neutron counts for the field site kat from 3rd april to 8th august 2013 for bs the crns measurements cover a period from 14th april to 14th october 2014 though the dataset exhibits some data gaps fig 3 these gaps were caused by power failure from batteries and solar panel at kat the corrected neutron counts are in the range of 726 1108 cph while at bs they range from 970 to 1435 cph accordingly a slightly lower noise of the hourly neutron counts is detected at bs compared to kat still the count rates at both field sites show a clear response to rain and in case of bs also irrigation the measurements obtained during the soil sampling campaigns are listed together with the resulting calibration parameters n0 in table 1 the silty soil at kat has in general higher soil moisture values than the sandy soil at bs especially dry conditions are captured at the second calibration at bs in july the arithmetic mean θt and the weighted average θt wt of the total water content differ mainly due to non homogeneous distribution of the vertical soil moisture profiles and to a lesser extent to the horizontal soil moisture spatial variability within the field mean neutron counts at calibration are very similar for all four dates at kat while the water content θt wt differs distinctly at bs the mean neutron counts as well as the water content values at calibration differ distinctly it was expected that the calibration parameters n0 would depend on the biomass water content and n0 values should slightly decrease with increasing biomass baatz et al 2015 baroni and oswald 2015 franz et al 2013b hawdon et al 2014 however in this study a clear and significant dependence of n0 on biomass water equivalent bwe is not observed at both field sites table 1 the reasons are not identified in the present study as several factors could be considered for instance at kat the similar neutron counts and distinct water content values lead to calibration parameters dependent on water content wettest conditions lead to the highest n0 suggesting the need for further adaptation of the parameters of the desilets equation as it has been proposed also in other studies iwema et al 2017 rivera villarreyes et al 2011 at bs the calibration in july was done after the tasseling stage of maize when plants contain the highest amounts of water that we measured see table 1 which should result in a lower calibration parameter n0 instead n0 value is larger than for the two other calibration dates but still within the standard deviation of neutron counts 33 cph the calibration however is based on the data collected during an exceptional dry period assuming the seasonal difference between crns soil moisture and point scale soil moisture as a first order estimation of the biomass contribution see baroni and oswald 2015 the results indicate an underestimation of the water content in very dry condition of the desilets equation which was also found in other studies baatz et al 2014 heidbüchel et al 2016 higher value of crns soil moisture would have led in fact to bigger differences with point scale soil moisture and would have revealed the biomass contribution finally the uncertainty also in the specific factors identified in the present studies and discussed below could play a role showing differences that could have hidden the biomass contribution for these reasons further studies are recommended to address the effects of biomass in more detail 3 2 soil moisture derived by crns for the further interpretation of the results the soil moisture obtained with the mean n0 over all soil sampling campaigns is used at kat n0 1438 cph and at bs n0 1531 cph based on these the overall dynamics between weighted point scale soil moisture θt wt and crns θcrns are compared fig 3 lower panel at kat the time series of crns is well comparable with the values from the point scale sensor network rmse is 0 03 m3 m 3 and is consistent to other studies conducted in similar conditions coopersmith et al 2014 tian et al 2016 however θcrns still shows a higher variability despite the kernel regression applied this is to some degree a consequence of the low count rate at kat and the resulting low signal to noise ratio however it is noteworthy that at this experimental site the shallowest point scale sensor was installed at a depth of 10 cm since crns is more sensitive to the soil moisture in the first few centimeters the crns signal better detected the faster dynamic in the top soil for instance lv et al 2014 had a similar setting and they could show how the integration of surface soil moisture simulated by hydrus significantly improved the comparison at bs θcrns shows similar discrepancy to θt wt fig 3 with the overall rmse of 0 02 m3 m 3 however it has to be noted that θt wt are averaged from only a few locations within the field and from the end of september only sensors close to the crns probe are left in the field for this reason θt wt at bs can be considered for comparison but is not suited as direct evaluation of the crns for instance θt wt strongly increases during irrigation periods but devices react to local timing of irrigation only cover half of the irrigation strips and represent no field mean during this time on the contrary θcrns shows clear response to the irrigation on the field it might be also noted that crns could be influenced by irrigation on other fields in the outer part of the footprint however irrigation on the fields in the outer footprint are most of the time less important than the response to precipitation or the irrigation on the field investigated as an exception around the 20th july an increase in crns values can be solely attributed to the irrigation on an adjoining field which provides experimental support of the large footprint of the sensor especially under dry conditions a quantification of the crns response to single irrigation events could not be achieved as there are intermingled effects of precipitation and irrigation in different parts of the footprint thus crns measurements show a more reliable average of total water content in the field compared to the water content from the point scale measurements 3 3 definition of the sources of uncertainty based on the datasets collected at the two experimental sites seven factors were identified as possible sources of uncertainty affecting crns estimation the factors are listed in table 2 together with the distributions considered in the further uncertainty and sensitivity analysis and presented in the following 1 incoming neutrons ninc time series of incoming neutrons used for the correction of the crns neutron counts are available from the monitoring neutrons network neutron monitor database 2008 as was recommended by hawdon et al 2014 and schrön et al 2015 a practical approach is to select the time series from the location closest to the specific experimental site however it is still not fully understood which neutron monitor represents a given location on earth best kudela 2012 due to the complex spatial distribution of cosmic radiation bütikofer et al 2015 local temporal changes of the magnetosphere herbst et al 2013 or device specific differences dorman 2004 krüger et al 2008 for this reason this factor could still introduce some uncertainty in the soil moisture estimation to account for this possible source of uncertainty two different time series of incoming neutrons are considered in the assessment the time series from the station kiel and from the station jungfraujoch the factor ninc is defined by a discrete uniform distribution ud 1 2 depending on the sample value the time series of jungfraujoch ninc 1 or kiel ninc 2 is used in the further uncertainty and sensitivity analysis 2 vegetation veg a major source of uncertainty that could affect the crns signal discussed also in several other studies is the hydrogen pool stored in the biomass baatz et al 2015 baroni and oswald 2015 franz et al 2013b hornbuckle et al 2012 this is assumed to be an especially important factor for agricultural sites where field crops can constitute a big varying hydrogen pool over the season though less in absolute contribution compared to forest sites we note on the one hand that a clear relation between growing biomass and neutron counts was not detected in the present study for this reason this type of correction was not included directly in the analysis on the other hand however the calculation of the spatial weights accounts for the effect of above ground biomass köhli et al 2015 schrön et al 2017 this approach assumes a constant density of biomass water ρ veg 0 005 g cm 3 and uses vegetation height as a proxy of the total biomass water equivalent this relation could vary significantly between vegetation types introducing additional errors in the soil moisture and support volume to account for this potential source of uncertainty the measured vegetation height is perturbed assuming a white noise zero mean and given standard deviation the distributions were selected to achieve a variable density of biomass consistent with the crop types in each experimental sites i e ρ veg 0 005 0 0005 g cm 3 and 0 005 0 0002 g cm 3 for kat and bs respectively 3 lattice water and water storage in the soil organic carbon sw lw wsoc these parameters were measured and it was detected a certain spatial variability in each experimental site table 2 however an average value has to be removed from the total water content estimated by crns eq 3 to retrieve volumetric soil moisture to account for that in the assessment a gaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation measured in each experimental site is defined 4 bulk density ρ b this factor is used to derive volumetric water content see eq 3 but also in this case it was detected a certain spatial variability in each experimental site for this reason bulk density is also considered an additional source of uncertainty similar to sw a gaussian distribution mean and standard deviation is defined based on the values measured in each experimental site 5 desilets equation parameter n0 the variability identified in the calibrated parameter n0 lumps several sources of uncertainty that cannot be distinguished besides representing static properties of the site n0 could be affected by time variant properties in each specific site in particular the variability of n0 in different calibration dates could be induced by the underestimation in dry conditions detected in some studies baatz et al 2014 heidbüchel et al 2016 or include contributions from other hydrogen pools not explicitly considered such as biomass hornbuckle et al 2012 therefore this parameter is considered uncertain and a uniform probabilistic distribution is defined based on the range detected in the calibrations of each experimental site 6 7 vertical soil moisture profile p and horizontal soil moisture spatial variability s respectively the sensitivity of crns decreases with depth and distance from the sensor franz et al 2012 köhli et al 2015 schrön et al 2017 for this reason soil moisture estimated by crns was found to be a weighted value of the water equivalent within the support volume in case soil moisture is homogenous θ crns minus sw can be considered as the actual mean volumetric soil moisture θ v see eq 3 however since soil moisture can vary significantly within the soil profile and horizontally crns soil moisture tends to deviate from this value an example is shown in fig 4 where the volumetric soil moisture measurements θ v of the point scale sensors are shown at selected days with the same θcrns value different soil moisture profiles drying wetting and homogeneous distribution are presented in general the differences within the profile are more pronounced at kat it is notable how the same soil moisture value estimated by crns θ crns could coincide with different actual average conditions θ v depending on vertical and horizontal soil moisture variability for a stand alone use of this method to retrieve soil moisture this means that the approach is also affected by this non unique relation to account for that in the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis three characteristic vertical soil moisture profiles and three types of horizontal soil moisture spatial variabilities were considered in the former 1 a drying front 2 a vertical homogenous profile and 3 a wetting front are defined for the latter we considered that 1 the area close to the probe radius 75 m is wetter 2 the field is homogeneous and 3 the area close to the probe radius 75 m is drier the approaches for generating the specific vertical soil moisture profiles and the horizontal spatial soil moisture variability based on the crns soil moisture θ crns are described in details in the appendix a similar to the incoming correction two uniform discrete scalar factors p 1 2 3 and s 1 2 3 are defined for the vertical soil moisture profile and for the horizontal soil moisture spatial variability respectively these factors are sampled in the monte carlo approach for the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis by that the uncertainty in the estimation of the actual volumetric soil moisture θ v and support volume are characterized assuming that one of these cases could be a possible realistic realization of the soil moisture condition of the field 3 4 uncertainty analysis the seven factors and their distribution were sampled with a sample size 1000 and no correlation between the factors their uncertainties were propagated in a monte carlo approach for the assessment of the uncertainty in the estimation of the volumetric soil moisture θ v penetration depth d86 footprint radius r86 and total volume of water vw the results obtained with the maximum sample size are shown in fig 5 the uncertainty analysis as a function of the sample size is shown in appendix b fig b1 and provides the stability of the results and of the sample size used for the assessment overall the results show uncertainty in soil moisture θ v and support volume d86 and r86 for both experimental sites fig 5 both rmse and σ for soil moisture reach 0 06 m3 m 3 and 0 04 m3 m 3 for kat and bs respectively for both field sites rmse values increase in comparison to the values obtained in the previous section and presented in literature when θcrns is compared to the total weighted water content θt wt thus it becomes apparent if and how the use of a crns as a stand alone approach to retrieve actual non weighted volumetric soil moisture is prone to higher uncertainty this is for instance the case when the values are directly compared to remote sensing products or they are used for practical application e g irrigation it is also interesting to note how at kat wetter conditions the uncertainty in soil moisture is relatively higher than at bs however the contrary occurs in terms of penetration depth d86 for which the uncertainty is lower at kat rmse 2 cm than at bs rmse 4 cm on opposite the uncertainties detected in the footprint radius show comparable agreement for the two experimental sites rmse 11 m for both experimental sites in the range of the uncertainty related to the model assumptions köhli et al 2015 the differences in uncertainties detected in the two experimental sites are attributed to the different soil moisture conditions at kat water content values are higher than in bs this also reflects in the lower effective penetration depth d86 and the smaller footprint radius r86 this means that in these conditions the support volume is relatively well characterized low uncertainty in d86 and r86 while most of the uncertainty is related to the estimated soil moisture within this volume at bs the soil moisture is lower and d86 and r86 values are higher this means that in these conditions the estimated soil moisture is estimated well but the support volume d86 and r86 is uncertain it is however interesting to note that the differences detected in the two experimental sites compensate one another when the uncertainties of the three crns products are combined into the total volume of water vw m3 detected by the crns the results depicted in fig 5 lower panels shows that the uncertainties detected in each experimental site are more comparable than those of the individual estimations are nevertheless slightly higher uncertainty is detected at bs rmse 347 m3 in comparison to kat rmse 244 m3 this result shows how the lower uncertainty detected for the soil moisture at bs is a misleading quantity as it is compensated by a higher uncertainty of the effective penetration depth for these reasons the crns uncertainty has to be considered as a combined quantity that should encompass the actual soil moisture and support volume 3 5 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is conducted on the same factors considered for the uncertainty analysis table 2 in this analysis however 74000 samples were selected from the distribution of each factor this sample size showed to provide acceptable estimation of the sensitivity indices based on the convergence analysis see appendix c the analysis is performed assuming the specific average values measured in each experimental sites e g average plant height air pressure etc and is repeated for ten different neutron count rates and corresponding soil moisture this was done to make the analysis traceable but also to identify the possible role of the different factors in different conditions in time ghasemizade et al 2017 pianosi and wagener 2016 reusser et al 2011 the main effect si estimated for each factor and each experimental site is shown in fig 6 as a function of the mean soil moisture average soil moisture estimated based on all realizations the uncertainties in θ v r86 and vw are mainly explained by the uncertainty in the vertical soil moisture profile p at both experimental sites as indicated by the high value of the sensitivity indices for this factor the p factor is also important in most of the soil moisture conditions and tends to decrease only in extreme conditions very wet or very dry this is consistent with the way the factor is characterized the variability of the soil moisture profile tends to decrease to homogenous soil moisture profile in these conditions see appendix a fig a1 at kat additional uncertainty is explained by the choice of the incoming neutron time series ninc and to lesser extent the parameter n0 in particular for wet conditions this is due to the low count rates for which the variability of these factors becomes relatively more important on the contrary these factors are less important at bs considering the penetration depth bulk density plays a crucial role this behavior is especially evident at bs at kat it is also important but followed by the soil moisture profile p as identified before the incoming correction becomes important in the very wet range with low count rates the difference between total effect sti and main effect si is within the confidence interval obtained in the convergence analysis 0 1 therefore this quantity does not provide additional information and is not presented it is noteworthy however how the small differences between main effect and total effect indicate low interactions between the factors there is no dependency or compensation between the factors in estimating soil moisture and support volume thus each factor is identifiable and could be independently considered for further improvements ghasemizade et al 2017 saltelli et al 2010 4 towards further improvements in crns soil moisture estimation despite some variability of the important factors as a function of soil moisture conditions and so being time dependent four factors are identified to be generally the most important in explaining the uncertainty detected in crns in both experimental sites the factors are further discussed in this section possible solutions for reducing their impact on the uncertainty in crns soil moisture estimation are also presented 4 1 actual soil moisture profile the identification of the importance of the soil moisture profile is directly related to the importance of the weighting functions as reported in earlier studies franz et al 2012 schrön et al 2017 by that the missing knowledge about the shape of the vertical profile limits the direct use of the crns as a stand alone method for estimating volumetric soil moisture θ v in practical applications e g validation of remote sensing or irrigation water management to overcome this limitation soil or land surface hydrological models could be combined in data assimilation framework to estimate the soil moisture profile baatz et al 2017 han et al 2016 iwema et al 2017 rosolem et al 2014 but this requires a high additional effort also from the hydrological modelling perspective data and parameters for setting the model instead a more practical solution could be the use of representative point scale sensors installed within the crns footprint to determine the shape of the soil moisture profile these profiles could show the soil moisture conditions wetting or drying and could provide additional information for the evaluation of the soil moisture estimated by crns to test this hypothesis a simple weighting correction factor is calculated as follows 1 average θ p and weighted average θ p wt soil moisture in one point location p is calculated 2 the weighting correction factor fwt is calculated as fwt θ p θ p wt 3 this factor is used to correct crns soil moisture as θ crns non wt θ crns fwt 4 finally average lw and wsoc are subtracted to obtain the corrected volumetric soil moisture estimated by crns as θ crns v θ crns non wt lw wsoc based on the data collected at kat the factor was calculated for each point location and used for correction the values of θ crns v are compared to θ v that were to recall it here being obtained as the non weighted average volumetric soil moisture from all the point scale measurements on average the rmse reduces from 0 05 m3 m 3 by considering crns not corrected θ crns to 0 03 m3 m 3 by that the analysis shows how the approach could be a promising correction that should be considered when crns is used as a stand alone approach for soil moisture estimation it has also to be noted that the use of additional point scale sensors already showed to be useful in previous studies for the assessment of other temporal variant hydrogen pools with crns like biomass and water canopy interception baroni and oswald 2015 therefore the installation of some point scale soil moisture measurements within the support volume e g distance 50 m from the crns probe should be considered as a good practice not only for evaluation of the crns but as a permanent addition to the field monitoring equipment however further studies could focus on the best number and positions to be considered for the correction of the crns signal and the assessment of additional hydrogen pools 4 2 bulk density bulk density is found to be important in particular for the determination of the effective penetration depth d86 for this reason the estimation of d86 could be reformulated by directly using gravimetric water content this would avoid the use of bulk density in the equation and would reduce the uncertainty in the estimation it has to be noted however that the importance of this factor is strongly related to the agricultural fields considered in the present study bulk density was found to vary considerably due to the spatial variability of tillage and resettlement pace soil texture rooting density etc at agricultural sites furthermore also the temporal variability of bulk density induced by tillage might play a role for these reasons a relatively wide range of bulk density was considered in the assessment see table 2 in other sites this variability could be smaller and by that the relative importance of this factor in comparison to other sources of uncertainty could be lower 4 3 incoming neutrons ninc and the calibration parameter n0 the choice of the neutron monitoring station as reference for the correction of variations in the incoming neutron intensity was shown to be an important factor affecting the crns estimation thus the common approach to take the data from the closest station could lead to significant errors particularly in regions that are poorly covered by the global monitoring network for this reason it is recommended to conduct additional experiments to develop scaling factors to improve the representativeness of current monitoring stations hawdon et al 2014 or to test other measurement options that could be taken as reference flux for incoming neutrons desilets et al 2010 schrön et al 2015 a similar relevance was quantified for the parameter n0 in this case however the parameter lumps several possible sources of uncertainty and it was not possible to identify the specific reason of this it is interesting to note however how the identification and reduction of the different sources of uncertainty could provide promising reduction also on the variability of n0 supporting the existence of a single universal calibration function for crns applications schrön et al 2017 4 4 non relevant and non considered factors three factors were found to be relatively not important in the specific study namely sw lattice water and water storage in soil organic carbon vegetation and horizontal soil moisture spatial variability even though the results are consistent within the two experimental sites caution is advised to generalize the results in other field conditions considering the sw it has to be noted that the analysis is conducted during one crop season during this period sw value is not affected by temporal variability and subtracting averaged values from crns estimation eq 3 can be considered as a good practice to obtain the volumetric soil moisture θ v however in a longer term years organic carbon could vary from additional manure applied by the farmers or from slow decay or long turnover time of plant residue dead plant material remaining after harvesting franz et al 2013b this could increases the importance of this factor providing additional challenges for the use of crns for long monitoring observations similarly vegetation was found not to be an important factor in the specific case study on the one hand the reason could be attributed among others to the underestimation of the desilets equation in dry condition or the need of specific parameter calibration see section 3 1 for this reason additional neutron transport modelling studies should focus on the assessment of the equation in this condition on the other hand in the present study it was assumed that the temporal variability of the vegetation height is well known as it was measured and only the uncertainty in the density of biomass water was considered in the assessment by that this factor was found to not play an important role different results could be achieved when also vegetation heights are not measured as it is the case of rover applications e g dong et al 2014 finally soil moisture spatial variability was also found to not be an important factor although this is consistent with previous results conducted in natural soil conditions franz et al 2013a different conclusions could be drawn when extreme spatial variability is considered e g when different land use types or ponding water within the footprint are present schrön et al 2017 overall it has to be noted that the selection of the sources of uncertainty and their quantifications were defined by the data and results obtained at the specific experimental sites for instance the corrections for air pressure and air humidity were not considered as sources of uncertainty in the present study because a representative weather station data was available at the sites and no error was supposed to affect the crns soil moisture estimation and support volume in addition the air humidity correction was found to be negligible in most of the cases investigated in other studies where data does not represent well local conditions these factors could be considered additional sources of uncertainty similarly other factors could be considered important as the presence of litter layer in forest sites bogena et al 2013 the probabilistic framework used in the present study however could be easily adopted to account for these additional sources of uncertainty 5 conclusions data from stationary cosmic ray neutron sensors crns in two cropped fields has been calibrated and compared to point scale soil moisture monitoring networks an uncertainty analysis was performed for the assessment of the accuracy of the estimation and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the major sources of uncertainty results have proven that crns is a robust and valid proximal soil sensing method to estimate soil moisture at the field scale based on state of the art data processing the rmse calculated in comparison to total weighted point scale soil moisture measurements was found to be 0 03 m3 m 3 in both experimental sites this value is in agreement with results obtained in other studies baatz et al 2014 franz et al 2012 hawdon et al 2014 penetration depth ranged from 10 cm to 40 cm and footprint radius from 100 m to 200 m depending on local conditions soil moisture and vegetation data obtained in the two different experimental sites was also used to identify and quantify seven sources of uncertainty that were considered for the further assessment of crns as a stand alone method for soil moisture estimation based on these the uncertainty analysis has shown how the rmse increased up to 0 06 m3 m 3 in addition the effective penetration depth was uncertain within a range of up to 5 cm in comparison the footprint radius was less affected with an average uncertainty of 10 m which is in the range of the uncertainty that has been identified by köhli et al 2015 as being related to model assumptions finally we found that these uncertainties tend to compensate each other therefore the use of total volume of water as obtained by integrating also the actual volume investigated by the sensor could be considered as valuable quantity in future applications a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the major source of uncertainty and provide some guidelines for further improvements four major factors were identified by that the vertical soil moisture profile bulk density incoming neutrons and the calibrated parameter n0 the role of these factors was consistent between the two experimental sites with only some minor differences depending on the actual soil moisture conditions among the possible improvements identified a simple correction factor based on few point scale soil moisture measurements provides promising results to account for the sensitivity of the crns signal to the upper soil layers by that the accuracy in soil moisture estimation when crns is used as a stand alone method is improved e g validation of remote sensing product or agricultural water management the incoming correction was also found to be sensitive to the particular reference neutron monitoring location used and the uncertainty could become more influential in regions that are poorly covered by the global neutron monitoring network for this reason additional studies should be conducted developing scaling factors for the specific locations hawdon et al 2014 or evaluating additional local monitoring approaches schrön et al 2015 finally while the results are inherently specific to the two agricultural field sites the general probabilistic framework used in the present study can be easily extended to identify the role of influential factors also for other experimental sites in this context however we underline the importance of the correct quantification of the sources of uncertainty as the results are very sensitive to these distributions baroni et al 2017 acknowledgments g baroni was

the lab a estimation of the actual non weighted soil moisture soil moisture estimated by crns θ crns is a weighted value of the sum of actual soil moisture θ v lattice water and soil organic carbon within the support volume köhli et al 2015 schrön et al 2017 the following procedure is used for the assessment of the actual soil moisture θ v based on the θ crns the results obtained in one example are shown in fig a1 1 based on neutrons counts θ crns is estimated by equation 3 2 a first guess is attributed to the actual soil moisture θ v 3 the factor p 1 2 3 and s 1 2 3 are randomly sampled in the monte carlo analysis based on that the specific soil moisture profile and spatial soil moisture variability are defined respectively in particular in case of the soil moisture profile three scenarios are considered o p 1 θ v is multiplied by the following arbitrary weights wtpw 1 728 1 680 1 520 1 280 0 960 0 832 0 800 0 800 0 800 0 800 0 800 0 800 0 800 0 800 0 800 0 800 by that a wetting front based on 16 values every 5 cm down to 80 cm is defined with its mean equal to θ v o p 2 a homogeneous profile is considered by that θ v values are assigned to the 16 depths every 5 cm down to 80 cm o p 3 θ v is multiplied by the following weights wtpd 0 674 0 774 0 839 0 889 0 929 0 964 0 994 1 021 1 046 1 068 1 088 1 107 1 125 1 142 1 158 1 173 by that a drying soil moisture profile based on 16 values every 5 cm down to 80 cm is defined with its mean equal to θ v to account also for the spatial variability four locations are defined within the footprint these locations were selected based on the standard soil sampling scheme adopted in literature i e 25 75 150 250 m franz et al 2012 based on that three scenarios are defined o s 1 θ v is multiplied by the following weights wtcw 1 4 1 4 0 6 0 6 by that a field characterized by a wetter center but its mean is defined equal to θ v o s 2 the field is considered to be horizontally homogeneous by that the θ v value is attributed to the four positions within the footprint o s 3 θ v is multiplied by the following weights wtcd 0 6 0 6 1 4 1 4 by that a field characterized by a drier center but its mean is defined equal to θ v 1 based on these soil moisture values attributed to different depths and locations the total weighted soil moisture θ t wt is calculated following the procedure of schrön et al 2017 2 the difference δθ θ t wt θ crns is calculated 3 the code is iterated from 2 θ v is optimized minimizing δθ based on last square approach using as a convergence criteria δθ 0 005 m3 m 3 it has to be noted that the prescribed scenarios as defined so far could create unrealistic soil moisture conditions in case the soil is close to saturation in this condition it is unlikely to have the vertical and spatial variability as described by the weights wtpw wtpd wtcw wtcd to account for that the weights are corrected as follows 1 saturated soil moisture θ s is defined e g 0 55 m3 m 3 and the relative saturation is calculated as follows sr θ s θ v θ s 2 sr is used to reduce the curvature of the soil moisture profiles in case the values are close to saturation by correcting the weights as follows wt pcor s r wt p 16 s r wt p 16 with wtp wtpw or wtpd based on that in the extreme conditions where the actual soil moisture is close to saturation the scenarios converge to homogenous soil moisture profile sr is also used to reduce the spatial variability in extreme conditions as follows wt scor s r wt s 4 s r wt s 4 with wts wtcw or wtcd based on that in the extreme conditions where the actual soil moisture is close to saturation the scenarios converge to horizontally homogenous soil moisture b convergence of the uncertainty analysis c convergence of the sensitivity analysis 
7105,cosmic ray neutron sensing crns is a promising proximal soil sensing technique to estimate soil moisture at intermediate scale and high temporal resolution however the signal shows complex and non unique response to all hydrogen pools near the land surface providing some challenges for soil moisture estimation in practical applications aims of the study were 1 to assess the uncertainty of crns as a stand alone approach to estimate volumetric soil moisture in cropped field 2 to identify the causes of this uncertainty 3 and possible improvements two experimental sites in germany were equipped with a crns probe and point scale soil moisture network additional monitoring activities were conducted during the crop growing season to characterize the soil plant systems this data is used to identify and quantify the different sources of uncertainty factors an uncertainty analysis based on monte carlo approach is applied to propagate these uncertainties to crns soil moisture estimations in addition a sensitivity analysis based on the sobol method is performed to identify the most important factors explaining this uncertainty results show that crns soil moisture compares well to the soil moisture network when these point scale values are weighted to account for the spatial sensitivity of the signal and other sources of hydrogen lattice water and organic carbon are added to the water content however the performance decreases when crns is considered as a stand alone method to retrieve the actual non weighted volumetric soil moisture the support volume penetration depth and radius shows also a considerable uncertainty especially in relatively dry soil moisture conditions four of the seven factors analyzed the vertical soil moisture profile bulk density incoming neutron correction and the calibrated parameter n0 were found to play an important role among the possible improvements identified a simple correction factor based on vertical point scale soil moisture profiles shows to be a promising approach to account for the sensitivity of the crns signal to the upper soil layers keywords soil moisture cosmic ray neutrons uncertainty analysis sensitivity analysis 1 introduction soil moisture plays a crucial role in the water cycle by regulating the water fluxes to the atmosphere and controlling groundwater recharge the knowledge of its dynamics is important for drought and flood forecasting as well as for agricultural water management vereecken et al 2008 several measurement techniques to measure soil moisture have been developed from point scale sensors to remote sensing approaches corradini 2014 robinson et al 2008 in recent years the development of proximal sensors that integrate over field scale is in particular an active field of research bogena et al 2015 in this context cosmic ray neutron sensing crns is a unique method to estimate soil moisture at the intermediate scale of hundreds of meters non invasively and at a high temporal resolution hours zreda et al 2008 this method is based on the inverse relationship between natural neutrons created by cosmic ray fluxes and the presence of hydrogen which is predominantly found as water in the soil the method has shown to be accurate in several studies in a wide variety of environments baatz et al 2014 franz et al 2012 heidbüchel et al 2016 rivera villarreyes et al 2011 for this reason the approach has seen a fast expansion as it is now integrated in national networks evans et al 2016 hawdon et al 2014 zreda et al 2012 and used by several research groups all around the word applications range from inverse vadose zone modelling to estimate field scale soil parameters and fluxes foolad et al 2017 rivera villarreyes et al 2014 data assimilation in land surface models baatz et al 2017 han et al 2016 iwema et al 2017 rosolem et al 2014 validation of remote sensing products dong et al 2014 jana et al 2016 kędzior and zawadzki 2016 montzka et al 2017 and agricultural water management franz et al 2015 2016 however some limitations of the method for monitoring soil moisture have arisen because the signal is affected not only by soil moisture but also by all other hydrogen pools and land surface conditions andreasen et al 2017 in particular prior to calibration atmospheric corrections have been suggested to account for the effects of air pressure air humidity and variations in incoming neutron flux rosolem et al 2013 zreda et al 2012 in addition the standard calibration approach was further extended to account for hydrogen in lattice water and soil organic material bogena et al 2013 franz et al 2012 some corrections were also proposed to account for water in biomass baatz et al 2015 tian et al 2016 hawdon et al 2014 or to isolate the contributions of other dynamic hydrogen pools than soil moisture in the signal e g canopy interception baroni and oswald 2015 or snow schattan et al 2017 sigouin and si 2016 tian et al 2016 moreover the sensitivity of the probe was found to decrease with distance and weighting procedures to calibrate the sensor and to compare independent point scale measurements were introduced franz et al 2012 köhli et al 2015 schrön et al 2017 the same studies showed also how the support volume effective radius and soil penetration depth is not constant in time but it varies as a function of the specific environmental conditions soil moisture and vegetation on the one hand all the mentioned corrections have improved our understanding of the detected signal on the other hand they have revealed the complexity of the signal and the need of additional monitoring activities and data processing therefore they provide additional challenges for the use of crns for soil moisture estimation in specific applications e g validation of remote sensing products or agricultural water management in this study we investigate the use of crns for providing average volumetric soil moisture particular emphasis is given to the analysis and the applicability of the method as a stand alone approach for soil moisture estimation within a specified support volume effective radius and soil penetration depth data was collected at two experimental agricultural sites at one site a crns probe was added to an existing monitoring activity with some additional measurements performed to support the crns the other site is a typical example with a specific monitoring design tailored to crns needs the aims of the study are i to calibrate and evaluate crns based on two well equipped experimental sites and state of the art data processing ii to identify and quantify the sources of uncertainty data and or processing that could be relevant iii to assess their effects on crns soil moisture estimation and support volume iv to quantify the role of the different uncertainties for further developments of the method 2 methods 2 1 experimental sites and monitoring activities measurements were performed at two experimental sites in germany fig 1 both sites are agricultural fields in flat terrain but differing in crop and soil types the first experimental site belongs to the farm katharinentalerhof hereinafter referred to as kat and is located in the region kraichgau north of the city of pforzheim 48 9285 n 8 7028 e at an elevation of 319 m a s l mean annual temperature and precipitation are 9 5 c and 780 mm respectively the field size is 14 ha and during the monitoring period from april to august 2013 the field was cropped with winter wheat triticum aestivum the soils in the area are mostly formed from periglacial loess which accumulated during the last ice age groundwater levels are below 3 m depth the soil class is silt loam usda soil texture classification with soil textures in upper soil layers consisting of 3 4 81 1 and 15 4 of sand silt and clay respectively imukova et al 2016 a crns probe was installed in the middle of the field the probe crs1000 from hydroinnova ltd usa consists of a 3he filled counter tube shielded by polyethylene that serves as moderator to lower the energy of ephitermal neutrons to thermal level and enable their detection see schrön et al 2018 zreda et al 2012 for additional details additionally the volumetric soil water content was measured continuously in 15 min resolution at four depths 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm at sixteen locations with capacitance soil moisture sensors sm1 adcon telemetry austria calibration of the sensors and the crns probe was done by collecting soil samples four times during the growing season in 2013 16th april 3rd june 18th june 30th july the sampling locations did not follow the classical sampling design proposed by zreda et al 2012 as they were chosen by a stratified random design to cover the footprint of the eddy covariance ec station located at the same position as the crns imukova et al 2016 to better cover the full footprint of the crns additional six locations at distances between 185 and 235 m from the probe were sampled fig 1 the soil samples were taken in depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm though for the additional six locations only down to 30 cm the second experimental site is located on an irrigated 12 ha field north of braunschweig hereinafter referred to as bs it is located in the german lowlands 52 3587 n 10 4004 e at an elevation of about 60 m a s l mean annual temperature and precipitation are 9 2 c and 620 mm respectively dwd 2016 crns measurements were conducted from may to october 2014 and the field was cropped with maize zea maize groundwater levels at the field site are 1 8 m 2 m below surface with a slope towards the nearby small river oker in the east the soil parent material is mainly alluvial sand which was deposited by the river oker during the weichsel glacial and soil texture is classified as sand usda soil texture classification with only 9 of silt and 1 of clay the fields in this area are irrigated with an annual amount of about 520 mm of pre treated wastewater bmwa 2016 ingwersen 2001 which amends the low nutrient content and low water holding capacity of the sandy soil the irrigation on the field is via sprinkler irrigation in eight strips from west to east across the field investigated see fig 1 irrigation at the field site takes place several times during the crop season and each time the complete field is irrigated within few subsequent days with a total amount of 35 mm a crns probe was installed in the middle of the field the probe for this experimental site is self assembled and has a 3he filled counter tube canberra industries shielded by polyethylene with size and shape slightly different to the hydroinnova probe but with similar sensitivity to epithermal neutrons unpublished data point scale soil moisture probes were also installed at four different locations ml3 theta probes delta t devices were installed at 5 cm and 15 cm depth whereas 5te sensors decagon devices were installed at 5 cm 15 cm 25 cm 35 cm and 55 cm depth most point scale devices had to be removed before the harvest of maize and remained only at the single position closest to the crns probe for the period from 23rd september to 14th october soil samples for the calibration of the crns probe were taken at the 15th may 23rd july and 14th october at 20 locations within the field at 5 cm intervals down to 35 cm depth fig 1 the sampling locations were chosen adapting the sampling scheme proposed by zreda et al 2012 with distances of the outer locations to the probe slightly reduced and two additional locations sampled one close to the probe itself and one in greater distance at one of the point scale sensor positions for both field sites we measured the gravimetric water content of the soil samples by the oven drying method and we determined from the samples with known volume the bulk density ρ b at each sampling location and depth from mixed samples the lattice water lw and the water equivalent stored in soil organic matter wsoc were determined gravimetric values g g 1 are converted to volumetric values m3 m 3 by use of bulk density ρ b and lw and wsoc in this study refer to the volumetric values lattice water is determined by the loss on ignition method after the removal of organic material from the sample for kat the organic carbon content was measured with a leco carbon analyzer for bs the loss on ignition method was used to determine the organic matter content the water equivalent in soil organic matter wsoc is about the same weight as the soil organic carbon content zreda et al 2012 for the conversion to soil organic carbon the organic matter content is divided by a factor of 2 several studies suggest this factor to be more accurate than the traditional factor of 1 724 blume et al 2010 pribyl 2010 nelson and sommers 1996 this is due to the fact that organic matter does not only consist of cellulose and contains about 50 carbon that has about the same weight percentage as the water equivalent hydrogen and oxygen in organic material finally in both experimental sites crop height and biomass were monitored during the season at kat the average crop height was determined in the near surrounding of the ec station on a weekly basis at bs the crop height was measured on monthly basis until maize reached its maximum height in july at four random locations in the field 10 plants measured at each location data on crop height was interpolated to derive a daily continuous time series biomass water and dry matter was measured at kat seven times and at bs three times throughout the crop season at five kat and three bs random locations a square meter of plants was collected weighed to determine the fresh weight and dried in an oven 70 c for 72 h to constant weight to determine the dry weight the biomass water equivalent bwe accounts for the free water in the plants difference of fresh and dry weight and for the water equivalent hydrogen and oxygen stored in the tissue of the plant the calculation of water equivalent in the biomass tissue follows the stoichiometry assuming that the dry plant biomass consists of celluloses c6h12o6 or equivalent carbohydrates as described by franz et al 2013b 2 2 soil moisture from crns neutron counts were continuously aggregated to hourly intervals in units of cph in post processing mode for both field sites natural neutron radiation n is typically low at low altitudes and under wet conditions zreda et al 2012 since the corresponding counting error scales with n typical lowland applications of crns have to get along with relatively high statistical noise schrön et al 2018 to improve the signal to noise ratio a kernel regression is applied nadaraya watson kernel regression bandwidth 18 härdle et al 2004 this estimator is a weighted local average as opposed to a simple moving average and is still able to show short term reactions as they occur due to precipitation the bandwidth determines the smoothing and was chosen to have a value so that a clear response to irrigation at the field site bs is still visible in crns water content values the neutrons are sensitive to atmospheric conditions and need to be corrected for the variation in incoming neutrons air pressure neutron mitigating factor and air water vapor neutron mitigating factor corrections of the measured count rates follow the procedure described in zreda et al 2012 and rosolem et al 2013 as follows 1a f i n inc n inc 1b f p e p atm p atm λ 1c f h 1 0 0054 h air h air ref 1d n c n r f r f p f h where f represents the correction factor for incoming fi pressure fp and air humidity fh respectively hourly values of incoming neutrons ninc cph are set in relation to their mean over the measurement period n inc the pressure correction is based the hourly atmospheric pressure data patm mbar its mean over the measurement time p atm and the attenuation length λ mbar for calculation refer to dunai 2000 hourly values of absolute air humidity hair g cm 3 and the reference case of a dry atmosphere h air ref 0 g cm 3 are used to correct for water in the atmosphere nr is the raw count rate as measured by the sensor and nc the resulting corrected count rate the neutron monitor database neutron monitor database 2008 provides data on incoming neutrons ninc following recommendations from hawdon et al 2014 and schrön et al 2015 the neutron monitor station closest to each field site was chosen for the correction of the incoming neutron flux accordingly data from station jungfraujoch switzerland was used for kat and data from station kiel germany for bs weather stations provided the data for further atmospheric corrections at kat air pressure absolute humidity and precipitation are provided by sensors installed at the ec station at bs the data of a standard weather station close by 1 km distance was available for the calibration of crns the function proposed by desilets et al 2010 was used 2 θ crns a 0 n c n 0 a 1 a 2 ρ b ρ w where θ crns is volumetric water content estimated by crns m3 m 3 the parameters a0 a1 and a2 are 0 0808 0 372 and 0 115 respectively ρb and ρw are the soil bulk density g cm 3 and density of water assumed to be 1 g cm 3 respectively for calibration equation 2 is solved for the parameter n0 by using the mean corrected neutron count rate nc at the time of calibration during the soil sampling campaign n0 is a free parameter that can be interpreted as the maximum number of neutrons at the site under completely dry conditions zreda et al 2012 more recently the equation was adjusted to account for additional hydrogen pools and specific characteristics of the signal detected in particular lattice water lw and water stored in the soil organic carbon wsoc were explicitly considered dong et al 2014 hawdon et al 2014 in addition the crns signal was found to be more sensitive to the soil moisture in the upper soil layer franz et al 2012 and close to the probe köhli et al 2015 for this reason the water content estimated by crns θ crns more correctly represents a weighted soil moisture value within its support volume this implies also that for calibration and comparison to the crns point scale soil moisture measurements should be weighted for better reflecting their contribution to the signal these changes result in the following modified equation 3a θ crns θ t w t a 0 n c n 0 a 1 a 2 ρ b ρ w with 3b θ t w t θ v l w w soc wt where θ v is the volumetric water content m3 m 3 and the total water content θt is obtained as the sum of θ v lw and wsoc furthermore the values are weighted which results in a depth and distance weighted mean water content θ t wt the weighting approach applied in the present study followed the procedure described in schrön et al 2017 the approach is briefly summarized below by describing to the most important steps and dependencies useful for the discussion of the results obtained in the present study the effective penetration depth d86 θ t ρ b hveg patm is calculated at each sampling location by using the average total water content θ t averaging the total water content over the whole profile and bulk density ρ b the estimation is further corrected to account for the effect of vegetation using vegetation height hveg as a proxy and atmospheric pressure patm based on d86 the weights for each depth are calculated and the vertically weighted average water content at each location is determined these averaged soil moisture values are then horizontally weighted depending on their distance to the sensor using the radial weighting function wr θ t ρ b hveg patm hair this function accounts for all the parameters considered for the estimation of the penetration depth and additionally for the actual air humidity hair neutron mitigating factor then the horizontal footprint radius of the crns r86 is calculated as the radius from within 86 of the neutrons originated the continuous point scale measurements from all the soil moisture sensors are also weighted based on the same approach for each time step hours a total water content is calculated as the sum of θ v lw and wsoc at the specific site data on air pressure air humidity and vegetation height are given for each time step and from all sensor locations a vertically and horizontally weighted average of total water content θt wt is obtained from these continuous measurements also the penetration depth d86 and the footprint radius r86 of the cosmic ray can be determined for each time step based on equations from schrön et al 2017 finally for an overall assessment of the crns the total volume of water vw m3 detected by the crns is calculated as follows 4 v w θ v d 86 100 π r 86 2 where 100 is a converting factor to transform the units of d86 from cm to m 2 3 analysis based on the general probabilistic framework the data collected at both field sites are further analyzed based on the general probabilistic framework proposed in baroni and tarantola 2014 the framework is used 1 for the assessment of the uncertainty in crns estimation 2 to quantify the role of the different sources of uncertainty factors and 3 to identify possible further improvements a general sketch of the approach is illustrated in fig 2 and described below first each source of uncertainty factors is identified and characterized fig 2 step 1 in case of a scalar factor parameters the uncertainty is characterized by a probabilistic distribution function pdf fig 2 factor a to account for non scalar factors e g time series a two steps strategy is defined fig 2 factor b in the first step n possible realizations are defined e g two equally probable time series ts1 and ts2 in the second step the n realizations are associated to a discrete uniform distribution ud in the range 1 n the results of the framework are very sensitive to the definition of these distributions baroni et al 2017 for this reason in the specific case study the factors are not specified a priori instead they are identified and characterized based on the actual measurements and results obtained at the two experimental sites from the distributions of factor a and b a discrete number of samples is selected fig 2 step 2 in the specific case the sampling design is based on the quasi random sequences to cover the input space evenly kucherenko et al 2009 these uncertainties are then propagated based on monte carlo approach to estimate the expected uncertainty in the estimation fig 2 step 3 the approach is similar to the assessment presented by avery et al 2016 also for crns in this present study however the analysis is extended to all the crns estimations namely not only soil moisture θ v eq 3 but also to effective penetration depth d86 footprint radius r86 and total water volume vw eq 4 to assess the propagated uncertainty of the crns estimation the mean standard deviation σ and the mean root mean square error rmse are used as statistical metrics 5 σ 1 t t 1 t 1 n j 1 n y t j y t 2 6 rmse 1 n j 1 n 1 t t 1 t y t j y t 2 where yt j denotes the crns estimation at time step t and realization sample j y t denotes the mean of the crns estimation across all the realizations at time t y t denotes the corresponding observed value from averaged point measurements against which the performance is assessed in eq 5 the standard deviation is averaged over all time steps t to quantify the mean spread of the uncertainty in eq 6 the rmse is averaged over all realizations samples to assess the mean error of the estimation a convergence analysis is also performed to evaluate the actual number of samples used in the monte carlo approach where the analysis is considered stable if the standard deviation does not change by increasing the number of samples in order to identify the most influential factors a sensitivity analysis sa is performed that is able to quantify the contribution of the different sources of uncertainty fig 2 step 4 the approach is based on the variance decomposition proposed by sobol 2001 accordingly two sensitivity indices are defined as follows 7 s i v x i e x i y x i v y 8 s t i e x i v x i y x i v y where xi are the values of the ith input factor x i denotes the array of all input factors except xi v and e denote variance and expectation operators respectively and y is the crns estimation si main effect represents the average reduction in the variance of the crns estimation y when the input factor i would be fully known and fixed sti total effect includes also all the interactions between i and the other factors and can be interpreted as the expected variance that would be left if all factors except for i are fixed si and sti both vary in the range of zero to one with high values indicating high sensitivity important factors the difference between indices indicates strong interactions of the factor i with other factors in case the difference is not negligible the sensitivity of the factor depends on the value assumed by the other factors and the factor is also said to be non identifiable ghasemizade et al 2017 readers interested in further details about these sensitivity indices are referred to saltelli et al 2007 the indices are estimated based on the approach of saltelli et al 2010 since the indices are also estimated by monte carlo approach sampling the probabilistic distribution functions with a specified number of samples they are prone to errors for this reason the estimations are evaluated based on the convergence of the confidence interval ci 95 calculated with the bootstrap method as suggested by sarrazin et al 2016 in this approach the ci is calculated increasing the sample size and the result is considered acceptable if it reaches a specify threshold ci 0 1 finally the results of the sa are discussed to identify the strategies for further improvements fig 2 step 5 this could be achieved in different ways depending on the factor identified in the specific case study new monitoring activities new data processing or modifications of the specific equations are evaluated 3 results 3 1 crns neutron counts and calibration crns provides a continuous time series of neutron counts for the field site kat from 3rd april to 8th august 2013 for bs the crns measurements cover a period from 14th april to 14th october 2014 though the dataset exhibits some data gaps fig 3 these gaps were caused by power failure from batteries and solar panel at kat the corrected neutron counts are in the range of 726 1108 cph while at bs they range from 970 to 1435 cph accordingly a slightly lower noise of the hourly neutron counts is detected at bs compared to kat still the count rates at both field sites show a clear response to rain and in case of bs also irrigation the measurements obtained during the soil sampling campaigns are listed together with the resulting calibration parameters n0 in table 1 the silty soil at kat has in general higher soil moisture values than the sandy soil at bs especially dry conditions are captured at the second calibration at bs in july the arithmetic mean θt and the weighted average θt wt of the total water content differ mainly due to non homogeneous distribution of the vertical soil moisture profiles and to a lesser extent to the horizontal soil moisture spatial variability within the field mean neutron counts at calibration are very similar for all four dates at kat while the water content θt wt differs distinctly at bs the mean neutron counts as well as the water content values at calibration differ distinctly it was expected that the calibration parameters n0 would depend on the biomass water content and n0 values should slightly decrease with increasing biomass baatz et al 2015 baroni and oswald 2015 franz et al 2013b hawdon et al 2014 however in this study a clear and significant dependence of n0 on biomass water equivalent bwe is not observed at both field sites table 1 the reasons are not identified in the present study as several factors could be considered for instance at kat the similar neutron counts and distinct water content values lead to calibration parameters dependent on water content wettest conditions lead to the highest n0 suggesting the need for further adaptation of the parameters of the desilets equation as it has been proposed also in other studies iwema et al 2017 rivera villarreyes et al 2011 at bs the calibration in july was done after the tasseling stage of maize when plants contain the highest amounts of water that we measured see table 1 which should result in a lower calibration parameter n0 instead n0 value is larger than for the two other calibration dates but still within the standard deviation of neutron counts 33 cph the calibration however is based on the data collected during an exceptional dry period assuming the seasonal difference between crns soil moisture and point scale soil moisture as a first order estimation of the biomass contribution see baroni and oswald 2015 the results indicate an underestimation of the water content in very dry condition of the desilets equation which was also found in other studies baatz et al 2014 heidbüchel et al 2016 higher value of crns soil moisture would have led in fact to bigger differences with point scale soil moisture and would have revealed the biomass contribution finally the uncertainty also in the specific factors identified in the present studies and discussed below could play a role showing differences that could have hidden the biomass contribution for these reasons further studies are recommended to address the effects of biomass in more detail 3 2 soil moisture derived by crns for the further interpretation of the results the soil moisture obtained with the mean n0 over all soil sampling campaigns is used at kat n0 1438 cph and at bs n0 1531 cph based on these the overall dynamics between weighted point scale soil moisture θt wt and crns θcrns are compared fig 3 lower panel at kat the time series of crns is well comparable with the values from the point scale sensor network rmse is 0 03 m3 m 3 and is consistent to other studies conducted in similar conditions coopersmith et al 2014 tian et al 2016 however θcrns still shows a higher variability despite the kernel regression applied this is to some degree a consequence of the low count rate at kat and the resulting low signal to noise ratio however it is noteworthy that at this experimental site the shallowest point scale sensor was installed at a depth of 10 cm since crns is more sensitive to the soil moisture in the first few centimeters the crns signal better detected the faster dynamic in the top soil for instance lv et al 2014 had a similar setting and they could show how the integration of surface soil moisture simulated by hydrus significantly improved the comparison at bs θcrns shows similar discrepancy to θt wt fig 3 with the overall rmse of 0 02 m3 m 3 however it has to be noted that θt wt are averaged from only a few locations within the field and from the end of september only sensors close to the crns probe are left in the field for this reason θt wt at bs can be considered for comparison but is not suited as direct evaluation of the crns for instance θt wt strongly increases during irrigation periods but devices react to local timing of irrigation only cover half of the irrigation strips and represent no field mean during this time on the contrary θcrns shows clear response to the irrigation on the field it might be also noted that crns could be influenced by irrigation on other fields in the outer part of the footprint however irrigation on the fields in the outer footprint are most of the time less important than the response to precipitation or the irrigation on the field investigated as an exception around the 20th july an increase in crns values can be solely attributed to the irrigation on an adjoining field which provides experimental support of the large footprint of the sensor especially under dry conditions a quantification of the crns response to single irrigation events could not be achieved as there are intermingled effects of precipitation and irrigation in different parts of the footprint thus crns measurements show a more reliable average of total water content in the field compared to the water content from the point scale measurements 3 3 definition of the sources of uncertainty based on the datasets collected at the two experimental sites seven factors were identified as possible sources of uncertainty affecting crns estimation the factors are listed in table 2 together with the distributions considered in the further uncertainty and sensitivity analysis and presented in the following 1 incoming neutrons ninc time series of incoming neutrons used for the correction of the crns neutron counts are available from the monitoring neutrons network neutron monitor database 2008 as was recommended by hawdon et al 2014 and schrön et al 2015 a practical approach is to select the time series from the location closest to the specific experimental site however it is still not fully understood which neutron monitor represents a given location on earth best kudela 2012 due to the complex spatial distribution of cosmic radiation bütikofer et al 2015 local temporal changes of the magnetosphere herbst et al 2013 or device specific differences dorman 2004 krüger et al 2008 for this reason this factor could still introduce some uncertainty in the soil moisture estimation to account for this possible source of uncertainty two different time series of incoming neutrons are considered in the assessment the time series from the station kiel and from the station jungfraujoch the factor ninc is defined by a discrete uniform distribution ud 1 2 depending on the sample value the time series of jungfraujoch ninc 1 or kiel ninc 2 is used in the further uncertainty and sensitivity analysis 2 vegetation veg a major source of uncertainty that could affect the crns signal discussed also in several other studies is the hydrogen pool stored in the biomass baatz et al 2015 baroni and oswald 2015 franz et al 2013b hornbuckle et al 2012 this is assumed to be an especially important factor for agricultural sites where field crops can constitute a big varying hydrogen pool over the season though less in absolute contribution compared to forest sites we note on the one hand that a clear relation between growing biomass and neutron counts was not detected in the present study for this reason this type of correction was not included directly in the analysis on the other hand however the calculation of the spatial weights accounts for the effect of above ground biomass köhli et al 2015 schrön et al 2017 this approach assumes a constant density of biomass water ρ veg 0 005 g cm 3 and uses vegetation height as a proxy of the total biomass water equivalent this relation could vary significantly between vegetation types introducing additional errors in the soil moisture and support volume to account for this potential source of uncertainty the measured vegetation height is perturbed assuming a white noise zero mean and given standard deviation the distributions were selected to achieve a variable density of biomass consistent with the crop types in each experimental sites i e ρ veg 0 005 0 0005 g cm 3 and 0 005 0 0002 g cm 3 for kat and bs respectively 3 lattice water and water storage in the soil organic carbon sw lw wsoc these parameters were measured and it was detected a certain spatial variability in each experimental site table 2 however an average value has to be removed from the total water content estimated by crns eq 3 to retrieve volumetric soil moisture to account for that in the assessment a gaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation measured in each experimental site is defined 4 bulk density ρ b this factor is used to derive volumetric water content see eq 3 but also in this case it was detected a certain spatial variability in each experimental site for this reason bulk density is also considered an additional source of uncertainty similar to sw a gaussian distribution mean and standard deviation is defined based on the values measured in each experimental site 5 desilets equation parameter n0 the variability identified in the calibrated parameter n0 lumps several sources of uncertainty that cannot be distinguished besides representing static properties of the site n0 could be affected by time variant properties in each specific site in particular the variability of n0 in different calibration dates could be induced by the underestimation in dry conditions detected in some studies baatz et al 2014 heidbüchel et al 2016 or include contributions from other hydrogen pools not explicitly considered such as biomass hornbuckle et al 2012 therefore this parameter is considered uncertain and a uniform probabilistic distribution is defined based on the range detected in the calibrations of each experimental site 6 7 vertical soil moisture profile p and horizontal soil moisture spatial variability s respectively the sensitivity of crns decreases with depth and distance from the sensor franz et al 2012 köhli et al 2015 schrön et al 2017 for this reason soil moisture estimated by crns was found to be a weighted value of the water equivalent within the support volume in case soil moisture is homogenous θ crns minus sw can be considered as the actual mean volumetric soil moisture θ v see eq 3 however since soil moisture can vary significantly within the soil profile and horizontally crns soil moisture tends to deviate from this value an example is shown in fig 4 where the volumetric soil moisture measurements θ v of the point scale sensors are shown at selected days with the same θcrns value different soil moisture profiles drying wetting and homogeneous distribution are presented in general the differences within the profile are more pronounced at kat it is notable how the same soil moisture value estimated by crns θ crns could coincide with different actual average conditions θ v depending on vertical and horizontal soil moisture variability for a stand alone use of this method to retrieve soil moisture this means that the approach is also affected by this non unique relation to account for that in the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis three characteristic vertical soil moisture profiles and three types of horizontal soil moisture spatial variabilities were considered in the former 1 a drying front 2 a vertical homogenous profile and 3 a wetting front are defined for the latter we considered that 1 the area close to the probe radius 75 m is wetter 2 the field is homogeneous and 3 the area close to the probe radius 75 m is drier the approaches for generating the specific vertical soil moisture profiles and the horizontal spatial soil moisture variability based on the crns soil moisture θ crns are described in details in the appendix a similar to the incoming correction two uniform discrete scalar factors p 1 2 3 and s 1 2 3 are defined for the vertical soil moisture profile and for the horizontal soil moisture spatial variability respectively these factors are sampled in the monte carlo approach for the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis by that the uncertainty in the estimation of the actual volumetric soil moisture θ v and support volume are characterized assuming that one of these cases could be a possible realistic realization of the soil moisture condition of the field 3 4 uncertainty analysis the seven factors and their distribution were sampled with a sample size 1000 and no correlation between the factors their uncertainties were propagated in a monte carlo approach for the assessment of the uncertainty in the estimation of the volumetric soil moisture θ v penetration depth d86 footprint radius r86 and total volume of water vw the results obtained with the maximum sample size are shown in fig 5 the uncertainty analysis as a function of the sample size is shown in appendix b fig b1 and provides the stability of the results and of the sample size used for the assessment overall the results show uncertainty in soil moisture θ v and support volume d86 and r86 for both experimental sites fig 5 both rmse and σ for soil moisture reach 0 06 m3 m 3 and 0 04 m3 m 3 for kat and bs respectively for both field sites rmse values increase in comparison to the values obtained in the previous section and presented in literature when θcrns is compared to the total weighted water content θt wt thus it becomes apparent if and how the use of a crns as a stand alone approach to retrieve actual non weighted volumetric soil moisture is prone to higher uncertainty this is for instance the case when the values are directly compared to remote sensing products or they are used for practical application e g irrigation it is also interesting to note how at kat wetter conditions the uncertainty in soil moisture is relatively higher than at bs however the contrary occurs in terms of penetration depth d86 for which the uncertainty is lower at kat rmse 2 cm than at bs rmse 4 cm on opposite the uncertainties detected in the footprint radius show comparable agreement for the two experimental sites rmse 11 m for both experimental sites in the range of the uncertainty related to the model assumptions köhli et al 2015 the differences in uncertainties detected in the two experimental sites are attributed to the different soil moisture conditions at kat water content values are higher than in bs this also reflects in the lower effective penetration depth d86 and the smaller footprint radius r86 this means that in these conditions the support volume is relatively well characterized low uncertainty in d86 and r86 while most of the uncertainty is related to the estimated soil moisture within this volume at bs the soil moisture is lower and d86 and r86 values are higher this means that in these conditions the estimated soil moisture is estimated well but the support volume d86 and r86 is uncertain it is however interesting to note that the differences detected in the two experimental sites compensate one another when the uncertainties of the three crns products are combined into the total volume of water vw m3 detected by the crns the results depicted in fig 5 lower panels shows that the uncertainties detected in each experimental site are more comparable than those of the individual estimations are nevertheless slightly higher uncertainty is detected at bs rmse 347 m3 in comparison to kat rmse 244 m3 this result shows how the lower uncertainty detected for the soil moisture at bs is a misleading quantity as it is compensated by a higher uncertainty of the effective penetration depth for these reasons the crns uncertainty has to be considered as a combined quantity that should encompass the actual soil moisture and support volume 3 5 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is conducted on the same factors considered for the uncertainty analysis table 2 in this analysis however 74000 samples were selected from the distribution of each factor this sample size showed to provide acceptable estimation of the sensitivity indices based on the convergence analysis see appendix c the analysis is performed assuming the specific average values measured in each experimental sites e g average plant height air pressure etc and is repeated for ten different neutron count rates and corresponding soil moisture this was done to make the analysis traceable but also to identify the possible role of the different factors in different conditions in time ghasemizade et al 2017 pianosi and wagener 2016 reusser et al 2011 the main effect si estimated for each factor and each experimental site is shown in fig 6 as a function of the mean soil moisture average soil moisture estimated based on all realizations the uncertainties in θ v r86 and vw are mainly explained by the uncertainty in the vertical soil moisture profile p at both experimental sites as indicated by the high value of the sensitivity indices for this factor the p factor is also important in most of the soil moisture conditions and tends to decrease only in extreme conditions very wet or very dry this is consistent with the way the factor is characterized the variability of the soil moisture profile tends to decrease to homogenous soil moisture profile in these conditions see appendix a fig a1 at kat additional uncertainty is explained by the choice of the incoming neutron time series ninc and to lesser extent the parameter n0 in particular for wet conditions this is due to the low count rates for which the variability of these factors becomes relatively more important on the contrary these factors are less important at bs considering the penetration depth bulk density plays a crucial role this behavior is especially evident at bs at kat it is also important but followed by the soil moisture profile p as identified before the incoming correction becomes important in the very wet range with low count rates the difference between total effect sti and main effect si is within the confidence interval obtained in the convergence analysis 0 1 therefore this quantity does not provide additional information and is not presented it is noteworthy however how the small differences between main effect and total effect indicate low interactions between the factors there is no dependency or compensation between the factors in estimating soil moisture and support volume thus each factor is identifiable and could be independently considered for further improvements ghasemizade et al 2017 saltelli et al 2010 4 towards further improvements in crns soil moisture estimation despite some variability of the important factors as a function of soil moisture conditions and so being time dependent four factors are identified to be generally the most important in explaining the uncertainty detected in crns in both experimental sites the factors are further discussed in this section possible solutions for reducing their impact on the uncertainty in crns soil moisture estimation are also presented 4 1 actual soil moisture profile the identification of the importance of the soil moisture profile is directly related to the importance of the weighting functions as reported in earlier studies franz et al 2012 schrön et al 2017 by that the missing knowledge about the shape of the vertical profile limits the direct use of the crns as a stand alone method for estimating volumetric soil moisture θ v in practical applications e g validation of remote sensing or irrigation water management to overcome this limitation soil or land surface hydrological models could be combined in data assimilation framework to estimate the soil moisture profile baatz et al 2017 han et al 2016 iwema et al 2017 rosolem et al 2014 but this requires a high additional effort also from the hydrological modelling perspective data and parameters for setting the model instead a more practical solution could be the use of representative point scale sensors installed within the crns footprint to determine the shape of the soil moisture profile these profiles could show the soil moisture conditions wetting or drying and could provide additional information for the evaluation of the soil moisture estimated by crns to test this hypothesis a simple weighting correction factor is calculated as follows 1 average θ p and weighted average θ p wt soil moisture in one point location p is calculated 2 the weighting correction factor fwt is calculated as fwt θ p θ p wt 3 this factor is used to correct crns soil moisture as θ crns non wt θ crns fwt 4 finally average lw and wsoc are subtracted to obtain the corrected volumetric soil moisture estimated by crns as θ crns v θ crns non wt lw wsoc based on the data collected at kat the factor was calculated for each point location and used for correction the values of θ crns v are compared to θ v that were to recall it here being obtained as the non weighted average volumetric soil moisture from all the point scale measurements on average the rmse reduces from 0 05 m3 m 3 by considering crns not corrected θ crns to 0 03 m3 m 3 by that the analysis shows how the approach could be a promising correction that should be considered when crns is used as a stand alone approach for soil moisture estimation it has also to be noted that the use of additional point scale sensors already showed to be useful in previous studies for the assessment of other temporal variant hydrogen pools with crns like biomass and water canopy interception baroni and oswald 2015 therefore the installation of some point scale soil moisture measurements within the support volume e g distance 50 m from the crns probe should be considered as a good practice not only for evaluation of the crns but as a permanent addition to the field monitoring equipment however further studies could focus on the best number and positions to be considered for the correction of the crns signal and the assessment of additional hydrogen pools 4 2 bulk density bulk density is found to be important in particular for the determination of the effective penetration depth d86 for this reason the estimation of d86 could be reformulated by directly using gravimetric water content this would avoid the use of bulk density in the equation and would reduce the uncertainty in the estimation it has to be noted however that the importance of this factor is strongly related to the agricultural fields considered in the present study bulk density was found to vary considerably due to the spatial variability of tillage and resettlement pace soil texture rooting density etc at agricultural sites furthermore also the temporal variability of bulk density induced by tillage might play a role for these reasons a relatively wide range of bulk density was considered in the assessment see table 2 in other sites this variability could be smaller and by that the relative importance of this factor in comparison to other sources of uncertainty could be lower 4 3 incoming neutrons ninc and the calibration parameter n0 the choice of the neutron monitoring station as reference for the correction of variations in the incoming neutron intensity was shown to be an important factor affecting the crns estimation thus the common approach to take the data from the closest station could lead to significant errors particularly in regions that are poorly covered by the global monitoring network for this reason it is recommended to conduct additional experiments to develop scaling factors to improve the representativeness of current monitoring stations hawdon et al 2014 or to test other measurement options that could be taken as reference flux for incoming neutrons desilets et al 2010 schrön et al 2015 a similar relevance was quantified for the parameter n0 in this case however the parameter lumps several possible sources of uncertainty and it was not possible to identify the specific reason of this it is interesting to note however how the identification and reduction of the different sources of uncertainty could provide promising reduction also on the variability of n0 supporting the existence of a single universal calibration function for crns applications schrön et al 2017 4 4 non relevant and non considered factors three factors were found to be relatively not important in the specific study namely sw lattice water and water storage in soil organic carbon vegetation and horizontal soil moisture spatial variability even though the results are consistent within the two experimental sites caution is advised to generalize the results in other field conditions considering the sw it has to be noted that the analysis is conducted during one crop season during this period sw value is not affected by temporal variability and subtracting averaged values from crns estimation eq 3 can be considered as a good practice to obtain the volumetric soil moisture θ v however in a longer term years organic carbon could vary from additional manure applied by the farmers or from slow decay or long turnover time of plant residue dead plant material remaining after harvesting franz et al 2013b this could increases the importance of this factor providing additional challenges for the use of crns for long monitoring observations similarly vegetation was found not to be an important factor in the specific case study on the one hand the reason could be attributed among others to the underestimation of the desilets equation in dry condition or the need of specific parameter calibration see section 3 1 for this reason additional neutron transport modelling studies should focus on the assessment of the equation in this condition on the other hand in the present study it was assumed that the temporal variability of the vegetation height is well known as it was measured and only the uncertainty in the density of biomass water was considered in the assessment by that this factor was found to not play an important role different results could be achieved when also vegetation heights are not measured as it is the case of rover applications e g dong et al 2014 finally soil moisture spatial variability was also found to not be an important factor although this is consistent with previous results conducted in natural soil conditions franz et al 2013a different conclusions could be drawn when extreme spatial variability is considered e g when different land use types or ponding water within the footprint are present schrön et al 2017 overall it has to be noted that the selection of the sources of uncertainty and their quantifications were defined by the data and results obtained at the specific experimental sites for instance the corrections for air pressure and air humidity were not considered as sources of uncertainty in the present study because a representative weather station data was available at the sites and no error was supposed to affect the crns soil moisture estimation and support volume in addition the air humidity correction was found to be negligible in most of the cases investigated in other studies where data does not represent well local conditions these factors could be considered additional sources of uncertainty similarly other factors could be considered important as the presence of litter layer in forest sites bogena et al 2013 the probabilistic framework used in the present study however could be easily adopted to account for these additional sources of uncertainty 5 conclusions data from stationary cosmic ray neutron sensors crns in two cropped fields has been calibrated and compared to point scale soil moisture monitoring networks an uncertainty analysis was performed for the assessment of the accuracy of the estimation and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the major sources of uncertainty results have proven that crns is a robust and valid proximal soil sensing method to estimate soil moisture at the field scale based on state of the art data processing the rmse calculated in comparison to total weighted point scale soil moisture measurements was found to be 0 03 m3 m 3 in both experimental sites this value is in agreement with results obtained in other studies baatz et al 2014 franz et al 2012 hawdon et al 2014 penetration depth ranged from 10 cm to 40 cm and footprint radius from 100 m to 200 m depending on local conditions soil moisture and vegetation data obtained in the two different experimental sites was also used to identify and quantify seven sources of uncertainty that were considered for the further assessment of crns as a stand alone method for soil moisture estimation based on these the uncertainty analysis has shown how the rmse increased up to 0 06 m3 m 3 in addition the effective penetration depth was uncertain within a range of up to 5 cm in comparison the footprint radius was less affected with an average uncertainty of 10 m which is in the range of the uncertainty that has been identified by köhli et al 2015 as being related to model assumptions finally we found that these uncertainties tend to compensate each other therefore the use of total volume of water as obtained by integrating also the actual volume investigated by the sensor could be considered as valuable quantity in future applications a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the major source of uncertainty and provide some guidelines for further improvements four major factors were identified by that the vertical soil moisture profile bulk density incoming neutrons and the calibrated parameter n0 the role of these factors was consistent between the two experimental sites with only some minor differences depending on the actual soil moisture conditions among the possible improvements identified a simple correction factor based on few point scale soil moisture measurements provides promising results to account for the sensitivity of the crns signal to the upper soil layers by that the accuracy in soil moisture estimation when crns is used as a stand alone method is improved e g validation of remote sensing product or agricultural water management the incoming correction was also found to be sensitive to the particular reference neutron monitoring location used and the uncertainty could become more influential in regions that are poorly covered by the global neutron monitoring network for this reason additional studies should be conducted developing scaling factors for the specific locations hawdon et al 2014 or evaluating additional local monitoring approaches schrön et al 2015 finally while the results are inherently specific to the two agricultural field sites the general probabilistic framework used in the present study can be easily extended to identify the role of influential factors also for other experimental sites in this context however we underline the importance of the correct quantification of the sources of uncertainty as the results are very sensitive to these distributions baroni et al 2017 acknowledgments g baroni was

within the support volume köhli et al 2015 schrön et al 2017 the following procedure is used for the assessment of the actual soil moisture θ v based on the θ crns the results obtained in one example are shown in fig a1 1 based on neutrons counts θ crns is estimated by equation 3 2 a first guess is attributed to the actual soil moisture θ v 3 the factor p 1 2 3 and s 1 2 3 are randomly sampled in the monte carlo analysis based on that the specific soil moisture profile and spatial soil moisture variability are defined respectively in particular in case of the soil moisture profile three scenarios are considered o p 1 θ v is multiplied by the following arbitrary weights wtpw 1 728 1 680 1 520 1 280 0 960 0 832 0 800 0 800 0 800 0 800 0 800 0 800 0 800 0 800 0 800 0 800 by that a

profile based on 16 values every 5 cm down to 80 cm is defined with its mean equal to θ v to account also for the spatial variability four locations are defined within the footprint these locations were selected based on the standard soil sampling scheme adopted in literature i e 25 75 150 250 m franz et al 2012 based on that three scenarios are defined o s 1 θ v is multiplied by the following weights wtcw 1 4 1 4 0 6 0 6 by that a field characterized by a wetter center but its mean is defined equal to θ v o s 2 the field is considered to be horizontally homogeneous by that the θ v value is attributed to the four positions within the footprint o s 3 θ v is multiplied by the following weights wtcd 0 6 0 6 1 4 1 4 by that a field characterized by a drier center but its mean is defined

7106,the sediment delivery ratio sdr is a bond of slope erosion and channel sediment transport but exhibits poor dynamic applicability which makes it difficult to accurately identify the spatio temporal evolutions of sediment yield in an ecological restoration watershed with different governance degrees i an innovative piecewise sdr algorithm considering the multi stage effects of the comprehensive governance degree from 1991 to 2013 was embedded in a dynamic sediment yield model to solve the complex dynamic applicability problem of the sdr in sediment yield predictions ii the main advantages of the improved sdr algorithm over the existing models are small data requirements dynamic mechanism wide application range reduced complexity ease of use and better accuracy iii the erosion intensities of sloping farmland and orchards in the yangou river watershed were both intensive at the early stage of governance in 1997 the trends in erosion and sediment yield were closely related to the watershed management measures the soil erosion modulus in this watershed decreased from 5657 t km2 in 1997 to 906 2 t km2 in 2012 a total decrease rate of 84 the sediment yield modulus decreased from 4500 t km2 in 1997 to 51 9 t km2 in 2012 a total reduction rate of 98 8 iv the annual dynamics of the sdr values were not completely affected by the random fluctuations in rainfall erosivity but showed an obvious decreasing trend from 0 932 in 1992 to 0 057 in 2012 due to the soil conservation measures the annual average sdr in 1991 2013 was approximately 0 38 indicating that the average sediment yield after ecological restoration was significantly less than the average soil erosion in the yangou river watershed the results of this study may provide a better understanding of dynamic sdr studies and reveal the profound insights needed to guide watershed soil conservation planning keywords sediment delivery ratio piecewise algorithm sediment transport ecological restoration comprehensive governance degree 1 introduction quantifying the sediment transport flux remains a severe challenge in landscape evolution studies xie and li 2012 tsai et al 2012 the sediment delivery ratio sdr a ratio of the sediment yield from a region to the gross erosion of that same region is a bond of slope erosion and channel sediment transport and plays a key role in various projects involving the sediment yield prediction and soil conservation planning wu et al 2012a 2016a generally the development of the sdr algorithm was mainly based on the definition and main influencing factors of the sdr gao et al 2007 previous studies have shown that the sdr algorithm can be summarized as three categories i a single factor sdr algorithm considering the basin area ii a two factor sdr algorithm primarily considering the rainfall and runoff depth followed by gully density iii a multi factor sdr algorithm primarily including rainfall gully density runoff depth channel slope and basin area xie and li 2012 tao and chen 2015 wu et al 2018a although most of the existing sdr algorithms are legitimate and applicable for the individual research object in specific regions wu et al 2018a they were only statistically empirical equations it is difficult to obtain the general statements on interactions between different catchments because each study takes a rather narrow and specific perspective rogger et al 2017 moreover the existing sdr studies were primarily focused on the long term average value by the limited hydrological observations of a particular watershed chen et al 2001 xu 2010 there have been few reports on the dynamic sdr algorithms especially for the impacts of human activities such as soil and water conservation measures ali and de boer 2010 sang et al 2015 the difficulty in producing a widely applicable sdr algorithm was partly due to the complexity of sediment delivery processes and their interactions and partly due to the lack of definitive assessments of the natural and anthropogenic influencing factors didoné et al 2015 the loess plateau in china is one of the most fragile soil erosion regions in the world ouyang et al 2010 soil erosion in this region is mainly caused by several heavy rainstorms during 6 9 months and the amount of erosion by heavy rains accounts for 60 of total annual erosion wu et al 2018b however the ecological environments on the loess plateau have been significantly improved since the effective implementation of large scale soil and water conservation measures e g returning farmland to forest grass conservation tillage contour farming terracing construction of warp land dams hillside ditches and contour buffer strips wu et al 2016b how to accurately quantify the dynamic changes associated with the hydrometeorological parameters and anthropogenic land management activities is the main challenge of the sdr which is also the critical knowledge gap between slope erosion and sediment yield in an ecological restoration watershed liu et al 2007 wu et al 2018a therefore the comprehensive governance degree a percentage index used for quantifying the dynamic governance level in a watershed was innovatively introduced to address the issue of the quantification accuracy in dynamic sediment yield predictions the existing sdr studies on the loess plateau are primarily focused on the wuding river dali river chabagou river quanjiagou river yangdaogou river jiuyuangou river yangou river nanxiaohegou river and yanhe river chen 2000 cao et al 1993 sun and li 2004 xie and li 2012 through statistical analysis it was definitely found that all the above watersheds had experienced different governance backgrounds among them the governance of the yangou river watershed was the most typical and representative case on the loess plateau ju et al 2003 the corresponding large scale comprehensive governance project in this watershed was implemented in 1997 and basically reacheda stablegovernance state in 2009 liu et al 2011 wu et al 2016e this project went through four periods in which the governance degree increased from 27 to 83 the first period in 1991 1997 with a governance degree 27 the second period in 1998 2002 with a governance degree 52 the third period in 2003 2008 with a governance degree 73 and the fourth period in 2009 2013 with a governance degree 83 xu et al 2012a b therefore the yangou river watershed in northern shaanxi province was selected as a study case to explore and develop a dynamic sdr algorithm which is critical later to test hypotheses regarding the effects of the comprehensive governance degree on sediment yield dynamics this study aims to i develop a piecewise sdr algorithm coordinatively considering the main natural factors and the multi stage comprehensive governance degree in an ecological restoration watershed ii verify the applicability of the improved sdr algorithm in different watersheds and iii evaluate the effectiveness of the piecewise sdr algorithm on the spatio temporal dynamics response of sediment yield in the yangou river watershed the results may provide new understanding not only for the quantitative estimation of spatio temporal sediment yield evolutions but also for the reasonable soil conservation planning at different ecological restoration regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region and data sources the yangou river watershed 109 20 e 109 35 e 36 20 n 36 32 n which belongs to the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau fig 1 is located 5 km southeast of yan an city shaanxi province china the catchment area is 47 68 km2 the elevation of this watershed is 962 1402 m with an average of 1198 m the maximum height difference between the upper and lower reaches is 439 m and the terrain in this watershed is dominated by steep slopes liang et al 2003 the yangou river a second grade tributary of the yanhe river has an 8 6 km main river channel a longitudinal bottom slope of 2 41 and a gully density of 4 8 km km2 the watershed is located at the transitional zone from semi arid to semi humid climate regions where the average annual temperature is 9 4 c the average temperatures in january and july are 6 7 c and 22 9 c respectively the extreme maximum temperature is 39 7 c and the extreme minimum temperature is 25 4 c the average annual precipitation is 558 4 mm the inter annual variability of precipitation is large and the seasonal distribution is uneven so approximately 70 of the rainfall is concentrated in 6 9 months wang 2011 the watershed isshaped bymanyravines hills and loess slopes the loessal soil occupies an absolute advantage in the watershed the soil texture is silty loam that is primarily composed of particles 0 25 mm the contents of fine sand and silt account for 60 of the gross particle weight rendering the soil erosion resistance relatively poor xu et al 2012a b the land use types within the watershed are mostly dominated by dryland and middle coverage grassland which account for approximately 84 of the watershed area fig 2 the environmental database in this study include precipitation digital elevation model

http loess geodata cn 2 2 dynamic sediment yield model the dynamic sediment yield model has been modified from the original rusle equation renard et al 1997 the k and ls factors in the rusle equation are primarily related to the soil properties and topography of a watershed bagarello et al 2011 wu et al 2012b 2013 shrestha and wang 2018 they can be assumed to be constant because the topography and soil may have slight changes over a short period of time wu et al 2016a c the r c and p factors which are prone to being affected by hydrometeorological conditions and land management measures are defined as temporal dynamic factors wu et al 2016b e furthermore the comprehensive governance degree factor g affected by soil conservation measures was introduced to enhance the estimation accuracy of soil erosion under the great changes of erosion environments on the loess plateau the dynamic sediment yield model can be written as follows 1 e i r i k l s c i p j g j 2 q s i e i s d r i where e

represents the i th year and the subscript j represents the j th governance period 2 3 factor algorithms 2 3 1 r factor the rainfall erosivity factor r a crucial objective indicator for evaluating the capacity of raindrop splashing and soil denudation caused by erosive rainfall wu et al 2016d can be effectively employed to describe the features of rainfall energy wu et al 2015 a half month algorithm of rainfall erosivity proposed by zhang and fu 2003 was applied to estimate the r factor in this study the half month algorithms of the r factor are described as follows 3 r i α j 1 n p j β 4 β 0 8363 18 144 p d 12 24 455 p y 12 5 α 21 586 β 7 1891 6 r i 1 24 r i where r is the annual rainfall erosivity mj mm hm2 h yr ri is the rainfall erosivity in the i th half month period mj mm hm2 h

half month period and the remaining days of the corresponding month were used as the latter half month period the calculated value of the average annual r factor was approximately 1511 32 mj mm hm2 h yr except for the extreme hydrological year of 2013 fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the average annual r factor in the yangou river watershed 2 3 2 k factor the soil erodibility factor k is a comprehensive indicator for describing the separation resistance capacity of soil in the face of erosion force the k factor was calculated using the equation embedded in the environmental policy integrated climate epic model williams and berndt 1977 7 k 0 2 0 3 e 0 0256 s a n 1 s i l 100 sil cla s i l 0 3 1 0 25 c c e 3 72 2 95 c 1 0 7 s n 1 s n 1 e 229 s n 1 5 51 where k is the soil

above equation needs to be converted into a metric unit by k metric units k us units 0 1317 the average annual k value was calculated as 0 047 t hm2 h hm2 mj mm in the yangou river watershed 2 3 3 ls factor the topographical factor ls can be divided into the slope length factor l and the slope steepness factor s both the slope length and the slope steepness substantially affect the sheet and rill erosion estimated by the rusle the soil erosion increases with the slope length and is considered by the l factor the s factor reflects the influence of the slope gradient on erosion the l factor was calculated by the algorithm in the rusle model the specific equations are as follows 8 l λ 22 1 m m 0 2 θ 1 0 3 1 θ 3 0 4 3 θ 5 0 5 θ 5 where λ is the horizontal projection of the slope length m and m is the slope length exponent the s factor was calculated using the piecewise functions the equation proposed by mccool et al 1987 was used for the gentle slope 10 and the equation proposed by liu et al 2010 was applied for the steep slope 10 the specific expressions are as follows 9 s 10 8 sin θ 0 03 θ 5 s 16 8 sin θ 0 05 5 θ 10 s 21 9 sin θ 0 96 θ 10 where θ is the slope gradient the ls value was statistically averaged as 10 9 using gis techniques fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the ls factor in the yangou river watershed 2 3 4 c factor the vegetation cover management factor c refers to the ratio of soil loss from land cropped under specified conditions to the corresponding loss from clean tilled continuous fallow this factor measures the combined effect of all the interrelated cover and management variables previous studies indicate that the c factor is closely related to vegetation cover wischmeier and smith 1978 wu et al 2009 cai et al 2000 ma and ma 2001 the specific equations of vegetation coverage c and the c factor can be expressed as follows 10 c k ndv i k n d v i soil k ndv i veg k n d v i soil k 11 c k 1 c k 0 0 6508 0 3436 l g c k 0 c k 78 3 0 c k

for full vegetation cover in the k th month which is close to the maximal value of ndvi ndvi max k is a specific month from january to december rk is the monthly rainfall erosivity factor and r is the annual rainfall erosivity factor the average value of the c factor for different vegetation covers was estimated as 0 138 in the yangou river watershed 2 3 5 p factor the support practice factor p in the rusle refers to the ratio of the soil loss with a specific support practice to the corresponding loss with upslope and downslope tillage values for the p factor in this study were obtained from different land use types under different support practices rao et al 2014 the average p factor of different land use types was statistically summarized as 0 192 in the yangou river watershed 2 3 6 the improved sdr algorithm the watershed area rainfall gully density river channel slope and runoff depth were exactly proven to be the main natural influencing factors of watershed sediment transport cai and fan 2004 sánchez et al 2018 meanwhile the comprehensive governance degree was introduced to dynamically identify the potential influencing effects of anthropogenic factors based on these two prerequisites the target data in the yangou river watershed including the watershed area a 47 68 km2 annual rainfall 1991 2013 gully density r c 4 8 km km2 main river channel slope j 2 41 the comprehensive governance degree g 27 83 as well as the annual estimated erosion data and the annual observed sediment data 1991 2013 were statistically determined and the improved piecewise sdr function under four periods was finally developed and calibrated using the repeated trial of multivariate nonlinear regression analysis 11 sd r i 1 4376 a 0 4443 p 0 06873 r c 1 6917 g 2 3852 j 3 8034

river channel slope 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration performance of the improved sdr algorithm the calculated sdr by the improved sdr algorithm and the measured sdr by the definition were comparatively used to check the reliability of the improved sdr algorithm in the yangou river watershed table 1 shows the calibration results of the improved sdr algorithm from 1991 to 2013 i the calculated soil erosion modulus was compared with the observed soil erosion modulus measured by the 137cs radionuclides tracing technique in the yangou river watershed wang et al 2003 wang 2009 the observed values of the soil erosion modulus were 4647 t km2 in 1997 and 1588 t km2 in 2000 respectively and the corresponding relative errors between the calculated and observed values of the soil erosion modulus were 21 7 in 1997 and 9 6 in 2000 ii the yangou river watershed belongs to the second sub region of the hilly and gully region on the loess plateau wang and tian 2005 the observed soil erosion modulus in this sub region was 5000 9000 t km2 before 1997 the calculated average soil erosion modulus from 1991 to 1997 was 6632 7 t km2 in the yangou river watershed which was exactly within the limits of experimental uncertainty of the soil erosion modulus in this sub region iii although the sdr errors in individual years were relatively large the calculated soil erosion modulus and the sdr in the yangou river watershed both presented a significant decreasing trend and this trend was well consistent with the governance stage of the watershed wang et al 2009 which indicated that the modified algorithm had strong applicability in the yangou river watershed iv the sdr values calculated by the improved algorithm were close to the sdr values measured by the definition method y 0 975x 0 0091 r2 0 977 n 23 p 0 01 and the relative error range was approximately 21 2 22 0 which further confirmed that the improved algorithm had good applicability in different governance stages of the yangou river watershed v the main advantages of the improved sdr algorithm over the process based models are small data requirements reduced complexity clear mechanism ease of use and better accuracy these features also prove that the regression models have a great potential for modelling event based suspended sediment yields in small river systems and the regression analysis itself can provide an additional understanding of the factors influencing sediment levels in different regions merritt et al 2003 rymszewicz et al 2017 vi the high sdr values could be associated with the dominant steep terrain 15 which accounted for as much as 79 56 of the total watershed area whereas only 5 25 of the watershed was classified as the cultivable land 5 jiao et al 1998 both koulouri and giourga 2007 and kannan et al 2017 both proved that the steeper slopes could be significantly associated with the higher levels of surface runoff and soil loss and flow from each subbasin was the dominant factor affecting the sdr in a watershed vii the above calibration performance indicated that the improved sdr algorithm had strong reliability for sediment yield predictions in an ecological restoration watershed which may provide new understanding for watershed soil conservation planning in hilly loess regions 3 2 validation and evaluation of the improved sdr algorithm the effects of different governance degrees in the jiuyuangou watershed on the sdr ma 2013 were firstly used to verify the reliability of the improved sdr algorithm in the yangou river watershed the jiuyuangou watershed a tributary of the middle reaches of the wuding river is located 5 km north of suide county shaanxi province the watershed with a governance degree of only 0 8 in 1953 has been extensively governed since then the comprehensive governance networks of soil and water conservation measures e g returning farmland to forestland grassland terracing constructing reservoirs and warp land dams were established after nearly 60 years of governance the soil loss was effectively controlled and the sdr values of the jiuyuanyou watershed also decreased significantly table 2 compares the sdr values between the jiuyuangou and yangou river watersheds under different governance periods it was observed that all the errors from 1959 to 2004 were relatively acceptable by comparing the sdr values in these two watersheds so the improved sdr algorithm was reliable and feasible in time scales moreover 19 watersheds with various governance degrees were also used to verify the applicability of the improved sdr algorithm table 3 the verification results indicated that the relative errors between the observed and calculated sdr values were all within a relatively acceptable range of 19 25 15 69 the above verifications were very persuasive because they covered diverse watersheds with various hydrometeorological conditions and underlying surfaces and there was a strong correlation and a certain level of significant difference between the statistical sdr and the calculated sdr y 1 0918x 0 0497 r2 0 959 n 19 p 0 01 so the improved sdr algorithm had strong applicability in multi scale watersheds with different governance levels specifically i the yanhe river with a catchment area of 7725 km2 is a first grade tributary in the right bank of the yellow river the average annual sdr of this watershed was 0 92 from 1954 to 2010 xie 2012 the average governance degree was approximately 52 the relative error between the calculated and statistical sdrs was approximately 7 96 which meant that the sdr algorithm had good applicability ii the chabagou river with a watershed area of 205 km2 is a branch of the dali river on the loess plateau the average annual sdr in this watershed was close to 1 from 1959 to 1969 liu et al 2007 whereas the sdr decreased substantially after the implementation of soil conservation measures since 1970s thus thecalculatedvalue of sdr under the designed governance degree was in good agreement with the statistical sdr value after the 1990 s iii the zhifanggou watershed with a catchment area of 8 27 km2 is a typical representation of the hilly and gully loess region since 1975 the soil erosion has been comprehensively harnessed in this watershed the average sdr value in this watershed remained close to 1 from 1985 to 2000 although the spatial distribution of soil erosion changed greatly jiang and zheng 2004 the statistical value is close to the calculated value under the corresponding governance degree using the improved sdr algorithm iv the jinghe river with a basin area of 45421 km2 flows through the loess hilly and plateaued regions it is generally assumed that the sediment yield is negatively correlated with the catchment area because large catchments tend to have greater proportions of mild slopes thus rendering lower soil erosion rates and producing more sediment deposition occurrances walling and webb 1996 wu et al 2014 however the average sdr value in the jinghe river basin remained large despite the considerable catchment area which suggests that there was a more complex interaction between the erosion processes and catchment connectivity for a large watershed haregeweyn et al 2008 zabaleta et al 2016 furthermore the nonlinearity and scale dependence of erosion processes fundamentally determined the nonlinear relationship between sediment yield and catchment area de vente and poesen 2005 de vente et al 2007 this complex correlation was further controlled by human activities or by any spatial differences in soil erodibility rainfall characteristics land use and topography within a catchment that might cause a change in sediment yield independent of catchment area dedkov and moszherin 1992 de vente et al 2007 v the improved study of the sdr algorithm in an ecological restoration watershed could provide a new understanding for the severity of soil erosion crises and the implementation effects of soil and water conservation measures under different governance periods this algorithm could also predict the variation trends of soil loss and put forward the reasonable design of soil conservation planning by evaluating the variation trends of the sdr in different periods of the same catchment 3 3 soil erosion modulus under different land use types fig 5 shows the dynamic changes of main land use types and the corresponding soil erosion modulus in the yangou river watershed in 1997 2000 2003 and 2009 there were a variety of land use types from 1997 to 2009 in the yangou river watershed including five major categories and nine sub categories of cultivated land plain dam land terrace sloping farmland orchard land forestland artificial planting tree shrub mixed forestland natural secondary forestland grassland artificial planting grassland waste gully grassland and rural settlements fig 5 a indicates that the transfer of land use types from 1997 to 2009 took on a feature of single source and multi direction in the yangou river watershed xu et al 2012b the total area of sloping farmland substantially decreased from 16 18 km2 in 1997 to 0 24 km2 in 2009 the area of orchard land expanded from 1 74 km2 in 1997 to 7 79 km2 in 2009 and the area of the artificial planting tree shrub mixed forestland increased continuously from 10 79 km2 in 1997 to 20 08 km2 in 2009 however the area of natural secondary forestland was almost unchanged and the area of waste gully grassland increased slightly moreover the area of artificial grassland first increased from 12 24 km2 in 1997 to 18 59 km2 in 2000 and then decreased to 4 71 km2 in 2009 land use affects erosion more than any other single factor toy et al 2002 the generalized land use refers to different land use types and the management applied to that land this study primarily focused on the erosion changes of six land use types including sloping farmland orchard land artificial planting tree shrub mixed forestland natural secondary forestland waste gully grassland and artificial planting grassland terraces dam lands and rural settlements in the yangou river watershed were assumed to be non erosion regions and their erosion intensity was considered as zero wang 2003 the annual soil erosion modulus of different land use types in the yangou river watershed was obtained by the product of different factors in the modified rusle model and identified using gis spatial analysis tools fig 5 b shows the soil erosion modulus of different land use types in the typical years of 1997 2000 2003 and 2009 the erosion intensities of the sloping farmland and orchards were intensive due to lack of reasonable soil conservation measures at the beginning of watershed management in 1997 soil conservation measures such as returning farmland to forestland grassland and terracing have been implemented in almost all the sloping farmlands since 1997 the specific designs were as follows the sloping farmlands 15 were all planted trees and shrubs the sloping farmlands between 5 and 15 were all transformed into the horizontal terraces and the serious soil erosion regions were effectively managed by dam lands and other soil conservation measures the area of sloping farmland in 2009 decreased by 98 52 comparing with the beginning of governance in 1997 whereas the annual soil erosion modulus in the yangou river watershed decreased from 5657 t km2 in 1997 to 2938 6 t km2 in 2009 a total reduction rate of 48 1 in addition the annual soil erosion intensity in each land use type also showed a significant downward trend after the effective implementation of soil conservation measures which may be attributed to the fact that the hillslopes were transferred from agricultural production to forestland or grassland thus leading to changes of flow paths flow velocities flow connectivity and water storage and reduced soil erosion gupta et al 2015 rogger et al 2017 3 4 spatial variations of erosion and sediment yield fig 6 shows the spatial distributions of soil erosion grade and sediment yield modulus in the yangou river watershed in 2010 most regions of the watershed were between moderate and extreme erosion in 2010 and the soil erosion grade in the lower parts of the yangou river watershed was relatively high but there was also some negligible erosion regions in the lower parts of the watershed the high intensity sediment yield regions were primarily concentrated in the middle of the watershed where dry farmland was the dominant land use type the peak regions of sediment yield in the yangou river watershed primarily appeared in the dry farmland region along both sides of the main river banks but the sediment yield modulus in the upper section of the watershed was relatively weak primarily because the sloping farmlands 15 were all reforested by trees and shrubs which can reduce runoff and erosion due to increased rainfall interception transpiration and soil permeability rogger et al 2017 furthermore the sloping farmlands between 5 and 15 were all converted into the horizontal terraces which can delay surface runoff depress peak flows and decrease shallow landslides due to the flat topographic slope gallart et al 1994 dagnew et al 2015 table 4 shows the results of soil erosion grade and sediment yield modulus under different land use types in the yangou river watershed in 2010 which were statistically identified by the corresponding spatial distribution maps using the gis zonal statistics techniques with the land use map as the zone field the land use types in the watershed were primarily dry land and moderate coverage grassland accounting for 47 22 and 36 45 of the total watershed area respectively although the erosion grade in the dry land region was higher than that of the moderate coverage grassland the erosion grades of these two land use types were both between moderate and extreme erosions the maximum sediment yield modulus appeared in the dry land region whereas the main source of sediment in the watershed was derived from the hilly dry land region and these two results were both closely related to agricultural activities these results are similar to the findings of schmidt et al 2018 that the soil particles were preferentially lost from regions with high rates of agricultural land use furthermore the extent of agricultural land use was directly proportional to the sediment yield modulus suggesting that the soil loss in the yangou river watershed is strongly influenced by agricultural activities therefore it is of great importance to implement appropriate soil conservation measures in the dry farmlands of hilly loess regions 3 5 temporal dynamics of the sediment yield modulus quantifying the sediment dynamics under different spatial and temporal scales is crucial for understanding the potential effects of anthropogenic drivers on sediment processes and is also helpful for effective watershed management golosov et al 2017 fig 7 shows the annual trends of the sediment yield modulus and rainfall erosivity during different governance periods in the yangou river watershed from 1991 to 2013 i the average sediment yield modulus during the four governance stages were 5310 8 1250 1 177 9 and 166 0 t km2 yr respectively except the extreme hydrological year of 2013 the results are well consistent with the findings of lian et al 2008 that the average sediment yield modulus before the governance project was 3000 7000 t km2 in the yangjiagou watershed 2 17 km2 which is 5 km from the yangou river watershed and has landforms and geomorphic conditions similar to those of the early governance stage of this watershed ii the annual sediment yield modulus in the first stage of the governance project 1991 1997 belonged to the intensive level after decades of governance the annual sediment yield modulus in the yangou river watershed showed a significant descending trend xu and sidle 2001 especially for governance stage 2 to stage 4 decreasing by 76 45 96 6 and 96 9 respectively compared with governance stage 1 iii the rainfall intensity provides an estimate of the strike force applied to the soil by raindrops the rainfall erosivity fluctuated in varying degrees from 1991 to 2012 except for a sharp increase in 2013 due to the once in a century heavy rainstorm event in yan an city however the annual sediment yield modulus in the yangou river watershed showed an overall decreasing trend due to the effective implementation of soil conservation measures and the overall changing trends were basically in accordance with different governance stages of the watershed indicating that the dynamics of sediment yield in a watershed are not completely affected by the random fluctuations of rainfall erosivity iv the underlying surfaces in the yangou river watershed have changed greatly since the implementation of soil conservation measures in the 1990s thus the erosion and sediment transport environments have also undergone great changes these results are similar to the findings of didoné et al 2015 that the additional conservation measures such as increasing the soil vegetation cover were greatly helpful for reducing sediment transfers in the agricultural regions of southern brazil 3 6 annual variations of the sediment delivery ratio the sediment transport capacity in a watershed is basically stable over a long series of time but it may be briefly unstable jing 2002 therefore it is necessary to study the dynamic trends of the sdr on a certain time scale jian 2011 fig 8 shows the annual variations of the sdr during different governance periods in the yangou river watershed i the annual sdr in the yangou river watershed presented a substantial decreasing trend from 1991 to 2013 the average sdr value decreased from 0 82 at governance stage 1 to 0 12 at stage 4 while the annual sdr value in the yangou river watershed decreased from 0 932 in 1992 to 0 057 in 2012 the sdr decreased by approximately 50 when the governance degree reached 50 and it decreased by 75 and 86 when the governance degree reached 70 and 80 respectively ii the governance effects of soil and water conservation measures were notable and the annual trends of the sdr were strongly consistent with the different governance stages of the yangou river watershed the consistency of the trends is mainly attributed to the sand blocking effects of different soil conservation measures such as the warp land dam in the watershed xu and sun 2004 moreover the sediment transport capacity was also affected by the shear stresses applied by runoff from the soil surface and subsequently by the transportability of sediment which were both closely related to the size and density of sediment particles toy et al 2002 deposition will result in the accumulation of soil particles on the underlying surface if the sediment available for transport becomes greater than the transport capacity of runoff brown et al 2005 iii the average sdr value of the yangou river watershed was approximately 0 38 from 1991 to 2013 and it was close to the average sdr value 0 4 in a small purple soil hilly watershed of southwest china li et al 2012 this value is of great practical significance in the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau because it indicates that the average sediment yield in an ecological restoration watershed is substantially less than soil erosion iv the above results may be attributed to fact that the artificial land management activities affect the forces applied to the soil by the splashing of raindrops and the scouring of surface runoff toy et al 2002 which often renders the watershed system in a coexistence state of sediment deposition and re erosion liu et al 2007 v the sdr indirectly reflects the severity of soil erosion in a watershed a large sdr value usually means that there are strong erosion and numerous sediment yields jing et al 2010 the sdr can also be used to evaluate the effects of soil and water conservation measures as the small sdr values correspond to the beneficial governance effects xu and sun 2004 4 conclusions an innovative sediment delivery ratio sdr algorithm embedded in a dynamic sediment yield model was proposed to investigate the applicability of the piecewise sdr to diverse watersheds and clarify the interactions between the comprehensive governance degree and sediment yield in an ecological restoration watershed i the comprehensive governance degree watershed area gully density river channel slope annual rainfall annual erosion and sediment in the yangou river watershed were integrated to develop and calibrate the dynamic sdr algorithm using repeated multivariate nonlinear regression analysis the improved sdr algorithm has the features of strong reliability a certain physical mechanism very few parameters and high computational efficiency the integrated model can be applied to evaluate the sediment yield dynamics in any ecological restoration watersheds by calibrating local parameters ii the erosion intensities of sloping farmland and orchards in the yangou river watershed were intensive in the early stage of watershed governance in 1997 the annual soil erosion modulus decreased from 5657 t km2 in 1997 to 906 23 t km2 in 2012 a total reduction rate of 84 the annual soil erosion intensity also showed a substantial downward trend in each land use type after the effective implementation of soil conservation measures iii the peak regions of the sediment yield modulus in the yangou river watershed primarily appeared in the dry farmland region along both sides of the main river banks the sediment yield modulus in 1991 2013 presented a significant downward trend especially from 1997 which demonstrated the substantial benefits of sediment reduction due to the effective soil conservation measures iv the annual average sdr value considerably decreased from 0 82 at governance stage 1 to 0 12 at stage 4 the average sdr value from 1991 to 2013 was approximately 0 38 indicating that the average sediment yield modulus was substantially less than soil erosion after large scale ecological restorations v the significant reduction of sdr was primarily attributed to the effects of sand blocking by various soil conservation measures the soil conservation measures greatly affected the erosion environments of detachment entrainment transport and deposition of soil particles thus changing the sediment balance of the watershed vi the factors affecting sdr at different spatio temporal scales are extremely complex so the future research needs to give more consideration to the spatio temporal sdr algorithm with a physical mechanism this new overall understanding opens opportunities for studying further modifications of the multi scale sdr algorithm based on evaluating the spatio temporal dynamics of sediment yield in different ecological restoration watersheds the authors declare that there have no competing interests acknowledgements special thanks to the anonymous reviewers and the editor for their useful suggestions on the

7106,the sediment delivery ratio sdr is a bond of slope erosion and channel sediment transport but exhibits poor dynamic applicability which makes it difficult to accurately identify the spatio temporal evolutions of sediment yield in an ecological restoration watershed with different governance degrees i an innovative piecewise sdr algorithm considering the multi stage effects of the comprehensive governance degree from 1991 to 2013 was embedded in a dynamic sediment yield model to solve the complex dynamic applicability problem of the sdr in sediment yield predictions ii the main advantages of the improved sdr algorithm over the existing models are small data requirements dynamic mechanism wide application range reduced complexity ease of use and better accuracy iii the erosion intensities of sloping farmland and orchards in the yangou river watershed were both intensive at the early stage of governance in 1997 the trends in erosion and sediment yield were closely related to the watershed management measures the soil erosion modulus in this watershed decreased from 5657 t km2 in 1997 to 906 2 t km2 in 2012 a total decrease rate of 84 the sediment yield modulus decreased from 4500 t km2 in 1997 to 51 9 t km2 in 2012 a total reduction rate of 98 8 iv the annual dynamics of the sdr values were not completely affected by the random fluctuations in rainfall erosivity but showed an obvious decreasing trend from 0 932 in 1992 to 0 057 in 2012 due to the soil conservation measures the annual average sdr in 1991 2013 was approximately 0 38 indicating that the average sediment yield after ecological restoration was significantly less than the average soil erosion in the yangou river watershed the results of this study may provide a better understanding of dynamic sdr studies and reveal the profound insights needed to guide watershed soil conservation planning keywords sediment delivery ratio piecewise algorithm sediment transport ecological restoration comprehensive governance degree 1 introduction quantifying the sediment transport flux remains a severe challenge in landscape evolution studies xie and li 2012 tsai et al 2012 the sediment delivery ratio sdr a ratio of the sediment yield from a region to the gross erosion of that same region is a bond of slope erosion and channel sediment transport and plays a key role in various projects involving the sediment yield prediction and soil conservation planning wu et al 2012a 2016a generally the development of the sdr algorithm was mainly based on the definition and main influencing factors of the sdr gao et al 2007 previous studies have shown that the sdr algorithm can be summarized as three categories i a single factor sdr algorithm considering the basin area ii a two factor sdr algorithm primarily considering the rainfall and runoff depth followed by gully density iii a multi factor sdr algorithm primarily including rainfall gully density runoff depth channel slope and basin area xie and li 2012 tao and chen 2015 wu et al 2018a although most of the existing sdr algorithms are legitimate and applicable for the individual research object in specific regions wu et al 2018a they were only statistically empirical equations it is difficult to obtain the general statements on interactions between different catchments because each study takes a rather narrow and specific perspective rogger et al 2017 moreover the existing sdr studies were primarily focused on the long term average value by the limited hydrological observations of a particular watershed chen et al 2001 xu 2010 there have been few reports on the dynamic sdr algorithms especially for the impacts of human activities such as soil and water conservation measures ali and de boer 2010 sang et al 2015 the difficulty in producing a widely applicable sdr algorithm was partly due to the complexity of sediment delivery processes and their interactions and partly due to the lack of definitive assessments of the natural and anthropogenic influencing factors didoné et al 2015 the loess plateau in china is one of the most fragile soil erosion regions in the world ouyang et al 2010 soil erosion in this region is mainly caused by several heavy rainstorms during 6 9 months and the amount of erosion by heavy rains accounts for 60 of total annual erosion wu et al 2018b however the ecological environments on the loess plateau have been significantly improved since the effective implementation of large scale soil and water conservation measures e g returning farmland to forest grass conservation tillage contour farming terracing construction of warp land dams hillside ditches and contour buffer strips wu et al 2016b how to accurately quantify the dynamic changes associated with the hydrometeorological parameters and anthropogenic land management activities is the main challenge of the sdr which is also the critical knowledge gap between slope erosion and sediment yield in an ecological restoration watershed liu et al 2007 wu et al 2018a therefore the comprehensive governance degree a percentage index used for quantifying the dynamic governance level in a watershed was innovatively introduced to address the issue of the quantification accuracy in dynamic sediment yield predictions the existing sdr studies on the loess plateau are primarily focused on the wuding river dali river chabagou river quanjiagou river yangdaogou river jiuyuangou river yangou river nanxiaohegou river and yanhe river chen 2000 cao et al 1993 sun and li 2004 xie and li 2012 through statistical analysis it was definitely found that all the above watersheds had experienced different governance backgrounds among them the governance of the yangou river watershed was the most typical and representative case on the loess plateau ju et al 2003 the corresponding large scale comprehensive governance project in this watershed was implemented in 1997 and basically reacheda stablegovernance state in 2009 liu et al 2011 wu et al 2016e this project went through four periods in which the governance degree increased from 27 to 83 the first period in 1991 1997 with a governance degree 27 the second period in 1998 2002 with a governance degree 52 the third period in 2003 2008 with a governance degree 73 and the fourth period in 2009 2013 with a governance degree 83 xu et al 2012a b therefore the yangou river watershed in northern shaanxi province was selected as a study case to explore and develop a dynamic sdr algorithm which is critical later to test hypotheses regarding the effects of the comprehensive governance degree on sediment yield dynamics this study aims to i develop a piecewise sdr algorithm coordinatively considering the main natural factors and the multi stage comprehensive governance degree in an ecological restoration watershed ii verify the applicability of the improved sdr algorithm in different watersheds and iii evaluate the effectiveness of the piecewise sdr algorithm on the spatio temporal dynamics response of sediment yield in the yangou river watershed the results may provide new understanding not only for the quantitative estimation of spatio temporal sediment yield evolutions but also for the reasonable soil conservation planning at different ecological restoration regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region and data sources the yangou river watershed 109 20 e 109 35 e 36 20 n 36 32 n which belongs to the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau fig 1 is located 5 km southeast of yan an city shaanxi province china the catchment area is 47 68 km2 the elevation of this watershed is 962 1402 m with an average of 1198 m the maximum height difference between the upper and lower reaches is 439 m and the terrain in this watershed is dominated by steep slopes liang et al 2003 the yangou river a second grade tributary of the yanhe river has an 8 6 km main river channel a longitudinal bottom slope of 2 41 and a gully density of 4 8 km km2 the watershed is located at the transitional zone from semi arid to semi humid climate regions where the average annual temperature is 9 4 c the average temperatures in january and july are 6 7 c and 22 9 c respectively the extreme maximum temperature is 39 7 c and the extreme minimum temperature is 25 4 c the average annual precipitation is 558 4 mm the inter annual variability of precipitation is large and the seasonal distribution is uneven so approximately 70 of the rainfall is concentrated in 6 9 months wang 2011 the watershed isshaped bymanyravines hills and loess slopes the loessal soil occupies an absolute advantage in the watershed the soil texture is silty loam that is primarily composed of particles 0 25 mm the contents of fine sand and silt account for 60 of the gross particle weight rendering the soil erosion resistance relatively poor xu et al 2012a b the land use types within the watershed are mostly dominated by dryland and middle coverage grassland which account for approximately 84 of the watershed area fig 2 the environmental database in this study include precipitation digital elevation model

http loess geodata cn 2 2 dynamic sediment yield model the dynamic sediment yield model has been modified from the original rusle equation renard et al 1997 the k and ls factors in the rusle equation are primarily related to the soil properties and topography of a watershed bagarello et al 2011 wu et al 2012b 2013 shrestha and wang 2018 they can be assumed to be constant because the topography and soil may have slight changes over a short period of time wu et al 2016a c the r c and p factors which are prone to being affected by hydrometeorological conditions and land management measures are defined as temporal dynamic factors wu et al 2016b e furthermore the comprehensive governance degree factor g affected by soil conservation measures was introduced to enhance the estimation accuracy of soil erosion under the great changes of erosion environments on the loess plateau the dynamic sediment yield model can be written as follows 1 e i r i k l s c i p j g j 2 q s i e i s d r i where e

factor during the j th governance period sdr i is the annual sediment delivery ratio affected by hydrometeorological conditions and human activities ls c and p are dimensionless the subscript i represents the i th year and the subscript j represents the j th governance period 2 3 factor algorithms 2 3 1 r factor the rainfall erosivity factor r a crucial objective indicator for evaluating the capacity of raindrop splashing and soil denudation caused by erosive rainfall wu et al 2016d can be effectively employed to describe the features of rainfall energy wu et al 2015 a half month algorithm of rainfall erosivity proposed by zhang and fu 2003 was applied to estimate the r factor in this study the half month algorithms of the r factor are described as follows 3 r i α j 1 n p j β 4 β 0 8363 18 144 p d 12 24 455 p y 12 5 α 21 586 β 7 1891 6 r i 1 24 r i where r is the annual rainfall erosivity mj mm hm2 h yr ri is the rainfall erosivity in the i th half month period mj mm hm2 h

daily erosive rainfall standard 12 mm p y12 represents the average annual rainfall of all erosive rainfall and α and β are model parameters the first 15 days of each month were defined as the former half month period and the remaining days of the corresponding month were used as the latter half month period the calculated value of the average annual r factor was approximately 1511 32 mj mm hm2 h yr except for the extreme hydrological year of 2013 fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the average annual r factor in the yangou river watershed 2 3 2 k factor the soil erodibility factor k is a comprehensive indicator for describing the separation resistance capacity of soil in the face of erosion force the k factor was calculated using the equation embedded in the environmental policy integrated climate epic model williams and berndt 1977 7 k 0 2 0 3 e 0 0256 s a n 1 s i l 100 sil cla s i l 0 3 1 0 25 c c e 3 72 2 95 c 1 0 7 s n 1 s n 1 e 229 s n 1 5 51 where k is the soil

above equation needs to be converted into a metric unit by k metric units k us units 0 1317 the average annual k value was calculated as 0 047 t hm2 h hm2 mj mm in the yangou river watershed 2 3 3 ls factor the topographical factor ls can be divided into the slope length factor l and the slope steepness factor s both the slope length and the slope steepness substantially affect the sheet and rill erosion estimated by the rusle the soil erosion increases with the slope length and is considered by the l factor the s factor reflects the influence of the slope gradient on erosion the l factor was calculated by the algorithm in the rusle model the specific equations are as follows 8 l λ 22 1 m m 0 2 θ 1 0 3 1 θ 3 0 4 3 θ 5 0 5 θ 5 where λ is the horizontal projection of the slope length m and m is the slope length exponent the s factor was calculated using the piecewise functions the equation proposed by mccool et al 1987 was used for the gentle slope 10 and the equation proposed by liu et al 2010 was applied for the steep slope 10 the specific expressions are as follows 9 s 10 8 sin θ 0 03 θ 5 s 16 8 sin θ 0 05 5 θ 10 s 21 9 sin θ 0 96 θ 10 where θ is the slope gradient the ls value was statistically averaged as 10 9 using gis techniques fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the ls factor in the yangou river watershed 2 3 4 c factor the vegetation cover management factor c refers to the ratio of soil loss from land cropped under specified conditions to the corresponding loss from clean tilled continuous fallow this factor measures the combined effect of all the interrelated cover and management variables previous studies indicate that the c factor is closely related to vegetation cover wischmeier and smith 1978 wu et al 2009 cai et al 2000 ma and ma 2001 the specific equations of vegetation coverage c and the c factor can be expressed as follows 10 c k ndv i k n d v i soil k ndv i veg k n d v i soil k 11 c k 1 c k 0 0 6508 0 3436 l g c k 0 c k 78 3 0 c k

the actual value of ndvi in the k th month ndvisoil k is the ndvi value for bare or uncovered land in the k th month which is close to the minimal value of ndvi ndvi min ndviveg k is the ndvi value for full vegetation cover in the k th month which is close to the maximal value of ndvi ndvi max k is a specific month from january to december rk is the monthly rainfall erosivity factor and r is the annual rainfall erosivity factor the average value of the c factor for different vegetation covers was estimated as 0 138 in the yangou river watershed 2 3 5 p factor the support practice factor p in the rusle refers to the ratio of the soil loss with a specific support practice to the corresponding loss with upslope and downslope tillage values for the p factor in this study were obtained from different land use types under different support practices rao et al 2014 the average p factor of different land use types was statistically summarized as 0 192 in the yangou river watershed 2 3 6 the improved sdr algorithm the watershed area rainfall gully density river channel slope and runoff depth were exactly proven to be the main natural influencing factors of watershed sediment transport cai and fan 2004 sánchez et al 2018 meanwhile the comprehensive governance degree was introduced to dynamically identify the potential influencing effects of anthropogenic factors based on these two prerequisites the target data in the yangou river watershed including the watershed area a 47 68 km2 annual rainfall 1991 2013 gully density r c 4 8 km km2 main river channel slope j 2 41 the comprehensive governance degree g 27 83 as well as the annual estimated erosion data and the annual observed sediment data 1991 2013 were statistically determined and the improved piecewise sdr function under four periods was finally developed and calibrated using the repeated trial of multivariate nonlinear regression analysis 11 sd r i 1 4376 a 0 4443 p 0 06873 r c 1 6917 g 2 3852 j 3 8034

river channel slope 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration performance of the improved sdr algorithm the calculated sdr by the improved sdr algorithm and the measured sdr by the definition were comparatively used to check the reliability of the improved sdr algorithm in the yangou river watershed table 1 shows the calibration results of the improved sdr algorithm from 1991 to 2013 i the calculated soil erosion modulus was compared with the observed soil erosion modulus measured by the 137cs radionuclides tracing technique in the yangou river watershed wang et al 2003 wang 2009 the observed values of the soil erosion modulus were 4647 t km2 in 1997 and 1588 t km2 in 2000 respectively and the corresponding relative errors between the calculated and observed values of the soil erosion modulus were 21 7 in 1997 and 9 6 in 2000 ii the yangou river watershed belongs to the second sub region of the hilly and gully region on the loess plateau wang and tian 2005 the observed soil erosion modulus in this sub region was 5000 9000 t km2 before 1997 the calculated average soil erosion modulus from 1991 to 1997 was 6632 7 t km2 in the yangou river watershed which was exactly within the limits of experimental uncertainty of the soil erosion modulus in this sub region iii although the sdr errors in individual years were relatively large the calculated soil erosion modulus and the sdr in the yangou river watershed both presented a significant decreasing trend and this trend was well consistent with the governance stage of the watershed wang et al 2009 which indicated that the modified algorithm had strong applicability in the yangou river watershed iv the sdr values calculated by the improved algorithm were close to the sdr values measured by the definition method y 0 975x 0 0091 r2 0 977 n 23 p 0 01 and the relative error range was approximately 21 2 22 0 which further confirmed that the improved algorithm had good applicability in different governance stages of the yangou river watershed v the main advantages of the improved sdr algorithm over the process based models are small data requirements reduced complexity clear mechanism ease of use and better accuracy these features also prove that the regression models have a great potential for modelling event based suspended sediment yields in small river systems and the regression analysis itself can provide an additional understanding of the factors influencing sediment levels in different regions merritt et al 2003 rymszewicz et al 2017 vi the high sdr values could be associated with the dominant steep terrain 15 which accounted for as much as 79 56 of the total watershed area whereas only 5 25 of the watershed was classified as the cultivable land 5 jiao et al 1998 both koulouri and giourga 2007 and kannan et al 2017 both proved that the steeper slopes could be significantly associated with the higher levels of surface runoff and soil loss and flow from each subbasin was the dominant factor affecting the sdr in a watershed vii the above calibration performance indicated that the improved sdr algorithm had strong reliability for sediment yield predictions in an ecological restoration watershed which may provide new understanding for watershed soil conservation planning in hilly loess regions 3 2 validation and evaluation of the improved sdr algorithm the effects of different governance degrees in the jiuyuangou watershed on the sdr ma 2013 were firstly used to verify the reliability of the improved sdr algorithm in the yangou river watershed the jiuyuangou watershed a tributary of the middle reaches of the wuding river is located 5 km north of suide county shaanxi province the watershed with a governance degree of only 0 8 in 1953 has been extensively governed since then the comprehensive governance networks of soil and water conservation measures e g returning farmland to forestland grassland terracing constructing reservoirs and warp land dams were established after nearly 60 years of governance the soil loss was effectively controlled and the sdr values of the jiuyuanyou watershed also decreased significantly table 2 compares the sdr values between the jiuyuangou and yangou river watersheds under different governance periods it was observed that all the errors from 1959 to 2004 were relatively acceptable by comparing the sdr values in these two watersheds so the improved sdr algorithm was reliable and feasible in time scales moreover 19 watersheds with various governance degrees were also used to verify the applicability of the improved sdr algorithm table 3 the verification results indicated that the relative errors between the observed and calculated sdr values were all within a relatively acceptable range of 19 25 15 69 the above verifications were very persuasive because they covered diverse watersheds with various hydrometeorological conditions and underlying surfaces and there was a strong correlation and a certain level of significant difference between the statistical sdr and the calculated sdr y 1 0918x 0 0497 r2 0 959 n 19 p 0 01 so the improved sdr algorithm had strong applicability in multi scale watersheds with different governance levels specifically i the yanhe river with a catchment area of 7725 km2 is a first grade tributary in the right bank of the yellow river the average annual sdr of this watershed was 0 92 from 1954 to 2010 xie 2012 the average governance degree was approximately 52 the relative error between the calculated and statistical sdrs was approximately 7 96 which meant that the sdr algorithm had good applicability ii the chabagou river with a watershed area of 205 km2 is a branch of the dali river on the loess plateau the average annual sdr in this watershed was close to 1 from 1959 to 1969 liu et al 2007 whereas the sdr decreased substantially after the implementation of soil conservation measures since 1970s thus thecalculatedvalue of sdr under the designed governance degree was in good agreement with the statistical sdr value after the 1990 s iii the zhifanggou watershed with a catchment area of 8 27 km2 is a typical representation of the hilly and gully loess region since 1975 the soil erosion has been comprehensively harnessed in this watershed the average sdr value in this watershed remained close to 1 from 1985 to 2000 although the spatial distribution of soil erosion changed greatly jiang and zheng 2004 the statistical value is close to the calculated value under the corresponding governance degree using the improved sdr algorithm iv the jinghe river with a basin area of 45421 km2 flows through the loess hilly and plateaued regions it is generally assumed that the sediment yield is negatively correlated with the catchment area because large catchments tend to have greater proportions of mild slopes thus rendering lower soil erosion rates and producing more sediment deposition occurrances walling and webb 1996 wu et al 2014 however the average sdr value in the jinghe river basin remained large despite the considerable catchment area which suggests that there was a more complex interaction between the erosion processes and catchment connectivity for a large watershed haregeweyn et al 2008 zabaleta et al 2016 furthermore the nonlinearity and scale dependence of erosion processes fundamentally determined the nonlinear relationship between sediment yield and catchment area de vente and poesen 2005 de vente et al 2007 this complex correlation was further controlled by human activities or by any spatial differences in soil erodibility rainfall characteristics land use and topography within a catchment that might cause a change in sediment yield independent of catchment area dedkov and moszherin 1992 de vente et al 2007 v the improved study of the sdr algorithm in an ecological restoration watershed could provide a new understanding for the severity of soil erosion crises and the implementation effects of soil and water conservation measures under different governance periods this algorithm could also predict the variation trends of soil loss and put forward the reasonable design of soil conservation planning by evaluating the variation trends of the sdr in different periods of the same catchment 3 3 soil erosion modulus under different land use types fig 5 shows the dynamic changes of main land use types and the corresponding soil erosion modulus in the yangou river watershed in 1997 2000 2003 and 2009 there were a variety of land use types from 1997 to 2009 in the yangou river watershed including five major categories and nine sub categories of cultivated land plain dam land terrace sloping farmland orchard land forestland artificial planting tree shrub mixed forestland natural secondary forestland grassland artificial planting grassland waste gully grassland and rural settlements fig 5 a indicates that the transfer of land use types from 1997 to 2009 took on a feature of single source and multi direction in the yangou river watershed xu et al 2012b the total area of sloping farmland substantially decreased from 16 18 km2 in 1997 to 0 24 km2 in 2009 the area of orchard land expanded from 1 74 km2 in 1997 to 7 79 km2 in 2009 and the area of the artificial planting tree shrub mixed forestland increased continuously from 10 79 km2 in 1997 to 20 08 km2 in 2009 however the area of natural secondary forestland was almost unchanged and the area of waste gully grassland increased slightly moreover the area of artificial grassland first increased from 12 24 km2 in 1997 to 18 59 km2 in 2000 and then decreased to 4 71 km2 in 2009 land use affects erosion more than any other single factor toy et al 2002 the generalized land use refers to different land use types and the management applied to that land this study primarily focused on the erosion changes of six land use types including sloping farmland orchard land artificial planting tree shrub mixed forestland natural secondary forestland waste gully grassland and artificial planting grassland terraces dam lands and rural settlements in the yangou river watershed were assumed to be non erosion regions and their erosion intensity was considered as zero wang 2003 the annual soil erosion modulus of different land use types in the yangou river watershed was obtained by the product of different factors in the modified rusle model and identified using gis spatial analysis tools fig 5 b shows the soil erosion modulus of different land use types in the typical years of 1997 2000 2003 and 2009 the erosion intensities of the sloping farmland and orchards were intensive due to lack of reasonable soil conservation measures at the beginning of watershed management in 1997 soil conservation measures such as returning farmland to forestland grassland and terracing have been implemented in almost all the sloping farmlands since 1997 the specific designs were as follows the sloping farmlands 15 were all planted trees and shrubs the sloping farmlands between 5 and 15 were all transformed into the horizontal terraces and the serious soil erosion regions were effectively managed by dam lands and other soil conservation measures the area of sloping farmland in 2009 decreased by 98 52 comparing with the beginning of governance in 1997 whereas the annual soil erosion modulus in the yangou river watershed decreased from 5657 t km2 in 1997 to 2938 6 t km2 in 2009 a total reduction rate of 48 1 in addition the annual soil erosion intensity in each land use type also showed a significant downward trend after the effective implementation of soil conservation measures which may be attributed to the fact that the hillslopes were transferred from agricultural production to forestland or grassland thus leading to changes of flow paths flow velocities flow connectivity and water storage and reduced soil erosion gupta et al 2015 rogger et al 2017 3 4 spatial variations of erosion and sediment yield fig 6 shows the spatial distributions of soil erosion grade and sediment yield modulus in the yangou river watershed in 2010 most regions of the watershed were between moderate and extreme erosion in 2010 and the soil erosion grade in the lower parts of the yangou river watershed was relatively high but there was also some negligible erosion regions in the lower parts of the watershed the high intensity sediment yield regions were primarily concentrated in the middle of the watershed where dry farmland was the dominant land use type the peak regions of sediment yield in the yangou river watershed primarily appeared in the dry farmland region along both sides of the main river banks but the sediment yield modulus in the upper section of the watershed was relatively weak primarily because the sloping farmlands 15 were all reforested by trees and shrubs which can reduce runoff and erosion due to increased rainfall interception transpiration and soil permeability rogger et al 2017 furthermore the sloping farmlands between 5 and 15 were all converted into the horizontal terraces which can delay surface runoff depress peak flows and decrease shallow landslides due to the flat topographic slope gallart et al 1994 dagnew et al 2015 table 4 shows the results of soil erosion grade and sediment yield modulus under different land use types in the yangou river watershed in 2010 which were statistically identified by the corresponding spatial distribution maps using the gis zonal statistics techniques with the land use map as the zone field the land use types in the watershed were primarily dry land and moderate coverage grassland accounting for 47 22 and 36 45 of the total watershed area respectively although the erosion grade in the dry land region was higher than that of the moderate coverage grassland the erosion grades of these two land use types were both between moderate and extreme erosions the maximum sediment yield modulus appeared in the dry land region whereas the main source of sediment in the watershed was derived from the hilly dry land region and these two results were both closely related to agricultural activities these results are similar to the findings of schmidt et al 2018 that the soil particles were preferentially lost from regions with high rates of agricultural land use furthermore the extent of agricultural land use was directly proportional to the sediment yield modulus suggesting that the soil loss in the yangou river watershed is strongly influenced by agricultural activities therefore it is of great importance to implement appropriate soil conservation measures in the dry farmlands of hilly loess regions 3 5 temporal dynamics of the sediment yield modulus quantifying the sediment dynamics under different spatial and temporal scales is crucial for understanding the potential effects of anthropogenic drivers on sediment processes and is also helpful for effective watershed management golosov et al 2017 fig 7 shows the annual trends of the sediment yield modulus and rainfall erosivity during different governance periods in the yangou river watershed from 1991 to 2013 i the average sediment yield modulus during the four governance stages were 5310 8 1250 1 177 9 and 166 0 t km2 yr respectively except the extreme hydrological year of 2013 the results are well consistent with the findings of lian et al 2008 that the average sediment yield modulus before the governance project was 3000 7000 t km2 in the yangjiagou watershed 2 17 km2 which is 5 km from the yangou river watershed and has landforms and geomorphic conditions similar to those of the early governance stage of this watershed ii the annual sediment yield modulus in the first stage of the governance project 1991 1997 belonged to the intensive level after decades of governance the annual sediment yield modulus in the yangou river watershed showed a significant descending trend xu and sidle 2001 especially for governance stage 2 to stage 4 decreasing by 76 45 96 6 and 96 9 respectively compared with governance stage 1 iii the rainfall intensity provides an estimate of the strike force applied to the soil by raindrops the rainfall erosivity fluctuated in varying degrees from 1991 to 2012 except for a sharp increase in 2013 due to the once in a century heavy rainstorm event in yan an city however the annual sediment yield modulus in the yangou river watershed showed an overall decreasing trend due to the effective implementation of soil conservation measures and the overall changing trends were basically in accordance with different governance stages of the watershed indicating that the dynamics of sediment yield in a watershed are not completely affected by the random fluctuations of rainfall erosivity iv the underlying surfaces in the yangou river watershed have changed greatly since the implementation of soil conservation measures in the 1990s thus the erosion and sediment transport environments have also undergone great changes these results are similar to the findings of didoné et al 2015 that the additional conservation measures such as increasing the soil vegetation cover were greatly helpful for reducing sediment transfers in the agricultural regions of southern brazil 3 6 annual variations of the sediment delivery ratio the sediment transport capacity in a watershed is basically stable over a long series of time but it may be briefly unstable jing 2002 therefore it is necessary to study the dynamic trends of the sdr on a certain time scale jian 2011 fig 8 shows the annual variations of the sdr during different governance periods in the yangou river watershed i the annual sdr in the yangou river watershed presented a substantial decreasing trend from 1991 to 2013 the average sdr value decreased from 0 82 at governance stage 1 to 0 12 at stage 4 while the annual sdr value in the yangou river watershed decreased from 0 932 in 1992 to 0 057 in 2012 the sdr decreased by approximately 50 when the governance degree reached 50 and it decreased by 75 and 86 when the governance degree reached 70 and 80 respectively ii the governance effects of soil and water conservation measures were notable and the annual trends of the sdr were strongly consistent with the different governance stages of the yangou river watershed the consistency of the trends is mainly attributed to the sand blocking effects of different soil conservation measures such as the warp land dam in the watershed xu and sun 2004 moreover the sediment transport capacity was also affected by the shear stresses applied by runoff from the soil surface and subsequently by the transportability of sediment which were both closely related to the size and density of sediment particles toy et al 2002 deposition will result in the accumulation of soil particles on the underlying surface if the sediment available for transport becomes greater than the transport capacity of runoff brown et al 2005 iii the average sdr value of the yangou river watershed was approximately 0 38 from 1991 to 2013 and it was close to the average sdr value 0 4 in a small purple soil hilly watershed of southwest china li et al 2012 this value is of great practical significance in the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau because it indicates that the average sediment yield in an ecological restoration watershed is substantially less than soil erosion iv the above results may be attributed to fact that the artificial land management activities affect the forces applied to the soil by the splashing of raindrops and the scouring of surface runoff toy et al 2002 which often renders the watershed system in a coexistence state of sediment deposition and re erosion liu et al 2007 v the sdr indirectly reflects the severity of soil erosion in a watershed a large sdr value usually means that there are strong erosion and numerous sediment yields jing et al 2010 the sdr can also be used to evaluate the effects of soil and water conservation measures as the small sdr values correspond to the beneficial governance effects xu and sun 2004 4 conclusions an innovative sediment delivery ratio sdr algorithm embedded in a dynamic sediment yield model was proposed to investigate the applicability of the piecewise sdr to diverse watersheds and clarify the interactions between the comprehensive governance degree and sediment yield in an ecological restoration watershed i the comprehensive governance degree watershed area gully density river channel slope annual rainfall annual erosion and sediment in the yangou river watershed were integrated to develop and calibrate the dynamic sdr algorithm using repeated multivariate nonlinear regression analysis the improved sdr algorithm has the features of strong reliability a certain physical mechanism very few parameters and high computational efficiency the integrated model can be applied to evaluate the sediment yield dynamics in any ecological restoration watersheds by calibrating local parameters ii the erosion intensities of sloping farmland and orchards in the yangou river watershed were intensive in the early stage of watershed governance in 1997 the annual soil erosion modulus decreased from 5657 t km2 in 1997 to 906 23 t km2 in 2012 a total reduction rate of 84 the annual soil erosion intensity also showed a substantial downward trend in each land use type after the effective implementation of soil conservation measures iii the peak regions of the sediment yield modulus in the yangou river watershed primarily appeared in the dry farmland region along both sides of the main river banks the sediment yield modulus in 1991 2013 presented a significant downward trend especially from 1997 which demonstrated the substantial benefits of sediment reduction due to the effective soil conservation measures iv the annual average sdr value considerably decreased from 0 82 at governance stage 1 to 0 12 at stage 4 the average sdr value from 1991 to 2013 was approximately 0 38 indicating that the average sediment yield modulus was substantially less than soil erosion after large scale ecological restorations v the significant reduction of sdr was primarily attributed to the effects of sand blocking by various soil conservation measures the soil conservation measures greatly affected the erosion environments of detachment entrainment transport and deposition of soil particles thus changing the sediment balance of the watershed vi the factors affecting sdr at different spatio temporal scales are extremely complex so the future research needs to give more consideration to the spatio temporal sdr algorithm with a physical mechanism this new overall understanding opens opportunities for studying further modifications of the multi scale sdr algorithm based on evaluating the spatio temporal dynamics of sediment yield in different ecological restoration watersheds the authors declare that there have no competing interests acknowledgements special thanks to the anonymous reviewers and the editor for their useful suggestions on the

7107,due to the dynamic flow exchange between a stream and a connected water table aquifer a physically based hydrologic model is an important tool for the design of conjunctive use of surface and ground waters it is needed to develop sound plans for sustainable use of the groundwater with minimal undesirable effects this article reports an investigation of the component module that describes the stream aquifer flow exchange in several groundwater simulators the study indicates that the module may not have a solid physical basis when used in large scale regional studies to estimate the stream aquifer flow exchange the component relies upon an empirical parameter known as the leakance coefficient it is demonstrated that neglecting river penetration of the aquifer can lead to non negligible errors in estimation of seepage in addition the leakance coefficient dimension inverse of a time is not constant in time but varies with the conditions in the river and in the surrounding aquifer a potential practical and simple alternative is presented keywords quantitative estimation of seepage stream aquifer interaction leakance coefficient dimensionless conductance relation between leakance coefficient and dimensionless conductance and other physical parameters time variation of leakance coefficient with various environmental factors 1 introduction this article has two goals first it describes how some widely used models estimate the flow exchange between rivers and hydraulically connected water table aquifers that estimation of the seepage actual seepage if positive and aquifer return flow if negative depends upon a parameter the leakance coefficient the nature of that coefficient is highly approximate the second goal is to propose an alternative by using a physically based and analytically derived expression for the leakance coefficient numerical examples demonstrate that the use of that exact leakance coefficient provides a more accurate estimate for the seepage most groundwater or integrated surface groundwater models state that they have a physical basis to a large extent they do for example in a recent contract with the state water resources control board of california the usgs states due to the relationship between surface water flow and groundwater use a scientifically defensible surface water groundwater model is a crucial component and transparent management strategy for the rrw russian river watershed usgs 2016 whereas the goal is correct i e that the code should be scientifically defensible the question is whether modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and many other codes meet that criterion for all components of their code in this document we look closely at the particular component module that estimates the flow exchange between a river and a hydraulically connected water table aquifer given the complexity of nature it is not possible to represent correctly every inch of soil or aquifer material thus models by necessity are and always will be largely conceptual for example finite differences or finite elements approximations are typically used to solve the original governing partial differential equations if fine grids are used in space and time the numerical solutions to the finite differences or finite elements approximations can give accurate solutions however our experience is that extremely fine grids can be required to obtain reasonable accuracy for the estimation of seepage morel seytoux et al 2014 miracapillo and morel seytoux et al 2015 morel seytoux and miller 2016 in fig 1 the grid size is approximately 20 calculation cells in the vertical direction and 50 cells in the horizontal direction for a total 1000 cells previous work has shown morel seytoux et al 2014 that to calculate the seepage discharge within a relative accuracy of 4 using modflow the grid size would have to be of the order of 28x10 280 calculation cells for large scale regional studies the size of the cells in the horizontal direction is easily 500 m and in the vertical direction it is the thickness of the water table aquifer which is often in excess of 50 m whereas the width of the river or creek is often less than 20 m yet in the commonly used groundwater models the aquifer cell that includes the river the river cell is not divided into calculation subcells so that the calculation grid size is essentially 1x1 for that cell the size of the calculation cell is the full size of the river cell with size g in the horizontal direction and the saturated aquifer thickness in the vertical direction d aq for numerical example 1 g 140 m d aq 15 m while the river bottom width is 2 b 20 m the width of the river cell is much larger than the width of the river the analytical solution to which the numerical results using modflow were compared to estimate seepage was obtained exactly using complex variable and potential theories morel seytoux 2009 morel seytoux et al 2014 morel seytoux and miller 2016 in fig 1 the outer boundary condition of a constant head is located at a distance from the river bank which is twice the aquifer thickness that was chosen so that by the time the flow reaches the outer boundary the flow has become essentially horizontal as can be verified in fig 1 when the grid size as needed in practice becomes relatively large the approximations do not represent the proper physics and dynamics of the system but may hopefully provide some reasonably acceptable average values in time and space most of our discussion is focused on large scale regional studies in such studies typically the water table aquifer is treated as a single calculation layer and not subdivided into multiple calculation cells in both horizontal and vertical directions e g hanson 2017 woolfenden and nishikawa 2014 in both cited studies the water table aquifer thickness is of the order of 30 50 m and is treated as a single calculation layer and the cell widths are much larger than the river widths 2 the conceptualization process a comparison between modflow mike she and hydrogeosphere the process of conceptualization is as much an art as a science different modelers have a distinct way of describing reality just as michelangelo and van gogh view and represent the world differently in their paintings in this work we consider the way modflow and mike she mike she 2013 describe conceptualize imagine paint the process of seepage understood in an algebraic sense i e positive if gain for the aquifer and negative if gain for the river aquifer return flow 2 1 modflow the following description and discussion applies also essentially to iwfm dogrul 2012 pihm kumar et al 2009 asmwin kinzelbach and rausch 1995 and hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2012 in the case of modflow let us consider a rectangular cross section the following discussion remains valid if the cross section is not rectangular according to modflow the equation to calculate the seepage discharge from the river is 1 q s k u e u l w 2 h h s h f λ u l w p h s h f c riv h s h f where q s is the seepage discharge volume per time k u is the hydraulic conductivity of a clogging layer that may not exist e u is its thickness l is the length of the river reach w is the width of the river h is the river water stage i e maximum water depth hs is the river head and h f is the head at the center of the aquifer cell that contains the river reach the river cell w 2 h w p is the wetted perimeter of the cross section formally eq 1 expresses darcy s law for flow in a vertical direction k u e u is referred to as the leakance coefficient λ u and it has dimension inverse of a time c riv has dimension of transmissivity i e area per time clearly as shown in fig 1 the direction of flow at the sides is certainly not vertical and in the case of a rectangular cross section it is actually horizontal so what modflow does see fig 3 is to fold the sides flat and makes the flow through the sides to be fictitiously vertical one might say that modflow thinks at least implicitly through eq 1 that seepage from a river occurs only vertically through the bottom an artificially larger bottom of the river there is no discussion in modflow s report on how one proceeds from the actual wetted perimeter in fig 2 a to the river width in the rectangular cross section in fig 2b we might assume since the sides in fig 2b are impermeable that the effective width is equal to the wetted perimeter even though the original modflow report dates back to 1988 still currently in most widely used commercial groundwater models the seepage is calculated by eq 1 it is useful to quote the original modflow document the model developers were aware of the assumptions they were making and provided plenty of warnings for the eventual users in general however it should be recognized that formulation of a single conductance term to account for a three dimensional flow process is inherently an empirical exercise and that adjustment during calibration is almost always required equation 1 normally provides an acceptable approximation of stream aquifer interaction over a certain range of aquifer head values mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 pages 6 1 6 6 confirming these warnings rushton 2007 states the modflow approach assumes that head losses between the stream and the aquifer node representing the stream are limited to those across the streambed itself fine grid model solutions show that typically less than one third of the loss occurs across the streambed the remaining loss is due to the converging flows i e the turning factor morel seytoux 2009 in the aquifer in the vicinity of the river channel 2 2 mike she on page 203 of mike she s manual mike she 2013 it is stated mike she assumes that the primary exchange between the river and the aquifer takes place through the river banks for more detail on the river aquifer exchange see groundwater exchange with mike 11 v 1p 207 in the case of mike she to calculate the seepage the cross section of the river is assumed to be triangular of course for a triangular cross section there is no bottom so flow has to be from the sides it is true that to calculate the surface flow in the river reach a correct cross section is used in mike she see fig 4 however to calculate seepage the triangular cross section is still assumed the contrast could not be sharper between modflow and mike she whereas in one model flow is strictly through the bottom in the other it is strictly through the sides we have provided the example of two different widely used models that describe the process of seepage in fundamentally different ways this raises a question given that these leakance coefficients are calibrated does it matter if approximate equations are used to estimate seepage ultimately regardless of the assumptions made to justify the leakance coefficient used in eq 1 it is the same identical equation which is used after calibration of the leakance coefficient though the equation has the same form the geometric representation is very different for the wetted perimeter extent of river penetration into the aquifer water stage aquifer thickness and the pattern of the flow lines these are still artifacts of the conceptualization 2 3 hydrogeosphere on pages 27 28 therrien et al 2012 it is stated the second method is more general because it does not assume continuity of hydraulic head between two domains but uses a darcy flux relation to transfer water from one domain to the other the darcy flux is computed from the hydraulic head difference between two domains and assumes that they are separated by a possibly thin layer of porous material across which water exchange occurs in a similar vein on page 72 therrien et al 2012 it is stated river nodes can be used to simulate fluid flow into or out of the domain for a given node i the flow rate is given by q i c riv h i h riv 3 59 where c riv is an equivalent conductance l2t 1 for the river node and h r i v is the river hydraulic head assuming the river bed acts as a semi impervious layer the equivalence conductance c riv is given by c r i v k b e d l b e d w r c h l r c h 3 60 where k bed is the river bed conductivity lt 1 l b e d is the river bed thickness l w rch is the width of the reach l and l rch is the length of the reach l this is exactly the same approach as in modflow 3 mitigation of conceptual limitations by calibration of parameters nature is very secretive and this is especially true when it comes to what stands below the earth surface what are the values of hydraulic conductivity here and there within a water table aquifer is one justified to calibrate such parameters that cannot be measured the main distinction in our mind is whether the parameter to be calibrated has itself a physical meaning hydraulic conductivity is a parameter that has a physical meaning air entry capillary pressure has a physical meaning specific yield effective porosity has a physical meaning these are parameters that are not a combination of many factors they are simple intrinsic parameters on the other hand the leakance coefficient is a very complex parameter that depends on other unknown parameters depends particularly upon a variety of circumstances such as the curvature of the streamlines leading from the river wetted perimeter to the location of a head at a node in an aquifer cell and upon the size of the grid one could refer to it as an integrated physical conductance and declare it a physical parameter as well the main difference compared to an intrinsic parameter such as hydraulic conductivity is that its value is changing with the factors that define it the hydraulic conductivity in one particular location is not a function of the rate of pumping in a nearby well or whether the seepage connection between the river and the aquifer is saturated or unsaturated thus over a range of historical observations it is legitimate to calibrate a single value however it can be problematic to calibrate the leakance coefficient as a single value over a long period of historical values of aquifer heads and river stages it is as mcdonald and harbaugh have clearly stated essentially an empirical coefficient if a model in its structure has become dependent upon such parameter it will need to be calibrated and it will be used within an empirical internal structure the problem is the legitimacy of such parameters for predictive purposes for the future it is quite reasonable to consider that a calibrated hydraulic conductivity over past historical observations can be used in a model to make future predictions when management strategies have changed when the weather has changed when new surface reservoirs have been built when more wells have been drilled etc can the same be said of the leakance coefficient 4 proposed alternative it is possible that an empirical model such as eq 1 may appear accurate as judged by comparison with historical observations of aquifer heads and river discharges thus one can proceed to use it for predictions into the future and hope for the best an alternative is to change the internal structure of the model to account more physically with the actual stream aquifer interaction another alternative which is more practical is to introduce the improved physical changes without changing the internal structure of the model this was done in a recent article morel seytoux and miller 2016 where the leakance coefficient is calibrated in a separate physically based analytical model so that the internal structure of modflow is unchanged the value of the leakance coefficient is input to modflow by the user as it is currently done but a separate computer routine determines the leakance coefficient based on a more physical description of the interaction 5 can river penetration be neglected is a constant value of the leakance coefficient adequate the two major problems with the empirical leakance coefficient are that 1 there are no guidelines on how to estimate it so it is usually obtained by calibration and 2 it is assumed that it is constant in time it does not vary with the surrounding conditions whether the river is in flood or recession whether the weather is changing whether additional wells will be added and pump in the future etc previous work morel seytoux and miller 2016 has demonstrated that it is possible to derive an exact analytically derived physically based leakance coefficient it uses the analytically derived safe dimensionless conductance γ defined as q s 2 l k h h δ h adj where the total seepage discharge q s has been determined analytically for details see morel seytoux 2009 morel seytoux et al 2014 morel seytoux and miller 2016 l is the length of the river reach k h is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity h is the water stage and δ h a d j is the head in a cell adjacent to the river cell at a far distance1 measured with datum at the river bottom the leakance coefficient is related to several physical parameters through the equation morel seytoux and miller 2016 3 λ elc 2 k h w p γ 1 g d aq γ where λ elc is an exact leakance coefficient k h is the aquifer horizontal conductivity w p is the wetted perimeter of the river cross section γ is the analytically derived safe dimensionless conductance which accounts for factors such as normalized wetted perimeter wetted perimeter saturated aquifer thickness extent of river penetration in the aquifer water depth saturated aquifer thickness degree of anisotropy ratio of vertical conductivity over horizontal conductivity g is the river cell size i e width and d aq is the average aquifer saturated thickness within the river cell from water table top to bedrock at aquifer bottom in eq 3 a number of variables change with time the wetted perimeter changes as the water stage varies as the water table aquifer head and the river stage change with time the saturated aquifer thickness changes for the purpose of this illustration because parameter values are set exactly the estimation of the saturated aquifer thickness is chosen as d a q d b r b 0 5 h δ h f where d brb is the aquifer thickness below the river bottom and δ h f is the head in the river cell measured with datum at the river bottom in practice one does not know the saturated thickness of the aquifer below the riverbed only a value in the vicinity of the river the safe dimensionless conductance also changes as the wetted perimeter and the degree of penetration both change thus it is demonstrated that an arbitrary or calibrated constant leakance coefficient misrepresents the reality and will lead to errors of estimation of the seepage amounts the structure of eq 3 would suffice to prove that point the purpose of the following demonstration with numerical examples is to provide for a simple situation the order of magnitude of errors in estimation of seepage that might result from using a constant leakance coefficient the case for purpose of illustration is chosen simple enough so that the interpretation of the results does not become too complicated in an actual large scale regional case that particular river reach would be embedded within a system involving many finite difference cells possibly thousands of them the heads in the adjacent cells would be conditioned by what happens in the entire system due to pumping here and there recharge evapotranspiration from the crops river diversion into canals etc the river and the river cell would react to those heads conditioned by a myriad of decision variables through the system precisely as is described here thus the differences that we observe in these numerical examples are representative of what would happen in a real system fig 5 shows a schematic cross section of a river reach in saturated hydraulic connection with a water table aquifer the system consists of a river and a water table aquifer the aquifer is shown divided between three aquifer cells the cell that contains the river the river cell plus two adjacent cells below the river there is a mound and the water table at least touches the bottom of the river or is higher beyond the banks of the river the phreatic surface head could be above or below the river head the system is subject to two external excitations the river stage h and the head in the adjacent aquifer cells h adj or δ h adj if measured from the river bottom they form the boundary conditions both vary with time any head variable preceded by the symbol δ or the capital greek letter delta means that it is measured with the datum at the river bottom 5 1 example number 1 the chosen excitations are displayed in tables 1 and 2 they are meant to represent a rise in the river water stage then a decline as would happen during a flood event then a more gradual decline follows similar to a typical recession during a dry summer the purpose was to check that the algorithm to determine seepage could handle these different situations the values for δ h adj are chosen to display abrupt changes in the values of head in the adjacent cell to demonstrate that the algorithm can handle such sharp changes in boundary conditions without leading to instabilities in addition it makes it easier to interpret the response of the system the responses are primarily the head in the river cell the aquifer cell that contains the river reach the seepage rate from the river and the leakance coefficient the parameters of the system are for specific yield ϕ e effective porosity 0 2 for horizontal conductivity k h 10 m day saturated aquifer thickness below the river bottom d brb 15 m degree of anisotropy k v k h 0 1 grid size g 140 m total river length l t 40 km and river width w 2 b 20 m the extent of river penetration is h d aq the aquifer thickness varies with river stage and heads in the river cell and adjacent cells in either numerical example 1 or 2 there is no actual clogging layer in the river bed in scenario 1 safe approach the sides are not flattened and flow is not assumed to take place solely in a vertical fashion through a completely horizontal clogging layer extent of penetration varies with the water stage and the aquifer saturated thickness in scenario 2 the wetted perimeter of the cross section is accounted properly but it is flattened into a flat horizontal line see fig 3 extent of penetration is zero this is an incorrect simplification of the safe approach still the variation of the wetted perimeter with time is accounted for in the estimation of the c riv coefficient as it is for scenario 1 scenario 3 considers only vertical flow through the bottom but does not account for the contribution of the sides to the estimation of the wetted perimeter extent of penetration is zero this is not a very coherent scenario and hopefully rarely used in practice it preserves the head but not the wetted perimeter for this reason few results are shown for this scenario scenarios 4 and 5 reproduce the situation for most groundwater models e g modflow where a constant value of the leakance coefficient is used in scenario 1 the leakance coefficient varies between a maximum value of 0 71 per day and a minimum of 0 24 as shown in fig 7 for the first numerical example for scenario 4 the value of the leakance coefficient is chosen high 0 7 per day and in scenario 5 it is chosen low as 0 24 fig 6 displays the calculated seepage values under the external excitations provided in tables 1 and 2 for scenarios 1 2 4 and 5 comparing results for scenarios 1 and 2 whether in the case of seepage or aquifer return flow with the added effect of penetration the exchange rate is higher with scenario 1 this is amplified in this case as a result of anisotropy the side fraction of the wetted perimeter varies as stage in the river varies but it is of the order 2 h w p h b h 2 12 namely 17 one might have expected a ratio of discharges on the order of 0 17 k h 1 0 17 k v k v 0 17 10 0 83 1 1 2 53 compared to the case of no penetration scenario 2 however it is much smaller than that providing evidence of numerous compensation factors for example looking at fig 6 at time 10 days where the ratio is one of the highest it is only 3 0 2 0 1 5 again at time 35 days where it is again one of the highest it is only about 3 3 2 4 1 4 interestingly scenarios 4 and 5 do better than scenario 2 this is understandable because a constant leakance coefficient possibly obtained by calibration accounts in a statistical sense on the average for the degree of penetration which is completely neglected in scenario 2 however the better agreement with scenario 1 is not uniform for example scenario 4 with a high leakance coefficient 0 7 does very well during the flood hydrograph of river stage but does poorly during the dry recession between days 35 50 on the other hand scenario 5 with a low leakance coefficient 0 24 does better during those same days but much worse otherwise in other words one cannot expect a constant leakance coefficient to match well the time evolution of seepage throughout fig 7 shows the variation of the leakance coefficients with the scenarios one can see that the leakance coefficients ratio between scenarios 1 and 2 is high and can be on the order of as much as 0 7 0 25 2 8 at day 12 but as low as 0 25 0 22 1 14 at day 65 in eq 1 the leakance coefficient plays a role as well as the wetted perimeter and the head difference in this particular comparison scenarios 1 and 2 the wetted perimeter is the same thus the difference comes entirely from the two other factors given that the ratios of the seepages are not that high there must be a strong compensation effect that reduces the head difference more in the case of scenario 1 than in the case of scenario 2 this makes sense because when the seepage is high the head of the receiving river cell rises quickly especially when the head of the adjacent cell is high preventing the lateral evacuation toward the adjacent cells the higher rise of the head in the river cell tends to inhibit the seepage fig 8 shows the head difference that drives the seepage between the river and the aquifer below for scenario 1 and for scenario 2 because there is more seepage or aquifer return flow with scenario 1 as a result the head in the river cell rises more rapidly than in the case of scenario 2 and the driving head difference is consequently reduced this is especially the case if the head in the adjacent cell is high and prevents the lateral evacuation of the infiltrated water toward the adjacent cell seepage is still higher but it is constrained the amount of seepage is highly conditioned by what happens in the vicinity of the river but also by what happens in the adjacent cells fig 9 shows the variation of head in the system and it is very complex nevertheless it is very clear that the head in the river cell responds far more readily to the river stage than to the head in the adjacent cell fig 10 shows the values of the coefficient c riv for scenarios 1 2 4 and 5 in the case of scenarios 4 and 5 where the leakance coefficient is constant in time the c riv coefficient does change with time this has to be attributed to the variations with time of the wetted perimeter see eq 1 fig 11 shows the variations of the aquifer thickness with time in response to the variations of the river stage and of the head in the river cell the aquifer thickness does not vary much between the scenarios at least for this example it does not seem that the aquifer thickness would be a major factor to explain the differences in calculated seepage rates for the different scenarios this simple illustration makes the point that 1 the degree of penetration of the river has a non negligible effect on the amount of seepage and 2 very clearly the leakance coefficient is not a constant in time independent of the surrounding conditions 5 2 example 2 a simpler set of excitations to see more clearly through the complex inter relation between heads in the system under transient conditions a simpler less variable set of external conditions was imposed the head in the river is maintained constant at 3 m and the heads in the adjacent cells vary as a succession of pulses this example is provided as appendix c with the online supporting information 6 discussion it must be emphasized that the proposed alternative is primarily for large scale regional studies e g hanson 2017 woolfenden and nishikawa 2014 cdm smith 2013 when the water table aquifer layer is treated as a single calculation layer the conductivity within the river cell is uniform and the flow in the system is treated as if essentially horizontal dupuit forchheimer approximation whereas the flow may be essentially horizontal in most cells of the system it cannot be true in the vicinity of the river see fig 1 the proposed approach corrects that oversimplification for the river cell while that approximation remains valid away from the river in the adjacent cells in very local studies if very refined grids are used both in the horizontal plane and in the vertical direction the boundary condition at the interface between the river and the aquifer is one of a prescribed head and not a third type boundary condition that uses a leakance coefficient even then it would be numerically efficient to use the safe exact leakance coefficient and avoid the fine discretization it is worth noting in fig 9 that the head in the river cell responds quickly to the water stage i e seepage inflow much more slowly to the adjacent cell head if only because it is far away the seepage rate depends upon what happens very locally and indirectly on what happens farther away in a large scale regional system consisting of thousands of cells solving for all the variables at the same time in a huge matrix of equations can be costly in computer time inaccurate and unstable another strategy is to break the system into two parts solve them separately and iterate between them currently the break is done with the head in the river cell because there is no explicit analytical relation between river stage and the adjacent cell independent of head in the river cell still that iterative procedure is often tricky and can be unstable fig 9 suggests strongly that this is not the right place for the break it is intuitive that the break between the two parts should be where the mutual dependence is least so that iteration convergence is rapid if a relation exists between the water stage and the head in the adjacent cell independent of the river cell head as demonstrated in this article appendices a and b it is better to choose for the variables in the iteration the water stage and the adjacent cell head because that head depending on so much taking place in the system away from the river is much less sensitive to the seepage flow than the river cell head the safe dimensionless conductance has been determined analytically for a few cross sectional shapes trapezoidal rectangular triangular and quasi elliptical it was found that provided the normalized wetted perimeter and the degree of penetration are the same the shape has a minimal impact on the value of the safe dimensionless conductance thus for a real cross section that naturally deviates from these standard geometrical shapes again provided that the normalized wetted perimeter and the degree of penetration are the same it is accurate to use the available formulae for the safe dimensionless conductance morel seytoux et al 2014 miracapillo and morel seytoux 2014 morel seytoux and miller 2016 the actual cross section shape of a river is naturally different from a theoretical geometric shape whereas such characterization may be useful to estimate the routing along the river it has no bearing on the calculation of the seepage because in its estimation by eq 1 only the wetted perimeter and the water depth matter one might ask how often should the leakance coefficient be updated during transient simulations how much more computational cost it would induce since the formulae to calculate the safe dimensionless conductance are simple algebraic formulae e g morel seytoux et al 2014 morel seytoux and miller 2016 there is essentially no additional computer cost even if under transient simulations the leakance coefficient has to be updated with every time step typically aquifer parameters such as horizontal hydraulic conductivity and degree of anisotropy are calibrated in addition the leakance coefficient is also calibrated as if it were an independent parameter what our work has demonstrated is that actually they are not independent and this is obvious from eq 3 thus when these parameters are calibrated eq 3 should be used as a constraint on the optimization algorithm to minimize the deviations between observed and calculated values ignoring that relation will lead to an over parameterized and thus less reliable statistical model for future predictions use of the empirical leakance coefficient precludes the possibility to estimate properly the condition leading to loss of the saturated connection incipient desaturation morel seytoux et al 2015 and a simple estimation of transient seepage under an unsaturated connection in section 5 1 it is was stated that the differences that we observe in these numerical examples are representative of what would happen in a real system indeed it was found that compensation effects made the difference between modflow and the proposed alternative smaller than expected there was a perfectly sound physical reason for that fact as explained in section 5 1 there is no doubt that in large scale real systems numerous compensation effects will occur that minimize the impact of conceptual errors present in the models testing of the proposed approach in a second step on a real system would shed light on that possibility the authors would be quite willing to cooperate with experienced large scale model users to carry that second step on a real system with which they are familiar 7 conclusion models will never be perfect but they are very useful nevertheless with some effort they can be marginally improved such improvement is suggested currently used models tend to calibrate a leakance coefficient constant in time for a particular reach of river it is shown in this article by demonstration with an analytical solution that the leakance coefficient when related to physical parameters varies with the degree of penetration and thus with time neglecting that variation leads to errors in the calculation of the seepage discharges the suggested approach to estimate the leakance coefficient can be implemented without changing the internal structure of a code such as modflow thus it is highly practical instead of entering an arbitrary value for the leakance coefficient or a calibrated one in the input file one enters the leakance coefficient as calculated from eq 3 for other codes such as iwfm mike she asmwin hydrogeosphere pihm etc the relation may be slightly different from the one derived specifically for modflow morel seytoux and miller 2016 however such relations can be derived for the other codes

7107,due to the dynamic flow exchange between a stream and a connected water table aquifer a physically based hydrologic model is an important tool for the design of conjunctive use of surface and ground waters it is needed to develop sound plans for sustainable use of the groundwater with minimal undesirable effects this article reports an investigation of the component module that describes the stream aquifer flow exchange in several groundwater simulators the study indicates that the module may not have a solid physical basis when used in large scale regional studies to estimate the stream aquifer flow exchange the component relies upon an empirical parameter known as the leakance coefficient it is demonstrated that neglecting river penetration of the aquifer can lead to non negligible errors in estimation of seepage in addition the leakance coefficient dimension inverse of a time is not constant in time but varies with the conditions in the river and in the surrounding aquifer a potential practical and simple alternative is presented keywords quantitative estimation of seepage stream aquifer interaction leakance coefficient dimensionless conductance relation between leakance coefficient and dimensionless conductance and other physical parameters time variation of leakance coefficient with various environmental factors 1 introduction this article has two goals first it describes how some widely used models estimate the flow exchange between rivers and hydraulically connected water table aquifers that estimation of the seepage actual seepage if positive and aquifer return flow if negative depends upon a parameter the leakance coefficient the nature of that coefficient is highly approximate the second goal is to propose an alternative by using a physically based and analytically derived expression for the leakance coefficient numerical examples demonstrate that the use of that exact leakance coefficient provides a more accurate estimate for the seepage most groundwater or integrated surface groundwater models state that they have a physical basis to a large extent they do for example in a recent contract with the state water resources control board of california the usgs states due to the relationship between surface water flow and groundwater use a scientifically defensible surface water groundwater model is a crucial component and transparent management strategy for the rrw russian river watershed usgs 2016 whereas the goal is correct i e that the code should be scientifically defensible the question is whether modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and many other codes meet that criterion for all components of their code in this document we look closely at the particular component module that estimates the flow exchange between a river and a hydraulically connected water table aquifer given the complexity of nature it is not possible to represent correctly every inch of soil or aquifer material thus models by necessity are and always will be largely conceptual for example finite differences or finite elements approximations are typically used to solve the original governing partial differential equations if fine grids are used in space and time the numerical solutions to the finite differences or finite elements approximations can give accurate solutions however our experience is that extremely fine grids can be required to obtain reasonable accuracy for the estimation of seepage morel seytoux et al 2014 miracapillo and morel seytoux et al 2015 morel seytoux and miller 2016 in fig 1 the grid size is approximately 20 calculation cells in the vertical direction and 50 cells in the horizontal direction for a total 1000 cells previous work has shown morel seytoux et al 2014 that to calculate the seepage discharge within a relative accuracy of 4 using modflow the grid size would have to be of the order of 28x10 280 calculation cells for large scale regional studies the size of the cells in the horizontal direction is easily 500 m and in the vertical direction it is the thickness of the water table aquifer which is often in excess of 50 m whereas the width of the river or creek is often less than 20 m yet in the commonly used groundwater models the aquifer cell that includes the river the river cell is not divided into calculation subcells so that the calculation grid size is essentially 1x1 for that cell the size of the calculation cell is the full size of the river cell with size g in the horizontal direction and the saturated aquifer thickness in the vertical direction d aq for numerical example 1 g 140 m d aq 15 m while the river bottom width is 2 b 20 m the width of the river cell is much larger than the width of the river the analytical solution to which the numerical results using modflow were compared to estimate seepage was obtained exactly using complex variable and potential theories morel seytoux 2009 morel seytoux et al 2014 morel seytoux and miller 2016 in fig 1 the outer boundary condition of a constant head is located at a distance from the river bank which is twice the aquifer thickness that was chosen so that by the time the flow reaches the outer boundary the flow has become essentially horizontal as can be verified in fig 1 when the grid size as needed in practice becomes relatively large the approximations do not represent the proper physics and dynamics of the system but may hopefully provide some reasonably acceptable average values in time and space most of our discussion is focused on large scale regional studies in such studies typically the water table aquifer is treated as a single calculation layer and not subdivided into multiple calculation cells in both horizontal and vertical directions e g hanson 2017 woolfenden and nishikawa 2014 in both cited studies the water table aquifer thickness is of the order of 30 50 m and is treated as a single calculation layer and the cell widths are much larger than the river widths 2 the conceptualization process a comparison between modflow mike she and hydrogeosphere the process of conceptualization is as much an art as a science different modelers have a distinct way of describing reality just as michelangelo and van gogh view and represent the world differently in their paintings in this work we consider the way modflow and mike she mike she 2013 describe conceptualize imagine paint the process of seepage understood in an algebraic sense i e positive if gain for the aquifer and negative if gain for the river aquifer return flow 2 1 modflow the following description and discussion applies also essentially to iwfm dogrul 2012 pihm kumar et al 2009 asmwin kinzelbach and rausch 1995 and hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2012 in the case of modflow let us consider a rectangular cross section the following discussion remains valid if the cross section is not rectangular according to modflow the equation to calculate the seepage discharge from the river is 1 q s k u e u l w 2 h h s h f λ u l w p h s h f c riv h s h f where q s is the seepage discharge volume per time k u is the hydraulic conductivity of a clogging layer that may not exist e u is its thickness l is the length of the river reach w is the width of the river h is the river water stage i e maximum water depth hs is the river head and h f is the head at the center of the aquifer cell that contains the river reach the river cell w 2 h w p is the wetted perimeter of the cross section formally eq 1 expresses darcy s law for flow in a vertical direction k u e u is referred to as the leakance coefficient λ u and it has dimension inverse of a time c riv has dimension of transmissivity i e area per time clearly as shown in fig 1 the direction of flow at the sides is certainly not vertical and in the case of a rectangular cross section it is actually horizontal so what modflow does see fig 3 is to fold the sides flat and makes the flow through the sides to be fictitiously vertical one might say that modflow thinks at least implicitly through eq 1 that seepage from a river occurs only vertically through the bottom an artificially larger bottom of the river there is no discussion in modflow s report on how one proceeds from the actual wetted perimeter in fig 2 a to the river width in the rectangular cross section in fig 2b we might assume since the sides in fig 2b are impermeable that the effective width is equal to the wetted perimeter even though the original modflow report dates back to 1988 still currently in most widely used commercial groundwater models the seepage is calculated by eq 1 it is useful to quote the original modflow document the model developers were aware of the assumptions they were making and provided plenty of warnings for the eventual users in general however it should be recognized that formulation of a single conductance term to account for a three dimensional flow process is inherently an empirical exercise and that adjustment during calibration is almost always required equation 1 normally provides an acceptable approximation of stream aquifer interaction over a certain range of aquifer head values mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 pages 6 1 6 6 confirming these warnings rushton 2007 states the modflow approach assumes that head losses between the stream and the aquifer node representing the stream are limited to those across the streambed itself fine grid model solutions show that typically less than one third of the loss occurs across the streambed the remaining loss is due to the converging flows i e the turning factor morel seytoux 2009 in the aquifer in the vicinity of the river channel 2 2 mike she on page 203 of mike she s manual mike she 2013 it is stated mike she assumes that the primary exchange between the river and the aquifer takes place through the river banks for more detail on the river aquifer exchange see groundwater exchange with mike 11 v 1p 207 in the case of mike she to calculate the seepage the cross section of the river is assumed to be triangular of course for a triangular cross section there is no bottom so flow has to be from the sides it is true that to calculate the surface flow in the river reach a correct cross section is used in mike she see fig 4 however to calculate seepage the triangular cross section is still assumed the contrast could not be sharper between modflow and mike she whereas in one model flow is strictly through the bottom in the other it is strictly through the sides we have provided the example of two different widely used models that describe the process of seepage in fundamentally different ways this raises a question given that these leakance coefficients are calibrated does it matter if approximate equations are used to estimate seepage ultimately regardless of the assumptions made to justify the leakance coefficient used in eq 1 it is the same identical equation which is used after calibration of the leakance coefficient though the equation has the same form the geometric representation is very different for the wetted perimeter extent of river penetration into the aquifer water stage aquifer thickness and the pattern of the flow lines these are still artifacts of the conceptualization 2 3 hydrogeosphere on pages 27 28 therrien et al 2012 it is stated the second method is more general because it does not assume continuity of hydraulic head between two domains but uses a darcy flux relation to transfer water from one domain to the other the darcy flux is computed from the hydraulic head difference between two domains and assumes that they are separated by a possibly thin layer of porous material across which water exchange occurs in a similar vein on page 72 therrien et al 2012 it is stated river nodes can be used to simulate fluid flow into or out of the domain for a given node i the flow rate is given by q i c riv h i h riv 3 59 where c riv is an equivalent conductance l2t 1 for the river node and h r i v is the river hydraulic head assuming the river bed acts as a semi impervious layer the equivalence conductance c riv is given by c r i v k b e d l b e d w r c h l r c h 3 60 where k bed is the river bed conductivity lt 1 l b e d is the river bed thickness l w rch is the width of the reach l and l rch is the length of the reach l this is exactly the same approach as in modflow 3 mitigation of conceptual limitations by calibration of parameters nature is very secretive and this is especially true when it comes to what stands below the earth surface what are the values of hydraulic conductivity here and there within a water table aquifer is one justified to calibrate such parameters that cannot be measured the main distinction in our mind is whether the parameter to be calibrated has itself a physical meaning hydraulic conductivity is a parameter that has a physical meaning air entry capillary pressure has a physical meaning specific yield effective porosity has a physical meaning these are parameters that are not a combination of many factors they are simple intrinsic parameters on the other hand the leakance coefficient is a very complex parameter that depends on other unknown parameters depends particularly upon a variety of circumstances such as the curvature of the streamlines leading from the river wetted perimeter to the location of a head at a node in an aquifer cell and upon the size of the grid one could refer to it as an integrated physical conductance and declare it a physical parameter as well the main difference compared to an intrinsic parameter such as hydraulic conductivity is that its value is changing with the factors that define it the hydraulic conductivity in one particular location is not a function of the rate of pumping in a nearby well or whether the seepage connection between the river and the aquifer is saturated or unsaturated thus over a range of historical observations it is legitimate to calibrate a single value however it can be problematic to calibrate the leakance coefficient as a single value over a long period of historical values of aquifer heads and river stages it is as mcdonald and harbaugh have clearly stated essentially an empirical coefficient if a model in its structure has become dependent upon such parameter it will need to be calibrated and it will be used within an empirical internal structure the problem is the legitimacy of such parameters for predictive purposes for the future it is quite reasonable to consider that a calibrated hydraulic conductivity over past historical observations can be used in a model to make future predictions when management strategies have changed when the weather has changed when new surface reservoirs have been built when more wells have been drilled etc can the same be said of the leakance coefficient 4 proposed alternative it is possible that an empirical model such as eq 1 may appear accurate as judged by comparison with historical observations of aquifer heads and river discharges thus one can proceed to use it for predictions into the future and hope for the best an alternative is to change the internal structure of the model to account more physically with the actual stream aquifer interaction another alternative which is more practical is to introduce the improved physical changes without changing the internal structure of the model this was done in a recent article morel seytoux and miller 2016 where the leakance coefficient is calibrated in a separate physically based analytical model so that the internal structure of modflow is unchanged the value of the leakance coefficient is input to modflow by the user as it is currently done but a separate computer routine determines the leakance coefficient based on a more physical description of the interaction 5 can river penetration be neglected is a constant value of the leakance coefficient adequate the two major problems with the empirical leakance coefficient are that 1 there are no guidelines on how to estimate it so it is usually obtained by calibration and 2 it is assumed that it is constant in time it does not vary with the surrounding conditions whether the river is in flood or recession whether the weather is changing whether additional wells will be added and pump in the future etc previous work morel seytoux and miller 2016 has demonstrated that it is possible to derive an exact analytically derived physically based leakance coefficient it uses the analytically derived safe dimensionless conductance γ defined as q s 2 l k h h δ h adj where the total seepage discharge q s has been determined analytically for details see morel seytoux 2009 morel seytoux et al 2014 morel seytoux and miller 2016 l is the length of the river reach k h is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity h is the water stage and δ h a d j is the head in a cell adjacent to the river cell at a far distance1 measured with datum at the river bottom the leakance coefficient is related to several physical parameters through the equation morel seytoux and miller 2016 3 λ elc 2 k h w p γ 1 g d aq γ where λ elc is an exact leakance coefficient k h is the aquifer horizontal conductivity w p is the wetted perimeter of the river cross section γ is the analytically derived safe dimensionless conductance which accounts for factors such as normalized wetted perimeter wetted perimeter saturated aquifer thickness extent of river penetration in the aquifer water depth saturated aquifer thickness degree of anisotropy ratio of vertical conductivity over horizontal conductivity g is the river cell size i e width and d aq is the average aquifer saturated thickness within the river cell from water table top to bedrock at aquifer bottom in eq 3 a number of variables change with time the wetted perimeter changes as the water stage varies as the water table aquifer head and the river stage change with time the saturated aquifer thickness changes for the purpose of this illustration because parameter values are set exactly the estimation of the saturated aquifer thickness is chosen as d a q d b r b 0 5 h δ h f where d brb is the aquifer thickness below the river bottom and δ h f is the head in the river cell measured with datum at the river bottom in practice one does not know the saturated thickness of the aquifer below the riverbed only a value in the vicinity of the river the safe dimensionless conductance also changes as the wetted perimeter and the degree of penetration both change thus it is demonstrated that an arbitrary or calibrated constant leakance coefficient misrepresents the reality and will lead to errors of estimation of the seepage amounts the structure of eq 3 would suffice to prove that point the purpose of the following demonstration with numerical examples is to provide for a simple situation the order of magnitude of errors in estimation of seepage that might result from using a constant leakance coefficient the case for purpose of illustration is chosen simple enough so that the interpretation of the results does not become too complicated in an actual large scale regional case that particular river reach would be embedded within a system involving many finite difference cells possibly thousands of them the heads in the adjacent cells would be conditioned by what happens in the entire system due to pumping here and there recharge evapotranspiration from the crops river diversion into canals etc the river and the river cell would react to those heads conditioned by a myriad of decision variables through the system precisely as is described here thus the differences that we observe in these numerical examples are representative of what would happen in a real system fig 5 shows a schematic cross section of a river reach in saturated hydraulic connection with a water table aquifer the system consists of a river and a water table aquifer the aquifer is shown divided between three aquifer cells the cell that contains the river the river cell plus two adjacent cells below the river there is a mound and the water table at least touches the bottom of the river or is higher beyond the banks of the river the phreatic surface head could be above or below the river head the system is subject to two external excitations the river stage h and the head in the adjacent aquifer cells h adj or δ h adj if measured from the river bottom they form the boundary conditions both vary with time any head variable preceded by the symbol δ or the capital greek letter delta means that it is measured with the datum at the river bottom 5 1 example number 1 the chosen excitations are displayed in tables 1 and 2 they are meant to represent a rise in the river water stage then a decline as would happen during a flood event then a more gradual decline follows similar to a typical recession during a dry summer the purpose was to check that the algorithm to determine seepage could handle these different situations the values for δ h adj are chosen to display abrupt changes in the values of head in the adjacent cell to demonstrate that the algorithm can handle such sharp changes in boundary conditions without leading to instabilities in addition it makes it easier to interpret the response of the system the responses are primarily the head in the river cell the aquifer cell that contains the river reach the seepage rate from the river and the leakance coefficient the parameters of the system are for specific yield ϕ e effective

river width w 2 b 20 m the extent of river penetration is h d aq the aquifer thickness varies with river stage and heads in the river cell and adjacent cells in either numerical example 1 or 2 there is no actual clogging layer in the river bed in scenario 1 safe approach the sides are not flattened and flow is not assumed to take place solely in a vertical fashion through a completely horizontal clogging layer extent of penetration varies with the water stage and the aquifer saturated thickness in scenario 2 the wetted perimeter of the cross section is accounted properly but it is flattened into a flat horizontal line see fig 3 extent of penetration is zero this is an incorrect simplification of the safe approach still the variation of the wetted perimeter with time is accounted for in the estimation of the c riv coefficient as it is for scenario 1 scenario 3 considers only vertical flow through the bottom but does not account for the contribution of the sides to the estimation of the wetted perimeter extent of penetration is zero this is not a very coherent scenario and hopefully rarely used in practice it preserves the head but not the wetted perimeter for this reason few results are shown for this scenario scenarios 4 and 5 reproduce the situation for most groundwater models e g modflow where a constant value of the leakance coefficient is used in scenario 1 the leakance coefficient varies between a maximum value of 0 71 per day and a minimum of 0 24 as shown in fig 7 for the first numerical example for scenario 4 the value of the leakance coefficient is chosen high 0 7 per day and in scenario 5 it is chosen low as 0 24 fig 6 displays the calculated seepage values under the external excitations provided in tables 1 and 2 for scenarios 1 2 4 and 5 comparing results for scenarios 1 and 2 whether in the case of seepage or aquifer return flow with the added effect of penetration the exchange rate is higher with scenario 1 this is amplified in this case as a result of anisotropy the side fraction of the wetted perimeter varies as stage in the river varies but it is of the order 2 h w p h b h 2 12 namely 17 one might have expected a ratio of discharges on the order of 0 17 k h 1 0 17 k v k v 0 17 10 0 83 1 1 2 53 compared to the case of no penetration scenario 2 however it is much smaller than that providing evidence of numerous compensation factors for example looking at fig 6 at time 10 days where the ratio is one of the highest it is only 3 0 2 0 1 5 again at time 35 days where it is again one of the highest it is only about 3 3 2 4 1 4 interestingly scenarios 4 and 5 do better than scenario 2 this is understandable because a constant leakance coefficient possibly obtained by calibration accounts in a statistical sense on the average for the degree of penetration which is completely neglected in scenario 2 however the better agreement with scenario 1 is not uniform for example scenario 4 with a high leakance coefficient 0 7 does very well during the flood hydrograph of river stage but does poorly during the dry recession between days 35 50 on the other hand scenario 5 with a low leakance coefficient 0 24 does better during those same days but much worse otherwise in other words one cannot expect a constant leakance coefficient to match well the time evolution of seepage throughout fig 7 shows the variation of the leakance coefficients with the scenarios one can see that the leakance coefficients ratio between scenarios 1 and 2 is high and can be on the order of as much as 0 7 0 25 2 8 at day 12 but as low as 0 25 0 22 1 14 at day 65 in eq 1 the leakance coefficient plays a role as well as the wetted perimeter and the head difference in this particular comparison scenarios 1 and 2 the wetted perimeter is the same thus the difference comes entirely from the two other factors given that the ratios of the seepages are not that high there must be a strong compensation effect that reduces the head difference more in the case of scenario 1 than in the case of scenario 2 this makes sense because when the seepage is high the head of the receiving river cell rises quickly especially when the head of the adjacent cell is high preventing the lateral evacuation toward the adjacent cells the higher rise of the head in the river cell tends to inhibit the seepage fig 8 shows the head difference that drives the seepage between the river and the aquifer below for scenario 1 and for scenario 2 because there is more seepage or aquifer return flow with scenario 1 as a result the head in the river cell rises more rapidly than in the case of scenario 2 and the driving head difference is consequently reduced this is especially the case if the head in the adjacent cell is high and prevents the lateral evacuation of the infiltrated water toward the adjacent cell seepage is still higher but it is constrained the amount of seepage is highly conditioned by what happens in the vicinity of the river but also by what happens in the adjacent cells fig 9 shows the variation of head in the system and it is very complex nevertheless it is very clear that the head in the river cell responds far more readily to the river stage than to the head in the adjacent cell fig 10 shows the values of the coefficient c riv for scenarios 1 2 4 and 5 in the case of scenarios 4 and 5 where the leakance coefficient is constant in time the c riv coefficient does change with time this has to be attributed to the variations with time of the wetted perimeter see eq 1 fig 11 shows the variations of the aquifer thickness with time in response to the variations of the river stage and of the head in the river cell the aquifer thickness does not vary much between the scenarios at least for this example it does not seem that the aquifer thickness would be a major factor to explain the differences in calculated seepage rates for the different scenarios this simple illustration makes the point that 1 the degree of penetration of the river has a non negligible effect on the amount of seepage and 2 very clearly the leakance coefficient is not a constant in time independent of the surrounding conditions 5 2 example 2 a simpler set of excitations to see more clearly through the complex inter relation between heads in the system under transient conditions a simpler less variable set of external conditions was imposed the head in the river is maintained constant at 3 m and the heads in the adjacent cells vary as a succession of pulses this example is provided as appendix c with the online supporting information 6 discussion it must be emphasized that the proposed alternative is primarily for large scale regional studies e g hanson 2017 woolfenden and nishikawa 2014 cdm smith 2013 when the water table aquifer layer is treated as a single calculation layer the conductivity within the river cell is uniform and the flow in the system is treated as if essentially horizontal dupuit forchheimer approximation whereas the flow may be essentially horizontal in most cells of the system it cannot be true in the vicinity of the river see fig 1 the proposed approach corrects that oversimplification for the river cell while that approximation remains valid away from the river in the adjacent cells in very local studies if very refined grids are used both in the horizontal plane and in the vertical direction the boundary condition at the interface between the river and the aquifer is one of a prescribed head and not a third type boundary condition that uses a leakance coefficient even then it would be numerically efficient to use the safe exact leakance coefficient and avoid the fine discretization it is worth noting in fig 9 that the head in the river cell responds quickly to the water stage i e seepage inflow much more slowly to the adjacent cell head if only because it is far away the seepage rate depends upon what happens very locally and indirectly on what happens farther away in a large scale regional system consisting of thousands of cells solving for all the variables at the same time in a huge matrix of equations can be costly in computer time inaccurate and unstable another strategy is to break the system into two parts solve them separately and iterate between them currently the break is done with the head in the river cell because there is no explicit analytical relation between river stage and the adjacent cell independent of head in the river cell still that iterative procedure is often tricky and can be unstable fig 9 suggests strongly that this is not the right place for the break it is intuitive that the break between the two parts should be where the mutual dependence is least so that iteration convergence is rapid if a relation exists between the water stage and the head in the adjacent cell independent of the river cell head as demonstrated in this article appendices a and b it is better to choose for the variables in the iteration the water stage and the adjacent cell head because that head depending on so much taking place in the system away from the river is much less sensitive to the seepage flow than the river cell head the safe dimensionless conductance has been determined analytically for a few cross sectional shapes trapezoidal rectangular triangular and quasi elliptical it was found that provided the normalized wetted perimeter and the degree of penetration are the same the shape has a minimal impact on the value of the safe dimensionless conductance thus for a real cross section that naturally deviates from these standard geometrical shapes again provided that the normalized wetted perimeter and the degree of penetration are the same it is accurate to use the available formulae for the safe dimensionless conductance morel seytoux et al 2014 miracapillo and morel seytoux 2014 morel seytoux and miller 2016 the actual cross section shape of a river is naturally different from a theoretical geometric shape whereas such characterization may be useful to estimate the routing along the river it has no bearing on the calculation of the seepage because in its estimation by eq 1 only the wetted perimeter and the water depth matter one might ask how often should the leakance coefficient be updated during transient simulations how much more computational cost it would induce since the formulae to calculate the safe dimensionless conductance are simple algebraic formulae e g morel seytoux et al 2014 morel seytoux and miller 2016 there is essentially no additional computer cost even if under transient simulations the leakance coefficient has to be updated with every time step typically aquifer parameters such as horizontal hydraulic conductivity and degree of anisotropy are calibrated in addition the leakance coefficient is also calibrated as if it were an independent parameter what our work has demonstrated is that actually they are not independent and this is obvious from eq 3 thus when these parameters are calibrated eq 3 should be used as a constraint on the optimization algorithm to minimize the deviations between observed and calculated values ignoring that relation will lead to an over parameterized and thus less reliable statistical model for future predictions use of the empirical leakance coefficient precludes the possibility to estimate properly the condition leading to loss of the saturated connection incipient desaturation morel seytoux et al 2015 and a simple estimation of transient seepage under an unsaturated connection in section 5 1 it is was stated that the differences that we observe in these numerical examples are representative of what would happen in a real system indeed it was found that compensation effects made the difference between modflow and the proposed alternative smaller than expected there was a perfectly sound physical reason for that fact as explained in section 5 1 there is no doubt that in large scale real systems numerous compensation effects will occur that minimize the impact of conceptual errors present in the models testing of the proposed approach in a second step on a real system would shed light on that possibility the authors would be quite willing to cooperate with experienced large scale model users to carry that second step on a real system with which they are familiar 7 conclusion models will never be perfect but they are very useful nevertheless with some effort they can be marginally improved such improvement is suggested currently used models tend to calibrate a leakance coefficient constant in time for a particular reach of river it is shown in this article by demonstration with an analytical solution that the leakance coefficient when related to physical parameters varies with the degree of penetration and thus with time neglecting that variation leads to errors in the calculation of the seepage discharges the suggested approach to estimate the leakance coefficient can be implemented without changing the internal structure of a code such as modflow thus it is highly practical instead of entering an arbitrary value for the leakance coefficient or a calibrated one in the input file one enters the leakance coefficient as calculated from eq 3 for other codes such as iwfm mike she asmwin hydrogeosphere pihm etc the relation may be slightly different from the one derived specifically for modflow morel seytoux and miller 2016 however such relations can be derived for the other codes

7108,high resolution gridded precipitation products are rare globally particularly below a daily time step yet many hydrological applications require or can be improved by a higher temporal resolution of rainfall data here we present a new 1 km resolution gridded hourly rainfall dataset for great britain gridded estimates of hourly areal rainfall for great britain 1990 2014 ceh gear1hr using data from over 1900 quality controlled rainfall gauges which improves upon the current uk national gridded precipitation datasets at daily time step we extend and automate a quality control qc procedure to permit the use of hourly data for 1990 2014 and independently validate the qc using daily rainfall data and recorded historic events our two tiered validation approach at daily and hourly timescales indicates that spurious extreme values are excluded from the resultant dataset while legitimate values are preserved we use a nearest neighbour interpolation scheme to derive gridded hourly rainfall values at 1 km resolution to temporally disaggregate the ceh gear daily gridded dataset and produce an hourly dataset with consistent daily totals this provides a unique resource for hydrological applications in great britain the ceh gear1hr dataset associated metadata and qc information will be freely available from the environmental information data centre eidc and hosted alongside the daily

gridded hourly precipitation extremes quality control great britain dataset rain gauge 1 introduction recently increased attention has been given to sub daily precipitation observations due to the contribution of intense rainfall events to flash flooding in urban areas and fast responding catchments indeed our ability to address and plan for flash floods has been partly limited by the paucity of available high quality rain gauge data westra et al 2014 several studies have demonstrated the sensitivity and improved performance of hydrological model simulations when driven by precipitation data at a sub daily time step e g finnerty et al 1997 bastola and misra 2013 particularly for small catchments with rapid response times additionally the lack of temporal resolution offered by daily data for direct application in flood forecasting and the need for assessment of the impacts of short duration intense rainfall events on hydrological systems has created a requirement for the improved availability of sub daily precipitation data this was further identified as a need in the world climate research programme grand challenge on extremes alexander et al 2016 and the intense project has taken up the mantle of collecting and quality controlling a global sub daily precipitation dataset www research ncl ac uk intense such datasets are also invaluable for the validation of the new generation of very high resolution convection permitting climate models cpms see prein et al 2015 for a review which offer improved representation of sub daily extreme rainfall e g kendon et al 2012

inputs to national hydrological modelling e g bell et al 2007 yang et al 2014 the assessment of historical climate and its variability e g blenkinsop et al 2008 simpson and jones 2014 becker et al 2013 yu et al 2016 and the assessment of reanalysis and downscaled climate model products e g isotta et al 2015 existing datasets of ground based observations are typically on daily timescales but gridded hourly products offer the potential for enhanced applications in these areas as well as for the verification of quantitative precipitation forecasts satellite products and the validation of cpms radar data offers the required temporal resolution but suffers from errors in the estimation of precipitation magnitude collier 1989 villarini and krajewski 2010 and may lead to reduced performance of hydrological models compared with gauge derived data cole and moore 2009 parkes et al 2013 a number of gridded precipitation products derived from rain gauges are available for the uk and are summarised in table s1 in the supplementary information comprising uk only and europe wide datasets reanalysis data which are created by a data assimilation scheme and models which incorporate observations at 6 12 h time steps may also be used to characterise the observed long term variability of precipitation e g ncep ncar kalnay et al 1996 20cr compo et al 2011 era interim dee et al 2011 however these are typically at coarser spatial resolutions and are not appropriate for most hydrological modelling studies for example rhodes et al 2015 noted that although reanalysis products represent many of the features of large scale precipitation and daily totals over england and wales individual extreme events are less well represented regional reanalyses may address some of the problems associated with coarse scale reanalysis datasets though improved understanding of uncertainties is needed borsche et al 2015 gridded datasets at hourly resolution have been constructed for some regions using a range of methodological approaches although these are typically only for short time periods and often constructed for the calibration and assessment of hydrological models in catchments for example wüest et al 2010 used a dense daily rain gauge network for switzerland for 1992 2003 and disaggregated this to the hourly timescale using radar data to preserve daily totals a similar approach was used by paulat et al 2008 to create a gridded hourly dataset for germany for the period 2001 2004 shen et al 2014 merged over 30 000 hourly gauge observations with satellite data to produce a gridded hourly dataset for china for the 2008 2010 warm seasons an alternative approach was applied by luo et al 2013 who constructed an hourly precipitation grid over the yangtze huai rivers basin in china for the 2007 mei yu season using a direct interpolation method with automated weather station aws data some national scale sub daily datasets have been produced however vormoor and skaugen 2013 developed a 1 km 3 h gridded precipitation dataset for norway using a model simulated hindcast series to disaggregate an existing gridded daily dataset for the period 1957 2010 hourly observations for approximately 2 500 stations in the us have also been interpolated onto a relatively coarse 2 latitude by 2 5 longitude grid higgins et al 1996 and a gridded product created through merging of daily gauges with radar cosgrove et al 2003 up to a resolution of 1 8 for the uk generation of gridded sub daily precipitation data on a catchment scale over limited periods has been performed on an ad hoc basis for the assessment of hydrological models and their input data typically this has been achieved by disaggregating a relatively dense daily rain gauge network using radar e g parkes et al 2013 for the 4062 km2 of the upper severn river cole and moore 2008 for 136 km2 of the river darwen and 212 km2 of the river kent catchments the availability of quality controlled individual hourly rain gauge data for the uk blenkinsop et al 2017 and extended here offers the potential for a more extensive gridded hourly dataset for uk coverage quality control of gauge rainfall data is essential to ensure a high quality product there are many shortcomings of gauge measurement of rainfall including mechanical errors recording errors evaporation from partly filled buckets wind induced under catch and snow effects mcmillan et al 2012 qc procedures can identify some of these errors for example frequent tips upton and rahimi 2003 erroneous extreme values and erroneous dry periods abbott 1986 however qc procedures are unable to identify errors due to undercatch and evaporation therefore the measurements may still not reflect the true amount of rain that fell even after qc checks are completed quality control is typically a manual operation and in some instances quasi automated but still relies heavily on either a final manual inspection or on previously manually identified errors for model training prior to this work analysis of the uk rain gauge data has focussed only on a subset 20 of available rain gauges due to the need for near complete records for climatological analysis and the labour intensive nature of quality controlling such data blenkinsop et al 2017 this paper builds on blenkinsop et al 2017 by i developing additional quality control procedures whose implementation may be automated and applied to all 1900 gauge records and ii using these data to produce a gridded 1 km hourly dataset for the uk for 1990 2014 in section 2 we describe the data sources section 3 describes the extended and automated quality control procedure for the hourly rain gauge data which includes a rule base for the implementation of single site and nearest neighbour gauge checks section 4 details the validation of the automated qc process section 5 describes the resulting gauge dataset section 6 describes the methodological basis for the disaggregation of the daily gridded dataset section 7 assesses the reliability of the hourly gridded dataset and finally in section 8 we discuss the implications and potential applications of this dataset and potential future avenues which could improve the product and be used to investigate the associated uncertainties 2 data 2 1 ceh gear 1 km daily dataset to generate gridded hourly precipitation values we adopt a similar approach to that used in other studies as discussed in section 1 by disaggregating an existing quality controlled validated gridded daily precipitation dataset here we use the ceh gridded estimates of areal rainfall ceh gear dataset keller et al 2015 tanguy et al 2016 which is an open source dataset that provides 1 km gridded estimates of daily and monthly rainfall for great britain and northern ireland from 1890 to 2014 the rainfall estimates in this dataset are derived from uk met office rain gauge observations which were gridded using a natural neighbour interpolation method a smooth weighted version of nearest neighbour interpolation we extracted the daily gridded estimates for 1990 2014 and temporally disaggregated these using an expanded version of the quality controlled hourly rain gauge dataset of blenkinsop et al 2017 thus the new hourly gridded dataset ceh gear1hr preserves the daily totals of and is consistent with the widely used ceh gear dataset this allows the hourly gridded dataset to be made open source currently the hourly rain gauge data is not freely available and also allows direct comparisons to be made between the different temporal resolutions 2 2 hourly rain gauge data to disaggregate the daily gridded dataset a large dataset of hourly accumulations from 1903 uk rain gauges see fig 1 for coverage was used including a mixture of tipping bucket tbr 15 min and hourly data these data were derived from the uk met office integrated data archive system midas downloadable from the british atmospheric data centre met office 2012 the england environment agency ea natural resources wales nrw and the scottish environmental protection agency sepa this dataset was originally created and used in blenkinsop et al 2017 for use in this paper the dataset was extended to the end of 2014 and an additional 216 gauges were included all of less than 10 years duration from midas blenkinsop et al 2017 identified significant errors within these data and noted that the original dataset required additional quality control qc due to problems which included the recording of accumulated totals principally daily unfeasibly large hourly and daily values unrecorded non operation of gauges and in the case of tbr data unrealistic high frequency tipping in particular internal qc procedures employed by the ea including the use of check gauges were noted to be affected by the institutional administrative structure and also varied in time a series of single site gauge tests were applied to identify the most egregious errors however a significant amount of time consuming manual inspection of gauge records was required to produce the blenkinsop et al 2017 dataset which comprises a subset of 376 near complete quality controlled gauges covering the period 1992 2011 these limited qc procedures identified two clear requirements to enable the maximum value to be derived from the entire dataset firstly the incorporation of additional qc methods to include those which use neighbouring gauge data as an additional check these are routinely used for the qc of daily data e g keller et al 2015 sciuto et al 2009 but their application on hourly timescales is problematic given the localised nature of convective storms secondly the development of an automated qc rule base that integrates the results of the various qc tests to negate the requirement for large scale manual data inspection this requires the identification of appropriate metrics by which to assess the performance of the rule base and the overall quality of the dataset and these are described in section 4 this also provides the potential to further develop these formalised rules to either improve qc procedures as more understanding of the data is realised to investigate the uncertainty associated with the qc process or to have a different set of rules for specific applications 3 automated quality control tests the quality control procedure is a three step process 1 the gauge data is compared to the gridded ceh gear daily dataset to identify suspect gauges which may subsequently be excluded from the dataset 2 a series of quality control tests are applied to identify suspect values at all gauges which are marked with a quality control flag but not excluded at this stage 3 combinations of quality control flags for a given hourly accumulation referred to here as rules are used to determine which flagged data are treated as erroneous values and thus excluded from the gauge records 3 1 step 1 comparison of gauge data to gridded daily dataset we first compared the pre qc hourly gauge data accumulated to 24 h to the ceh gear gridded daily dataset to estimate the initial quality of the rain gauge data and provide a baseline against which the qc process may be assessed for each gauge we selected the ceh gear grid cell over its location and used the spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs and percentage correct statistics p11 p00 wilks 2006 yoo and ha 2007 for comparison of the two time series the latter is here calculated as the proportion of days in which rainfall is greater than 0 mm in both records p11 or is dry in both records p00 and is therefore a measure of concordance in rainfall occurrence whilst ceh gear may not provide an accurate representation of rainfall at a point location as it is an interpolated product and may also contain its own errors the comparison is helpful to highlight potential errors in the gauge records which can then be examined further recorded as suspect by qc9 in table 2 fig 2 demonstrates that the majority of gauges 92 9 match well with the corresponding grid cell where rs 0 8 and p00 p11 0 8 however the long tail of gauges outside these bounds highlights the need for rigorous quality control of the gauge data 3 2 step 2 identification and flagging of suspect gauge data blenkinsop et al 2017 applied a series of single gauge qc tests independently to each rain gauge we supplement this by comparing the hourly data with that of neighbouring gauges in total therefore we apply 15 qc tests 11 single gauge qc tests and 4 neighbourhood gauge qc tests identifying dry spells and high values each applied seasonally with each hourly value allocated a flag if a potentially suspect hourly daily total is identified the single site gauge qc tests are based on the understanding of rainfall processes and known measurement practice see blenkinsop et al 2017 for further details for example we include checks against known rainfall records and checks for common instrumentation errors such as accumulations table 1 flags 1 to 11 some types of errors such as reporting or instrument errors are unlikely to be duplicated across gauge networks and are more readily detected by comparison with neighbouring gauges we use neighbourhood analysis to assess whether measurements at a gauge of interest are statistical outliers when compared with those of their similar neighbours table 1 qc flags 12 to 15 such approaches are most useful when the correlation decay distance is high e g for temperature but have also been used previously in the qc of rainfall datasets see e g eischeid et al 1995 upton and rahimi 2003 sciuto et al 2009 and keller et al 2015 given the high variability in hourly rainfall totals we apply these techniques to 24 h daily aggregations see supplementary information for a detailed description of the neighbourhood analysis methodology 3 3 step 3 application of a rule base to exclude suspect values one of the key objectives of this work was to develop a quasi automated procedure to interpret data flagged as potentially suspect in order to minimise the need for manual intervention in the qc process this would mean that the qc procedure could be a modified relatively easily and efficiently b the number of rules applied could be changed for different situations or analyses if less strict criteria were required and c the qc automated process could be applied to other comparable rain gauge datasets the rule base presented in table 2 uses the qc flags determined in the previous step table 1 in an intelligent manner based on knowledge of regional rainfall processes and characteristics and common errors in the rain gauge data blenkinsop et al 2017 it thus comprises a set of 20 rules rn that combine the qc flags either individually in combination with other flags or in relation to other data characteristics such as dry sequences its aim is to fulfil the two criteria of excluding the most egregious errors in the data but also simultaneously preserving real extreme values whilst the qc flags applied in step 2 provide valuable information on suspect data in the dataset individual flags may not identify erroneous data effectively for example the threshold based tests qc1 3 are derived from the uk met office gauge network but this does not include the additional ea gauge data that significantly increases the coverage of the uk and may capture previously unrecorded events a judgement is therefore required for such tests as to the appropriate thresholds at which a value may confidently be judged to be erroneous the use of different thresholds allows the testing of different levels of severity in the implementation of the qc tests here we judge that marginal threshold exceedance is insufficient on its own to identify erroneous data and so only automatically exclude such data if the uk record is exceeded by at least 20 table 2 r1 for smaller exceedances data is only excluded if further evidence of problems with the data exists table 2 r2 r7 as is the case for those values with non threshold flags r8 r13 the application of the neighbouring gauge checks also needed careful consideration initially these were implemented throughout the year but it was noted that this resulted in the exclusion of a well documented event at boscastle south west england in 2004 doe 2004 as noted previously the most intense hourly rainfall typically occurs from late spring to early autumn blenkinsop et al 2017 and can be highly localised this causes a rapid decrease in correlation between gauges with distance in summer months resulting in i daily accumulations differing significantly to the surrounding neighbours ii dry spells that are not recorded in surrounding neighbours to allow for this highly localised nature of extreme rainfall events in summer months the implemented rule base only applies high threshold value neighbourhood checks in winter r20 the final hourly precipitation gauge dataset includes the provision of all qc flags as gauge metadata this ensures that all qc decisions are both transparent and traceable and that users are able to test alternative rules and apply a custom rule base if required as appropriate for their application for example if gauge data were to be assimilated with radar data the occurrence of rainfall may be useful even if the magnitude is erroneously recorded 4 validation of automated qc process the qc rule base aims to exclude erroneous data whilst retaining correct values definitive validation of the rule base is impossible to achieve as other sources of national rainfall data may also contain errors however some attempt at validation is essential to provide confidence in the resultant dataset we have therefore validated the rule base in two ways firstly by comparing the resultant quality controlled gauge data to a different gridded daily dataset and secondly by comparing it to known historic storm and flood events recorded in the literature 4 1 validation of the exclusion of large rainfall values daily totals were calculated from the quality controlled hourly gauges and compared to the corresponding ukcp09 5 km gridded daily observed precipitation time series for the period 1990 2007 perry et al 2009 we used the ukcp09 dataset for validation as the ceh gear dataset was used in the qc process to flag suspicious data qc9 although ukcp09 and ceh gear use different interpolation methods they are still highly correlated indeed when the 24 h accumulation for each ceh gear 1 km time series is compared with its corresponding 5 km grid square the spearman s rank and pearson correlation coefficients range from 0 9 to 1 as the main applications of the gridded hourly data likely relate to the occurrence and intensity of extreme events this dataset was used to validate the rule base for days which contained very high wet values wet hour q99 of the original hourly records as well as for dry spells longer than 20 days fig 3 shows the different 24 h q99 event types highlighted by the validation process event type a is where a 24 h q99 value is found in the gauge data and a wet event is found in the gridded data as the two values coincide it is likely that the event did occur if the rule base excludes this value we consider it incorrect event type b occurs when there is high rainfall in the gauge data but not in the gridded dataset for this type of event if the rule base excludes this high value we consider it correct under the assumption that the gridded dataset is a reliable benchmark event type c occurs when there is a relatively high rainfall value observed in the gridded data but not in the gauge data this type of event would not be excluded by the rule base as the value in the gauge data is low in order to make this high low assessment of the difference between the two datasets we consider similar events as those where the percentage difference is less than 65 event type b in fig 3 plotting around the 1 1 line on fig 4 65 was chosen as the majority of differences are smaller than this conversely if the difference is large i e 65 we would expect that those values should frequently be excluded by the rule base in fig 4 we compare daily total rainfall 0900 to 0900 encompassing each hourly q99 event from the hourly gauge records to the corresponding day and location in the ukcp09 daily dataset this shows that as would be hoped non excluded points generally cluster around the 1 1 line where the two datasets are in good agreement whilst a large number of excluded points are characterised by lower correspondence between the two datasets indicating that generally the rule base is working as intended in total 24 3 of type b events were excluded by the rule base in contrast with only 2 0 of type a events the largest excluded values are typically eliminated by rules containing threshold checks as categorised in tables 1 and 2 a line of events on the 6 1 line in fig 4 are excluded by non threshold checks which identify unexplained scaling in the magnitude of the hourly record typically after a period of no data see fig 5 and are likely related to some undocumented gauge malfunction although this feature did require some manual checking to identify the nature of the problem qc9 it may be the case that standard statistical tests for break points e g buishand 1982 pettitt 1979 could instead be used to identify such errors but these also have a number of limitations of their own serinaldi et al 2018 it is also noticeable that a large number of excluded events do lie around the 1 1 line i e potentially incorrectly excluded as their daily totals approximately agree however further examination indicates that these are typically excluded by rules that apply the daily accumulation flag qc4 which means that although the daily totals are in broad agreement the storm shape is wrong in the hourly record typically as a result of recording the total as a 0900 accumulation resulting in their exclusion validation by comparison to the daily gridded dataset is a useful method but it is not without limitations particularly with regard to the lack of commensurability in the spatial representation of the two data sources no metadata on the locations of the gauges is provided with the ukcp09 5 km gridded daily rainfall dataset so we may be comparing the hourly data to an interpolated grid square value we therefore have to be particularly careful when validating in this way as extreme sub daily rainfall events can be of short duration and limited in their spatial extent and may not be captured in an interpolated grid square or may be smoothed out by interpolation this may justify why many type b events were not excluded to further check that the rule base was not excluding type a events we examined the correspondence of our data with known high intensity historic events we took 16 historic extreme rainfall events recorded in weather journal articles and a further 27 from a chronology of severe uk weather events between 1901 and 2008 eden 2008 the location date and duration of each event was identified from the literature see table s2 and compared to the highest recorded hourly value 24 h either side of the event at the nearest recording gauge for 12 of these events no rainfall was recorded in the nearest gauge and for 3 a period of missing data was recorded in the nearest gauge of the remaining 28 no events were excluded by the rule base which provides some confidence that it is not excluding real extreme events this method of validation is somewhat limited as the storm centre and its extent are not reported and so the extreme events may not necessarily show in the nearest hourly gauge record we also acknowledge that this is a relatively small sample of events compared to the number of gauges but it does provide some confidence that the qc process is not excluding genuine extreme events that were frequently associated with significant impacts 4 2 validation of the exclusion of dry spells long dry periods are another common error in the hourly gauge records in particular long sequences of zero values at the beginning and or end of records this may occur when the start or end time of a gauge has been incorrectly reported its malfunctioning is undocumented or data values have been incorrectly recorded as zero dry spells in the uk are typically defined by a 15 day threshold atkinson et al 1985 for validation of the rule base we however investigated all sequences of dry days over a relaxed threshold of 20 days or more within the gauge records for each dry sequence the percentage of wet days and average daily rainfall for the relevant grid cell over the corresponding period in the ukcp09 dataset were calculated fig 6 shows the two types of dry events examined in the validation process for likely true dry periods type d events the wet days and average daily rainfall in the ukcp09 gridded daily dataset are very low by definition type d events are therefore defined as periods that are dry in the gauge data and for which the ukcp09 gridded dataset has a wet day percentage value of 20 or an average daily rainfall of 1 mm type e events likely erroneous are defined as periods that are dry in the gauge data but for which the ukcp09 gridded dataset has a wet day percentage value of 20 or an average daily rainfall of 1 mm in total 61 4 of type e erroneous events were excluded by the rule base whereas only 3 3 of type d true events were excluded when evaluating by wet percentage day similarly 69 3 of type e events were excluded whilst only 8 0 of type d were when evaluating by average daily rainfall the rule base therefore seems to be effective as it is excluding a large percentage of erroneous dry spells whilst only excluding a small percentage of real dry spells due to the interpolation of daily rainfall values however it is more likely to rain in the gridded record than at the gauge and so even for true dry sequences some rain might be expected in the ukcp09 gridded dataset the percentage wet days and average daily rainfall is much lower for non excluded events than those that are excluded fig 7 demonstrating that the rule base is excluding mainly erroneous dry spells 5 resulting gauge dataset in total 3 4 of the hourly data was excluded by the qc process fig 8 shows the improvement over fig 2 in rs and percentage correct statistics after the rule base is applied mean absolute differences are also shown in fig s3 only 2 5 of gauges still have poor correlation and percentage correct statistics 0 8 when compared to the ceh gear daily time series on further investigation these gauges are characterised by rainfall values of a reasonable order of magnitude but with long periods of missing data suggesting that the gauge may be faulty over a prolonged period the absence of particularly high values in these gauges means that the qc tests have not flagged data as suspicious and therefore such potential discrepancies are best identified through comparison to a high quality reference dataset e g the ceh gear gridded dataset check gauges etc such gauges would be excluded from some climatological analyses as a consequence of the large percentage of missing data though this is not an important factor for the production of the gridded dataset as the subsequent interpolation procedure section 6 accounts for missing periods by using the next nearest gauge however as a precaution against using such potentially erroneous data only gauges with rs 0 8 and p00 p11 0 8 after the qc process were used there are a range of rule bases that could be used to determine the exclusion of potentially suspect data flagged by the qc tests outlined in this paper we therefore examined three other rule bases made up of fewer rules and representing differing levels of severity each of these was validated using the process described above see supplementary information tables s3 and s4 the selected rule base described in this paper was found to eliminate a relatively large amount of suspect data whilst simultaneously eliminating only a small amount of non suspect data it is difficult to quantitatively demonstrate which rule base is better as we do not have a reliable true reference dataset the rule base presented here representatively codifies the judgments made in manual inspection and was therefore considered to be the most appropriate 6 temporal disaggregation the quality controlled hourly gauge data was used to disaggregate the ceh gear gridded daily rainfall dataset there are many different interpolation methods available for gridding rainfall data such as thiessen inverse distance weighting cubic spline kriging etc many studies have compared the relative benefits of each contractor et al 2015 dunn et al 2014 hofstra et al 2008 dirks et al 1998 and conclude that in areas of high gauge network density the method selected has little impact given the relatively high rainfall gauge network density in the uk a simple nearest neighbour interpolation without height correction was used to preserve a real storm shape for every grid square this was considered to be beneficial as it will preserve extreme hourly rainfall intensities whereas other interpolation methods will smooth these extremes out a limitation of this approach is that convective events can be very small and therefore nearest neighbour may sometimes represent a convective storm over too large an area however as it is the hourly rainfall fractions that are interpolated here the actual rainfall total is modulated by the daily rainfall dataset which is smoothed meaning that this effect is reduced this methodological choice is supported by similar applications in li et al 2018 and choi et al 2008 for each day a subset of hourly gauges was selected using only those where the record for that day was complete the number of gauges used on each day was therefore variable as some were excluded because they contained missing data therefore the number of gauges used on a given day ranged from 295 to 1372 see fig 9 for each hour the gauge data was interpolated onto a 1 km grid using nearest neighbour interpolation that for each grid square assigns it the nearest station hourly rainfall value as a fraction of the station s daily total isaaks and srivastava 1989 if the nearest station was over 50 km away or if there was rain in the daily dataset but not in the nearest hourly gauge the station value was not used and an average storm shape was used instead the gridded hourly fractions were then multiplied by the daily rainfall from the ceh gear dataset this preserved the daily totals from ceh gear whilst maintaining the nearest recorded storm shape fig 10 shows the average storm shape given a daily rainfall total range which changes according to season and was constructed from all the available gauges see fig s2 for the full distribution of storm profiles in winter november april the storms are typically longer in duration and less intense whilst in summer may october they are shorter and more intense this average storm is set to begin in the gridded dataset at 0900 whenever it is applied this represents a more realistic approach to disaggregation than has been used elsewhere when accumulated rainfall totals have been distributed equally across the 24 h period e g parkes et al 2013 and could potentially be improved upon by setting the peak of the design storm to coincide with a seasonal likely wettest hour the design storms could also be calculated regionally or alternatively a weather generator could be used to infill missing data 7 reliability of the gridded hourly dataset the reliability of ceh gear1hr is dependent upon that of the daily totals from ceh gear see keller et al 2015 and of the hourly disaggregations the disaggregation error has several components measurement error of the gauge record error associated with the distance to the nearest gauge and the error associated with using statistical disaggregation the measurement error has been reduced as much as possible through qc however some errors will remain in the gauge data particularly those associated with wind induced under catch and evaporation errors the metadata associated with the dataset includes the distance to the gauge used for each grid square for every day the mean distance to a gauge over the whole period is 11 3 km and the maximum distance is 97 7 km for the west coast of scotland most of the country is reasonably well covered by rain gauges with the exception of scotland and the south west of england which is reflected in these areas having a higher average distance to gauge fig 11 in the case of the latter this is likely a result of the later instrumentation with gauges by the environment agency in south west england compared with other parts of the country fig 12 shows the increasing error with distance between the temporal patterns the fraction of daily rainfall falling in each hour of a gauge and its nearest neighbour this information together with the distance to the gauge used for disaggregation provided with the hourly rainfall grids gives users the information to decide if parts of the ceh gear1hr estimates are suitable for their needs the low gauge density in some areas also means that errors are likely to occur from under sampling of orographically enhanced rainfall and localised convective storms the metadata also describes whether or not statistical disaggregation was used for each day as noted above where a grid square is greater than 50 km from a gauge or when there is rainfall in the daily record but not in the hourly record statistical disaggregation is used statistical disaggregation due to zero rainfall in the hourly record is used for 0 26 of grid squares on any given day over the whole 1990 2014 period whereas statistical disaggregation due to the grid square being over 50 km away from a gauge was used for 0 3 of grid squares over this time period instances of the latter use of statistical disaggregation are rare after 2000 when the final regions of the ea network were gauged and so the average distance between gauges in data sparse areas decreased whilst the percentage of grid squares using statistical disaggregation due to zero rainfall in the hourly record fluctuates greatly over the record 97 of the time this is used to disaggregate a daily total of less than 1 mm of rainfall the statistical disaggregation is therefore unlikely to have a large impact on extreme values in the dataset or on subsequent hydrological model simulations 8 evaluation of the hourly gridded dataset ceh gear1hr has statistical properties of interest that are generally consistent with previous gauge derived national scale estimates blenkinsop et al 2017 throughout most of the year the median of the seasonal maximum 1hr rainfall rmax is highest in the mountainous regions and the west of britain fig 13 whilst in the east and lowland areas rmax is highest in summer jja and autumn son the spatial pattern of rmax is also much less coherent and less clearly defined by orogrophy in summer which might be expected from the increased dominance of convective rainfall at this time of year and is consistent with the corresponding results presented in blenkinsop et al 2017 summer also sees the lowest number of wet hours across the country and winter the greatest fig 14 with the influence of topography on this variable evident throughout the year these patterns are as expected broadly consistent with those of daily rainfall occurrence rates jenkins et al 2008 by using both gridded daily data and hourly gauges the new dataset provides additional spatial detail not present in previous maps a more detailed evaluation of the dataset is beyond the scope of this paper but will be provided in a subsequent publication 9 discussion and conclusions a 1 km gridded hourly rainfall dataset has been created for great britain using data from over 1900 quality controlled gauges for the period 1990 2014 we extended and automated a quality control procedure essential for such a large number of gauges to expand the availability of the hourly rain gauge dataset accumulated by blenkinsop et al 2017 we allocated a series of qc flags that identified potentially suspect values and then constructed a set of rules that apply either single or combined qc flags based on knowledge gained from the initial dataset to exclude likely erroneous rainfall amounts accumulations and dry spells a two tiered validation approach at the daily and hourly timescales indicates that spurious extreme values have been excluded from the resultant dataset while assumed legitimate values have been preserved most quality controlled gauges are found to be highly correlated with the ukcp09 observed 5 km dataset at the daily timescale and show a high degree of concordance in terms of rainfall occurrence the resulting gauge density used in this product varies over time and space being particularly sparse in scotland and the southwest of england prior to 2000 and this should be borne in mind when using the dataset a nearest neighbour interpolation scheme was used to provide gridded hourly rainfall values at a resolution of 1 km these data were then used to temporally disaggregate the existing ceh gear daily gridded dataset to produce an hourly dataset with consistent daily totals consistency with the existing ceh gear dataset is an important feature of the new hourly dataset as it will be made freely available hosted and updated alongside the ceh gear product at http eidc ceh ac uk this new dataset will be a valuable resource for hydrologists climate scientists and the broader community wishing to assess current exposure to intense rainfall there are few national datasets available at a sub daily time step yet many hydrological applications require or can be improved by a higher temporal resolution of rainfall data especially for smaller rapidly responding catchments e g archer et al 2016 however we would recommend that the gridded hourly data should not be used for trend analyses due to the short length of the dataset potential gauge level inhomogeneities and the temporal variation in gauges used in the disaggregation kendon et al 2018 examined uk gauges of at least 13 years duration and subsequently corrected for inhomogeneities arising from changes in measurement resolution this was found to have a limited effect on extreme values but can have a significant impact on mean intensities and rainfall occurrence statistics the lack of additional metadata available makes the identification and attribution of other potential inhomogeneities challenging if only gauge data is required the qc procedure presented here can be used to improve the consistency of data by trying to eliminate erroneous extremes whilst maintaining genuine values the qc framework here will therefore also be implemented in the global effort to gather sub daily rainfall data currently being undertaken by the intense intelligent use of climate models for adaptation to non stationary hydrological extremes project which forms part of the world climate research programme s global energy and water exchanges gewex grand challenge on extremes this has identified the importance of developing new and novel qc methods at different timescales and for different locations alexander et al 2016 a key challenge will be to adapt the tests and rules developed here so that they are applicable to different climate regimes and operating practices a by product from the generation of the gridded dataset is an additional dataset comprising the individual qc flags table 1 associated with each hourly value for each gauge this metadata can be obtained alongside the rule base code to allow users who are licensed to use the original gauge data to apply a bespoke rule base to the gauge data this creates a community resource where improvements to the database can be made and shared for different types of analyses one future piece of work could be to explore the uncertainty associated with the implementation of the rule base or more generally the quantification of uncertainty within the gridded hourly precipitation product the importance of adequately assessing uncertainty within model predictions and observations that drive them has been highlighted by a vast array of authors e g beven 2002 pappenberger et al 2006 2008 di baldassarre et al 2010 mcmillan et al 2012 within the field of hydrology the rainfall data used to force a model prediction is a key source of error and therefore the generation of a probabilistic rainfall product would be a valuable next step ahrens and jaun 2007 sideris et al 2014 corresponding products are currently being developed by the reanalysis community bach et al 2016 some key prerequisites for generating a probabilistic rainfall product would be to gain a better understanding of the uncertainties associated with the hourly gauge data for example undercatch the qc process and the interpolation method but ultimately this would also need to be explored at the daily level in the original ceh gear product further potential exists for novel methods to create merged products that take advantage of the spatial detail offered by other sources of data such as radar jewell and gaussiat 2015 examined several schemes to merge radar with tbr data over england and wales all of which produced a merged product that was superior to the individual data sources such products have significant potential to support flood forecasting and may provide improved calibration of hydrological models parkes et al 2013 as a next step we intend to provide added value to the dataset by conducting an assessment of its key characteristics with respect to flooding from intense rainfall and developing freely available gridded datasets of useful indices such as extreme percentiles and peaks over threshold as well as the provision of intensity duration frequency curves we will also evaluate the benefit of using the hourly gridded dataset in hydrological modelling applications 10 declarations of interest none acknowledgements this research forms part of the sinatra

7108,high resolution gridded precipitation products are rare globally particularly below a daily time step yet many hydrological applications require or can be improved by a higher temporal resolution of rainfall data here we present a new 1 km resolution gridded hourly rainfall dataset for great britain gridded estimates of hourly areal rainfall for great britain 1990 2014 ceh gear1hr using data from over 1900 quality controlled rainfall gauges which improves upon the current uk national gridded precipitation datasets at daily time step we extend and automate a quality control qc procedure to permit the use of hourly data for 1990 2014 and independently validate the qc using daily rainfall data and recorded historic events our two tiered validation approach at daily and hourly timescales indicates that spurious extreme values are excluded from the resultant dataset while legitimate values are preserved we use a nearest neighbour interpolation scheme to derive gridded hourly rainfall

gridded hourly precipitation extremes quality control great britain dataset rain gauge 1 introduction recently increased attention has been given to sub daily precipitation observations due to the contribution of intense rainfall events to flash flooding in urban areas and fast responding catchments indeed our ability to address and plan for flash floods has been partly limited by the paucity of available high quality rain gauge data westra et al 2014 several studies have demonstrated the sensitivity and improved performance of hydrological model simulations when driven by precipitation data at a sub daily time step e g finnerty et al 1997 bastola and misra 2013 particularly for small catchments with rapid response times additionally the lack of temporal resolution offered by daily data for direct application in flood forecasting and the need for assessment of the impacts of short duration intense rainfall events on hydrological systems has created a requirement for the improved availability of sub daily precipitation data this was further identified as a need in the world climate research programme grand challenge on extremes alexander et al 2016 and the intense project has taken up the mantle of collecting and quality controlling a global sub daily precipitation dataset www research ncl ac uk intense such datasets are also invaluable for the validation of the new generation of very high resolution convection permitting climate models cpms see prein et al 2015 for a review which offer improved representation of sub daily extreme rainfall e g kendon et al 2012

gridded hourly products offer the potential for enhanced applications in these areas as well as for the verification of quantitative precipitation forecasts satellite products and the validation of cpms radar data offers the required temporal resolution but suffers from errors in the estimation of precipitation magnitude collier 1989 villarini and krajewski 2010 and may lead to reduced performance of hydrological models compared with gauge derived data cole and moore 2009 parkes et al 2013 a number of gridded precipitation products derived from rain gauges are available for the uk and are summarised in table s1 in the supplementary information comprising uk only and europe wide datasets reanalysis data which are created by a data assimilation scheme and models which incorporate observations at 6 12 h time steps may also be used to characterise the observed long term variability of precipitation e g ncep ncar kalnay et al 1996 20cr compo et al 2011 era interim dee et al 2011 however these are typically at coarser spatial resolutions and are not appropriate for most hydrological modelling studies for example rhodes et al 2015 noted that although reanalysis products represent many of the features of large scale precipitation and daily totals over england and wales individual extreme events are less well represented regional reanalyses may address some of the problems associated with coarse scale reanalysis datasets though improved understanding of uncertainties is needed borsche et al 2015 gridded datasets at hourly resolution have been constructed for some regions using a range of methodological approaches although these are typically only for short time periods and often constructed for the calibration and assessment of hydrological models in catchments for example wüest et al 2010 used a dense daily rain gauge network for switzerland for 1992 2003 and disaggregated this to the hourly timescale using radar data to preserve daily totals a similar approach was used by paulat et al 2008 to create a gridded hourly dataset for germany for the period 2001 2004 shen et al 2014 merged over 30 000 hourly gauge observations with satellite data to produce a gridded hourly dataset for china for the 2008 2010 warm seasons an alternative approach was applied by luo et al 2013 who constructed an hourly precipitation grid over the yangtze huai rivers basin in china for the 2007 mei yu season using a direct interpolation method with automated weather station aws data some national scale sub daily datasets have been produced however vormoor and skaugen 2013 developed a 1 km 3 h gridded precipitation dataset for norway using a model simulated hindcast series to disaggregate an existing gridded daily dataset for the period 1957 2010 hourly observations for approximately 2 500 stations in the us have also been interpolated onto a relatively coarse 2 latitude by 2 5 longitude grid higgins et al 1996 and a gridded product created through merging of daily gauges with radar cosgrove et al 2003 up to a resolution of 1 8 for the uk generation of gridded sub daily precipitation data on a catchment scale over limited periods has been performed on an ad hoc basis for the assessment of hydrological models and their input data typically this has been achieved by disaggregating a relatively dense daily rain gauge network using radar e g parkes et al 2013 for the 4062 km2 of the upper severn river cole and moore 2008 for 136 km2 of the river darwen and 212 km2 of the river kent catchments the availability of quality controlled individual hourly rain gauge data for the uk blenkinsop et al 2017 and extended here offers the potential for a more extensive gridded hourly dataset for uk coverage quality control of gauge rainfall data is essential to ensure a high quality product there are many shortcomings of gauge measurement of rainfall including mechanical errors recording errors evaporation from partly filled buckets wind induced under catch and snow effects mcmillan et al 2012 qc procedures can identify some of these errors for example frequent tips upton and rahimi 2003 erroneous extreme values and erroneous dry periods abbott 1986 however qc procedures are unable to identify errors due to undercatch and evaporation therefore the measurements may still not reflect the true amount of rain that fell even after qc checks are completed quality control is typically a manual operation and in some instances quasi automated but still relies heavily on either a final manual inspection or on previously manually identified errors for model training prior to this work analysis of the uk rain gauge data has focussed only on a subset 20 of available rain gauges due to the need for near complete records for climatological analysis and the labour intensive nature of quality controlling such data blenkinsop et al 2017 this paper builds on blenkinsop et al 2017 by i developing additional quality control procedures whose implementation may be automated and applied to all 1900 gauge records and ii using these data to produce a gridded 1 km hourly dataset for the uk for 1990 2014 in section 2 we describe the data sources section 3 describes the extended and automated quality control procedure for the hourly rain gauge data which includes a rule base for the implementation of single site and nearest neighbour gauge checks section 4 details the validation of the automated qc process section 5 describes the resulting gauge dataset section 6 describes the methodological basis for the disaggregation of the daily gridded dataset section 7 assesses the reliability of the hourly gridded dataset and finally in section 8 we discuss the implications and potential applications of this dataset and potential future avenues which could improve the product and be used to investigate the associated uncertainties 2 data 2 1 ceh gear 1 km daily dataset to generate gridded hourly precipitation values we adopt a similar approach to that used in other studies as discussed in section 1 by disaggregating an existing quality controlled validated gridded daily precipitation dataset here we use the ceh gridded estimates of areal rainfall ceh gear dataset keller et al 2015 tanguy et al 2016 which is an open source dataset that provides 1 km gridded estimates of daily and monthly rainfall for great britain and northern ireland from 1890 to 2014 the rainfall estimates in this dataset are derived from uk met office rain gauge observations which were gridded using a natural neighbour interpolation method a smooth weighted version of nearest neighbour interpolation we extracted the daily gridded estimates for 1990 2014 and temporally disaggregated these using an expanded version of the quality controlled hourly rain gauge dataset of blenkinsop et al 2017 thus the new hourly gridded dataset ceh gear1hr preserves the daily totals of and is consistent with the widely used ceh gear dataset this allows the hourly gridded dataset to be made open source currently the hourly rain gauge data is not freely available and also allows direct comparisons to be made between the different temporal resolutions 2 2 hourly rain gauge data to disaggregate the daily gridded dataset a large dataset of hourly accumulations from 1903 uk rain gauges see fig 1 for coverage was used including a mixture of tipping bucket tbr 15 min and hourly data these data were derived from the uk met office integrated data archive system midas downloadable from the british atmospheric data centre met office 2012 the england environment agency ea natural resources wales nrw and the scottish environmental protection agency sepa this dataset was originally created and used in blenkinsop et al 2017 for use in this paper the dataset was extended to the end of 2014 and an additional 216 gauges were included all of less than 10 years duration from midas blenkinsop et al 2017 identified significant errors within these data and noted that the original dataset required additional quality control qc due to problems which included the recording of accumulated totals principally daily unfeasibly large hourly and daily values unrecorded non operation of gauges and in the case of tbr data unrealistic high frequency tipping in particular internal qc procedures employed by the ea including the use of check gauges were noted to be affected by the institutional administrative structure and also varied in time a series of single site gauge tests were applied to identify the most egregious errors however a significant amount of time consuming manual inspection of gauge records was required to produce the blenkinsop et al 2017 dataset which comprises a subset of 376 near complete quality controlled gauges covering the period 1992 2011 these limited qc procedures identified two clear requirements to enable the maximum value to be derived from the entire dataset firstly the incorporation of additional qc methods to include those which use neighbouring gauge data as an additional check these are routinely used for the qc of daily data e g keller et al 2015 sciuto et al 2009 but their application on hourly timescales is problematic given the localised nature of convective storms secondly the development of an automated qc rule base that integrates the results of the various qc tests to negate the requirement for large scale manual data inspection this requires the identification of appropriate metrics by which to assess the performance of the rule base and the overall quality of the dataset and these are described in section 4 this also provides the potential to further develop these formalised rules to either improve qc procedures as more understanding of the data is realised to investigate the uncertainty associated with the qc process or to have a different set of rules for specific applications 3 automated quality control tests the quality control procedure is a three step process 1 the gauge data is compared to the gridded ceh gear daily dataset to identify suspect gauges which may subsequently be excluded from the dataset 2 a series of quality control tests are applied to identify suspect values at all gauges which are marked with a quality control flag but not excluded at this stage 3 combinations of quality control flags for a given hourly accumulation referred to here as rules are used to determine which flagged data are treated as erroneous values and thus excluded from the gauge records 3 1 step 1 comparison of gauge data to gridded daily dataset we first compared the pre qc hourly gauge data accumulated to 24 h to the ceh gear gridded daily dataset to estimate the initial quality of the rain gauge data and provide a baseline against which the qc process may be assessed for each gauge we selected the ceh gear grid cell over its location and used the spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs and percentage correct statistics p11 p00 wilks 2006 yoo and ha 2007 for comparison of the two time series the latter is here calculated as the proportion of days in which rainfall is greater than 0 mm in both records p11 or is dry in both records p00 and is therefore a measure of concordance in rainfall occurrence whilst ceh gear may not provide an accurate representation of rainfall at a point location as it is an interpolated product and may also contain its own errors the comparison is helpful to highlight potential errors in the gauge records which can then be examined further recorded as suspect by qc9 in table 2 fig 2 demonstrates that the majority of gauges 92 9 match well with the corresponding grid cell where rs 0 8 and p00 p11 0 8 however the long tail of gauges outside these bounds highlights the need for rigorous quality control of the gauge data 3 2 step 2 identification and flagging of suspect gauge data blenkinsop et al 2017 applied a series of single gauge qc tests independently to each rain gauge we supplement this by comparing the hourly data with that of neighbouring gauges in total therefore we apply 15 qc tests 11 single gauge qc tests and 4 neighbourhood gauge qc tests identifying dry spells and high values each applied seasonally with each hourly value allocated a flag if a potentially suspect hourly daily total is identified the single site gauge qc tests are based on the understanding of rainfall processes and known measurement practice see blenkinsop et al 2017 for further details for example we include checks against known rainfall records and checks for common instrumentation errors such as accumulations table 1 flags 1 to 11 some types of errors such as reporting or instrument errors are unlikely to be duplicated across gauge networks and are more readily detected by comparison with neighbouring gauges we use neighbourhood analysis to assess whether measurements at a gauge of interest are statistical outliers when compared with those of their similar neighbours table 1 qc flags 12 to 15 such approaches are most useful when the correlation decay distance is high e g for temperature but have also been used previously in the qc of rainfall datasets see e g eischeid et al 1995 upton and rahimi 2003 sciuto et al 2009 and keller et al 2015 given the high variability in hourly rainfall totals we apply these techniques to 24 h daily aggregations see supplementary information for a detailed description of the neighbourhood analysis methodology 3 3 step 3 application of a rule base to exclude suspect values one of the key objectives of this work was to develop a quasi automated procedure to interpret data flagged as potentially suspect in order to minimise the need for manual intervention in the qc process this would mean that the qc procedure could be a modified relatively easily and efficiently b the number of rules applied could be changed for different situations or analyses if less strict criteria were required and c the qc automated process could be applied to other comparable rain gauge datasets the rule base presented in table 2 uses the qc flags determined in the previous step table 1 in an intelligent manner based on knowledge of regional rainfall processes and characteristics and common errors in the rain gauge data blenkinsop et al 2017 it thus comprises a set of 20 rules rn that combine the qc flags either individually in combination with other flags or in relation to other data characteristics such as dry sequences its aim is to fulfil the two criteria of excluding the most egregious errors in the data but also simultaneously preserving real extreme values whilst the qc flags applied in step 2 provide valuable information on suspect data in the dataset individual flags may not identify erroneous data effectively for example the threshold based tests qc1 3 are derived from the uk met office gauge network but this does not include the additional ea gauge data that significantly increases the coverage of the uk and may capture previously unrecorded events a judgement is therefore required for such tests as to the appropriate thresholds at which a value may confidently be judged to be erroneous the use of different thresholds allows the testing of different levels of severity in the implementation of the qc tests here we judge that marginal threshold exceedance is insufficient on its own to identify erroneous data and so only automatically exclude such data if the uk record is exceeded by at least 20 table 2 r1 for smaller exceedances data is only excluded if further evidence of problems with the data exists table 2 r2 r7 as is the case for those values with non threshold flags r8 r13 the application of the neighbouring gauge checks also needed careful consideration initially these were implemented throughout the year but it was noted that this resulted in the exclusion of a well documented event at boscastle south west england in 2004 doe 2004 as noted previously the most intense hourly rainfall typically occurs from late spring to early autumn blenkinsop et al 2017 and can be highly localised this causes a rapid decrease in correlation between gauges with distance in summer months resulting in i daily accumulations differing significantly to the surrounding neighbours ii dry spells that are not recorded in surrounding neighbours to allow for this highly localised nature of extreme rainfall events in summer months the implemented rule base only applies high threshold value neighbourhood checks in winter r20 the final hourly precipitation gauge dataset includes the provision of all qc flags as gauge metadata this ensures that all qc decisions are both transparent and traceable and that users are able to test alternative rules and apply a custom rule base if required as appropriate for their application for example if gauge data were to be assimilated with radar data the occurrence of rainfall may be useful even if the magnitude is erroneously recorded 4 validation of automated qc process the qc rule base aims to exclude erroneous data whilst retaining correct values definitive validation of the rule base is impossible to achieve as other sources of national rainfall data may also contain errors however some attempt at validation is essential to provide confidence in the resultant dataset we have therefore validated the rule base in two ways firstly by comparing the resultant quality controlled gauge data to a different gridded daily dataset and secondly by comparing it to known historic storm and flood events recorded in the literature 4 1 validation of the exclusion of large rainfall values daily totals were calculated from the quality controlled hourly gauges and compared to the corresponding ukcp09 5 km gridded daily observed precipitation time series for the period 1990 2007 perry et al 2009 we used the ukcp09 dataset for validation as the ceh gear dataset was used in the qc process to flag suspicious data qc9 although ukcp09 and ceh gear use different interpolation methods they are still highly correlated indeed when the 24 h accumulation for each ceh gear 1 km time series is compared with its corresponding 5 km grid square the spearman s rank and pearson correlation coefficients range from 0 9 to 1 as the main applications of the gridded hourly data likely relate to the occurrence and intensity of extreme events this dataset was used to validate the rule base for days which contained very high wet values wet hour q99 of the original hourly records as well as for dry spells longer than 20 days fig 3 shows the different 24 h q99 event types highlighted by the validation process event type a is where a 24 h q99 value is found in the gauge data and a wet event is found in the gridded data as the two values coincide it is likely that the event did occur if the rule base excludes this value we consider it incorrect event type b occurs when there is high rainfall in the gauge data but not in the gridded dataset for this type of event if the rule base excludes this high value we consider it correct under the assumption that the gridded dataset is a reliable benchmark event type c occurs when there is a relatively high rainfall value observed in the gridded data but not in the gauge data this type of event would not be excluded by the rule base as the value in the gauge data is low in order to make this high low assessment of the difference between the two datasets we consider similar events as those where the percentage difference is less than 65 event type b in fig 3 plotting around the 1 1 line on fig 4 65 was chosen as the majority of differences are smaller than this conversely if the difference is large i e 65 we would expect that those values should frequently be excluded by the rule base in fig 4 we compare daily total rainfall 0900 to 0900 encompassing each hourly q99 event from the hourly gauge records to the corresponding day and location in the ukcp09 daily dataset this shows that as would be hoped non excluded points generally cluster around the 1 1 line where the two datasets are in good agreement whilst a large number of excluded points are characterised by lower correspondence between the two datasets indicating that generally the rule base is working as intended in total 24 3 of type b events were excluded by the rule base in contrast with only 2 0 of type a events the largest excluded values are typically eliminated by rules containing threshold checks as categorised in tables 1 and 2 a line of events on the 6 1 line in fig 4 are excluded by non threshold checks which identify unexplained scaling in the magnitude of the hourly record typically after a period of no data see fig 5 and are likely related to some undocumented gauge malfunction although this feature did require some manual checking to identify the nature of the problem qc9 it may be the case that standard statistical tests for break points e g buishand 1982 pettitt 1979 could instead be used to identify such errors but these also have a number of limitations of their own serinaldi et al 2018 it is also noticeable that a large number of excluded events do lie around the 1 1 line i e potentially incorrectly excluded as their daily totals approximately agree however further examination indicates that these are typically excluded by rules that apply the daily accumulation flag qc4 which means that although the daily totals are in broad agreement the storm shape is wrong in the hourly record typically as a result of recording the total as a 0900 accumulation resulting in their exclusion validation by comparison to the daily gridded dataset is a useful method but it is not without limitations particularly with regard to the lack of commensurability in the spatial representation of the two data sources no metadata on the locations of the gauges is provided with the ukcp09 5 km gridded daily rainfall dataset so we may be comparing the hourly data to an interpolated grid square value we therefore have to be particularly careful when validating in this way as extreme sub daily rainfall events can be of short duration and limited in their spatial extent and may not be captured in an interpolated grid square or may be smoothed out by interpolation this may justify why many type b events were not excluded to further check that the rule base was not excluding type a events we examined the correspondence of our data with known high intensity historic events we took 16 historic extreme rainfall events recorded in weather journal articles and a further 27 from a chronology of severe uk weather events between 1901 and 2008 eden 2008 the location date and duration of each event was identified from the literature see table s2 and compared to the highest recorded hourly value 24 h either side of the event at the nearest recording gauge for 12 of these events no rainfall was recorded in the nearest gauge and for 3 a period of missing data was recorded in the nearest gauge of the remaining 28 no events were excluded by the rule base which provides some confidence that it is not excluding real extreme events this method of validation is somewhat limited as the storm centre and its extent are not reported and so the extreme events may not necessarily show in the nearest hourly gauge record we also acknowledge that this is a relatively small sample of events compared to the number of gauges but it does provide some confidence that the qc process is not excluding genuine extreme events that were frequently associated with significant impacts 4 2 validation of the exclusion of dry spells long dry periods are another common error in the hourly gauge records in particular long sequences of zero values at the beginning and or end of records this may occur when the start or end time of a gauge has been incorrectly reported its malfunctioning is undocumented or data values have been incorrectly recorded as zero dry spells in the uk are typically defined by a 15 day threshold atkinson et al 1985 for validation of the rule base we however investigated all sequences of dry days over a relaxed threshold of 20 days or more within the gauge records for each dry sequence the percentage of wet days and average daily rainfall for the relevant grid cell over the corresponding period in the ukcp09 dataset were calculated fig 6 shows the two types of dry events examined in the validation process for likely true dry periods type d events the wet days and average daily rainfall in the ukcp09 gridded daily dataset are very low by definition type d events are therefore defined as periods that are dry in the gauge data and for which the ukcp09 gridded dataset has a wet day percentage value of 20 or an average daily rainfall of 1 mm type e events likely erroneous are defined as periods that are dry in the gauge data but for which the ukcp09 gridded dataset has a wet day percentage value of 20 or an average daily rainfall of 1 mm in total 61 4 of type e erroneous events were excluded by the rule base whereas only 3 3 of type d true events were excluded when evaluating by wet percentage day similarly 69 3 of type e events were excluded whilst only 8 0 of type d were when evaluating by average daily rainfall the rule base therefore seems to be effective as it is excluding a large percentage of erroneous dry spells whilst only excluding a small percentage of real dry spells due to the interpolation of daily rainfall values however it is more likely to rain in the gridded record than at the gauge and so even for true dry sequences some rain might be expected in the ukcp09 gridded dataset the percentage wet days and average daily rainfall is much lower for non excluded events than those that are excluded fig 7 demonstrating that the rule base is excluding mainly erroneous dry spells 5 resulting gauge dataset in total 3 4 of the hourly data was excluded by the qc process fig 8 shows the improvement over fig 2 in rs and percentage correct statistics after the rule base is applied mean absolute differences are also shown in fig s3 only 2 5 of gauges still have poor correlation and percentage correct statistics 0 8 when compared to the ceh gear daily time series on further investigation these gauges are characterised by rainfall values of a reasonable order of magnitude but with long periods of missing data suggesting that the gauge may be faulty over a prolonged period the absence of particularly high values in these gauges means that the qc tests have not flagged data as suspicious and therefore such potential discrepancies are best identified through comparison to a high quality reference dataset e g the ceh gear gridded dataset check gauges etc such gauges would be excluded from some climatological analyses as a consequence of the large percentage of missing data though this is not an important factor for the production of the gridded dataset as the subsequent interpolation procedure section 6 accounts for missing periods by using the next nearest gauge however as a precaution against using such potentially erroneous data only gauges with rs 0 8 and p00 p11 0 8 after the qc process were used there are a range of rule bases that could be used to determine the exclusion of potentially suspect data flagged by the qc tests outlined in this paper we therefore examined three other rule bases made up of fewer rules and representing differing levels of severity each of these was validated using the process described above see supplementary information tables s3 and s4 the selected rule base described in this paper was found to eliminate a relatively large amount of suspect data whilst simultaneously eliminating only a small amount of non suspect data it is difficult to quantitatively demonstrate which rule base is better as we do not have a reliable true reference dataset the rule base presented here representatively codifies the judgments made in manual inspection and was therefore considered to be the most appropriate 6 temporal disaggregation the quality controlled hourly gauge data was used to disaggregate the ceh gear gridded daily rainfall dataset there are many different interpolation methods available for gridding rainfall data such as thiessen inverse distance weighting cubic spline kriging etc many studies have compared the relative benefits of each contractor et al 2015 dunn et al 2014 hofstra et al 2008 dirks et al 1998 and conclude that in areas of high gauge network density the method selected has little impact given the relatively high rainfall gauge network density in the uk a simple nearest neighbour interpolation without height correction was used to preserve a real storm shape for every grid square this was considered to be beneficial as it will preserve extreme hourly rainfall intensities whereas other interpolation methods will smooth these extremes out a limitation of this approach is that convective events can be very small and therefore nearest neighbour may sometimes represent a convective storm over too large an area however as it is the hourly rainfall fractions that are interpolated here the actual rainfall total is modulated by the daily rainfall dataset which is smoothed meaning that this effect is reduced this methodological choice is supported by similar applications in li et al 2018 and choi et al 2008 for each day a subset of hourly gauges was selected using only those where the record for that day was complete the number of gauges used on each day was therefore variable as some were excluded because they contained missing data therefore the number of gauges used on a given day ranged from 295 to 1372 see fig 9 for each hour the gauge data was interpolated onto a 1 km grid using nearest neighbour interpolation that for each grid square assigns it the nearest station hourly rainfall value as a fraction of the station s daily total isaaks and srivastava 1989 if the nearest station was over 50 km away or if there was rain in the daily dataset but not in the nearest hourly gauge the station value was not used and an average storm shape was used instead the gridded hourly fractions were then multiplied by the daily rainfall from the ceh gear dataset this preserved the daily totals from ceh gear whilst maintaining the nearest recorded storm shape fig 10 shows the average storm shape given a daily rainfall total range which changes according to season and was constructed from all the available gauges see fig s2 for the full distribution of storm profiles in winter november april the storms are typically longer in duration and less intense whilst in summer may october they are shorter and more intense this average storm is set to begin in the gridded dataset at 0900 whenever it is applied this represents a more realistic approach to disaggregation than has been used elsewhere when accumulated rainfall totals have been distributed equally across the 24 h period e g parkes et al 2013 and could potentially be improved upon by setting the peak of the design storm to coincide with a seasonal likely wettest hour the design storms could also be calculated regionally or alternatively a weather generator could be used to infill missing data 7 reliability of the gridded hourly dataset the reliability of ceh gear1hr is dependent upon that of the daily totals from ceh gear see keller et al 2015 and of the hourly disaggregations the disaggregation error has several components measurement error of the gauge record error associated with the distance to the nearest gauge and the error associated with using statistical disaggregation the measurement error has been reduced as much as possible through qc however some errors will remain in the gauge data particularly those associated with wind induced under catch and evaporation errors the metadata associated with the dataset includes the distance to the gauge used for each grid square for every day the mean distance to a gauge over the whole period is 11 3 km and the maximum distance is 97 7 km for the west coast of scotland most of the country is reasonably well covered by rain gauges with the exception of scotland and the south west of england which is reflected in these areas having a higher average distance to gauge fig 11 in the case of the latter this is likely a result of the later instrumentation with gauges by the environment agency in south west england compared with other parts of the country fig 12 shows the increasing error with distance between the temporal patterns the fraction of daily rainfall falling in each hour of a gauge and its nearest neighbour this information together with the distance to the gauge used for disaggregation provided with the hourly rainfall grids gives users the information to decide if parts of the ceh gear1hr estimates are suitable for their needs the low gauge density in some areas also means that errors are likely to occur from under sampling of orographically enhanced rainfall and localised convective storms the metadata also describes whether or not statistical disaggregation was used for each day as noted above where a grid square is greater than 50 km from a gauge or when there is rainfall in the daily record but not in the hourly record statistical disaggregation is used statistical disaggregation due to zero rainfall in the hourly record is used for 0 26 of grid squares on any given day over the whole 1990 2014 period whereas statistical disaggregation due to the grid square being over 50 km away from a gauge was used for 0 3 of grid squares over this time period instances of the latter use of statistical disaggregation are rare after 2000 when the final regions of the ea network were gauged and so the average distance between gauges in data sparse areas decreased whilst the percentage of grid squares using statistical disaggregation due to zero rainfall in the hourly record fluctuates greatly over the record 97 of the time this is used to disaggregate a daily total of less than 1 mm of rainfall the statistical disaggregation is therefore unlikely to have a large impact on extreme values in the dataset or on subsequent hydrological model simulations 8 evaluation of the hourly gridded dataset ceh gear1hr has statistical properties of interest that are generally consistent with previous gauge derived national scale estimates blenkinsop et al 2017 throughout most of the year the median of the seasonal maximum 1hr rainfall rmax is highest in the mountainous regions and the west of britain fig 13 whilst in the east and lowland areas rmax is highest in summer jja and autumn son the spatial pattern of rmax is also much less coherent and less clearly defined by orogrophy in summer which might be expected from the increased dominance of convective rainfall at this time of year and is consistent with the corresponding results presented in blenkinsop et al 2017 summer also sees the lowest number of wet hours across the country and winter the greatest fig 14 with the influence of topography on this variable evident throughout the year these patterns are as expected broadly consistent with those of daily rainfall occurrence rates jenkins et al 2008 by using both gridded daily data and hourly gauges the new dataset provides additional spatial detail not present in previous maps a more detailed evaluation of the dataset is beyond the scope of this paper but will be provided in a subsequent publication 9 discussion and conclusions a 1 km gridded hourly rainfall dataset has been created for great britain using data from over 1900 quality controlled gauges for the period 1990 2014 we extended and automated a quality control procedure essential for such a large number of gauges to expand the availability of the hourly rain gauge dataset accumulated by blenkinsop et al 2017 we allocated a series of qc flags that identified potentially suspect values and then constructed a set of rules that apply either single or combined qc flags based on knowledge gained from the initial dataset to exclude likely erroneous rainfall amounts accumulations and dry spells a two tiered validation approach at the daily and hourly timescales indicates that spurious extreme values have been excluded from the resultant dataset while assumed legitimate values have been preserved most quality controlled gauges are found to be highly correlated with the ukcp09 observed 5 km dataset at the daily timescale and show a high degree of concordance in terms of rainfall occurrence the resulting gauge density used in this product varies over time and space being particularly sparse in scotland and the southwest of england prior to 2000 and this should be borne in mind when using the dataset a nearest neighbour interpolation scheme was used to provide gridded hourly rainfall values at a resolution of 1 km these data were then used to temporally disaggregate the existing ceh gear daily gridded dataset to produce an hourly dataset with consistent daily totals consistency with the existing ceh gear dataset is an important feature of the new hourly dataset as it will be made freely available hosted and updated alongside the ceh gear product at http eidc ceh ac uk this new dataset will be a valuable resource for hydrologists climate scientists and the broader community wishing to assess current exposure to intense rainfall there are few national datasets available at a sub daily time step yet many hydrological applications require or can be improved by a higher temporal resolution of rainfall data especially for smaller rapidly responding catchments e g archer et al 2016 however we would recommend that the gridded hourly data should not be used for trend analyses due to the short length of the dataset potential gauge level inhomogeneities and the temporal variation in gauges used in the disaggregation kendon et al 2018 examined uk gauges of at least 13 years duration and subsequently corrected for inhomogeneities arising from changes in measurement resolution this was found to have a limited effect on extreme values but can have a significant impact on mean intensities and rainfall occurrence statistics the lack of additional metadata available makes the identification and attribution of other potential inhomogeneities challenging if only gauge data is required the qc procedure presented here can be used to improve the consistency of data by trying to eliminate erroneous extremes whilst maintaining genuine values the qc framework here will therefore also be implemented in the global effort to gather sub daily rainfall data currently being undertaken by the intense intelligent use of climate models for adaptation to non stationary hydrological extremes project which forms part of the world climate research programme s global energy and water exchanges gewex grand challenge on extremes this has identified the importance of developing new and novel qc methods at different timescales and for different locations alexander et al 2016 a key challenge will be to adapt the tests and rules developed here so that they are applicable to different climate regimes and operating practices a by product from the generation of the gridded dataset is an additional dataset comprising the individual qc flags table 1 associated with each hourly value for each gauge this metadata can be obtained alongside the rule base code to allow users who are licensed to use the original gauge data to apply a bespoke rule base to the gauge data this creates a community resource where improvements to the database can be made and shared for different types of analyses one future piece of work could be to explore the uncertainty associated with the implementation of the rule base or more generally the quantification of uncertainty within the gridded hourly precipitation product the importance of adequately assessing uncertainty within model predictions and observations that drive them has been highlighted by a vast array of authors e g beven 2002 pappenberger et al 2006 2008 di baldassarre et al 2010 mcmillan et al 2012 within the field of hydrology the rainfall data used to force a model prediction is a key source of error and therefore the generation of a probabilistic rainfall product would be a valuable next step ahrens and jaun 2007 sideris et al 2014 corresponding products are currently being developed by the reanalysis community bach et al 2016 some key prerequisites for generating a probabilistic rainfall product would be to gain a better understanding of the uncertainties associated with the hourly gauge data for example undercatch the qc process and the interpolation method but ultimately this would also need to be explored at the daily level in the original ceh gear product further potential exists for novel methods to create merged products that take advantage of the spatial detail offered by other sources of data such as radar jewell and gaussiat 2015 examined several schemes to merge radar with tbr data over england and wales all of which produced a merged product that was superior to the individual data sources such products have significant potential to support flood forecasting and may provide improved calibration of hydrological models parkes et al 2013 as a next step we intend to provide added value to the dataset by conducting an assessment of its key characteristics with respect to flooding from intense rainfall and developing freely available gridded datasets of useful indices such as extreme percentiles and peaks over threshold as well as the provision of intensity duration frequency curves we will also evaluate the benefit of using the hourly gridded dataset in hydrological modelling applications 10 declarations of interest none acknowledgements this research forms part of the sinatra

7109,physically based distributed hydrological models are useful for simulating the spatial distribution of hydrologic fluxes across the catchment under various climate and land cover change scenarios however complexities associated with their implementation at large scales make their applications limited previously an equivalent cross section ecs based distributed hydrological modelling approach was developed for first order sub basins to reduce the computational time effort here the ecs approach is modified for semi distributed hydrological modelling at the catchment scale the modelling approach is implemented for a 314 km2 mclaughlin catchment located in south eastern new south wales nsw australia that consists of 822 first order sub basins a 26 year long streamflow record simulated using an ecs based modelling approach are compared against daily observed streamflow and four calibrated lumped conceptual hydrologic models and found to be consistent further the simulated actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture from the ecs approach are compared against the australian water availability project awap model simulations and results found to be consistent in addition the temporal dynamics of simulated soil moisture from the ecs approach is consistent with the satellite derived european space agency climate change initiative esa cci surface soil moisture data in the ecs based semi distributed modelling all parameters are derived from the actual topographic and physiographic information of the catchment and none of the parameters is calibrated therefore this approach has the advantage of simulating streamflow in ungauged catchments compared to lumped conceptual models the impact of spatially distributed climatic forcing and land cover on soil moisture is investigated across four landforms upslope midslope footslope and alluvial flats and at various soil depths our results show increase of mean soil moisture in shallow layers of upslope toward alluvial flats however mean soil moisture in deeper horizons remained almost constant across all landforms the variability of daily soil moisture at surface soil layers is higher than the deeper soil layers for all landforms our results illustrated that disaggregation of a catchment to a series of ecs at the scale of first order sub basins captures dynamics of soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration across the landscape and results are consistent with the climatology land cover type topography and soil hydraulic properties further the use of ecs approach in the mclaughlin catchment reduced the number of computational units by 40 times in comparison to 3 d grid based distributed modelling setup keywords equivalent cross section ecs soil moisture computational time first order sub basin distributed hydrological modelling lumped conceptual hydrological modelling 1 introduction the development and applications of physically based distributed hydrological models have increased in the last two decades due to substantial improvements in geographical information system gis spatial resolution of topographic physiographic and remote sensing data and computational power abbott et al 1986a b abbott and refsgaard 1996 bell et al 2007 beven and kirkby 1979 kampf and burges 2007 reed et al 2004 singh and woolhiser 2002 tague and band 2004 watson et al 1998 wigmosta et al 1994 during this period several distributed hydrological models are developed with various level of complexity including mike she abbott et al 1986a b hydrus 1d 2 d 3d simunek et al 1999 2005 2006 cathy paniconi et al 2003 gssha downer and ogden 2004 modhms panday and huyakorn 2004 parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 grid to grid g2g bell et al 2007 cole and moore 2009 and hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 in these models parameters for every grid cell or hydrologic response units are derived from spatially distributed data such as topography soil type land cover climate and geology in turn spatially distributed fluxes including transpiration soil evaporation deep drainage runoff and soil moisture are obtained across the catchment these extensive spatial fluxes from distributed models are useful for assessing the impact of climate land use and land cover changes on the other end the lumped conceptual models are also very popular in hydrological modelling due to their simple structure and limited parameter requirements beven 2012 kirchner 2006 singh 1995 singh and woolhiser 2002 the lumped conceptual models consider entire catchment as a single unit and simulate discharge at the catchment outlet as a function of lumped representation of catchment storage refsgaard and knudsen 1996 compared the performance of three hydrological models including a fully distributed model mike she abbott et al 1986a b a semi distributed model watbal knudsen et al 1986 and a lumped conceptual model nam nielsen and hansen 1973 they concluded that distributed models performed better than lumped conceptual models in cases where no calibration was allowed and long term streamflow data were not available however often simpler conceptual models are preferred over their distributed counterparts due to significant computational effort of distributed hydrologic models for long term simulations in large catchments or due to the lack of high resolution spatial information about model parameters beven 1989 2001 grayson et al 1992b kirchner 2006 one possible option for reducing the computational effort time in distributed hydrological modelling is to disaggregate the catchment into the smaller homogeneous spatial entities argent et al 2007 beven and kirkby 1979 flugel 1995 reggiani et al 1999 reggiani et al 1998 summerell et al 2005 vertessy et al 1993 watson et al 1999 wood et al 1988 these spatial entities are known with various names including hydrologic response units hrus flugel 1995 representative elementary areas reas wood et al 1988 representative elementary watersheds rews reggiani et al 1998 and functional units fus argent et al 2007 with the term hrus being commonly used in hydrology wood et al 1988 delineated reas on the basis of topography soil and rainfall flugel 1995 and argent et al 2007 developed the concept of hrus and fus on the basis of similarities in topographical and physiographical features of the catchment most of the existing methods of catchment disaggregation either lack contiguity and topological connectivity of hrus or require artificial nodes to connect these entities which restricts the transfer of lateral fluxes from the upper part of a hillslope to the lower parts to address this khan et al 2013 developed an approach to delineate contiguous topologically connected hrus to transfer the fluxes from the upper parts of a hillslope to the lower parts to delineate hrus the entire catchment was divided into four major landforms upslope midslope footslope and alluvial flats four landforms were delineated on the basis of similarities in topographical and geomorphological attributes of a catchment the catchment was also divided into different stream order sub basins based on strahler s convention ensuring that the variability of saturated hydraulic conductivity was least in first order sub basins following the hru delineation khan et al 2014 developed an equivalent cross section ecs approach for semi distributed hydrologic modelling at the scale of first order sub basins where landform based delineated hrus were used as the basis for weighting the topographical and physiographical features of first order sub basins as hrus are embedded in the ecs formulation ecss are capable of transferring fluxes from the upper parts of a hillslope to the lower parts the soil moisture and runoff simulation toolkit smart developed by ajami et al 2016 also used ecs approach in the ecs approach either single or multiple ecss were formulated as a weighted representation of a first order sub basin depending on the arrangement of soil types within the sub basin water balance simulations for these ecss are performed using a 2 d distributed hydrological model the ecs approach was investigated for eight first order sub basins and modelling results showed that it was effective for reducing the computational time effort in a 2 d distributed hydrological modelling without significant loss of accuracy in simulated fluxes khan et al 2014 despite considerable improvement in computational efficiency of the ecs approach in comparison to distributed cross section modelling approaches performance of the ecs approach at a catchment scale with multiple first order sub basins was not investigated in khan et al 2014 further no verification of simulated stream flow against observations was performed due to non availability of streamflow observations at the first order sub basin scale which serves as the motivation of the current study the aims of this study are to 1 modify the ecs approach for semi distributed hydrological modelling at the catchment scale which contains 822 first order sub basins 2 compare simulated streamflow of a calibration free ecs approach with observations and simulations from four calibrated lumped conceptual models and 3 examine soil moisture dynamics for the entire catchment and across four landforms at various soil depths under different climate and land cover types 2 study area this study is conducted for the mclaughlin catchment which is a sub catchment of the snowy river located in the snowy monaro region in south eastern new south wales nsw australia the total catchment area of the mclaughlin up to the confluence of snowy river is 459 km2 the catchment area up to the gauging station is used in this study due to the availability of observed streamflow at the gauging station the mclaughlin catchment up to the gauging station fig 1 a has the area of 314 km2 and consists of 822 first order sub basins the first order sub basins areas vary from 0 8 ha to 283 ha the elevation range in the mclaughlin catchment up to the gauging station varies from 740 m to 1231 m the mclaughlin catchment is considered in this study because this catchment and its neighbouring catchments have been under hydrologic investigation for the last ten years because of changes in land cover during the last 50 years khan et al 2013 tuteja et al 2007 the digital elevation model dem data has the resolution of 25 m 25 m and is derived from the contour and drainage data of nsw topographic maps all data for this research was taken from the previous studies by tuteja et al 2007 2 1 climate and runoff four climate zones were delineated for the mclaughlin and its neighbouring catchments by teng et al 2008 using the climate surfaces of the australian continent developed by jeffrey et al 2001 fig 1b the daily scientific information for land owners silo climate surfaces use daily gauged climate data of approximately 4600 locations across australia the density of these climate stations varies across australia the density of climate stations is high near the coast of australia especially in the south east where the mclaughlin catchment is located the silo climate surfaces use spatial interpolation algorithms to generate daily climate surfaces such as daily rainfall and evaporation at 5 km 5 km spatial resolution jeffrey et al 2001 the root mean square error rmse of monthly silo rainfall for 1990 1997 was 35 1 mm jeffrey et al 2001 in mclaughlin and its neighbouring catchments the range of annual rainfall mean annual rainfall and pan evaporation for four climate zones delineated by teng et al 2008 for the period 1975 2000 are presented in table 1 the mean annual rainfall and pan evaporation for the mclaughlin catchment for the period 1975 2000 are 658 mm y and 992 mm y respectively the annual rainfall for the mclaughlin catchment for a wet year 1978 and a dry year 1982 varies in the range 1041 mm y and 370 mm y respectively and the respective annual pan evaporation values are 933 mm y and 1194 mm y daily streamflow data for the period 1975 2000 at the gauging station is used in this study with the mean annual streamflow of 85 mm y which is significantly lower than the rainfall indicating most of the rainfall is lost to evapotranspiration the delineation of four climate zones used in this study is validated by comparing the range of annual rainfall in four climate zones with the average annual rainfall from silo grid cells the average annual rainfall for 1975 2000 period are calculated for all 26 silo grid cells of size 5 km 5 km located either partly or fully in the mclaughlin catchment fig s 1 in the supplementary material the rainfall pattern at gridded scale matches closely with the rainfall pattern of four climate zones fig 1b this analysis confirms that the delineation of climate zones is correct and the spatial variation of rainfall is well represented by these climate zones 2 2 land cover the mclaughlin catchment mainly consists of three land cover types i e pasture native woody and improved pasture tuteja et al 2006 fig 1c out of which pasture and native woody are the dominant land cover types comprising 86 and 13 of the total area respectively the area under improved pasture is negligible and therefore this land cover class is merged with the pasture in this study the leaf area index lai and root biomass distributions of pasture and native woody land cover types are taken from tuteja et al 2006 2007 2 3 soil type and depth murphy et al 2005 developed a soils information package for the mclaughlin and neighbouring catchments which comprises spatial distribution of soil types soil depth and soil hydraulic properties on the basis of their respective parent material ancillary data sources and field observations murphy et al 2005 categorized individual soil types on the basis of similarities in metadata associated with each soil type e g particle size analysis bulk density and water holding capacity the soil hydraulic properties were determined using pedotransfer function ptf models of minasny and mcbratney 2002 and schaap and leij 1998 the soil types map and soil hydraulic properties of the mclaughlin catchment are presented in fig s 2 and table s 1 respectively of the supplementary material on the basis of this data a 25 m 25 m pixel size raster of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of the top soil horizon material is generated fig 1d for the mclaughlin catchment the variation of ksat is in the range of 4 8 cm d to 105 cm d these values are inferred on the basis of soil physical properties e g particle size distributions and bulk density soil toposequences extensive field work and laboratory analysis chapman and atkinson 2000 geeves et al 1995 murphy et al 2005 while acknowledging uncertainty around ksat values we note that these are high quality soils data sets for large catchments soil depth data is taken from murphy et al 2005 based on the methodology of mckenzie et al 2003 the soil depths are higher near valley bottoms and lower at the top of hillslopes 3 catchment modelling semi distributed modelling using the ecs approach consists of the following steps 1 delineating first order sub basins 2 delineating hrus using topographic and geomorphic analysis of the entire catchment 3 ecs delineation 4 2 dimensional soil moisture model simulations across every ecs in a first order sub basin and 5 post processing of outputs the description of 2 dimensional soil moisture movement model hrus and ecs approach and catchment modelling methodology are presented in the following sub sections 3 1 2 dimensional richards equation based unsaturated soil moisture movement model the unsaturated soil moisture movement model u3m 2d developed by tuteja et al 2004 is used to perform the hydrological modelling across the ecss of the mclaughlin catchment this model is based on the 2 d solution of richards equation the richards equation has been criticised for simulating the hydrologic fluxes at coarse scale as it was originally derived at point scale beven 2001 beven 2012 grayson et al 1992a grayson et al 1992b kirchner 2006 singh and woolhiser 2002 and may not capture non linearity of hydrological processes at various scales however still majority of existing physically based distributed hydrological models use the richards equation either1 d 2 d or 3 d formulation to calculate unsaturated zone fluxes these models include mike she abbott et al 1986a abbott et al 1986b hydrus 1d 2 d 3d simunek et al 1999 2005 2006 cathy paniconi et al 2003 gssha downer and ogden 2004 modhms panday and huyakorn 2004 tribs veggie ivanov et al 2008a b parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 and hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 previous investigations have shown that these models have been successful in simulating the hydrological fluxes at catchment scale the richards equation based u3m 2d model has also been successful in simulating the hydrological fluxes from the ecss khan et al 2014 the u3m 2d model is an extended version of 1 d unsaturated soil moisture movement model u3m 1d developed by vaze et al 2004 which was based on 1 d solution of richards equation the detailed concept and equations used in u3m 2d are presented in section 3 11 3 13 of tuteja et al 2004 see http www toolkit net au tools class u3m 1d publications for details the model requires four types of input data for each modelling element pixel 1 climate which includes daily rainfall pan evaporation maximum and minimum temperature and radiation 2 soil hydraulic properties and soil depths 3 root biomass distribution and leaf area index lai of each land cover types and 4 elevation and slope of each pixel u3m 2d divides the entire soil column into four soil horizons or soil materials and each soil material is further divided into thinner soil layers for computational purpose the model uses three boundary conditions 1 specified flux rainfall minus potential soil evaporation at the soil surface 2 free drainage boundary condition at the bottom of the soil profile specified head or specified flux boundary condition is also available in the model for the bottom of the soil profile and 3 specified flux representing soil moisture contribution from upslope pixels across each soil material of the soil profile the u3m 2d model uses richards equation for performing local water balance computations along the vertical axis for each soil layer of every pixel of a hillslope cross section while accounting for flux from the upslope areas gravity drainage capillary rise evapotranspiration soil moisture and downslope soil water outflow are then computed for each pixel a variable sub daily time step is used for partitioning the water balance transpiration soil evaporation deep drainage and soil moisture excess in the unsaturated zone the sub daily computational time step varies from user defined minimum e g 5 min to maximum e g 1 hr and exact values are decided on the basis of rainfall intensity the smaller time step e g 5 min is considered for the very high intensity rainfall e g 1000 mm d and 1 hr time step for the low intensity rainfall e g 5 mm d for rainfall intensity in between these two extremes the time steps are adaptively adjusted depending on the transient soil moisture conditions to calculate rainfall intensity at a sub daily time step u3m 2d disaggregates the input daily rainfall data by dividing the daily rainfall with the user defined time step used in the vertical water balance calculation for example an hourly time step is used for low rainfall intensity of 5 mm d potential plant transpiration and potential soil evaporation are calculated from potential evapotranspiration on the basis of monthly lai and land cover type actual transpiration and soil evaporation are dynamically calculated on the basis of available water in the root zone user defined root biomass distribution and transpiration factor derived from the wilting point field capacity and saturated soil moisture contents the horizontal water balance component of u3m 2d model performs the computations at daily time scale the excess moisture arising from the variably saturated conditions within each soil material is aggregated at a daily time scale and horizontally transferred to the respective soil materials in the next downslope pixel based on darcy s law the daily simulated fluxes for each pixel are soil moisture actual transpiration soil evaporation horizontal fluxes and drainage below the root zone deep drainage 3 2 overview of sub basin hru and equivalent cross section delineation approach catchment modelling starts with dividing the catchment into strahler s first order sub basins the order of sub basins was decided on the basis of variation in saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils as sub basins are aggregated to higher units i e second and higher order sub basins results from khan et al 2013 showed significant increases in saturated hydraulic conductivity variability in higher order sub basins therefore first order sub basins are selected as units for aggregating and transferring hydrologic fluxes down the stream within a first order sub basin contiguous topologically connected hrus are delineated to transfer the soil moisture fluxes from the upper parts of a hillslope to the lower parts khan et al 2013 derived landform delineation thresholds from a range of terrain analysis techniques the cumulative area distribution cad curve average local slope curvature compound topographic index cti and the multi resolution valley bottom flatness mrvbf index and divided the catchment into four major landforms upslope midslope footslope and alluvial flats these landforms represent the macroscopic changes in the catchment landscapes the widths of alluvial flats footslope midslope and upslope are 0 25 m 25 75 m 75 350 m and 350 m respectively for the mclaughlin catchment note that the delineated landform widths are smaller near the stream network and increases with distance from the stream in order to represent the saturation zone more appropriately near the stream network these hrus were used as the basis for formulating the ecs approach at the first order sub basin scale to reduce the computational time effort in distributed hydrological modelling without significant reduction in accuracy khan et al 2014 to formulate an ecs multiple cross sections are delineated in a sub basin and then the topographical and physiographical features of cross sections are length weighted averaged on a landform basis within a sub basin depending on the soil type pattern single or multiple ecs in each strahler s first order sub basin were formulated to represent the full or a part of the sub basin soil type pattern within a sub basin determine the number of ecs as follows 1 if the soil types remain unchanged within a sub basin then a single equivalent cross section can represent the entire sub basin 2 if the soil types are consistent with landform pattern i e different soil near the center of the river and changes towards the ridge line then the three equivalent cross sections left bank right bank and head water can represent a sub basin and 3 if the soil types do not follow a landform pattern or any other systematic pattern at least one equivalent cross section in each soil type is required to represent a sub basin khan et al 2014 investigated the ecs approach for seven discrete first order sub basins of the mclaughlin catchment along with the wagga wagga experimental catchment the simulated fluxes from the ecs approach were compared with the simulated fluxes from the distributed modelling at multiple cross sections the fluxes obtained from both approaches were very close whereas the computational time reduced significantly using the ecs approach as observed streamflow data for the first order sub basins were not available the ecs approach was validated using soil moisture observations in the wagga wagga experimental catchment and results found to be consistent with the observed soil moisture khan et al 2014 the soil moisture and runoff simulation toolkit smart developed by ajami et al 2016 used ecs approach here the ecs approach is modified to perform semi distributed hydrological modelling at the catchment scale and to compare the simulated runoff with the observed discharge at the catchment outlet 3 3 catchment scale modelling using the equivalent cross sections with four landforms a summary of the ecs formulation with four landforms ecs 4lf for catchment scale modelling is presented in fig 2 as can be seen in fig 2a a sample first order sub basin contains four landforms upslope midslope footslope and alluvial flats to maintain topological connectivity in a hillslope the mclaughlin catchment contains 822 first order sub basins fig 1a with variety of soil types fig s 2 in supplementary material and fig 1d to formulate the ecs for 822 first order sub basins in an automated manner it is essential to maintain consistency in ecs formulation approach throughout all sub basins therefore all ecs are formulated on the basis of soil types and landforms for example if the first order sub basin has three soil types fig 2b three ecs one each for each soil type are formulated fig 2c and in the case of one soil type only a single ecs is formulated for the entire sub basin to formulate ecss on a four landform basis ecs 4lf first order sub basins layer of the catchment is overlaid with the soil type and landform layers fig 3 therefore each first order sub basin will contain soil type polygons and within each soil polygon landforms are available one ecs 4lf is formulated for each soil type polygon within each first order sub basin fig 3 to perform the 2 d distributed hydrologic modelling on each ecs 4lf the following topographical and physiographical parameters are required for each pixel of the ecs 4lf elevation soil depths slope climate land cover and soil type the following parameters are calculated for each landform of the ecs width slope elevation land cover and climate to compute landform width it is assumed that the shape of each landform polygon is rectangular this is a reasonable assumption because the actual landforms are generally long narrow curvy strips and they can be replicated by equal area perimeter rectangles fig 2a 3 eq 1 is used to calculate the width of each landform within a soil polygon using its area and perimeter 1 w i p i p i 2 16 a i 4 where i 1 upslope 2 midslope 3 footslope and 4 alluvial flats w i is the width of landform i and ai and pi are the area and perimeter of the landform i respectively calculated in arcgis the 2 d distributed hydrological modelling of an ecs 4lf is performed along the length of an ecs 4lf obtained by summation of the widths of all landforms i e upslope midslope footslope and alluvial flats within a soil polygon note that khan et al 2014 calculated the length of an ecs by arithmetic averaging of the lengths of multiple cross sections drawn in a first order sub basin drawing of multiple cross sections in each first order sub basin is not practically feasible here as the number of sub basins is large 822 and the ecs formulation needs to be automated therefore calculation of ecs 4lf length is simplified for formulating the ecs 4lf in 822 first order sub basins the length of an ecs 4lf is divided into 25 m interval i e the resolution of dem data and model parameters are obtained for each element average slope of each landform within a soil polygon is obtained by averaging local slope of all grid cells 25 m 25 m in a landform local slope is calculated in arcgis using available dem data and the average landform slope is used in formulating an ecs 4lf fig 3 in a similar manner average soil depths of all four soil materials horizons for each landform are calculated from the available soil depth rasters of individual soil material horizons fig 3 note that khan et al 2014 calculated the slope and soil depth of each landform of an ecs by length weighted averaging of slope and soil depth of multiple cross sections drawn in a first order sub basin but as stated above drawing of multiple cross sections in each first order sub basin is not practically feasible due to number of sub basins therefore calculation of slope and soil depth is simplified here for the climate and land cover type only the dominant class in each landform within a soil polygon of a first order sub basin is obtained for example if 80 area of a landform is covered with pasture and 20 covered with native woody then the pasture land cover is assigned for this landform and the associated 25 m pixels fig 3 the maximum elevation of each landform is calculated from the dem data this elevation was assigned to the first upslope pixel of the uppermost landform in an ecs 4lf the elevations of other pixels in the ecs 4lf are calculated with the help of average slope of landforms and landform widths which are calculated earlier fig 3 the land cover types climate zones soil depths of all soil materials and slopes are considered constant within those pixels of an ecs 4lf that are located within the same landform for example if an ecs 4lf is 250 m long 10 pixels and upslope contains 3 pixels then the land cover type dominant climate zone dominant soil depth average and slope average of these 3 pixels remain the same in this manner a total of 2392 ecss 4lf are formulated for 822 first order sub basins in the mclaughlin catchment the 2 d distributed hydrological modelling is performed for every ecs 4lf using the u3m 2d at a pixel scale the connectivity of first order sub basins with stream network is shown in fig 1a the simulated results are available for each pixel of an ecs 4lf and it includes daily soil moisture actual transpiration soil evaporation horizontal fluxes and drainage below the root zone deep drainage initial processing of the topographical and physiographical data for formulating an ecs 4lf is performed in arcgis and the final output organized in an attribute table which contains ecs properties later r and matlab scripts are written to process this data and prepare input data files in an automated manner for the u3m 2d model the soil hydraulic properties and land cover related parameters are also assigned in input files using r and matlab scripts the u3m 2d model written in c run for 2392 ecs 4lf using a workflow based approach which is written in r the simulated data is post processed using r scripts 3 4 catchment scale modelling using the equivalent cross sections with single landform to investigate the impact of aggregating ecs properties in simulated fluxes the four landforms of an ecs are replaced with a single landform the method of formulating and processing of geospatial data in the equivalent cross section on a single landform basis ecs slf is similar to the ecs 4lf the major difference is on the averaging weighting of topographical and physiographical properties of an ecs is performed on a single landform instead of four landforms as one ecs slf is delineated per soil polygon the average slope of all grid cells in a soil polygon is calculated as there is only one landform within a soil polygon in a similar manner average soil depths of all four soil materials horizons for each soil polygon are calculated from the available soil depth rasters of individual soil material horizons for the climate and land cover type only the dominant class in each soil polygon of a first order sub basin is obtained for example if 80 area of a soil polygon is covered with pasture and 20 covered with native woody then the pasture land cover is assigned for this single landform and the associated 25 m pixels to compute the single landform width the soil polygons are assumed to be an equivalent square and the width of a square is calculated by taking the square root of soil polygon area this is a reasonable assumption as areas of polygons are preserved here compared to the ecs 4lf and the equivalent square concept helps in automating ecs formulation in large catchments the maximum elevation of each soil polygon is calculated from the dem and was assigned to the first upslope pixel of an ecs slf the elevations of other pixels in the ecs slf are calculated with the help of the average slope of a single landform and landform width calculated earlier the land cover types climate zones soil depths of all soil materials and slopes are considered constant within each pixel of single landform for example if a single landform is 250 m long 10 pixels then the land cover type dominant climate zone dominant soil depth average and slope average of these 10 pixels remain the same note that in this example the length of ecs slf will also be 10 pixels as there is only one landform in each ecs in this manner a total of 2458 ecss slf are formulated for 822 first order sub basins in the mclaughlin catchment simulations across ecs slf are performed using the u3m 2d at pixel scale as described in section 3 3 note that the u3m 2d model remains unaltered in both the ecs 4lf or ecs slf approaches presented here in each case the model is applied at a pixel scale with parameters derived for four or a single landform depending on whether the ecs 4lf or ecs slf approach is considered 3 5 catchment modelling using lumped conceptual models in the ecs 4lf and ecs slf based distributed modelling approaches actual topographical and physiographical parameters were obtained from the geospatial data without any calibration to compare the ecs 4lf and ecs slf based modelling simulations against lumped conceptual models which require thorough calibration four lumped conceptual models gr4j sacramento simhyd and smar in different setups are used 3 5 1 gr4j a four parameter based lumped conceptual model gr4j developed by perrin et al 2003 is used within wafari2 water availability forecast of australian rivers modelling system which is the modified version of wafari developed by the bureau of meteorology australia to issue seasonal streamflow forecasts shin et al 2011 tuteja et al 2011 the gr4j model is selected because of its high performance in simulating streamflow for a wide range of australian catchments the gr4j model is calibrated for each year in cross validation mode for the period 1970 2000 using a 5 year leave out window as an example when simulating streamflow for 1981 gr4j is calibrated using data for 1970 1980 and 1986 2000 similarly the 5 years moving leave out window steps through all years during 1970 2000 altogether 200 parameter sets are generated by using a weighted least square wls option for the total error model to define the objective function in the bayesian total error analysis batea framework within the wafari2 modelling system kavetski et al 2006a b shin et al 2011 tuteja et al 2011 generated parameter sets for each year are used in the model to generate 200 ensembles of daily streamflow for each year with the observed daily rainfall and evaporation data the differences between these 200 ensembles are negligible and therefore median mean or even a single ensemble member gives the same results in this study median of 200 ensembles is considered for each year and a continuous daily time series of simulated streamflow for the entire study period i e 1975 2000 is generated using the mclaughlin daily rainfall and potential evapotranspiration data 3 5 2 sacramento simhyd and smar simulations three lumped conceptual models sacramento burnash 1985 burnash et al 1973 simhyd chiew et al 2002 and smar kachroo 1992 o connell et al 1970 tuteja and cunnane 1999 are also specified for the mclaughlin catchment to compare with the simulations from the ecs 4lf and ecs slf cases these widely used lumped models are specified by dividing the entire data length 1975 2000 into two equal parts for model calibration 1975 1987 and validation 1988 2000 the 1970 1974 simulation period is considered as the warm up period the computer programs for all three models sacramento simhyd and smar are obtained from the rainfall runoff library rrl podger 2004 model calibration is performed using the shuffled complex evolution method sce ua duan et al 1993 1994 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is used as the objective function a continuous daily time series of simulated streamflow for the entire study period i e 1975 2000 is generated using the optimized parameters for each model 3 6 waterdyn awap model for evapotranspiration and soil moisture verification the waterdyn model was developed under the australian water availability project awap by csiro raupach et al 2009 the waterdyn awap model is a terrestrial water balance model runs at 5 km 5 km grid scale and solves the water balance equations mainly in unsaturated soil columns at a daily time step raupach et al 2009 to verify the simulated evapotranspiration from the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches simulated monthly evapotranspiration from the waterdyn model is used as no eddy covariance or sap flux data is available the spatial variation of average annual evapotranspiration and soil moisture for the entire study period 1975 2000 wet year 1978 and dry year 1982 from the waterdyn awap model are also compared with the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches the results are presented and discussed in section 4 2 3 3 7 satellite derived data for soil moisture verification the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci surface soil moisture data are used to verify simulated soil moisture from the ecs 4lf approach the esa cci has released daily surface 2 cm soil moisture products at a spatial resolution of 0 25 approximately 25 km at equator using seven passive and three active microwave spaceborne instruments covering 38 years from november 1 1978 to december 31 2016 current version 04 2 http www esa soilmoisture cci org liu et al 2012 three products are available in the cci soil moisture active passive and active passive combined data which have been comprehensively validated at the global scale and applied for long term studies with promising performances dorigo et al 2017 kim et al 2018 miralles et al 2013 the esa cci soil moisture is a composite product from the multiple passive and active microwave spaceborne instruments and there have been advances in the quality and temporal coverage of the product through time the 1979 1987 data product is based on a single instrument while the 1991 2000 data are from the multiple advanced instruments chung et al 2018 further the number of observations in each year is high during 1991 2000 period in comparison to the 1979 1987 period there are no observations available during aug 1987 to jul 1991 period in esa cci soil moisture data set covering the study catchment considering the significant differences in quality and number of observations in esa cci soil moisture data set during 1979 1987 and 1991 2000 periods the 1991 2000 data set is used in this study from the esa cci soil moisture data area weighted catchment average daily soil moisture is generated for the mclaughlin catchment this data is compared with the landform area weighted catchment average daily simulated soil moisture from the top model layer 10 cm in the ecs 4lf approach the results are presented and discussed in section 4 2 4 4 results and discussion the comparison of simulated streamflows from the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches with the observed streamflow and four conceptual models are presented in the following sub sections the spatial distribution of hydrological fluxes and analysis of soil moisture dynamics for different climates and different land covers of the entire catchment and landforms from the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are also presented 4 1 comparison of simulated and observed streamflows the daily time series of simulated streamflows from all models and approaches are compared with the observed streamflows in the following sub section further the scatter between the simulated and observed streamflows and bias are also compared in the following sub sections 4 1 1 comparison of daily flow series for a selected year daily horizontal fluxes and deep drainage are simulated for each pixel of an ecs 4lf and ecs slf using the u3m 2d model the deep drainage from all the pixels in ecs 4lf and ecs slf are arithmetically averaged and added with the horizontal fluxes from the last pixel to obtain the total streamflow from the single ecs 4lf and ecs slf total streamflow from every ecs is multiplied by the soil polygon area from which the ecs 4lf or ecs slf was formulated to obtain weighted total streamflow for a first order sub basin the weighted total daily streamflow from all 822 sub basins are added to obtain the total simulated streamflow at the outlet of mclaughlin catchment simulated daily streamflow from the ecs approach and four conceptual models gr4j sacramento simhyd and smar are shown for the year 1995 as it is one of the validation years for the lumped conceptual models fig 4 a f the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and mean absolute error mae values for the entire simulation period i e 1975 2000 at daily monthly and annual time scales are presented in tables 2 and 3 respectively the daily nse of the ecs 4lf simulation is lower than all four conceptual models tables 2 however at the monthly time scale performance of the ecs 4lf approach is improved and is comparable with other conceptual models tables 2 at annual time scale the ecs 4lf approach has the second highest nse after the sacramento model tables 2 daily monthly and annual nse values of the ecs 4lf approach are higher than the ecs slf approach the daily mae of the ecs 4lf approach is very low and only the mae of gr4j is lower than the ecs 4lf approach table 3 the monthly and annual mae values of ecs 4lf approach are higher than the sacramento and smar models close to gr4j model and lower than the simhyd model table 3 the mae values of ecs slf at daily monthly and annual scale are higher than the ecs 4lf approach table 3 it should be noted that the nse values are more influenced by accurately simulating high flows whereas mae reflect the overall performance i e high as well as low flows as a result it can be concluded that the overall performance of the ecs 4lf approach is reasonable given no calibration is involved in its specification and this approach has the potential to be applied in ungauged areas at a daily time scale the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches simulate low flows well fig 4a f while underestimating the very high flow events fig 4a b performance of conceptual models for streamflow simulation varies the gr4j model overestimates high flows in 1995 but simulates low flows with reasonable accuracy fig 4c the sacramento and simhyd models overestimate high and low flows in 1995 fig 4d and e the smar model simulates low as well as high flows reasonably well but it underestimates a few high flow events in 1995 fig 4f the performance of ecs 4lf at a daily time scale is reasonable by considering that no parameter adjustment is performed for this approach and all parameters are directly derived from the topographical and physiographical features of the catchment 4 1 2 overall model performance comparison the bias of daily simulated streamflow is calculated by estimating the average difference between the simulated and observed streamflows for the entire period 1975 2000 the positive bias indicates overestimation of streamflows by the model and negative bias indicates underestimation the ecs 4lf ecs slf and gr4j models have small bias during low flows whereas high negative bias exists for some of the high flow events fig 5 a c the sacramento model has mostly positive bias in low and high flows and it overestimates some of the high flow events fig 5d the simhyd model significantly overestimates low and high flows as shown by a large positive bias throughout the simulations fig 5e the bias in smar is slightly smaller than the other five models during low and high flow periods fig 5f though none of these models perform extraordinarily well all conceptual models require observed streamflows to optimise parameter sets which is not the case with ecs 4lf and all parameters are directly derived from the topographical and physiographical features of the catchment as a result it can be concluded that the ecs 4lf approach can be applied in ungauged catchments with reasonable accuracy water balance partitioning based on ecs 4lf approach revealed that the actual evapotranspiration constitutes around 82 of rainfall for the whole study period whereas the deep drainage and horizontal flows constitute around 15 and 2 respectively of rainfall therefore the majority of rainfall evapotranspires and only a small amount of rainfall contributes to streamflow previously khan et al 2014 performed 2 d distributed modelling on multiple cross sections on seven first order sub basins properties of these cross sections are derived from actual topographic and physiographic properties of each pixel in a cross section comparison of simulated soil moisture and various hydrological fluxes including transpiration and soil evaporation from the ecs approach found to be consistent with these distributed cross section simulations in particular simulated evapotranspiration from the ecs approach closely resembles distributed cross section simulations we further assess accuracy of simulated evapotranspiration using data from the australian water availability project raupach et al 2009 presented in section 4 2 to analyse sensitivity of streamflow to initial soil moisture conditions two extreme initial conditions very wet close to saturation and very dry close to residual moisture content are considered in the ecs 4lf approach the ecs 4lf simulations with average initial soil moisture conditions are presented throughout this paper comparison of three simulated streamflow time series from the wet dry and average initial condition with daily observed streamflow shows that the initial soil moisture conditions cause small differences in simulated streamflows for the first few 8 9 months after that the impact of initial condition diminishes and all three simulated time series become similar figures are not presented here but are available from the authors on request one of the major benefits of the ecs 4lf with u3m 2d model approach over the conceptual models is that it provides a variety of spatially distributed hydrological fluxes in addition to streamflow whereas the conceptual models only provide catchment average outputs the various spatially distributed hydrological fluxes will be discussed in the following sections in comparison with the 3 d grid based distributed modelling approaches the number of modelling elements decreased substantially from 501 953 pixels for a 3 d case to 12 430 pixels for the ecs 4lf approach in the mclaughlin catchment this 40 times reduction in the number of computational units is irrespective of cpu speed and decreases the computational time at the same order i e 40 this reduction in computational units time will enable hydrologic modellers to assess long term climate change impacts in large catchments using high resolution spatial information and also to perform uncertainty analysis using multiple climate change scenarios the impact of channel routing on simulated streamflow from the ecs 4lf approach is also explored three routing models are applied at the catchment scale these are the muskingum model cunge 1969 nash 1959 ordinary least square ols model liang and nash 1988 and linear perturbation model lpm nash and barsi 1983 to apply these models single input and single output routing schemes are considered and parameters of the routing models are calibrated using the observed streamflow data while adding these routing models slightly improved simulated streamflow the results were not consistent throughout the study period as a result the routing models were not considered due to calibration of routing parameters in addition channel routing becomes important in catchments that are larger than the study catchment liang and nash 1988 for those very large catchments calibration free channel routing models can be developed similar to those used for ungauged areas all simulation results presented here are based on derived parameter values from the actual topographical and physiographical features of the catchment and no calibration was performed as channel routing is not considered in the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches water storage mechanism in channels cannot be considered however the impacts of unsaturated zone storage on streamflow and the rest of catchment fluxes are considered in the u3m 2d model 4 2 spatial variability of catchment scale fluxes in relation to climate and land cover daily actual transpiration and soil evaporation are simulated on each pixel of an ecs 4lf and ecs slf using the u3m 2d model the actual transpiration and soil evaporation are added to calculate daily actual evapotranspiration for the ecs 4lf approach actual evapotranspiration values for each landform within a soil polygon were obtained as an arithmetic average of pixels located in the same landform inside a soil polygon of a first order sub basin in the ecs slf approach as there is only a single landform in each soil polygon the actual evapotranspiration values were obtained as an arithmetic average of pixels located inside a soil polygon of a first order sub basin fig 6 a and 7a present the spatial variation of average annual evapotranspiration from the ecs 4lf approach at landform scale and ecs slf approach at soil polygon scale respectively across the mclaughlin catchment for the period 1975 2000 daily soil moistures are simulated for each pixel of an ecs 4lf and ecs slf at various depths to obtain mean annual soil moisture for each landform within a soil polygon for the ecs 4lf approach the soil moisture values of all pixels in a given landform are averaged for the duration of the analysis in a similar manner for the ecs slf approach the soil moisture values of all pixels in a soil polygon are averaged for the duration of the analysis to obtain mean annual soil moisture for each soil polygon results are only presented for the surface soil layer of 10 cm depth fig 6d for ecs 4lf and 7d for ecs slf the averaging of pixel values in a given landform will result in uniform soil moisture and evapotranspiration values in a landform because the alluvial flat landform width is 0 25 m saturation in soil moisture generally occurs near the stream network the width of footslope is 50 m 25 m to 75 m from the stream network therefore this landform will show average soil moisture of two pixels in the ecs 4lf approach to compare the soil moisture distribution across a wet and a dry year average wet year 1978 and dry year 1982 soil moisture values for the ecs 4lf and ecs slf are also mapped in figs 6e f 7e f respectively further the spatial pattern of evapotranspiration in a wet 1978 versus a dry year 1982 for ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are presented in figs 6b c 7b c respectively 4 2 1 spatial variability of evapotranspiration simulated average annual evapotranspiration in the mclaughlin catchment ranges from 414 mm y to 682 mm y for the ecs 4lf and 426 mm y to 680 mm y for the ecs slf approach figs 6a 7a the ranges of average annual evapotranspiration in both ecs approaches are very close but the ecs slf range is slightly narrower because the averaging of topographical and physiographical properties is done at the soil polygon scale instead of four landforms in a sub basin on average evapotranspiration for native woody and pasture land cover types are 555 mm y and 538 mm y respectively for the ecs 4lf approach whereas these are 557 mm y and 537 mm y respectively for ecs slf approach evapotranspiration is higher for the native woody compared to the pasture due to higher water use efficiency e g higher lai and deeper roots of the native woody vegetation figs 6a 7a 1c mean annual evapotranspiration in a wet year varies between 367 mm y to 628 mm y for the ecs 4lf approach and 371 mm y to 627 mm y for the ecs slf approach the rainfall and potential evapotranspiration are 1041 mm y and 793 mm y respectively jeffrey et al 2001 teng et al 2008 figs 6b 7b the maximum evapotranspiration in both ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are lower than the potential evapotranspiration in a wet year due to higher frequency of anoxic condition caused by fully saturated conditions in the root zone despite the higher rainfall in the upper part of the catchment compared to the low land the evapotranspiration is lower due to the lower potential evapotranspiration in climate zones c d table 1 and frequency of anoxic conditions mean annual evapotranspiration in a dry year varies between 304 mm y to 807 mm y for the ecs 4lf approach and 311 mm y to 805 mm y for ecs slf approach fig 6c 7c the evapotranspiration in a dry year strongly shows the pattern of climate zones rainfall for ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches fig 6c 7c 1b table 1 the rainfall amount in a dry year is very low i e 370 mm y and potential evapotranspiration is high i e 1015 mm y therefore actual evapotranspiration is highly controlled by the limited available water in a dry year the upper ranges of evapotranspiration in the dry year for both ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are higher than the wet year because the potential evapotranspiration in the dry year is significantly higher 1015 mm y than the wet year 793 mm y fig 6b c 7b c a common trend found in the first order sub basins of all evapotranspiration maps in the ecs 4lf approach fig 6a c is that evapotranspiration is gradually increasing from the upper landforms i e upslope toward the bottom landform i e alluvial flats however this trend is not presented in evapotranspiration maps of ecs slf approach because the entire soil polygon is treated as one landform fig 7 a c therefore the ecs 4lf approach is superior to the ecs slf approach in representing the spatial variation of evapotranspiration along the hillslopes the increasing trend of evapotranspiration from the upper landform to the bottom landform is consistent with the field scenarios as evapotranspiration is high in the wetter zones located close to the river network further it is also consistent with the increasing trend in soil moisture from the upper landforms to bottom landforms as discussed in the next section which shows that the evapotranspiration is highly controlled by the amount of available water in the root zones in both ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches most of the evapotranspiration occurs in shallow rooting pasture as it covers around 86 of the entire catchment and the remainder is the native woody covering 13 of the catchment the simulated evapotranspiration from the ecs 4lf is very close to the ecs slf approach but the ecs slf approach is unable to simulate the evapotranspiration at a landform scale note that the evapotranspiration is the dominant flux in the mclaughlin catchment the comparison of simulated evapotranspiration from ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches with the simulated evapotranspiration from waterdyn model raupach et al 2009 is presented in detail in section 4 2 3 4 2 2 spatial variability of soil moisture the average soil moisture maps for ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches for the whole study period wet year and dry year show lower soil moisture values in the upper part of the catchment and in few areas of the lower part of the catchment figs 6d f 7d f in the upper part of the catchment soil moisture values are lower because of higher evapotranspiration from the native woody and the presence of shallow yellow earth granite and earthy sands granite soil types in these soil types surface soil material has significantly higher saturated hydraulic conductivity than the deeper soil materials causing more water to move down in the deeper soil materials and retain less water in the surface soil material fig 1c d and fig s 2 in supplementary material the lower values of soil moisture in few areas of the lower part of the catchment such as along the main stem of the river network are mostly due to the dominance of lithosols metasediments soil type figs 6d f 7d f 1d and fig s 2 in supplementary material the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of lithosols metasediments is 24 cm d in all four soil horizons materials table s 1 in the supplementary material these high values of ksat in the lower soil horizons materials allow more water to pass downwards as deep drainage and less moisture is retained in top soil layers figs 6d f 7d f 1d and fig s 2 in supplementary material further all soil moisture maps in ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches closely reflect soil types and climate zones pattern figs 6d f 7d f 1b d and fig s 2 in supplementary material in particular the soil type pattern dominates because the soil type plays an important role for simulating the water balance and soil moisture values the average surface soil moisture for the ecs 4lf and ecs slf during the whole study period 26 yr varies from 0 12 m3 m3 to 0 41 m3 m3 over the entire catchment for the wet year 1978 this ranges between 0 14 m3 m3 to 0 42 m3 m3 figs 6d e and 7d e for the dry year 1982 the average soil moisture for the ecs 4lf varies from 0 09 m3 m3 to 0 37 m3 m3 and for the ecs slf varies from 0 09 m3 m3 to 0 36 m3 m3 figs 6f and 7f as can be seen in these figures no significant differences between the ecs 4lf and ecs slf simulations are observed when ranges of soil moisture for the whole duration wet year or dry year are considered as it is expected soil moisture values are higher in a wet year compared to the dry year for both ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches throughout the catchment reflecting the influence of input rainfall and potential evapotranspiration figs 6e f 7e f in the ecs 4lf approach all three soil moisture maps show that the bottom landforms i e alluvial flats have higher soil moisture values compared to the rest of the landforms because of higher saturation near the river network fig 6d f this pattern is not visible in some sub basins in the lower part of the catchment especially along the main stem of the river network fig 6d f low soil moisture values in these regions are due to the prevalence of lithosols metasediments soil type that allows more deep drainage and less moisture retained in the top soil layers fig 6d f and fig s 2 in supplementary material small water content of the top soil layer in all four landforms upslope midslope footslope and alluvial flats of the main river network results in small variation of soil moisture in these landforms during wet and dry periods fig 6d f the increase in soil moisture near the river network cannot be seen in soil moisture maps from the ecs slf approach as the entire soil polygon is treated as a single landform fig 7d f this highlights the importance of using multiple landforms in the ecs approach to simulate the spatial variability of land surface states and fluxes the variability of soil moisture across landforms in the ecs 4lf approach will be discussed in detail in section 4 3 note that the spatial variation of evapotranspiration and soil moisture cannot be simulated in lumped conceptual models as the entire catchment is treated as a single unit this highlights the importance of using the ecs 4lf based semi distributed modelling approach the spatial comparison of simulated soil moisture from ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches with the simulated soil moisture from waterdyn model raupach et al 2009 is presented in the next section 4 2 3 verification of evapotranspiration and soil moisture from waterdyn awap model the monthly simulated evapotranspiration values for 1975 2000 period are extracted from the waterdyn awap model developed by raupach et al 2009 for the grids which are either completely or partly located in the mclaughlin catchment the weighted monthly evapotranspiration is calculated for the entire mclaughlin catchment from these gridded data and compared with the ecs 4lf and ecs slf simulated evapotranspiration fig 8 a b the simulated evapotranspiration from both ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are very close to the waterdyn awap model throughout the simulation period the average annual evapotranspiration for the entire study period 1975 2000 wet year 1978 and dry year 1982 from the waterdyn awap model are also estimated and presented in fig 9 a c the spatial variation of evapotranspiration of waterdyn awap model is consistent with the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches figs 6a c 7a c and 9a c the average annual evapotranspiration for 1975 2000 from the waterdyn awap model is higher in the upper part of the catchment and gradually decreases towards the lower part of the catchment this spatial pattern is consistent with the spatial pattern of evapotranspiration from the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches figs 6a 7a and 9a in the wet year 1978 simulated evapotranspiration from the waterdyn awap model is higher than the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches as shown in the evapotranspiration time series plot figs 6b 7b 8a and 9b in terms of spatial patterns simulated evapotranspiration in the upper part of the catchment where climate zones c d are located by the waterdyn awap are significantly higher ranges 700 to 790 mm than the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches with ranges from 330 to 660 mm figs 1b 6b 7b and 9b the reason for these differences particularly in the wet year is mainly related to the consideration of anoxic conditions in the root zone in u3m 2d model caused by increases in soil saturation in the dry year 1982 the spatial pattern of evapotranspiration from the waterdyn awap model is consistent with the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches and all three modelling approaches show higher evapotranspiration in the upper part of the catchment and evapotranspiration is gradually decreasing towards the lower part of the catchment figs 6c 7c and 9c in the upper part of the catchment where climate zones c d are located the ranges of evapotranspiration from ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are high ranges 360 to 810 mm compared to the ranges from the waterdyn awap model ranges 490 to 580 mm figs 1b 6c 7c and 9c the reason for these differences is related to differences in soil depth and rooting depth between the two models in the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches soil layers are quite deep and can reach up to 6 m in some areas in the upper part of the catchment in addition native woody vegetation has deep rooting depth and can extract water from the deep soil layers up to 4 m fig 1c whereas in waterdyn awap model the maximum depth of soil layer is limited to 1 5 m only and two soil layers are considered with depths of 0 to 0 2 m and 0 2 to 1 5 m for the upper and lower soil layers respectively raupach et al 2009 soil moisture in deep soil layers is high in comparison to the top soil layer as discussed in detail in sections 4 3 and 4 4 the mean annual soil moisture from the waterdyn awap model for the entire study period 1975 2000 wet year 1978 and dry year 1982 are estimated and presented in fig 9d f in general horizontal and vertical distribution of soil moisture is highly variable between the two models further the waterdyn awap model is a daily terrestrial water balance model with a spatial resolution of 5 km 5 km raupach et al 2009 these limitations make soil moisture comparisons more challenging despite the differences in the spatial resolution of both models top layer soil moisture patterns in the waterdyn awap model is consistent with the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches figs 6d f 7d f and 9d f there is a little variation in the upper part of the catchment where ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches show less soil moisture than the waterdyn awap model figs 6d f 7d f and 9d f this difference could be caused by the differences in soil properties between the two models in the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches the soil type in the upper part of the catchment is shallow yellow earth granite and earthy sands granite with significantly higher saturated hydraulic conductivity than the deeper soil materials causing more downward movement of water to the deeper soil materials and lower surface soil moisture fig 1d and fig s 2 in supplementary material the soil type and properties used in the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are from the soil information package of murphy et al 2005 these high quality datasets are specifically generated for the mclaughlin and neighbouring catchments in the previous investigations for the waterdyn awap model soil properties are obtained from the digital atlas of australian soils developed at continental scale therefore it is quite likely that soil properties would be different between the two models in some small regions of the catchment despite minor differences in the upper part of the catchment in general the top layer soil moisture spatial pattern from the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are comparable with the waterdyn awap model the waterdyn awap model has been validated for catchment outflows at various time scales in variety of catchments across australia and few climate variables and found reasonably accurate raupach et al 2009 therefore the waterdyn awap model outputs are widely used in australia although there are differences in the input forcings spatial resolution modelling methodology and soil information between the waterdyn awap model and ecs 4lf ecs slf approaches the simulated evapotranspiration and soil moisture are consistent in most parts of the mclaughlin catchment these results indicate that the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches have the potential to simulate evapotranspiration and soil moisture with reasonably good accuracy 4 2 4 verification of soil moisture from the european space agency climate change initiative data set the correlation coefficients between area weighted catchment average daily surface soil moisture from the esa cci and the landform area weighted catchment average daily simulated soil moisture from the ecs 4lf approach are calculated for individual years and the entire period 1991 2000 table 4 the correlation coefficient for the entire period is 0 612 but varies for individual year from 0 438 to 0 819 table 4 depending on the quality of esa cci soil moisture observations in individual years and availability of esa cci observations the average monthly soil moisture is also calculated from the daily catchment average soil moisture from the esa cci and ecs 4lf approaches the correlation coefficient from the average monthly soil moisture for the entire period 1991 2000 is 0 64 which is slightly higher than the daily data overall the correlation coefficient values between the two data sets at daily and monthly time scales are reasonably high despite the large differences in spatial resolution the ecs 4lf daily soil moisture time series is also compared with the esa cci daily soil moisture time series for year 1995 in fig 10 as the same year is used for streamflow comparison fig 4 the simulated soil moisture values from the ecs 4lf approach are matching closely with the esa cci soil moisture values fig 10 similar trends are also observed in other years considering the large differences in horizontal as well as vertical resolution between the ecs 4lf and esa cci approaches the soil moisture values from both approaches are close this result indicates that the simulated soil moisture from the ecs 4lf is reasonably accurate and reliable considering that no calibration is performed in the ecs 4lf approach as ecs 4lf is the best performing approach no comparison with the ecs slf is performed 4 3 vertical distribution of soil moisture across different landforms the vertical distribution of soil moisture is important for calculating the soil moisture deficit for irrigation purposes to analyze the vertical soil moisture distribution across the landforms in ecs 4lf approach the kernel density and bar plots of soil moisture are presented for various soil depths and four landforms of the entire mclaughlin catchment figs 11 12 to obtain the kernel density plots pixel based values of daily soil moisture at a particular depth are averaged for a given landform across the catchment fig 11 note that to avoid excessive number of kernel density plots in fig 11 data for a few nodal soil depths are shown fig 12 a b shows the mean and standard deviation of daily soil moisture for each landform at various soil depths kernel density and bar plots show the variation of soil moisture in four landforms at various depths for the entire mclaughlin catchment figs 11 12 overall soil moisture variability is highest at the surface soil layer i e at 10 cm depth for all the landforms however mean soil moisture is low due to high transpiration and soil evaporation soil moisture variability reduces in deeper soil layers because of lower permeability of deep soil layers which restrict soil water movement soil evaporation and transpiration from deep soil layers are negligible because of the lower permeability of deep soil layers and shallow rooting depth of pasture figs 11 12 note the pasture is dominant land cover type in the mclaughlin catchment fig 1c the kernel density plots of all the landforms at various soil depths 0 1 0 5 1 0 3 0 6 0 m clearly show shift of the distribution plots towards the right side as depth increases fig 11 i e increase in mean soil moisture at deeper soil layers fig 12a the kernel density plots are spiky at 3 0 m and 6 0 m depths fig 11 as the number of simulated data points is less at higher soil depths note that the soil depths are not constant throughout the catchment generally upper parts of the hillslopes have shallower soils and the thickness of soil zone gradually increases towards the lower part of the hillslopes the mean soil moisture is increasing from 0 1 m to 1 0 m depth within four landforms i e upslope to alluvial flats due to more saturation near the river network after 1 0 m depth the mean soil moisture is almost constant in all four landforms because deeper soil layers are wetter fig 12a the simulated soil moisture at 15 cm depth from the ecs approach was thoroughly validated against in situ soil moisture for wagga wagga experimental catchment by khan et al 2014 indicating reasonable accuracy of soil moisture simulations by the ecs approach further the soil moisture at various soil depths in this study is also consistent with the input forcing and follows the expected behaviour as ecs slf approach only contains one single landform in a soil polygon therefore above mentioned analysis cannot be performed for ecs slf approach 4 4 impact of different climate and land cover on soil moisture to analyze the impact of different climate and land cover on soil moisture values on four landforms at various soil depths the kernel density and bar plots of mean and standard deviation are explored for ecs 4lf approach to avoid an excessive number of plots only mean plots are presented in fig 13 a b other plots are available from the authors on request two extreme climate zones wettest zone d and driest zone a are considered the mean soil moisture values of each landform at various soil depths are calculated for ecs 4lf approach in a similar manner as calculated in section 4 3 however the averaging is performed at the scale of individual climate zones rather than the entire catchment fig 13a as it is expected mean soil moisture in zone a driest zone is lower than zone d throughout all landforms and soil depths fig 1b despite the large differences in the mean annual rainfall in the climate zones a d 551 mm y vs 1300 mm y the same order of differences is not reflected in soil moisture values in fig 13a this is because the soil hydraulic properties as well as the land cover types play an important role in controlling the soil moisture in the catchment in the case of climate zone d a major part of this region is covered with highly permeable soils that allow more deep drainage in addition presence of native woody land cover type in this area causes high transpiration rates fig 1b d and fig s 2 in supplementary material the impact of transpiration and soil evaporation on soil moisture diminishes at 6 0 m depth whereas substantial differences exist in mean soil moisture between climate zones a d the mean soil moistures of four landforms at various soil depths are calculated separately for ecs 4lf approach for both land cover types i e pasture and native woody using the same methodology as used for climate zones fig 13b the mean soil moisture values for native woody are consistently lower than the pasture across all landforms and soil depths higher transpiration from native woody is caused by deep rooting depth the maximum root depth for pasture is 60 cm whereas for native woody is 4 0 m and access to deeper soil moisture the soil hydraulic properties are also playing an important role in reducing the soil moisture in native woodlands the native woodlands are located in the areas where soil types have higher saturated hydraulic conductivity which causes more deep drainage fig 1c d and fig s 2 in supplementary material note that in fig 13a the mean soil moisture values in climate zone a for upslope at 6 0 m soil depth is not shown this is because the simulated soil moisture data is not available at this depth in climate zone a for upslope in a similar manner the simulated soil moisture data is not available for native woody in upslope at 6 0 m soil depth fig 13b the soil moisture information at various soil depths in each land cover types is very helpful for calculating soil moisture deficit for irrigation purposes note that the above mentioned analysis cannot be performed for the ecs slf approach as a single landform exists in each soil polygon implementation of the ecs 4lf approach is recommended over the ecs slf approach because the ecs 4lf disaggregates the hillslope realistically and provides more information about spatial variability of soil moisture and hydrologic fluxes 5 summary the ecs approach developed previously by khan et al 2014 was applicable at the first order sub basin scale whereas the presented ecs 4lf approach is modified to apply at the catchment scale we made some simplifications for automating the presented ecs 4lf delineation approach for catchment scale applications the simulated discharge from the modified ecs 4lf based distributed modelling approach without calibration shows reasonable consistency with the observed streamflow and all lumped conceptual models used in this study this consistency indicates that the ecs 4lf approach has the potential to be applied for distributed modelling of other catchments especially ungauged catchments where observed streamflow data are not available or not sufficient for proper calibration of the conceptual models the ecs 4lf modelling approach along with the 2 d richards equation makes this approach more suitable for simulating the shallow sub surface flows in upland catchments like other distributed hydrologic models the ecs 4lf approach also requires extensive spatial input data i e dem soil type land cover climate and geology to derive model parameters currently the ecs 4lf approach is used in research mode further development and evaluation are required in variety of settings to make it an operational product future developments are focused on developing a graphical user interface gui for automating ecs 4lf delineation development of groundwater and detailed eco hydrological modules despite these limitations the presented ecs 4lf approach is a valuable tool for simulating spatially distributed hydrological fluxes with high accuracy and significantly reducing the computational time units associated with typical distributed hydrological modelling applications 6 conclusions an equivalent cross section based semi distributed hydrologic modelling approach initially developed for eight discrete first order sub basins is modified here for a large catchment scale simulation containing 822 first order sub basins all parameters used in this approach are derived from the actual topographical and physiographical features of the catchment without any calibration or adjustment being needed the simulated streamflows from the equivalent cross section approach are consistent with the observed streamflows the simulated streamflows are also compared with four calibrated conceptual models streamflows and results found to be comparable in addition the equivalent cross section approach shows nearly a 40 times reduction in computational units when compared to a grid based fully distributed hydrological modelling setup performance of the ecs 4lf was better than the ecs slf approach considering that the ecs 4lf represents the spatial variability of hydrologic fluxes along the hillslope the simulated actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture from the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are very similar to the awap model further the simulated soil moisture from the ecs 4lf approach is found to be consistent with the satellite derived european space agency climate change initiative esa cci surface soil moisture data the equivalent cross section based semi distributed modelling approach has the ability to simulate variety of spatially distributed hydrological fluxes that are consistent with the input forcing and land surface characteristics the results at the landform scale show that within the landforms the mean soil moisture in shallow layers has increased as we move from upslope to alluvial flats due to the saturation near river network this pattern is not significant in small regions in lower parts of the catchment especially along the main stem of the river network because of low soil moisture values in all landforms in deeper soil layers the mean soil moisture is almost constant across all landforms due to low saturated hydraulic conductivity the variability in soil moisture is higher for surface soil layers due to high evapotranspiration and lower for deeper soil layers for all landforms the pasture dominated region of the catchment has higher soil moisture than the native woody due to shallower root depths and lower lai it can be concluded that the equivalent cross section based semi distributed hydrological modelling has the potential to simulate a variety of hydrological fluxes for a large catchment in a

7109,physically based distributed hydrological models are useful for simulating the spatial distribution of hydrologic fluxes across the catchment under various climate and land cover change scenarios however complexities associated with their implementation at large scales make their applications limited previously an equivalent cross section ecs based distributed hydrological modelling approach was developed for first order sub basins to reduce the computational time effort here the ecs approach is modified for semi distributed hydrological modelling at the catchment scale the modelling approach is implemented for a 314 km2 mclaughlin catchment located in south eastern new south wales nsw australia that consists of 822 first order sub basins a 26 year long streamflow record simulated using an ecs based modelling approach are compared against daily observed streamflow and four calibrated lumped conceptual hydrologic models and found to be consistent further the simulated actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture from the ecs approach are compared against the australian water availability project awap model simulations and results found to be consistent in addition the temporal dynamics of simulated soil moisture from the ecs approach is consistent with the satellite derived european space agency climate change initiative esa cci surface soil moisture data in the ecs based semi distributed modelling all parameters are derived from the actual topographic and physiographic information of the catchment and none of the parameters is calibrated therefore this approach has the advantage of simulating streamflow in ungauged catchments compared to lumped conceptual models the impact of spatially distributed climatic forcing and land cover on soil moisture is investigated across four landforms upslope midslope footslope and alluvial flats and at various soil depths our results show increase of mean soil moisture in shallow layers of upslope toward alluvial flats however mean soil moisture in deeper horizons remained almost constant across all landforms the variability of daily soil moisture at surface soil layers is higher than the deeper soil layers for all landforms our results illustrated that disaggregation of a catchment to a series of ecs at the scale of first order sub basins captures dynamics of soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration across the landscape and results are consistent with the climatology land cover type topography and soil hydraulic properties further the use of ecs approach in the mclaughlin catchment reduced the number of computational units by 40 times in comparison to 3 d grid based distributed modelling setup keywords equivalent cross section ecs soil moisture computational time first order sub basin distributed hydrological modelling lumped conceptual hydrological modelling 1 introduction the development and applications of physically based distributed hydrological models have increased in the last two decades due to substantial improvements in geographical information system gis spatial resolution of topographic physiographic and remote sensing data and computational power abbott et al 1986a b abbott and refsgaard 1996 bell et al 2007 beven and kirkby 1979 kampf and burges 2007 reed et al 2004 singh and woolhiser 2002 tague and band 2004 watson et al 1998 wigmosta et al 1994 during this period several distributed hydrological models are developed with various level of complexity including mike she abbott et al 1986a b hydrus 1d 2 d 3d simunek et al 1999 2005 2006 cathy paniconi et al 2003 gssha downer and ogden 2004 modhms panday and huyakorn 2004 parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 grid to grid g2g bell et al 2007 cole and moore 2009 and hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 in these models parameters for every grid cell or hydrologic response units are derived from spatially distributed data such as topography soil type land cover climate and geology in turn spatially distributed fluxes including transpiration soil evaporation deep drainage runoff and soil moisture are obtained across the catchment these extensive spatial fluxes from distributed models are useful for assessing the impact of climate land use and land cover changes on the other end the lumped conceptual models are also very popular in hydrological modelling due to their simple structure and limited parameter requirements beven 2012 kirchner 2006 singh 1995 singh and woolhiser 2002 the lumped conceptual models consider entire catchment as a single unit and simulate discharge at the catchment outlet as a function of lumped representation of catchment storage refsgaard and knudsen 1996 compared the performance of three hydrological models including a fully distributed model mike she abbott et al 1986a b a semi distributed model watbal knudsen et al 1986 and a lumped conceptual model nam nielsen and hansen 1973 they concluded that distributed models performed better than lumped conceptual models in cases where no calibration was allowed and long term streamflow data were not available however often simpler conceptual models are preferred over their distributed counterparts due to significant computational effort of distributed hydrologic models for long term simulations in large catchments or due to the lack of high resolution spatial information about model parameters beven 1989 2001 grayson et al 1992b kirchner 2006 one possible option for reducing the computational effort time in distributed hydrological modelling is to disaggregate the catchment into the smaller homogeneous spatial entities argent et al 2007 beven and kirkby 1979 flugel 1995 reggiani et al 1999 reggiani et al 1998 summerell et al 2005 vertessy et al 1993 watson et al 1999 wood et al 1988 these spatial entities are known with various names including hydrologic response units hrus flugel 1995 representative elementary areas reas wood et al 1988 representative elementary watersheds rews reggiani et al 1998 and functional units fus argent et al 2007 with the term hrus being commonly used in hydrology wood et al 1988 delineated reas on the basis of topography soil and rainfall flugel 1995 and argent et al 2007 developed the concept of hrus and fus on the basis of similarities in topographical and physiographical features of the catchment most of the existing methods of catchment disaggregation either lack contiguity and topological connectivity of hrus or require artificial nodes to connect these entities which restricts the transfer of lateral fluxes from the upper part of a hillslope to the lower parts to address this khan et al 2013 developed an approach to delineate contiguous topologically connected hrus to transfer the fluxes from the upper parts of a hillslope to the lower parts to delineate hrus the entire catchment was divided into four major landforms upslope midslope footslope and alluvial flats four landforms were delineated on the basis of similarities in topographical and geomorphological attributes of a catchment the catchment was also divided into different stream order sub basins based on strahler s convention ensuring that the variability of saturated hydraulic conductivity was least in first order sub basins following the hru delineation khan et al 2014 developed an equivalent cross section ecs approach for semi distributed hydrologic modelling at the scale of first order sub basins where landform based delineated hrus were used as the basis for weighting the topographical and physiographical features of first order sub basins as hrus are embedded in the ecs formulation ecss are capable of transferring fluxes from the upper parts of a hillslope to the lower parts the soil moisture and runoff simulation toolkit smart developed by ajami et al 2016 also used ecs approach in the ecs approach either single or multiple ecss were formulated as a weighted representation of a first order sub basin depending on the arrangement of soil types within the sub basin water balance simulations for these ecss are performed using a 2 d distributed hydrological model the ecs approach was investigated for eight first order sub basins and modelling results showed that it was effective for reducing the computational time effort in a 2 d distributed hydrological modelling without significant loss of accuracy in simulated fluxes khan et al 2014 despite considerable improvement in computational efficiency of the ecs approach in comparison to distributed cross section modelling approaches performance of the ecs approach at a catchment scale with multiple first order sub basins was not investigated in khan et al 2014 further no verification of simulated stream flow against observations was performed due to non availability of streamflow observations at the first order sub basin scale which serves as the motivation of the current study the aims of this study are to 1 modify the ecs approach for semi distributed hydrological modelling at the catchment scale which contains 822 first order sub basins 2 compare simulated streamflow of a calibration free ecs approach with observations and simulations from four calibrated lumped conceptual models and 3 examine soil moisture dynamics for the entire catchment and across four landforms at various soil depths under different climate and land cover types 2 study area this study is conducted for the mclaughlin catchment which is a sub catchment of the snowy river located in the snowy monaro region in south eastern new south wales nsw australia the total catchment area of the mclaughlin up to the confluence of snowy river is 459 km2 the catchment area up to the gauging station is used in this study due to the availability of observed streamflow at the gauging station the mclaughlin catchment up to the gauging station fig 1 a has the area of 314 km2 and consists of 822 first order sub basins the first order sub basins areas vary from 0 8 ha to 283 ha the elevation range in the mclaughlin catchment up to the gauging station varies from 740 m to 1231 m the mclaughlin catchment is considered in this study because this catchment and its neighbouring catchments have been under hydrologic investigation for the last ten years because of changes in land cover during the last 50 years khan et al 2013 tuteja et al 2007 the digital elevation model dem data has the resolution of 25 m 25 m and is derived from the contour and drainage data of nsw topographic maps all data for this research was taken from the previous studies by tuteja et al 2007 2 1 climate and runoff four climate zones were delineated for the mclaughlin and its neighbouring catchments by teng et al 2008 using the climate surfaces of the australian continent developed by jeffrey et al 2001 fig 1b the daily scientific information for land owners silo climate surfaces use daily gauged climate data of approximately 4600 locations across australia the density of these climate stations varies across australia the density of climate stations is high near the coast of australia especially in the south east where the mclaughlin catchment is located the silo climate surfaces use spatial interpolation algorithms to generate daily climate surfaces such as daily rainfall and evaporation at 5 km 5 km spatial resolution jeffrey et al 2001 the root mean square error rmse of monthly silo rainfall for 1990 1997 was 35 1 mm jeffrey et al 2001 in mclaughlin and its neighbouring catchments the range of annual rainfall mean annual rainfall and pan evaporation for four climate zones delineated by teng et al 2008 for the period 1975 2000 are presented in table 1 the mean annual rainfall and pan evaporation for the mclaughlin catchment for the period 1975 2000 are 658 mm y and 992 mm y respectively the annual rainfall for the mclaughlin catchment for a wet year 1978 and a dry year 1982 varies in the range 1041 mm y and 370 mm y respectively and the respective annual pan evaporation values are 933 mm y and 1194 mm y daily streamflow data for the period 1975 2000 at the gauging station is used in this study with the mean annual streamflow of 85 mm y which is significantly lower than the rainfall indicating most of the rainfall is lost to evapotranspiration the delineation of four climate zones used in this study is validated by comparing the range of annual rainfall in four climate zones with the average annual rainfall from silo grid cells the average annual rainfall for 1975 2000 period are calculated for all 26 silo grid cells of size 5 km 5 km located either partly or fully in the mclaughlin catchment fig s 1 in the supplementary material the rainfall pattern at gridded scale matches closely with the rainfall pattern of four climate zones fig 1b this analysis confirms that the delineation of climate zones is correct and the spatial variation of rainfall is well represented by these climate zones 2 2 land cover the mclaughlin catchment mainly consists of three land cover types i e pasture native woody and improved pasture tuteja et al 2006 fig 1c out of which pasture and native woody are the dominant land cover types comprising 86 and 13 of the total area respectively the area under improved pasture is negligible and therefore this land cover class is merged with the pasture in this study the leaf area index lai and root biomass distributions of pasture and native woody land cover types are taken from tuteja et al 2006 2007 2 3 soil type and depth murphy et al 2005 developed a soils information package for the mclaughlin and neighbouring catchments which comprises spatial distribution of soil types soil depth and soil hydraulic properties on the basis of their respective parent material ancillary data sources and field observations murphy et al 2005 categorized individual soil types on the basis of similarities in metadata associated with each soil type e g particle size analysis bulk density and water holding capacity the soil hydraulic properties were determined using pedotransfer function ptf models of minasny and mcbratney 2002 and schaap and leij 1998 the soil types map and soil hydraulic properties of the mclaughlin catchment are presented in fig s 2 and table s 1 respectively of the supplementary material on the basis of this data a 25 m 25 m pixel size raster of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of the top soil horizon material is generated fig 1d for the mclaughlin catchment the variation of ksat is in the range of 4 8 cm d to 105 cm d these values are inferred on the basis of soil physical properties e g particle size distributions and bulk density soil toposequences extensive field work and laboratory analysis chapman and atkinson 2000 geeves et al 1995 murphy et al 2005 while acknowledging uncertainty around ksat values we note that these are high quality soils data sets for large catchments soil depth data is taken from murphy et al 2005 based on the methodology of mckenzie et al 2003 the soil depths are higher near valley bottoms and lower at the top of hillslopes 3 catchment modelling semi distributed modelling using the ecs approach consists of the following steps 1 delineating first order sub basins 2 delineating hrus using topographic and geomorphic analysis of the entire catchment 3 ecs delineation 4 2 dimensional soil moisture model simulations across every ecs in a first order sub basin and 5 post processing of outputs the description of 2 dimensional soil moisture movement model hrus and ecs approach and catchment modelling methodology are presented in the following sub sections 3 1 2 dimensional richards equation based unsaturated soil moisture movement model the unsaturated soil moisture movement model u3m 2d developed by tuteja et al 2004 is used to perform the hydrological modelling across the ecss of the mclaughlin catchment this model is based on the 2 d solution of richards equation the richards equation has been criticised for simulating the hydrologic fluxes at coarse scale as it was originally derived at point scale beven 2001 beven 2012 grayson et al 1992a grayson et al 1992b kirchner 2006 singh and woolhiser 2002 and may not capture non linearity of hydrological processes at various scales however still majority of existing physically based distributed hydrological models use the richards equation either1 d 2 d or 3 d formulation to calculate unsaturated zone fluxes these models include mike she abbott et al 1986a abbott et al 1986b hydrus 1d 2 d 3d simunek et al 1999 2005 2006 cathy paniconi et al 2003 gssha downer and ogden 2004 modhms panday and huyakorn 2004 tribs veggie ivanov et al 2008a b parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 and hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 previous investigations have shown that these models have been successful in simulating the hydrological fluxes at catchment scale the richards equation based u3m 2d model has also been successful in simulating the hydrological fluxes from the ecss khan et al 2014 the u3m 2d model is an extended version of 1 d unsaturated soil moisture movement model u3m 1d developed by vaze et al 2004 which was based on 1 d solution of richards equation the detailed concept and equations used in u3m 2d are presented in section 3 11 3 13 of tuteja et al 2004 see http www toolkit net au tools class u3m 1d publications for details the model requires four types of input data for each modelling element pixel 1 climate which includes daily rainfall pan evaporation maximum and minimum temperature and radiation 2 soil hydraulic properties and soil depths 3 root biomass distribution and leaf area index lai of each land cover types and 4 elevation and slope of each pixel u3m 2d divides the entire soil column into four soil horizons or soil materials and each soil material is further divided into thinner soil layers for computational purpose the model uses three boundary conditions 1 specified flux rainfall minus potential soil evaporation at the soil surface 2 free drainage boundary condition at the bottom of the soil profile specified head or specified flux boundary condition is also available in the model for the bottom of the soil profile and 3 specified flux representing soil moisture contribution from upslope pixels across each soil material of the soil profile the u3m 2d model uses richards equation for performing local water balance computations along the vertical axis for each soil layer of every pixel of a hillslope cross section while accounting for flux from the upslope areas gravity drainage capillary rise evapotranspiration soil moisture and downslope soil water outflow are then computed for each pixel a variable sub daily time step is used for partitioning the water balance transpiration soil evaporation deep drainage and soil moisture excess in the unsaturated zone the sub daily computational time step varies from user defined minimum e g 5 min to maximum e g 1 hr and exact values are decided on the basis of rainfall intensity the smaller time step e g 5 min is considered for the very high intensity rainfall e g 1000 mm d and 1 hr time step for the low intensity rainfall e g 5 mm d for rainfall intensity in between these two extremes the time steps are adaptively adjusted depending on the transient soil moisture conditions to calculate rainfall intensity at a sub daily time step u3m 2d disaggregates the input daily rainfall data by dividing the daily rainfall with the user defined time step used in the vertical water balance calculation for example an hourly time step is used for low rainfall intensity of 5 mm d potential plant transpiration and potential soil evaporation are calculated from potential evapotranspiration on the basis of monthly lai and land cover type actual transpiration and soil evaporation are dynamically calculated on the basis of available water in the root zone user defined root biomass distribution and transpiration factor derived from the wilting point field capacity and saturated soil moisture contents the horizontal water balance component of u3m 2d model performs the computations at daily time scale the excess moisture arising from the variably saturated conditions within each soil material is aggregated at a daily time scale and horizontally transferred to the respective soil materials in the next downslope pixel based on darcy s law the daily simulated fluxes for each pixel are soil moisture actual transpiration soil evaporation horizontal fluxes and drainage below the root zone deep drainage 3 2 overview of sub basin hru and equivalent cross section delineation approach catchment modelling starts with dividing the catchment into strahler s first order sub basins the order of sub basins was decided on the basis of variation in saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils as sub basins are aggregated to higher units i e second and higher order sub basins results from khan et al 2013 showed significant increases in saturated hydraulic conductivity variability in higher order sub basins therefore first order sub basins are selected as units for aggregating and transferring hydrologic fluxes down the stream within a first order sub basin contiguous topologically connected hrus are delineated to transfer the soil moisture fluxes from the upper parts of a hillslope to the lower parts khan et al 2013 derived landform delineation thresholds from a range of terrain analysis techniques the cumulative area distribution cad curve average local slope curvature compound topographic index cti and the multi resolution valley bottom flatness mrvbf index and divided the catchment into four major landforms upslope midslope footslope and alluvial flats these landforms represent the macroscopic changes in the catchment landscapes the widths of alluvial flats footslope midslope and upslope are 0 25 m 25 75 m 75 350 m and 350 m respectively for the mclaughlin catchment note that the delineated landform widths are smaller near the stream network and increases with distance from the stream in order to represent the saturation zone more appropriately near the stream network these hrus were used as the basis for formulating the ecs approach at the first order sub basin scale to reduce the computational time effort in distributed hydrological modelling without significant reduction in accuracy khan et al 2014 to formulate an ecs multiple cross sections are delineated in a sub basin and then the topographical and physiographical features of cross sections are length weighted averaged on a landform basis within a sub basin depending on the soil type pattern single or multiple ecs in each strahler s first order sub basin were formulated to represent the full or a part of the sub basin soil type pattern within a sub basin determine the number of ecs as follows 1 if the soil types remain unchanged within a sub basin then a single equivalent cross section can represent the entire sub basin 2 if the soil types are consistent with landform pattern i e different soil near the center of the river and changes towards the ridge line then the three equivalent cross sections left bank right bank and head water can represent a sub basin and 3 if the soil types do not follow a landform pattern or any other systematic pattern at least one equivalent cross section in each soil type is required to represent a sub basin khan et al 2014 investigated the ecs approach for seven discrete first order sub basins of the mclaughlin catchment along with the wagga wagga experimental catchment the simulated fluxes from the ecs approach were compared with the simulated fluxes from the distributed modelling at multiple cross sections the fluxes obtained from both approaches were very close whereas the computational time reduced significantly using the ecs approach as observed streamflow data for the first order sub basins were not available the ecs approach was validated using soil moisture observations in the wagga wagga experimental catchment and results found to be consistent with the observed soil moisture khan et al 2014 the soil moisture and runoff simulation toolkit smart developed by ajami et al 2016 used ecs approach here the ecs approach is modified to perform semi distributed hydrological modelling at the catchment scale and to compare the simulated runoff with the observed discharge at the catchment outlet 3 3 catchment scale modelling using the equivalent cross sections with four landforms a summary of the ecs formulation with four landforms ecs 4lf for catchment scale modelling is presented in fig 2 as can be seen in fig 2a a sample first order sub basin contains four landforms upslope midslope footslope and alluvial flats to maintain topological connectivity in a hillslope the mclaughlin catchment contains 822 first order sub basins fig 1a with variety of soil types fig s 2 in supplementary material and fig 1d to formulate the ecs for 822 first order sub basins in an automated manner it is essential to maintain consistency in ecs formulation approach throughout all sub basins therefore all ecs are formulated on the basis of soil types and landforms for example if the first order sub basin has three soil types fig 2b three ecs one each for each soil type are formulated fig 2c and in the case of one soil type only a single ecs is formulated for the entire sub basin to formulate ecss on a four landform basis ecs 4lf first order sub basins layer of the catchment is overlaid with the soil type and landform layers fig 3 therefore each first order sub basin will contain soil type polygons and within each soil polygon landforms are available one ecs 4lf is formulated for each soil type polygon within each first order sub basin fig 3 to perform the 2 d distributed hydrologic modelling on each ecs 4lf the following topographical and physiographical parameters are required for each pixel of the ecs 4lf elevation soil depths slope climate land cover and soil type the following parameters are calculated for each landform of the ecs width slope elevation land cover and climate to compute landform width it is assumed that the shape of each landform polygon is rectangular this is a reasonable assumption because the actual landforms are generally long narrow curvy strips and they can be replicated by equal area perimeter rectangles fig 2a 3 eq 1 is used to calculate the width of each landform within a soil polygon using its area and perimeter 1 w i p i p i 2 16 a i 4 where i 1 upslope 2 midslope 3 footslope and 4 alluvial flats w i is the width of landform i and ai and pi are the area and perimeter of the landform i respectively calculated in arcgis the 2 d distributed hydrological modelling of an ecs 4lf is performed along the length of an ecs 4lf obtained by summation of the widths of all landforms i e upslope midslope footslope and alluvial flats within a soil polygon note that khan et al 2014 calculated the length of an ecs by arithmetic averaging of the lengths of multiple cross sections drawn in a first order sub basin drawing of multiple cross sections in each first order sub basin is not practically feasible here as the number of sub basins is large 822 and the ecs formulation needs to be automated therefore calculation of ecs 4lf length is simplified for formulating the ecs 4lf in 822 first order sub basins the length of an ecs 4lf is divided into 25 m interval i e the resolution of dem data and model parameters are obtained for each element average slope of each landform within a soil polygon is obtained by averaging local slope of all grid cells 25 m 25 m in a landform local slope is calculated in arcgis using available dem data and the average landform slope is used in formulating an ecs 4lf fig 3 in a similar manner average soil depths of all four soil materials horizons for each landform are calculated from the available soil depth rasters of individual soil material horizons fig 3 note that khan et al 2014 calculated the slope and soil depth of each landform of an ecs by length weighted averaging of slope and soil depth of multiple cross sections drawn in a first order sub basin but as stated above drawing of multiple cross sections in each first order sub basin is not practically feasible due to number of sub basins therefore calculation of slope and soil depth is simplified here for the climate and land cover type only the dominant class in each landform within a soil polygon of a first order sub basin is obtained for example if 80 area of a landform is covered with pasture and 20 covered with native woody then the pasture land cover is assigned for this landform and the associated 25 m pixels fig 3 the maximum elevation of each landform is calculated from the dem data this elevation was assigned to the first upslope pixel of the uppermost landform in an ecs 4lf the elevations of other pixels in the ecs 4lf are calculated with the help of average slope of landforms and landform widths which are calculated earlier fig 3 the land cover types climate zones soil depths of all soil materials and slopes are considered constant within those pixels of an ecs 4lf that are located within the same landform for example if an ecs 4lf is 250 m long 10 pixels and upslope contains 3 pixels then the land cover type dominant climate zone dominant soil depth average and slope average of these 3 pixels remain the same in this manner a total of 2392 ecss 4lf are formulated for 822 first order sub basins in the mclaughlin catchment the 2 d distributed hydrological modelling is performed for every ecs 4lf using the u3m 2d at a pixel scale the connectivity of first order sub basins with stream network is shown in fig 1a the simulated results are available for each pixel of an ecs 4lf and it includes daily soil moisture actual transpiration soil evaporation horizontal fluxes and drainage below the root zone deep drainage initial processing of the topographical and physiographical data for formulating an ecs 4lf is performed in arcgis and the final output organized in an attribute table which contains ecs properties later r and matlab scripts are written to process this data and prepare input data files in an automated manner for the u3m 2d model the soil hydraulic properties and land cover related parameters are also assigned in input files using r and matlab scripts the u3m 2d model written in c run for 2392 ecs 4lf using a workflow based approach which is written in r the simulated data is post processed using r scripts 3 4 catchment scale modelling using the equivalent cross sections with single landform to investigate the impact of aggregating ecs properties in simulated fluxes the four landforms of an ecs are replaced with a single landform the method of formulating and processing of geospatial data in the equivalent cross section on a single landform basis ecs slf is similar to the ecs 4lf the major difference is on the averaging weighting of topographical and physiographical properties of an ecs is performed on a single landform instead of four landforms as one ecs slf is delineated per soil polygon the average slope of all grid cells in a soil polygon is calculated as there is only one landform within a soil polygon in a similar manner average soil depths of all four soil materials horizons for each soil polygon are calculated from the available soil depth rasters of individual soil material horizons for the climate and land cover type only the dominant class in each soil polygon of a first order sub basin is obtained for example if 80 area of a soil polygon is covered with pasture and 20 covered with native woody then the pasture land cover is assigned for this single landform and the associated 25 m pixels to compute the single landform width the soil polygons are assumed to be an equivalent square and the width of a square is calculated by taking the square root of soil polygon area this is a reasonable assumption as areas of polygons are preserved here compared to the ecs 4lf and the equivalent square concept helps in automating ecs formulation in large catchments the maximum elevation of each soil polygon is calculated from the dem and was assigned to the first upslope pixel of an ecs slf the elevations of other pixels in the ecs slf are calculated with the help of the average slope of a single landform and landform width calculated earlier the land cover types climate zones soil depths of all soil materials and slopes are considered constant within each pixel of single landform for example if a single landform is 250 m long 10 pixels then the land cover type dominant climate zone dominant soil depth average and slope average of these 10 pixels remain the same note that in this example the length of ecs slf will also be 10 pixels as there is only one landform in each ecs in this manner a total of 2458 ecss slf are formulated for 822 first order sub basins in the mclaughlin catchment simulations across ecs slf are performed using the u3m 2d at pixel scale as described in section 3 3 note that the u3m 2d model remains unaltered in both the ecs 4lf or ecs slf approaches presented here in each case the model is applied at a pixel scale with parameters derived for four or a single landform depending on whether the ecs 4lf or ecs slf approach is considered 3 5 catchment modelling using lumped conceptual models in the ecs 4lf and ecs slf based distributed modelling approaches actual topographical and physiographical parameters were obtained from the geospatial data without any calibration to compare the ecs 4lf and ecs slf based modelling simulations against lumped conceptual models which require thorough calibration four lumped conceptual models gr4j sacramento simhyd and smar in different setups are used 3 5 1 gr4j a four parameter based lumped conceptual model gr4j developed by perrin et al 2003 is used within wafari2 water availability forecast of australian rivers modelling system which is the modified version of wafari developed by the bureau of meteorology australia to issue seasonal streamflow forecasts shin et al 2011 tuteja et al 2011 the gr4j model is selected because of its high performance in simulating streamflow for a wide range of australian catchments the gr4j model is calibrated for each year in cross validation mode for the period 1970 2000 using a 5 year leave out window as an example when simulating streamflow for 1981 gr4j is calibrated using data for 1970 1980 and 1986 2000 similarly the 5 years moving leave out window steps through all years during 1970 2000 altogether 200 parameter sets are generated by using a weighted least square wls option for the total error model to define the objective function in the bayesian total error analysis batea framework within the wafari2 modelling system kavetski et al 2006a b shin et al 2011 tuteja et al 2011 generated parameter sets for each year are used in the model to generate 200 ensembles of daily streamflow for each year with the observed daily rainfall and evaporation data the differences between these 200 ensembles are negligible and therefore median mean or even a single ensemble member gives the same results in this study median of 200 ensembles is considered for each year and a continuous daily time series of simulated streamflow for the entire study period i e 1975

continuous daily time series of simulated streamflow for the entire study period i e 1975 2000 is generated using the optimized parameters for each model 3 6 waterdyn awap model for evapotranspiration and soil moisture verification the waterdyn model was developed under the australian water availability project awap by csiro raupach et al 2009 the waterdyn awap model is a terrestrial water balance model runs at 5 km 5 km grid scale and solves the water balance equations mainly in unsaturated soil columns at a daily time step raupach et al 2009 to verify the simulated evapotranspiration from the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches simulated monthly evapotranspiration from the waterdyn model is used as no eddy covariance or sap flux data is available the spatial variation of average annual evapotranspiration and soil moisture for the entire study period 1975 2000 wet year 1978 and dry year 1982 from the waterdyn awap model are also compared with the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches the results are presented and discussed in section 4 2 3 3 7 satellite derived data for soil moisture verification the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci surface soil moisture data are used to verify simulated soil moisture from the ecs 4lf approach the esa cci has released daily surface 2 cm soil moisture products at a spatial resolution of 0 25 approximately 25 km at equator

three products are available in the cci soil moisture active passive and active passive combined data which have been comprehensively validated at the global scale and applied for long term studies with promising performances dorigo et al 2017 kim et al 2018 miralles et al 2013 the esa cci soil moisture is a composite product from the multiple passive and active microwave spaceborne instruments and there have been advances in the quality and temporal coverage of the product through time the 1979 1987 data product is based on a single instrument while the 1991 2000 data are from the multiple advanced instruments chung et al 2018 further the number of observations in each year is high during 1991 2000 period in comparison to the 1979 1987 period there are no observations available during aug 1987 to jul 1991 period in esa cci soil moisture data set covering the study catchment considering the significant differences in quality and number of observations in esa cci soil moisture data set during 1979 1987 and 1991 2000 periods the 1991 2000 data set is used in this study from the esa cci soil moisture data area weighted catchment average daily soil moisture is generated for the mclaughlin catchment this data is compared with the landform area weighted catchment average daily simulated soil moisture from the top model layer 10 cm in the ecs 4lf approach the results are presented and discussed in section 4 2 4 4 results and discussion the comparison of simulated streamflows from the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches with the observed streamflow and four conceptual models are presented in the following sub sections the spatial distribution of hydrological fluxes and analysis of soil moisture dynamics for different climates and different land covers of the entire catchment and landforms from the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are also presented 4 1 comparison of simulated and observed streamflows the daily time series of simulated streamflows from all models and approaches are compared with the observed streamflows in the following sub section further the scatter between the simulated and observed streamflows and bias are also compared in the following sub sections 4 1 1 comparison of daily flow series for a selected year daily horizontal fluxes and deep drainage are simulated for each pixel of an ecs 4lf and ecs slf using the u3m 2d model the deep drainage from all the pixels in ecs 4lf and ecs slf are arithmetically averaged and added with the horizontal fluxes from the last pixel to obtain the total streamflow from the single ecs 4lf and ecs slf total streamflow from every ecs is multiplied by the soil polygon area from which the ecs 4lf or ecs slf was formulated to obtain weighted total streamflow for a first order sub basin the weighted total daily streamflow from all 822 sub basins are added to obtain the total simulated streamflow at the outlet of mclaughlin catchment simulated daily streamflow from the ecs approach and four conceptual models gr4j sacramento simhyd and smar are shown for the year 1995 as it is one of the validation years for the lumped conceptual models fig 4 a f the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and mean absolute error mae values for the entire simulation period i e 1975 2000 at daily monthly and annual time scales are presented in tables 2 and 3 respectively the daily nse of the ecs 4lf simulation is lower than all four conceptual models tables 2 however at the monthly time scale performance of the ecs 4lf approach is improved and is comparable with other conceptual models tables 2 at annual time scale the ecs 4lf approach has the second highest nse after the sacramento model tables 2 daily monthly and annual nse values of the ecs 4lf approach are higher than the ecs slf approach the daily mae of the ecs 4lf approach is very low and only the mae of gr4j is lower than the ecs 4lf approach table 3 the monthly and annual mae values of ecs 4lf approach are higher than the sacramento and smar models close to gr4j model and lower than the simhyd model table 3 the mae values of ecs slf at daily monthly and annual scale are higher than the ecs 4lf approach table 3 it should be noted that the nse values are more influenced by accurately simulating high flows whereas mae reflect the overall performance i e high as well as low flows as a result it can be concluded that the overall performance of the ecs 4lf approach is reasonable given no calibration is involved in its specification and this approach has the potential to be applied in ungauged areas at a daily time scale the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches simulate low flows well fig 4a f while underestimating the very high flow events fig 4a b performance of conceptual models for streamflow simulation varies the gr4j model overestimates high flows in 1995 but simulates low flows with reasonable accuracy fig 4c the sacramento and simhyd models overestimate high and low flows in 1995 fig 4d and e the smar model simulates low as well as high flows reasonably well but it underestimates a few high flow events in 1995 fig 4f the performance of ecs 4lf at a daily time scale is reasonable by considering that no parameter adjustment is performed for this approach and all parameters are directly derived from the topographical and physiographical features of the catchment 4 1 2 overall model performance comparison the bias of daily simulated streamflow is calculated by estimating the average difference between the simulated and observed streamflows for the entire period 1975 2000 the positive bias indicates overestimation of streamflows by the model and negative bias indicates underestimation the ecs 4lf ecs slf and gr4j models have small bias during low flows whereas high negative bias exists for some of the high flow events fig 5 a c the sacramento model has mostly positive bias in low and high flows and it overestimates some of the high flow events fig 5d the simhyd model significantly overestimates low and high flows as shown by a large positive bias throughout the simulations fig 5e the bias in smar is slightly smaller than the other five models during low and high flow periods fig 5f though none of these models perform extraordinarily well all conceptual models require observed streamflows to optimise parameter sets which is not the case with ecs 4lf and all parameters are directly derived from the topographical and physiographical features of the catchment as a result it can be concluded that the ecs 4lf approach can be applied in ungauged catchments with reasonable accuracy water balance partitioning based on ecs 4lf approach revealed that the actual evapotranspiration constitutes around 82 of rainfall for the whole study period whereas the deep drainage and horizontal flows constitute around 15 and 2 respectively of rainfall therefore the majority of rainfall evapotranspires and only a small amount of rainfall contributes to streamflow previously khan et al 2014 performed 2 d distributed modelling on multiple cross sections on seven first order sub basins properties of these cross sections are derived from actual topographic and physiographic properties of each pixel in a cross section comparison of simulated soil moisture and various hydrological fluxes including transpiration and soil evaporation from the ecs approach found to be consistent with these distributed cross section simulations in particular simulated evapotranspiration from the ecs approach closely resembles distributed cross section simulations we further assess accuracy of simulated evapotranspiration using data from the australian water availability project raupach et al 2009 presented in section 4 2 to analyse sensitivity of streamflow to initial soil moisture conditions two extreme initial conditions very wet close to saturation and very dry close to residual moisture content are considered in the ecs 4lf approach the ecs 4lf simulations with average initial soil moisture conditions are presented throughout this paper comparison of three simulated streamflow time series from the wet dry and average initial condition with daily observed streamflow shows that the initial soil moisture conditions cause small differences in simulated streamflows for the first few 8 9 months after that the impact of initial condition diminishes and all three simulated time series become similar figures are not presented here but are available from the authors on request one of the major benefits of the ecs 4lf with u3m 2d model approach over the conceptual models is that it provides a variety of spatially distributed hydrological fluxes in addition to streamflow whereas the conceptual models only provide catchment average outputs the various spatially distributed hydrological fluxes will be discussed in the following sections in comparison with the 3 d grid based distributed modelling approaches the number of modelling elements decreased substantially from 501 953 pixels for a 3 d case to 12 430 pixels for the ecs 4lf approach in the mclaughlin catchment this 40 times reduction in the number of computational units is irrespective of cpu speed and decreases the computational time at the same order i e 40 this reduction in computational units time will enable hydrologic modellers to assess long term climate change impacts in large catchments using high resolution spatial information and also to perform uncertainty analysis using multiple climate change scenarios the impact of channel routing on simulated streamflow from the ecs 4lf approach is also explored three routing models are applied at the catchment scale these are the muskingum model cunge 1969 nash 1959 ordinary least square ols model liang and nash 1988 and linear perturbation model lpm nash and barsi 1983 to apply these models single input and single output routing schemes are considered and parameters of the routing models are calibrated using the observed streamflow data while adding these routing models slightly improved simulated streamflow the results were not consistent throughout the study period as a result the routing models were not considered due to calibration of routing parameters in addition channel routing becomes important in catchments that are larger than the study catchment liang and nash 1988 for those very large catchments calibration free channel routing models can be developed similar to those used for ungauged areas all simulation results presented here are based on derived parameter values from the actual topographical and physiographical features of the catchment and no calibration was performed as channel routing is not considered in the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches water storage mechanism in channels cannot be considered however the impacts of unsaturated zone storage on streamflow and the rest of catchment fluxes are considered in the u3m 2d model 4 2 spatial variability of catchment scale fluxes in relation to climate and land cover daily actual transpiration and soil evaporation are simulated on each pixel of an ecs 4lf and ecs slf using the u3m 2d model the actual transpiration and soil evaporation are added to calculate daily actual evapotranspiration for the ecs 4lf approach actual evapotranspiration values for each landform within a soil polygon were obtained as an arithmetic average of pixels located in the same landform inside a soil polygon of a first order sub basin in the ecs slf approach as there is only a single landform in each soil polygon the actual evapotranspiration values were obtained as an arithmetic average of pixels located inside a soil polygon of a first order sub basin fig 6 a and 7a present the spatial variation of average annual evapotranspiration from the ecs 4lf approach at landform scale and ecs slf approach at soil polygon scale respectively across the mclaughlin catchment for the period 1975 2000 daily soil moistures are simulated for each pixel of an ecs 4lf and ecs slf at various depths to obtain mean annual soil moisture for each landform within a soil polygon for the ecs 4lf approach the soil moisture values of all pixels in a given landform are averaged for the duration of the analysis in a similar manner for the ecs slf approach the soil moisture values of all pixels in a soil polygon are averaged for the duration of the analysis to obtain mean annual soil moisture for each soil polygon results are only presented for the surface soil layer of 10 cm depth fig 6d for ecs 4lf and 7d for ecs slf the averaging of pixel values in a given landform will result in uniform soil moisture and evapotranspiration values in a landform because the alluvial flat landform width is 0 25 m saturation in soil moisture generally occurs near the stream network the width of footslope is 50 m 25 m to 75 m from the stream network therefore this landform will show average soil moisture of two pixels in the ecs 4lf approach to compare the soil moisture distribution across a wet and a dry year average wet year 1978 and dry year 1982 soil moisture values for the ecs 4lf and ecs slf are also mapped in figs 6e f 7e f respectively further the spatial pattern of evapotranspiration in a wet 1978 versus a dry year 1982 for ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are presented in figs 6b c 7b c respectively 4 2 1 spatial variability of evapotranspiration simulated average annual evapotranspiration in the mclaughlin catchment ranges from 414 mm y to 682 mm y for the ecs 4lf and 426 mm y to 680 mm y for the ecs slf approach figs 6a 7a the ranges of average annual evapotranspiration in both ecs approaches are very close but the ecs slf range is slightly narrower because the averaging of topographical and physiographical properties is done at the soil polygon scale instead of four landforms in a sub basin on average evapotranspiration for native woody and pasture land cover types are 555 mm y and 538 mm y respectively for the ecs 4lf approach whereas these are 557 mm y and 537 mm y respectively for ecs slf approach evapotranspiration is higher for the native woody compared to the pasture due to higher water use efficiency e g higher lai and deeper roots of the native woody vegetation figs 6a 7a 1c mean annual evapotranspiration in a wet year varies between 367 mm y to 628 mm y for the ecs 4lf approach and 371 mm y to 627 mm y for the ecs slf approach the rainfall and potential evapotranspiration are 1041 mm y and 793 mm y respectively jeffrey et al 2001 teng et al 2008 figs 6b 7b the maximum evapotranspiration in both ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are lower than the potential evapotranspiration in a wet year due to higher frequency of anoxic condition caused by fully saturated conditions in the root zone despite the higher rainfall in the upper part of the catchment compared to the low land the evapotranspiration is lower due to the lower potential evapotranspiration in climate zones c d table 1 and frequency of anoxic conditions mean annual evapotranspiration in a dry year varies between 304 mm y to 807 mm y for the ecs 4lf approach and 311 mm y to 805 mm y for ecs slf approach fig 6c 7c the evapotranspiration in a dry year strongly shows the pattern of climate zones rainfall for ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches fig 6c 7c 1b table 1 the rainfall amount in a dry year is very low i e 370 mm y and potential evapotranspiration is high i e 1015 mm y therefore actual evapotranspiration is highly controlled by the limited available water in a dry year the upper ranges of evapotranspiration in the dry year for both ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are higher than the wet year because the potential evapotranspiration in the dry year is significantly higher 1015 mm y than the wet year 793 mm y fig 6b c 7b c a common trend found in the first order sub basins of all evapotranspiration maps in the ecs 4lf approach fig 6a c is that evapotranspiration is gradually increasing from the upper landforms i e upslope toward the bottom landform i e alluvial flats however this trend is not presented in evapotranspiration maps of ecs slf approach because the entire soil polygon is treated as one landform fig 7 a c therefore the ecs 4lf approach is superior to the ecs slf approach in representing the spatial variation of evapotranspiration along the hillslopes the increasing trend of evapotranspiration from the upper landform to the bottom landform is consistent with the field scenarios as evapotranspiration is high in the wetter zones located close to the river network further it is also consistent with the increasing trend in soil moisture from the upper landforms to bottom landforms as discussed in the next section which shows that the evapotranspiration is highly controlled by the amount of available water in the root zones in both ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches most of the evapotranspiration occurs in shallow rooting pasture as it covers around 86 of the entire catchment and the remainder is the native woody covering 13 of the catchment the simulated evapotranspiration from the ecs 4lf is very close to the ecs slf approach but the ecs slf approach is unable to simulate the evapotranspiration at a landform scale note that the evapotranspiration is the dominant flux in the mclaughlin catchment the comparison of simulated evapotranspiration from ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches with the simulated evapotranspiration from waterdyn model raupach et al 2009 is presented in detail in section 4 2 3 4 2 2 spatial variability of soil moisture the average soil moisture maps for ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches for the whole study period wet year and dry year show lower soil moisture values in the upper part of the catchment and in few areas of the lower part of the catchment figs 6d f 7d f in the upper part of the catchment soil moisture values are lower because of higher evapotranspiration from the native woody and the presence of shallow yellow earth granite and earthy sands granite soil types in these soil types surface soil material has significantly higher saturated hydraulic conductivity than the deeper soil materials causing more water to move down in the deeper soil materials and retain less water in the surface soil material fig 1c d and fig s 2 in supplementary material the lower values of soil moisture in few areas of the lower part of the catchment such as along the main stem of the river network are mostly due to the dominance of lithosols metasediments soil type figs 6d f 7d f 1d and fig s 2 in supplementary material the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of lithosols metasediments is 24 cm d in all four soil horizons materials table s 1 in the supplementary material these high values of ksat in the lower soil horizons materials allow more water to pass downwards as deep drainage and less moisture is retained in top soil layers figs 6d f 7d f 1d and fig s 2 in supplementary material further all soil moisture maps in ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches closely reflect soil types and climate zones pattern figs 6d f 7d f 1b d and fig s 2 in supplementary material in particular the soil type pattern dominates because the soil type plays an important role for simulating the water balance and soil moisture values the average surface soil moisture for the ecs 4lf and ecs slf during the whole study period 26 yr varies from 0 12 m3 m3 to 0 41 m3 m3 over the entire catchment for the wet year 1978 this ranges between 0 14 m3 m3 to 0 42 m3 m3 figs 6d e and 7d e for the dry year 1982 the average soil moisture for the ecs 4lf varies from 0 09 m3 m3 to 0 37 m3 m3 and for the ecs slf varies from 0 09 m3 m3 to 0 36 m3 m3 figs 6f and 7f as can be seen in these figures no significant differences between the ecs 4lf and ecs slf simulations are observed when ranges of soil moisture for the whole duration wet year or dry year are considered as it is expected soil moisture values are higher in a wet year compared to the dry year for both ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches throughout the catchment reflecting the influence of input rainfall and potential evapotranspiration figs 6e f 7e f in the ecs 4lf approach all three soil moisture maps show that the bottom landforms i e alluvial flats have higher soil moisture values compared to the rest of the landforms because of higher saturation near the river network fig 6d f this pattern is not visible in some sub basins in the lower part of the catchment especially along the main stem of the river network fig 6d f low soil moisture values in these regions are due to the prevalence of lithosols metasediments soil type that allows more deep drainage and less moisture retained in the top soil layers fig 6d f and fig s 2 in supplementary material small water content of the top soil layer in all four landforms upslope midslope footslope and alluvial flats of the main river network results in small variation of soil moisture in these landforms during wet and dry periods fig 6d f the increase in soil moisture near the river network cannot be seen in soil moisture maps from the ecs slf approach as the entire soil polygon is treated as a single landform fig 7d f this highlights the importance of using multiple landforms in the ecs approach to simulate the spatial variability of land surface states and fluxes the variability of soil moisture across landforms in the ecs 4lf approach will be discussed in detail in section 4 3 note that the spatial variation of evapotranspiration and soil moisture cannot be simulated in lumped conceptual models as the entire catchment is treated as a single unit this highlights the importance of using the ecs 4lf based semi distributed modelling approach the spatial comparison of simulated soil moisture from ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches with the simulated soil moisture from waterdyn model raupach et al 2009 is presented in the next section 4 2 3 verification of evapotranspiration and soil moisture from waterdyn awap model the monthly simulated evapotranspiration values for 1975 2000 period are extracted from the waterdyn awap model developed by raupach et al 2009 for the grids which are either completely or partly located in the mclaughlin catchment the weighted monthly evapotranspiration is calculated for the entire mclaughlin catchment from these gridded data and compared with the ecs 4lf and ecs slf simulated evapotranspiration fig 8 a b the simulated evapotranspiration from both ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are very close to the waterdyn awap model throughout the simulation period the average annual evapotranspiration for the entire study period 1975 2000 wet year 1978 and dry year 1982 from the waterdyn awap model are also estimated and presented in fig 9 a c the spatial variation of evapotranspiration of waterdyn awap model is consistent with the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches figs 6a c 7a c and 9a c the average annual evapotranspiration for 1975 2000 from the waterdyn awap model is higher in the upper part of the catchment and gradually decreases towards the lower part of the catchment this spatial pattern is consistent with the spatial pattern of evapotranspiration from the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches figs 6a 7a and 9a in the wet year 1978 simulated evapotranspiration from the waterdyn awap model is higher than the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches as shown in the evapotranspiration time series plot figs 6b 7b 8a and 9b in terms of spatial patterns simulated evapotranspiration in the upper part of the catchment where climate zones c d are located by the waterdyn awap are significantly higher ranges 700 to 790 mm than the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches with ranges from 330 to 660 mm figs 1b 6b 7b and 9b the reason for these differences particularly in the wet year is mainly related to the consideration of anoxic conditions in the root zone in u3m 2d model caused by increases in soil saturation in the dry year 1982 the spatial pattern of evapotranspiration from the waterdyn awap model is consistent with the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches and all three modelling approaches show higher evapotranspiration in the upper part of the catchment and evapotranspiration is gradually decreasing towards the lower part of the catchment figs 6c 7c and 9c in the upper part of the catchment where climate zones c d are located the ranges of evapotranspiration from ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are high ranges 360 to 810 mm compared to the ranges from the waterdyn awap model ranges 490 to 580 mm figs 1b 6c 7c and 9c the reason for these differences is related to differences in soil depth and rooting depth between the two models in the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches soil layers are quite deep and can reach up to 6 m in some areas in the upper part of the catchment in addition native woody vegetation has deep rooting depth and can extract water from the deep soil layers up to 4 m fig 1c whereas in waterdyn awap model the maximum depth of soil layer is limited to 1 5 m only and two soil layers are considered with depths of 0 to 0 2 m and 0 2 to 1 5 m for the upper and lower soil layers respectively raupach et al 2009 soil moisture in deep soil layers is high in comparison to the top soil layer as discussed in detail in sections 4 3 and 4 4 the mean annual soil moisture from the waterdyn awap model for the entire study period 1975 2000 wet year 1978 and dry year 1982 are estimated and presented in fig 9d f in general horizontal and vertical distribution of soil moisture is highly variable between the two models further the waterdyn awap model is a daily terrestrial water balance model with a spatial resolution of 5 km 5 km raupach et al 2009 these limitations make soil moisture comparisons more challenging despite the differences in the spatial resolution of both models top layer soil moisture patterns in the waterdyn awap model is consistent with the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches figs 6d f 7d f and 9d f there is a little variation in the upper part of the catchment where ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches show less soil moisture than the waterdyn awap model figs 6d f 7d f and 9d f this difference could be caused by the differences in soil properties between the two models in the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches the soil type in the upper part of the catchment is shallow yellow earth granite and earthy sands granite with significantly higher saturated hydraulic conductivity than the deeper soil materials causing more downward movement of water to the deeper soil materials and lower surface soil moisture fig 1d and fig s 2 in supplementary material the soil type and properties used in the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are from the soil information package of murphy et al 2005 these high quality datasets are specifically generated for the mclaughlin and neighbouring catchments in the previous investigations for the waterdyn awap model soil properties are obtained from the digital atlas of australian soils developed at continental scale therefore it is quite likely that soil properties would be different between the two models in some small regions of the catchment despite minor differences in the upper part of the catchment in general the top layer soil moisture spatial pattern from the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are comparable with the waterdyn awap model the waterdyn awap model has been validated for catchment outflows at various time scales in variety of catchments across australia and few climate variables and found reasonably accurate raupach et al 2009 therefore the waterdyn awap model outputs are widely used in australia although there are differences in the input forcings spatial resolution modelling methodology and soil information between the waterdyn awap model and ecs 4lf ecs slf approaches the simulated evapotranspiration and soil moisture are consistent in most parts of the mclaughlin catchment these results indicate that the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches have the potential to simulate evapotranspiration and soil moisture with reasonably good accuracy 4 2 4 verification of soil moisture from the european space agency climate change initiative data set the correlation coefficients between area weighted catchment average daily surface soil moisture from the esa cci and the landform area weighted catchment average daily simulated soil moisture from the ecs 4lf approach are calculated for individual years and the entire period 1991 2000 table 4 the correlation coefficient for the entire period is 0 612 but varies for individual year from 0 438 to 0 819 table 4 depending on the quality of esa cci soil moisture observations in individual years and availability of esa cci observations the average monthly soil moisture is also calculated from the daily catchment average soil moisture from the esa cci and ecs 4lf approaches the correlation coefficient from the average monthly soil moisture for the entire period 1991 2000 is 0 64 which is slightly higher than the daily data overall the correlation coefficient values between the two data sets at daily and monthly time scales are reasonably high despite the large differences in spatial resolution the ecs 4lf daily soil moisture time series is also compared with the esa cci daily soil moisture time series for year 1995 in fig 10 as the same year is used for streamflow comparison fig 4 the simulated soil moisture values from the ecs 4lf approach are matching closely with the esa cci soil moisture values fig 10 similar trends are also observed in other years considering the large differences in horizontal as well as vertical resolution between the ecs 4lf and esa cci approaches the soil moisture values from both approaches are close this result indicates that the simulated soil moisture from the ecs 4lf is reasonably accurate and reliable considering that no calibration is performed in the ecs 4lf approach as ecs 4lf is the best performing approach no comparison with the ecs slf is performed 4 3 vertical distribution of soil moisture across different landforms the vertical distribution of soil moisture is important for calculating the soil moisture deficit for irrigation purposes to analyze the vertical soil moisture distribution across the landforms in ecs 4lf approach the kernel density and bar plots of soil moisture are presented for various soil depths and four landforms of the entire mclaughlin catchment figs 11 12 to obtain the kernel density plots pixel based values of daily soil moisture at a particular depth are averaged for a given landform across the catchment fig 11 note that to avoid excessive number of kernel density plots in fig 11 data for a few nodal soil depths are shown fig 12 a b shows the mean and standard deviation of daily soil moisture for each landform at various soil depths kernel density and bar plots show the variation of soil moisture in four landforms at various depths for the entire mclaughlin catchment figs 11 12 overall soil moisture variability is highest at the surface soil layer i e at 10 cm depth for all the landforms however mean soil moisture is low due to high transpiration and soil evaporation soil moisture variability reduces in deeper soil layers because of lower permeability of deep soil layers which restrict soil water movement soil evaporation and transpiration from deep soil layers are negligible because of the lower permeability of deep soil layers and shallow rooting depth of pasture figs 11 12 note the pasture is dominant land cover type in the mclaughlin catchment fig 1c the kernel density plots of all the landforms at various soil depths 0 1 0 5 1 0 3 0 6 0 m clearly show shift of the distribution plots towards the right side as depth increases fig 11 i e increase in mean soil moisture at deeper soil layers fig 12a the kernel density plots are spiky at 3 0 m and 6 0 m depths fig 11 as the number of simulated data points is less at higher soil depths note that the soil depths are not constant throughout the catchment generally upper parts of the hillslopes have shallower soils and the thickness of soil zone gradually increases towards the lower part of the hillslopes the mean soil moisture is increasing from 0 1 m to 1 0 m depth within four landforms i e upslope to alluvial flats due to more saturation near the river network after 1 0 m depth the mean soil moisture is almost constant in all four landforms because deeper soil layers are wetter fig 12a the simulated soil moisture at 15 cm depth from the ecs approach was thoroughly validated against in situ soil moisture for wagga wagga experimental catchment by khan et al 2014 indicating reasonable accuracy of soil moisture simulations by the ecs approach further the soil moisture at various soil depths in this study is also consistent with the input forcing and follows the expected behaviour as ecs slf approach only contains one single landform in a soil polygon therefore above mentioned analysis cannot be performed for ecs slf approach 4 4 impact of different climate and land cover on soil moisture to analyze the impact of different climate and land cover on soil moisture values on four landforms at various soil depths the kernel density and bar plots of mean and standard deviation are explored for ecs 4lf approach to avoid an excessive number of plots only mean plots are presented in fig 13 a b other plots are available from the authors on request two extreme climate zones wettest zone d and driest zone a are considered the mean soil moisture values of each landform at various soil depths are calculated for ecs 4lf approach in a similar manner as calculated in section 4 3 however the averaging is performed at the scale of individual climate zones rather than the entire catchment fig 13a as it is expected mean soil moisture in zone a driest zone is lower than zone d throughout all landforms and soil depths fig 1b despite the large differences in the mean annual rainfall in the climate zones a d 551 mm y vs 1300 mm y the same order of differences is not reflected in soil moisture values in fig 13a this is because the soil hydraulic properties as well as the land cover types play an important role in controlling the soil moisture in the catchment in the case of climate zone d a major part of this region is covered with highly permeable soils that allow more deep drainage in addition presence of native woody land cover type in this area causes high transpiration rates fig 1b d and fig s 2 in supplementary material the impact of transpiration and soil evaporation on soil moisture diminishes at 6 0 m depth whereas substantial differences exist in mean soil moisture between climate zones a d the mean soil moistures of four landforms at various soil depths are calculated separately for ecs 4lf approach for both land cover types i e pasture and native woody using the same methodology as used for climate zones fig 13b the mean soil moisture values for native woody are consistently lower than the pasture across all landforms and soil depths higher transpiration from native woody is caused by deep rooting depth the maximum root depth for pasture is 60 cm whereas for native woody is 4 0 m and access to deeper soil moisture the soil hydraulic properties are also playing an important role in reducing the soil moisture in native woodlands the native woodlands are located in the areas where soil types have higher saturated hydraulic conductivity which causes more deep drainage fig 1c d and fig s 2 in supplementary material note that in fig 13a the mean soil moisture values in climate zone a for upslope at 6 0 m soil depth is not shown this is because the simulated soil moisture data is not available at this depth in climate zone a for upslope in a similar manner the simulated soil moisture data is not available for native woody in upslope at 6 0 m soil depth fig 13b the soil moisture information at various soil depths in each land cover types is very helpful for calculating soil moisture deficit for irrigation purposes note that the above mentioned analysis cannot be performed for the ecs slf approach as a single landform exists in each soil polygon implementation of the ecs 4lf approach is recommended over the ecs slf approach because the ecs 4lf disaggregates the hillslope realistically and provides more information about spatial variability of soil moisture and hydrologic fluxes 5 summary the ecs approach developed previously by khan et al 2014 was applicable at the first order sub basin scale whereas the presented ecs 4lf approach is modified to apply at the catchment scale we made some simplifications for automating the presented ecs 4lf delineation approach for catchment scale applications the simulated discharge from the modified ecs 4lf based distributed modelling approach without calibration shows reasonable consistency with the observed streamflow and all lumped conceptual models used in this study this consistency indicates that the ecs 4lf approach has the potential to be applied for distributed modelling of other catchments especially ungauged catchments where observed streamflow data are not available or not sufficient for proper calibration of the conceptual models the ecs 4lf modelling approach along with the 2 d richards equation makes this approach more suitable for simulating the shallow sub surface flows in upland catchments like other distributed hydrologic models the ecs 4lf approach also requires extensive spatial input data i e dem soil type land cover climate and geology to derive model parameters currently the ecs 4lf approach is used in research mode further development and evaluation are required in variety of settings to make it an operational product future developments are focused on developing a graphical user interface gui for automating ecs 4lf delineation development of groundwater and detailed eco hydrological modules despite these limitations the presented ecs 4lf approach is a valuable tool for simulating spatially distributed hydrological fluxes with high accuracy and significantly reducing the computational time units associated with typical distributed hydrological modelling applications 6 conclusions an equivalent cross section based semi distributed hydrologic modelling approach initially developed for eight discrete first order sub basins is modified here for a large catchment scale simulation containing 822 first order sub basins all parameters used in this approach are derived from the actual topographical and physiographical features of the catchment without any calibration or adjustment being needed the simulated streamflows from the equivalent cross section approach are consistent with the observed streamflows the simulated streamflows are also compared with four calibrated conceptual models streamflows and results found to be comparable in addition the equivalent cross section approach shows nearly a 40 times reduction in computational units when compared to a grid based fully distributed hydrological modelling setup performance of the ecs 4lf was better than the ecs slf approach considering that the ecs 4lf represents the spatial variability of hydrologic fluxes along the hillslope the simulated actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture from the ecs 4lf and ecs slf approaches are very similar to the awap model further the simulated soil moisture from the ecs 4lf approach is found to be consistent with the satellite derived european space agency climate change initiative esa cci surface soil moisture data the equivalent cross section based semi distributed modelling approach has the ability to simulate variety of spatially distributed hydrological fluxes that are consistent with the input forcing and land surface characteristics the results at the landform scale show that within the landforms the mean soil moisture in shallow layers has increased as we move from upslope to alluvial flats due to the saturation near river network this pattern is not significant in small regions in lower parts of the catchment especially along the main stem of the river network because of low soil moisture values in all landforms in deeper soil layers the mean soil moisture is almost constant across all landforms due to low saturated hydraulic conductivity the variability in soil moisture is higher for surface soil layers due to high evapotranspiration and lower for deeper soil layers for all landforms the pasture dominated region of the catchment has higher soil moisture than the native woody due to shallower root depths and lower lai it can be concluded that the equivalent cross section based semi distributed hydrological modelling has the potential to simulate a variety of hydrological fluxes for a large catchment in a
