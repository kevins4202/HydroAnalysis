11695,the large scale quantification of groundwater recharge threshold conditions is a bottleneck in the field of research considering that groundwater recharge processes can be quite complex and affected by different factors in different regions traditional statistical approaches have either focused on local to regional scales or are limited to a single factor such as rainfall resulting in a lack of a comprehensive understanding of groundwater recharge mechanisms on large scales considering that finding a threshold to instantly determine whether the groundwater is in the state of recharge or discharge is a classification task involving multiple factors machine learning techniques with self learning capabilities efficient processing of big data and mining relationships between multiple factors is thus applied to this study in this study three traditional machine learning classification techniques are explored classification and regression tree cart random forest rf and logistical regression lr to quantify specific threshold values for each condition including rainfall evaporation soil moisture runoff and vegetation since they are more interpretable compared to advanced machine learning techniques such as neural networks using the australian continent as an example cart is the fastest method and provides an average classification accuracy 76 at almost the same levels compared to rf 77 78 and lr 79 80 meanwhile cart is the only method to rank the importance of conditions while providing a specific threshold for each condition when inferring the groundwater recharge mechanism through threshold conditions the cart method suggests that a primary the most important threshold condition is sufficient for most parts of the australian continent e g rainfall as the primary threshold condition in northern australia indicates a direct recharge mechanism only the coastal areas of southeastern and southwestern australia are dominated by multiple threshold conditions showing the complex groundwater recharge mechanism overall the significance of this work is to provide the spatial maps of threshold conditions that mainly control groundwater recharge and their specific threshold values which are crucial for managers to carry out a good plan over a large area more importantly this study demonstrates the potential of traditional machine learning methods to reveal groundwater recharge mechanisms which may help further refine the development of groundwater models in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords classification tree groundwater logistical regression random forest threshold data availability all data used in this study are free and available on the australia bureau of meteorology and the national aeronautics and space administration nasa earth data centre 1 introduction groundwater recharge is a complex hydrological process affected by many conditions such as rainfall evaporation soil vegetation topography geology fu et al 2019 moeck et al 2020 hu et al 2021 groundwater recharge threshold conditions defined as the necessary conditions required and the specific values that these conditions must reach to trigger the groundwater level rise baker et al 2020 moeck et al 2020 for example hu et al 2019 indicate that groundwater will not recharge in the coastal areas of perth australia unless rainfall exceeds 60 70 mm month normally april to september in this example rainfall of 60 70 mm month is considered as the groundwater recharge threshold condition and such information is important for predicting groundwater recharge timing needed for agricultural activity and adjusting an annual water allocation plan carroll et al 2019 previous studies have tried to quantify groundwater recharge threshold conditions using various methods such as isotope cave drip and borehole monitoring network jones and banner 2003 kotchoni et al 2019 baker et al 2020 however these methods are only suitable at local or regional scales usually coupled with geological investigations requiring specialised knowledge to place or operate equipment expensive and time consuming more importantly these methods have certain constraints when discussing groundwater recharge such as studying only rainfall threshold condition or discussing threshold conditions in terms of specific aquifers or climates this is possibly due to the complexity of handling multiple threshold conditions over a large area or at high spatial resolution for example each condition has a different weight of influence on groundwater recharge that varies spatially since the recharge mechanisms are different in various hydrogeological regions barron et al 2012 hu et al 2017 2021 motiee and mcbean 2017 large scale quantification of groundwater recharge threshold conditions is very difficult small 2005 tried to quantify the groundwater recharge threshold over the southwestern united states using precipitation and potential evapotranspiration however the conclusion reached was that using these two conditions was insufficient to predict groundwater recharge occurrence suggesting that other conditions have significant impacts on groundwater recharge which were not considered for example moeck et al 2020 indicate that except for climatic conditions e g rainfall and evaporation non climatic conditions such as vegetation and runoff also have obvious impacts on groundwater recharge over some regions around the world fu et al 2019 also make similar deductions based on a case study over the southeast corner of south australia however both studies do not provide the threshold values of each condition nor do they rank the importance of each condition to the best of the authors knowledge no study has ever provided information on groundwater recharge thresholds in terms of large areas e g basin to continental scales and multiple conditions yet such information is important for groundwater prediction understanding of recharge mechanisms and enabling managers to adjust water use plans for other applications besides for groundwater models that simulate the hydrological process such information can enhance the understanding of recharge processes thus improving model performance von freyberg et al 2015 from a statistical point of view quantifying groundwater recharge threshold conditions can be regarded as a classification task that requires the determination and quantification of the threshold conditions that instantly distinguish between net groundwater recharge class one level rises and discharge class two level drops machine learning classifications thus are likely to be the solution to this task since they normally do not require an understanding of the complex hydrological process of groundwater recharge yin et al 2021 also they can be applied on non parametric data distribution maxwell et al 2018 most importantly they are powerful enough to deal with large datasets and multi condition problems as considered in this study although we have not found any previous studies using machine learning classification techniques to quantify groundwater recharge threshold conditions machine learning techniques have already been employed in the groundwater research field for prediction purposes in recent years see e g tao et al 2022 martinsen et al 2022 also there have been many studies to identify threshold conditions in other fields see e g miao et al 2011 belgiu and drǎgut 2016 wu et al 2018 yang et al 2019 among many machine learning classification methods classification and regression tree cart breiman et al 1984 is probably the most suitable method for addressing this task since it is the only method that can directly quantify the specific threshold value for each condition the only concern is that the classification accuracy could be lower than for other more advanced machine learning classifications for example previous studies e g long et al 1993 ali et al 2012 deschamps et al 2012 belgiu and drǎgut 2016 showed that random forest rf breiman 2001 and logistical regression lr pregibon 1981 perform better than cart thus a comparison between cart and other machine learning classifications is necessary to confirm whether cart quantifies the groundwater recharge threshold conditions with satisfactory classification accuracy this study therefore tries to quantify large scale groundwater recharge threshold conditions through an exploration of the cart rf and lr methods as exemplified by the australian continent specifically i the classification accuracies and computation time of these three machine learning methods are compared ii the importance ranking of threshold conditions of these three methods are compared iii the specific threshold values monthly based of each condition from cart are presented spatially since it is the only method that provides threshold values iv the potential groundwater recharge mechanisms inferred by different threshold conditions are discussed and v the strength limitation and future direction of this study are discussed 2 method and material 2 1 data preparation since we are going to use machine learning techniques the training data that includes the condition variable and the response variable must be prepared for the training process 2 1 1 response variable in the training process the response variables which in our case are groundwater recharge class one and discharge class two are used to classify the condition variables here the global land data assimilation system gldas catchment land surface model clsm version 2 2 with data assimilated from the gravity recovery and climate experiment and follow on products grace grace fo hereafter referred to as gldas da is employed to offer groundwater storage estimates at a 0 25 0 25 spatial and daily temporal resolution li et al 2019 gldas da has been chosen here due to its high spatial resolution long temporal span data with global coverage and is freely available as for the quality of the data li et al 2019 evaluated the grace da using over 4000 in situ data around the world and obtained an average 4 3 cm groundwater variation root mean square errors and a correlation of 0 65 at regional scale note that the grace product is not used due to its coarse spatial resolution on the one hand and on the other hand gldas model is still required to derive groundwater storage changes from grace total water storage to prepare the monthly resolution datasets the monthly groundwater change is calculated using the groundwater storage estimates from gldas da for the last day of the current month minus the last day of the previous month when groundwater change is above below zero the groundwater for the current month is classified as recharge discharge 2 1 2 condition variable the condition variable is used to predict the response variable after training in our case we selected five condition variables rainfall evaporation runoff soil moisture and vegetation greenness since previous studies have reported these as the major threshold conditions that determine whether groundwater recharges see e g small 2005 diodato and ceccarelli 2006 fu et al 2019 moeck et al 2020 to evaluate the uncertainty of the machine learning classifications derived from different input training data the australian local products i e australian bureau of meteorology rainfall products and australian water resources assessment landscape awra l model version 6 frost et al 2018 frost and wright 2018 and the global products i e gldas noah land surface model version 2 1 rodell et al 2004 beaudoing et al 2020 are employed for the condition variables of rainfall evaporation soil moisture and runoff since it uses the same forcing input data as gldas da gldas da does not provide some of these parameters in daily format due to policy issues as for the vegetation greenness the enhanced vegetation index evi of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer mod13c2 didan 2015 products are used for the same month note that for groundwater and vegetation there are no australian local products and as such only two types of products are prepared for the condition variables of rainfall evaporation soil moisture and runoff also the common water balance equation rainfall minus evaporation is not used as a condition variable due to the fact that the output will lose the ability to distinguish which one is the primary condition finally table 1 summarises the products that offer data as condition variables and response variables to unify the spatial resolution among different datasets all data with 0 05 0 05 spatial resolution are resized into 0 25 0 25 before being used for the 2004 2019 period 2 2 machine learning classifications note all the classification methods in this study are done through matlab software for specific codes of each method we recommend referring to the following web pages https www mathworks com help stats choose a classifier html 2 2 1 classification and regression tree cart the classification and regression tree cart method proposed by breiman et al 1984 is a widely used decision tree see e g gray and fan 2008 zheng et al 2009 elliott and owens 2015 xu et al 2021 the core part of the cart method is to grow a binary decision tree by using recursive splitting rules see tree example in fig 1 for classification tree the rules normally used are entropy or gini s diversity index gdi both of them can get similar results however gdi is computationally faster than entropy thus is used in our study for gdi it measures the impurity of a node which is expressed as breiman et al 1984 1 g 1 i p i 2 where pi is the proportion of categories with the category i that reach the node since there are only two categories in the response variables in our case i e recharge p1 and discharge p2 gdi can be rewritten as 2 g 1 p 1 2 p 2 2 if a node has just one category e g all the response variables are marked as recharge perfectly being classified then g is equal to 0 otherwise g is positive therefore the rule of node division in cart is to choose the smallest g taking our case as an example suppose we are trying to quantify the rainfall threshold for groundwater recharge for a specific region and the total number of samples is d based on a test threshold value of rainfall such as m mm month all samples are divided into two parts da rainfall above m mm month and db rainfall below m mm month then the gdi of this m threshold g rainfall m for creating two nodes da and db can be calculated as 3 g r a i n f a l l m d a d g d a d b d g d b the calculation of equation 3 runs continuously for different test values of m until m covers all the range of rainfall values after that the m value corresponding to the minimum g is selected as the rainfall threshold for groundwater recharge after this process one node is split into two nodes correspondingly the training data is split into two parts by m i e above below m in terms of multi condition variables we simply line up all the samples of variables and loop the steps above each loop will quantify a threshold condition based on gdi and split a node into two the loop will continue until the impurity of the new node is 0 or it reaches the stopping criterion the decision tree is then complete normally if we do not set a stopping criterion the resulting tree could be very complicated and over fitting in other words its classification accuracy in the training data is very high but it is low in actual application thus post pruning is usually required after the tree is complete song and lu 2015 however post pruning needs to apply cross validation or similar approaches for all possible subtrees tree stops to grow at some nodes of the full tree tree grows without limitation and it takes significant time to compute given that our aim is to quantify the groundwater recharge threshold conditions at a large scale e g australia has around 11 000 pixels and each pixel needs to train a tree the pre pruning approach song and lu 2015 by setting global stopping criterion such as maximum split is more suitable for our study since it saves massive time in general the more the maximum split allowed the more accurate the decision tree but the greater the potential risk of over fitting in our case the maximum split number is set as the number of condition variables so that each variable has a chance to play a role in the groundwater recharge threshold condition at each split see a similar process in ghosh et al 2014 2 2 2 random forest rf random forest rf introduced by breiman 2001 is an ensemble classification method using the cart algorithm to grow many trees as shown in fig 2 every tree in the forest is grown independently by randomly selecting a subset of the training sample through replacement the so called bootstrap sampling or bagging belgiu and drǎgut 2016 specifically in the process of random sampling rf not only randomly selects the number of samples but also randomly selects condition variables for example some trees may be grown by using just rainfall and evaporation rather than all the condition variables this operation increases the randomness of the tree and prevents over fitting since the final classification results are generated by voting see fig 2 from every tree in the forest thus rf is said to have low variance robust model and better classification accuracy than cart see e g ali et al 2012 deschamps et al 2012 awange et al 2020 however compared to the cart method the random forest loses its interpretability and cannot provide the specific values of groundwater recharge threshold conditions maxwell et al 2018 for the rf training the number of trees to be generated is a parameter that needs to be pre set belgiu and drǎgut 2016 although some studies have reported that this parameter has no obvious influence on the classification results at least three trees are required for voting otherwise meaningless see e g du et al 2015 different number of trees will still be tested in our case besides the pre pruning process mentioned in section 2 2 1 is also necessary for rf to reduce the computation time belgiu and drǎgut 2016 since the rf will be compared to cart in this study the same maximum split as cart is applied to rf 2 2 3 logistical regression lr logistical regression lr is a widely used generalized linear regression model with features simple and fast especially for binary classification see e g dixon 2009 yang et al 2019 adiat et al 2020 in our case lr simply calculates the probability p from 0 to 1 of groundwater recharge through a sigmoid function of the linear combination of condition variables xn which is expressed as yang et al 2019 4 l n p 1 p a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a n x n where ai i 0 n are the regression coefficients corresponding to xi i 1 n the final classification results depend on p when p is above below 0 5 then groundwater is classified as recharge discharge thus similar to rf lr also cannot directly provide the specific values of groundwater recharge threshold conditions during the training process the ai i 0 n will be adjusted for numerous iterations until the classification accuracy stops improving or iteration times reaches the pre set limit for more details of the lr approach we refer the reader to awange et al 2020 pp 99 109 2 3 classification accuracy evaluation using k fold cross validation k fold cross validation fushiki 2009 rodriguez et al 2010 is commonly used for predictive models generated by machine learning in terms of accuracy evaluation the main theory of this method is to randomly divide all samples into k folds many previous studies used a default value of 10 folds mahmood and khan 2009 ramezan et al 2019 use the k 1 folds for training and leave one out of the fold for validation this process of training and validation gives a percentage of prediction error and is regarded as one iteration the process is repeated for k iterations and each iteration uses a different leaving one out of the fold for validation finally after k iterations the average prediction error of k times is the overall prediction error and the classification accuracy is equal to 1 minus the overall prediction error note that the traditional leave one out cross validation is not used in this study due to the fact that 1 leave one out only works better than k fold when the number of training data is small and in this study we have 192 training datasets for each pixel 2 leave one out is computationally expensive in this study it is almost 19 times slower than k fold and we have about 11 000 pixels to train 3 leave one out could have a high variance when a dataset is large which leads to unreliable estimates according to ron 1995 in addition this study only cares about the overall accuracy of machine learning models i e if groundwater recharge and discharge are all correctly classified thus other metrics such as precision recall and f score that specifically look at true positive or false negative are not considered 2 4 ranking of the importance of threshold conditions since groundwater recharge is determined by multiple conditions ranking the importance of each condition is important to improve the understanding of the groundwater recharge mechanism for the cart and rf methods the importance of threshold conditions is calculated using mean decrease in gini mdg and mean decrease in accuracy mda respectively see e g breiman 2001 belgiu and drǎgut 2016 the mdg ranks the importance of conditions by measuring how much gini s diversity index can be reduced by a condition generally speaking the further the condition is from the top of the tree fig 1 the lower the importance sandri and zuccolotto 2008 is the mda estimates the importance of conditions by measuring the influence of a condition on the classification accuracy i e the larger the influence the higher the importance as for lr it is a generalized linear regression model the importance of conditions cannot be determined directly since the regression coefficient and its corresponding p value only indicate the influence of each condition on the probability of groundwater recharge rather than the importance of being a threshold condition 2 5 uncertainty from input datasets machine learning techniques are pure statistical tools for data mining e g awange et al 2020 and thus the performance of output depends on the accuracy of the input training data yin et al 2021 in our case some condition variables such as rainfall can be represented by multiple products e g in situ based satellite based and re analysis therefore the uncertainty generated by different input training data for the cart rf and lr methods needs to be compared and discussed previous studies e g von freyberg et al 2015 also strongly recommends using at least two methods while applying different input data to show the uncertainty of the groundwater models 2 6 lag issue despite many previous studies such as yu and lin 2015 hu et al 2017 kotchoni et al 2019 have indicated that there are lags between rainfall and groundwater recharge this study however does not consider the lag issue due to the fact that the lag indicated by previous studies is associated with groundwater level changes which are real observations gldas da is mainly a simulation product based on water balance calculation see e g li et al 2019 theoretically it is unable to reflect the lag between rainfall and groundwater recharge in addition hu et al 2019 indicated that many previous studies take the statistical lags e g calculated using cross correlation between rainfall and groundwater variation as the real lags this is a misunderstanding since rainfall has to reach a certain threshold to recharge groundwater otherwise the rainfall may evaporate or be absorbed by vegetation before it becomes groundwater finally the real lag between rainfall and groundwater mainly depends on the depth of aquifers as well as the surface terrain and the geological structure of the subsurface which is very complex and beyond the scope of this study 2 7 computation time since our target is to quantify groundwater threshold conditions on a large scale the computation time of each machine learning classification would be one of concern in our case the cart rf and lr classification methods are all processed using matlab 2018b software on a pc whose settings are intel r core tm i7 9750h cpu 2 60ghz and 16gb ram note that the computation time can also vary greatly if other techniques such as cloud computing and parallel computing are applied the computation time shown in the results is only a reference for the efficiency of each machine learning classification method 3 results 3 1 classification accuracy 3 1 1 cart method for the cart method the maximum split of five is set as the stopping criterion during the training process as mentioned in section 2 2 1 however during the results inspection phase we found that many pixels only needed one maximum split to achieve almost the same high classification accuracy usually above 75 as the five maximum splits this potentially means that in most parts of the australian continent a single threshold condition is sufficient to classify whether groundwater will be recharged or not this observation might however be different for other areas around the world to confirm this conjecture fig 3 a and b shows the classification accuracy of cart using k fold cross validation k is set as a default value of 10 see details in mahmood and khan 2009 ramezan et al 2019 at the five maximum splits using inputs of australian local and gldas global products respectively while fig 3c and d presents the difference in the classification accuracy between five and one maximum split considering the influence of random sampling on the k fold cross validation a maximum 5 2 5 accuracy error is assumed to be allowed based on our test thus values below 5 are not shown in fig 3c and d from fig 3a and b one can see that the cart method using five maximum splits using local and global products achieve high classification accuracies above 80 in the northern southeastern and southwestern parts of australia the middle inland areas and southern parts of australia have relatively low classification accuracy around 60 compared to the one maximum split cart fig 3c and d five maximum splits cart have significant accuracy advantages of 5 15 in the southwestern a and southeastern b parts of australia for the rest of the areas the five maximum splits cart have no accuracy advantage and are even worse than the one maximum split cart over fitting this confirms our conjecture that a single primary threshold condition is sufficient to classify groundwater recharge discharge in most parts of the australian continent groundwater recharge determined by multi threshold conditions only exists in the southwestern a and southeastern b parts of australia to evaluate the uncertainty caused by the different inputs australian local and gldas global products fig 3e and f presents a comparison of the local and global cart at one and five maximum splits respectively generally the cart trained by australian local products bom and awra l has better classification accuracy 5 11 in the middle inland areas however in the southwestern a and southeastern c and d parts of australia the cart trained by global products gldas noah has better classification accuracy 5 18 3 1 2 cart compared to rf as mentioned in section 2 2 2 rf requires a pre set number of trees to be generated before training belgiu and drǎgut 2016 considering there are about 11 000 pixels over the entire australian continent to be processed by the rf method blindly increasing the number of trees to be generated in each pixel will lead to a drastic increase in computation time for example we tried to generate 50 trees in each pixel and it took about 10 hours to complete more importantly it was found that the classification accuracy of the rf method with 50 trees did not significantly improve in comparison to that of the cart method see table 1 in supplementary material this is consistent with previous studies e g du et al 2015 reported similar situation and concluded that the classification accuracy is not very sensitive to the number of tree to be generated in rf belgiu and drǎgut 2016 awange et al 2020 therefore we reduced the number of trees from 50 to 10 and computed the classification accuracy of 4 rf models about 2 hours each under different settings maximum split and input data the classification accuracy of the 4 rf models is subsequently compared to cart as shown in fig 4 a d from fig 4a d there are many scattered pixels showing that the classification accuracy of rf is improved 6 on average compared to cart however in these scattered pixels from rf the five maximum splits for example fig 4c and d only account for 10 and 16 of the areas of australia this confirms that the cart and rf methods have almost the same classification accuracy over most parts of the australian continent however when compared to the computation time of the cart method 10 minutes rf took hours to calculate the results depending on the number of trees generated e g for 10 trees rf required 2 hours computation time for the entire australian continent while for 50 trees it took approximately 10 hours for 500 trees commonly seen in previous studies belgiu and drǎgut 2016 rf needs more than 100 hours to train if no other acceleration technique such parallel computing is invoiced to examine the uncertainty of rf caused by different maximum splits and the inputs between australian local and gldas global products fig 4e h compare the local and global rf at one and five maximum splits respectively one can see that the uncertainty results are similar to cart see fig 3c f for example rf with five maximum splits has obvious advantages in terms of classification accuracy 5 14 in the southwestern a and southeastern b parts of australia see red circles furthermore rf trained by local products have 5 11 higher classification accuracy in the middle inland areas while those trained by global products lead to 5 12 higher classification accuracy in the southwestern a and southeastern b parts of australia see red circles 3 1 3 cart compared to lr as for the lr fig 5 a d shows the comparison of classification accuracy difference between lr and cart one and five maximum splits one can see that the lr has advantages on classification accuracy for some pixels averagely improved 7 9 in terms of local and global lr rf has 6 improvement on average these pixels with classification accuracy improved cover around 33 35 areas of the australian continent rf only covers 10 16 for the uncertainty evaluation between the australian local and gldas global lr see fig 5e still local lr has higher classification accuracy in the middle inland areas while global lr has higher classification accuracy in the southwestern and southeastern parts of australia overall the classification accuracy rankings of the three methods local and global input training data are lr average 79 80 rf average 77 78 and cart on average 76 although the cart method presents a lower percentage the difference in average classification accuracy maximum 4 on a continent wide scale is not very obvious 3 2 ranking of the importance of threshold conditions as discussed in section 2 2 1 the cart method indicated that a single primary condition was sufficient to classify whether groundwater will be recharged or not in most parts of the australian continent except the southwestern and southeastern parts see red circles a and b in fig 3c or d thus for a single threshold condition it is important to identify the type of condition that mainly controls groundwater recharge in order to understand its recharge mechanism for the multiple threshold conditions in the southwestern and southeastern parts of australia the importance ranking will be presented in section 3 3 together with the illustration of threshold values since lr is unable to rank the condition s importance fig 6 presents the identified primary threshold conditions from cart and rf using inputs of local and global products note that cart at one maximum split can be regarded as the result of cart at five maximum splits after post pruning thus for identifying the primary threshold condition there is no difference between cart at one maximum split and five maximum splits as seen in fig 6 cart and rf have a similar spatial pattern of primary threshold conditions if they are derived from the same training data local or global see fig 6a c and b d respectively this confirms the reliability of cart for ranking the importance of threshold conditions specifically for the local product derived results fig 6a c rainfall 62 64 blue and soil moisture 24 26 black are the primary threshold conditions for the australian continent while for the global product derived results fig 6b d rainfall 69 71 blue runoff 14 16 white and evaporation 9 12 red are identified as the primary threshold conditions vegetation 1 2 green plays the role of the groundwater threshold condition only in a few pixels over southwestern and southeastern australia 3 3 the specific threshold values of each condition from cart 3 3 1 single threshold condition considering that cart is the only method that can provide the specific values of the threshold conditions fig 7 presents the values of each primary threshold condition derived from it as seen from fig 7 the monthly rainfall recharge groundwater threshold ranged from 10 to 150 mm fig 7a and b with the threshold in the northern parts of australia being above 70 mm while the threshold in the middle inland areas being below 50 mm for monthly evaporation in the northwestern parts of australia the global cart fig 7d shows some additional coverage in comparison to the local cart fig 7c with thresholds ranging from 10 to 50 mm the remaining parts have thresholds of generally above 40 mm in terms of soil moisture fig 7e and f cannot be compared due to the differences in the unit and spatial coverage between the local and global cart the spatial patterns and values of vegetation recharge threshold 0 15 0 30 evi are similar in fig 7g and h finally despite some differences in spatial coverage in the western parts of australia the runoff shown in fig 7i and j have similar ranges of threshold around 0 1 1 0 mm 3 3 2 multiple threshold conditions when groundwater is controlled by multiple threshold conditions a visual examination of the tree in a specific pixel is required to assess the structure of the tree and the specific values of each threshold condition for the cart fig 8 uses the local cart as an example and randomly selects one pixel a in the southwestern part of australia and one pixel b in the southeastern part of australia to show the thresholds of the multiple conditions as seen in fig 8a the structure of the tree shows that the recharge of groundwater in pixel a is determined by two threshold conditions rainfall and evaporation as the primary condition the threshold value of rainfall is 52 36 mm by only using this threshold the classification accuracy is about 76 results generated by one maximum split by adding evaporation as the second threshold i e 37 44 mm and 55 35 mm in fig 8a the classification accuracy improves to 89 results generated by five maximum splits rf also identifies rainfall and evaporation as the major threshold conditions for this pixel according to mda however such results are not stable since rf sometimes judges that evaporation is more important than rainfall and this is most likely due to the influence of random sampling or these two conditions have similar importance of being threshold conditions the pixel illustrated in the southeastern part of australia fig 8b is much more complex than the pixel in the southwestern part of australia which involves four threshold conditions evaporation rainfall runoff and soil moisture evaporation in this pixel is the primary threshold condition that determines whether groundwater recharges or not at this stage only using evaporation the classification accuracy is around 65 however if the complete tree that also includes the rainfall 31 65 mm and 83 65 mm runoff 3 57 mm and soil moisture 9 4 thresholds are used the classification accuracy improves to 83 for this pixel rf has the same ranking results as cart in terms of evaporation and rainfall for most of the tests according to mda however the ranking results of soil moisture and runoff are unstable this is also likely due to the influence of random sampling where such influence seems more obvious on those threshold conditions that are less important therefore non primary threshold conditions and their corresponding values may not be reliable 4 discussion 4 1 inferring groundwater recharge mechanism shallow aquifer through threshold conditions section 3 3 has shown the results of groundwater threshold conditions and their importance ranking mostly for primary threshold conditions by analysing this result and combining it with some simple hydrogeological knowledge as shown in fig 9 the groundwater recharge mechanism can be inferred fig 9 is a simple illustration of the land hydrological cycle one can see that rainfall as the major input of the land water cycle is very important to groundwater recharge some studies e g jones and banner 2003 directly define the groundwater recharge threshold as the amount of rainfall required to recharge an aquifer it can be said that without rainfall there is no groundwater recharge although moeck et al 2020 and barron et al 2012 indicate that most studies have not been able to confidently confirm that rainfall is the major determinant of groundwater recharge on a large scale due to the lack of data our results in figs 6 and 7 i e rainfall as the primary threshold condition covers 64 71 of the australian continent supports the validity of this idea when rainfall is identified as the primary threshold condition it could represent a direct recharge mechanism for the shallow aquifers within the pixel as well as an indication of variable rainfall or a clear seasonal pattern of rainfall the greater rainfall threshold may refer to a faster loss of groundwater due to evaporation or groundwater drainage and to a larger amplitude of seasonal groundwater variations the northern part of the australian continent is a good example that has a tropical climate clear seasonal rainfall during november april hu et al 2022b high evaporation and is almost fully covered by rainfall threshold conditions according to knapton et al 2019 the groundwater level in darwin capital city of northern territory changes rapidly during the recharge discharge period and the variation could be over 10 m for some boreholes according to moeck et al 2020 and fig 9 evaporation as the major output of the land water cycle is another threshold condition that significantly affects groundwater recharge globally however in the case of the australian continent see figs 6 and 7 only a few regions show that evaporation is the primary threshold condition in terms of groundwater recharge this is due to the fact that most parts of australia are very dry and with sparse vegetation cover so there is not much water for evaporation evaporation only occurs when rainfall arrives thus usually acts as the second threshold condition after rainfall as shown in fig 8a when evaporation is identified as the primary threshold condition it potentially infers a relatively constant monthly rainfall that generates a relatively constant groundwater input source and thus groundwater recharge depends largely on the variation of evaporation output according to johnson 1992 and hu et al 2022a the southeastern part of the australian continent indicated by both local and global results in fig 6c and d has uniform monthly rainfall the evaporation there is low during winter e g average below 30 mm in july and high in summer e g average of 90 100 mm in january see official statistics http www bom gov au jsp ncc climate averages evapotranspiration soil moisture and runoff are related conditions of rainfall thus they are usually discussed together alvarez garreton et al 2014 wasko and nathan 2019 from fig 9 one can see that rainfall needs to penetrate the soil and then can become groundwater thus soil moisture as the primary condition indicates the diffuse recharge and represents a threshold of hydraulic power zhang et al 1999 in other words the soil moisture must reach a certain capacity to allow the water in the soil to pass down and become groundwater this process relates to soil structure thickness and soil properties which are complex and hardly represented by a percentage or storage volume thus it is difficult to judge which is more representative in the local or global result since they are very different see fig 7e and f unlike soil moisture rainfall and evaporation runoff is usually less discussed in relation to groundwater because runoff is not obvious in some flat regions e g arid or semi arid areas while runoff in mountainous regions is complex chiew et al 2009 petheram et al 2012 silberstein et al 2012 when runoff is identified as the primary threshold condition it indicates that groundwater recharges when runoff appears and thus may refer to a focused recharge mechanism vegetation can have both positive and negative relationships with groundwater recharge on a global scale koirala et al 2017 this indicates that vegetation can help recharge groundwater on the one hand and prevent its recharge on the other hand the main role of vegetation in helping groundwater recharge is to retain surface water and soil water spreading branches and leaves can also reduce evaporation see fig 9 however the roots of vegetation need to absorb groundwater to grow or sustain life and as such to some extent they also consume groundwater in our case fig 7g and h both indicate that some southwestern kalgoorlie and southeastern mungo parts of the australian continent are covered by vegetation threshold condition all the classifications above the vegetation threshold are groundwater recharge this indicates that vegetation shows the function of helping groundwater recharge in these regions although the detailed mechanism is not clear we found that these two parts of regions both have many scattered lakes and are surrounded by massive vegetation this possibly indicates that vegetation is important in maintaining groundwater levels in wetlands for inference of multiple threshold conditions in southeastern and southwestern parts of the australian continent see e g a and b in fig 3d it requires the inspection of the tree due to the fact that each pixel has a different structure of the tree as shown in fig 8 here fig 8b is used as an example for inferring the groundwater recharge mechanism first evaporation and rainfall are the primary and the second threshold conditions because of the little seasonality of rainfall and strong seasonality of evaporation in southeastern australia see pixel location in fig 7b if the evaporation is high above 52 71 mm usually occurs in summer then the groundwater recharge depends on rainfall amount if the monthly rainfall is above 83 65 mm then groundwater will recharge vice versa under this scenario the groundwater recharge in this pixel only depends on the balance of rainfall and evaporation showing a direct recharge mechanism when the evaporation below 52 71 mm usually occurs in winter and rainfall below 31 65 mm are both low the groundwater recharge depends on the runoff flowing from other regions recharge when runoff above 3 57 mm when evaporation is low below 52 71 mm but there is some rainfall above 31 65 mm in this pixel the groundwater recharge depends on if soil moisture has enough hydrological power to penetrate the soil which associates with rainfall intensity and soil structure finally note that for the same machine learning classification using different data the results are still going to be different see e g figs 6 and 7 and as such the inference of groundwater recharge mechanism will be different the possible reason is likely to be the different ways of building models at this moment the reliability of results depends on the classification accuracy of models for example our results figs 3 5 show that the classifications using australian local products have better accuracy in the middle inland areas while global products have better accuracy in the southeastern and southwestern parts of the australian continent thus for the middle inland areas and the southeastern and southwestern parts of the australian continent we should use the models trained from australian local and gldas global products to infer groundwater recharge mechanisms respectively 4 2 strength limitations and future direction 4 2 1 strength this study offers a possible solution to quantify groundwater recharge threshold conditions at a large scale using machine learning classification to the best of the authors efforts no previous study has ever done this topic and our study is the first attempt by using and comparing three different machine learning classification methods cart as core rf and lr as supplements the results offer the specific threshold values for multiple conditions spatially with an average accuracy of 76 at least meanwhile the results also provide a ranking of importance for multiple threshold conditions so that the groundwater recharge mechanisms in different areas are able to be inferred more importantly in section 4 1 we show that the inferred groundwater recharge mechanism matches the physical reality to some extent this proves the potential of using machine learning techniques to interpret groundwater recharge mechanisms i e cheap fast and do not require geological investigation and isotopic knowledge compared to traditional physical measurement 4 2 2 limitations and future works this is the first attempt to quantify groundwater threshold conditions at a large scale using machine learning techniques although the possibility of using machine learning classification for such a task is well explored substantial work is required to address the current limitations presented in this manuscript first of all the reliability of the revealed groundwater recharge mechanism is the major concern since this study attempts to reproduce model simulated recharge rather than real recharge despite the fact that the revealed mechanism show some consistency with physical reality in section 4 1 the results still lack confidence due to the fact that most of the training data are simulated e g groundwater rather than real observation e g vegetation for example according to li et al 2019 and hu et al 2022b gldas da products for groundwater may not be reliable in central australia since it has not been validated there to address this issue as many real observational products from the field should be collected as possible however this is very difficult considering the expensive cost and time of building borehole networks on a large scale picking some regional areas that have sufficient data for validation could be a possible solution low prediction accuracy is another issue related to the reliability of the revealed mechanism as table 2 shown below this study explored three traditional machine learning methods i e cart rf and lr among them cart is the core classification method in this study since it is able to provide the specific values and the order of importance for threshold conditions which has good interpretability for recharge mechanisms most importantly it computes fast and can be further applied to a global scale study the problem with cart however is the lower classification accuracy compared to other advanced classification techniques although from the results of the australian continent the difference in average classification accuracy between cart rf and lr maximum 4 compared to lr table 2 is not obvious for some specific pixels the differences are over 10 20 see figs 4 and 5 and the using of the cart method will lead to unreliable mechanism interpretation thus the low prediction accuracy issue for the cart method needs to be solved one direction would be building some kind of new hybrid machine learning models e g wijaya and bisri 2016 presented an approach that uses lr to reduce the data noise and improves the classification accuracy of cart speaking to new machine learning models one can see that rf and lr have poor recharge mechanism interpretability see table 2 since they cannot provide the specific values and or the order of importance for threshold conditions this is commonly seen in other studies see e g tao et al 2022 that most machine learning methods only act as a prediction tool for groundwater level changes the interpretability is lost due to the fact that advanced machine learning training methods are not visible or too complex to understand e g neural networks and support vector machines yet such information from model interpretation is often the key to understanding groundwater mechanisms and developing policies therefore future studies about machine learning and groundwater should consider how to remain interpretability when designing new machine learning models 5 conclusion the task of large scale quantification of groundwater recharge threshold conditions is challenging due to the fact that groundwater recharge mechanisms are affected by multiple factors leading to high spatial heterogeneity traditional statistical methods can only focus on local to regional scales or are limited to a single factor such as rainfall because of insufficient power to handle big data and solve the issue of multiple factors this study thus employed machine learning techniques that have self learning capabilities to quantify groundwater recharge threshold conditions using the australian continent as an example specifically three traditional machine learning methods cart rf and lr are explored and compared the major results show that although the cart method has an average accuracy of 76 in classifying groundwater recharge discharge slightly lower than rf 77 78 and lr 79 80 it is the only method that ranks the importance of conditions and provides specific thresholds for each condition compared to the cart method rf and lr are more computationally expensive particularly rf is almost 10 11 times slower than cart and the overall classification accuracy is not significantly improved thus should be carefully used in studies at the global scale lr has a high overall prediction accuracy but its poor interpretability makes it only act as a prediction tool for groundwater recharge mechanism interpretation the cart indicates that a single primary condition is sufficient to classify groundwater recharge discharge and rainfall is the most common primary condition only the southeastern and southwestern parts of the australian continent are dominated by multiple threshold conditions the less more splits may indicate simpler more complex mechanisms in addition using different training data may generate different mechanism interpretations therefore the inferred mechanism particularly for those of pixels with low prediction accuracy should be treated cautiously since only limited data are tested in this study overall this is a successful attempt to use machine learning to quantify groundwater thresholds the results provide spatial maps of primary conditions that control groundwater recharge and their specific threshold values at a large scale which helps the global engineering community for purposes of building the plan that relates to groundwater use more importantly this study is novel since it first uses machine learning to analyse the groundwater recharge mechanism at a large scale although this attempt still lacks many considerations such as the proper selection of training data and lag issues it can serve as a guide for the future development of more rational and effective machine learning groundwater models declaration of competing interest

11695,the large scale quantification of groundwater recharge threshold conditions is a bottleneck in the field of research considering that groundwater recharge processes can be quite complex and affected by different factors in different regions traditional statistical approaches have either focused on local to regional scales or are limited to a single factor such as rainfall resulting in a lack of a comprehensive understanding of groundwater recharge mechanisms on large scales considering that finding a threshold to instantly determine whether the groundwater is in the state of recharge or discharge is a classification task involving multiple factors machine learning techniques with self learning capabilities efficient processing of big data and mining relationships between multiple factors is thus applied to this study in this study three traditional machine learning classification techniques are explored classification and regression tree cart random forest rf and logistical regression lr to quantify specific threshold values for each condition including rainfall evaporation soil moisture runoff and vegetation since they are more interpretable compared to advanced machine learning techniques such as neural networks using the australian continent as an example cart is the fastest method and provides an average classification accuracy 76 at almost the same levels compared to rf 77 78 and lr 79 80 meanwhile cart is the only method to rank the importance of conditions while providing a specific threshold for each condition when inferring the groundwater recharge mechanism through threshold conditions the cart method suggests that a primary the most important threshold condition is sufficient for most parts of the australian continent e g rainfall as the primary threshold condition in northern australia indicates a direct recharge mechanism only the coastal areas of southeastern and southwestern australia are dominated by multiple threshold conditions showing the complex groundwater recharge mechanism overall the significance of this work is to provide the spatial maps of threshold conditions that mainly control groundwater recharge and their specific threshold values which are crucial for managers to carry out a good plan over a large area more importantly this study demonstrates the potential of traditional machine learning methods to reveal groundwater recharge mechanisms which may help further refine the development of groundwater models in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords classification tree groundwater logistical regression random forest threshold data availability all data used in this study are free and available on the australia bureau of meteorology and the national aeronautics and space administration nasa earth data centre 1 introduction groundwater recharge is a complex hydrological process affected by many conditions such as rainfall evaporation soil vegetation topography geology fu et al 2019 moeck et al 2020 hu et al 2021 groundwater recharge threshold conditions defined as the necessary conditions required and the specific values that these conditions must reach to trigger the groundwater level rise baker et al 2020 moeck et al 2020 for example hu et al 2019 indicate that groundwater will not recharge in the coastal areas of perth australia unless rainfall exceeds 60 70 mm month normally april to september in this example rainfall of 60 70 mm month is considered as the groundwater recharge threshold condition and such information is important for predicting groundwater recharge timing needed for agricultural activity and adjusting an annual water allocation plan carroll et al 2019 previous studies have tried to quantify groundwater recharge threshold conditions using various methods such as isotope cave drip and borehole monitoring network jones and banner 2003 kotchoni et al 2019 baker et al 2020 however these methods are only suitable at local or regional scales usually coupled with geological investigations requiring specialised knowledge to place or operate equipment expensive and time consuming more importantly these methods have certain constraints when discussing groundwater recharge such as studying only rainfall threshold condition or discussing threshold conditions in terms of specific aquifers or climates this is possibly due to the complexity of handling multiple threshold conditions over a large area or at high spatial resolution for example each condition has a different weight of influence on groundwater recharge that varies spatially since the recharge mechanisms are different in various hydrogeological regions barron et al 2012 hu et al 2017 2021 motiee and mcbean 2017 large scale quantification of groundwater recharge threshold conditions is very difficult small 2005 tried to quantify the groundwater recharge threshold over the southwestern united states using precipitation and potential evapotranspiration however the conclusion reached was that using these two conditions was insufficient to predict groundwater recharge occurrence suggesting that other conditions have significant impacts on groundwater recharge which were not considered for example moeck et al 2020 indicate that except for climatic conditions e g rainfall and evaporation non climatic conditions such as vegetation and runoff also have obvious impacts on groundwater recharge over some regions around the world fu et al 2019 also make similar deductions based on a case study over the southeast corner of south australia however both studies do not provide the threshold values of each condition nor do they rank the importance of each condition to the best of the authors knowledge no study has ever provided information on groundwater recharge thresholds in terms of large areas e g basin to continental scales and multiple conditions yet such information is important for groundwater prediction understanding of recharge mechanisms and enabling managers to adjust water use plans for other applications besides for groundwater models that simulate the hydrological process such information can enhance the understanding of recharge processes thus improving model performance von freyberg et al 2015 from a statistical point of view quantifying groundwater recharge threshold conditions can be regarded as a classification task that requires the determination and quantification of the threshold conditions that instantly distinguish between net groundwater recharge class one level rises and discharge class two level drops machine learning classifications thus are likely to be the solution to this task since they normally do not require an understanding of the complex hydrological process of groundwater recharge yin et al 2021 also they can be applied on non parametric data distribution maxwell et al 2018 most importantly they are powerful enough to deal with large datasets and multi condition problems as considered in this study although we have not found any previous studies using machine learning classification techniques to quantify groundwater recharge threshold conditions machine learning techniques have already been employed in the groundwater research field for prediction purposes in recent years see e g tao et al 2022 martinsen et al 2022 also there have been many studies to identify threshold conditions in other fields see e g miao et al 2011 belgiu and drǎgut 2016 wu et al 2018 yang et al 2019 among many machine learning classification methods classification and regression tree cart breiman et al 1984 is probably the most suitable method for addressing this task since it is the only method that can directly quantify the specific threshold value for each condition the only concern is that the classification accuracy could be lower than for other more advanced machine learning classifications for example previous studies e g long et al 1993 ali et al 2012 deschamps et al 2012 belgiu and drǎgut 2016 showed that random forest rf breiman 2001 and logistical regression lr pregibon 1981 perform better than cart thus a comparison between cart and other machine learning classifications is necessary to confirm whether cart quantifies the groundwater recharge threshold conditions with satisfactory classification accuracy this study therefore tries to quantify large scale groundwater recharge threshold conditions through an exploration of the cart rf and lr methods as exemplified by the australian continent specifically i the classification accuracies and computation time of these three machine learning methods are compared ii the importance ranking of threshold conditions of these three methods are compared iii the specific threshold values monthly based of each condition from cart are presented spatially since it is the only method that provides threshold values iv the potential groundwater recharge mechanisms inferred by different threshold conditions are discussed and v the strength limitation and future direction of this study are discussed 2 method and material 2 1 data preparation since we are going to use machine learning techniques the training data that includes the condition variable and the response variable must be prepared for the training process 2 1 1 response variable in the training process the response variables which in our case are groundwater recharge class one and discharge class two are used to classify the condition variables here the global land data assimilation system gldas catchment land surface model clsm version 2 2 with data assimilated from the gravity recovery and climate experiment and follow on products grace grace fo hereafter referred to as gldas da is employed to offer groundwater storage estimates at a 0 25 0 25 spatial and daily temporal resolution li et al 2019 gldas da has been chosen here due to its high spatial resolution long temporal span data with global coverage and is freely available as for the quality of the data li et al 2019 evaluated the grace da using over 4000 in situ data around the world and obtained an average 4 3 cm groundwater variation root mean square errors and a correlation of 0 65 at regional scale note that the grace product is not used due to its coarse spatial resolution on the one hand and on the other hand gldas model is still required to derive groundwater storage changes from grace total water storage to prepare the monthly resolution datasets the monthly groundwater change is calculated using the groundwater storage estimates from gldas da for the last day of the current month minus the last day of the previous month when groundwater change is above below zero the groundwater for the current month is classified as recharge discharge 2 1 2 condition variable the condition variable is used to predict the response variable after training in our case we selected five condition variables rainfall evaporation runoff soil moisture and vegetation greenness since previous studies have reported these as the major threshold conditions that determine whether groundwater recharges see e g small 2005 diodato and ceccarelli 2006 fu et al 2019 moeck et al 2020 to evaluate the uncertainty of the machine learning classifications derived from different input training data the australian local products i e australian bureau of meteorology rainfall products and australian water resources assessment landscape awra l model version 6 frost et al 2018 frost and wright 2018 and the global products i e gldas noah land surface model version 2 1 rodell et al 2004 beaudoing et al 2020 are employed for the condition variables of rainfall evaporation soil moisture and runoff since it uses the same forcing input data as gldas da gldas da does not provide some of these parameters in daily format due to policy issues as for the vegetation greenness the enhanced vegetation index evi of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer mod13c2 didan 2015 products are used for the same month note that for groundwater and vegetation there are no australian local products and as such only two types of products are prepared for the condition variables of rainfall evaporation soil moisture and runoff also the common water balance equation rainfall minus evaporation is not used as a condition variable due to the fact that the output will lose the ability to distinguish which one is the primary condition finally table 1 summarises the products that offer data as condition variables and response variables to unify the spatial resolution among different datasets all data with 0 05 0 05 spatial resolution are resized into 0 25 0 25 before being used for the 2004 2019 period 2 2 machine learning classifications note all the classification methods in this study are done through matlab software for specific codes of each method we recommend referring to the following web pages https www mathworks com help stats choose a classifier html 2 2 1 classification and regression tree cart the classification and regression tree cart method proposed by breiman et al 1984 is a widely used decision tree see e g gray and fan 2008 zheng et al 2009 elliott and owens 2015 xu et al 2021 the core part of the cart method is to grow a binary decision tree by using recursive splitting rules see tree example in fig 1 for classification tree the rules normally used are entropy or gini s diversity index gdi both of them can get similar results however gdi is computationally faster than entropy thus is used in our study for gdi it measures the impurity of a node which is expressed as breiman et al 1984 1 g 1 i p i 2 where pi is the proportion of categories with the category i that reach the node since there are only two categories in the response variables in our case i e recharge p1 and discharge p2 gdi can be rewritten as 2 g 1 p 1 2 p 2 2 if a node has just one category e g all the response variables are marked as recharge perfectly being classified then g is equal to 0 otherwise g is positive therefore the rule of node division in cart is to choose the smallest g taking our case as an example suppose we are trying to quantify the rainfall threshold for groundwater recharge for a specific region and the total number of samples is d based on a test threshold value of rainfall such as m mm month all samples are divided into two parts da rainfall above m mm month and db rainfall below m mm month then the gdi of this m threshold g rainfall m for creating two nodes da and db can be calculated as 3 g r a i n f a l l m d a d g d a d b d g d b the calculation of equation 3 runs continuously for different test values of m until m covers all the range of rainfall values after that the m value corresponding to the minimum g is selected as the rainfall threshold for groundwater recharge after this process one node is split into two nodes correspondingly the training data is split into two parts by m i e above below m in terms of multi condition variables we simply line up all the samples of variables and loop the steps above each loop will quantify a threshold condition based on gdi and split a node into two the loop will continue until the impurity of the new node is 0 or it reaches the stopping criterion the decision tree is then complete normally if we do not set a stopping criterion the resulting tree could be very complicated and over fitting in other words its classification accuracy in the training data is very high but it is low in actual application thus post pruning is usually required after the tree is complete song and lu 2015 however post pruning needs to apply cross validation or similar approaches for all possible subtrees tree stops to grow at some nodes of the full tree tree grows without limitation and it takes significant time to compute given that our aim is to quantify the groundwater recharge threshold conditions at a large scale e g australia has around 11 000 pixels and each pixel needs to train a tree the pre pruning approach song and lu 2015 by setting global stopping criterion such as maximum split is more suitable for our study since it saves massive time in general the more the maximum split allowed the more accurate the decision tree but the greater the potential risk of over fitting in our case the maximum split number is set as the number of condition variables so that each variable has a chance to play a role in the groundwater recharge threshold condition at each split see a similar process in ghosh et al 2014 2 2 2 random forest rf random forest rf introduced by breiman 2001 is an ensemble classification method using the cart algorithm to grow many trees as shown in fig 2 every tree in the forest is grown independently by randomly selecting a subset of the training sample through replacement the so called bootstrap sampling or bagging belgiu and drǎgut 2016 specifically in the process of random sampling rf not only randomly selects the number of samples but also randomly selects condition variables for example some trees may be grown by using just rainfall and evaporation rather than all the condition variables this operation increases the randomness of the tree and prevents over fitting since the final classification results are generated by voting see fig 2 from every tree in the forest thus rf is said to have low variance robust model and better classification accuracy than cart see e g ali et al 2012 deschamps et al 2012 awange et al 2020 however compared to the cart method the random forest loses its interpretability and cannot provide the specific values of groundwater recharge threshold conditions maxwell et al 2018 for the rf training the number of trees to be generated is a parameter that needs to be pre set belgiu and drǎgut 2016 although some studies have reported that this parameter has no obvious influence on the classification results at least three trees are required for voting otherwise meaningless see e g du et al 2015 different number of trees will still be tested in our case besides the pre pruning process mentioned in section 2 2 1 is also necessary for rf to reduce the computation time belgiu and drǎgut 2016 since the rf will be compared to cart in this study the same maximum split as cart is applied to rf 2 2 3 logistical regression lr logistical regression lr is a widely used generalized linear regression model with features simple and fast especially for binary classification see e g dixon 2009 yang et al 2019 adiat et al 2020 in our case lr simply calculates the probability p from 0 to 1 of groundwater recharge through a sigmoid function of the linear combination of condition variables xn which is expressed as yang et al 2019 4 l n p 1 p a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a n x n where ai i 0 n are the regression coefficients corresponding to xi i 1 n the final classification results depend on p when p is above below 0 5 then groundwater is classified as recharge discharge thus similar to rf lr also cannot directly provide the specific values of groundwater recharge threshold conditions during the training process the ai i 0 n will be adjusted for numerous iterations until the classification accuracy stops improving or iteration times reaches the pre set limit for more details of the lr approach we refer the reader to awange et al 2020 pp 99 109 2 3 classification accuracy evaluation using k fold cross validation k fold cross validation fushiki 2009 rodriguez et al 2010 is commonly used for predictive models generated by machine learning in terms of accuracy evaluation the main theory of this method is to randomly divide all samples into k folds many previous studies used a default value of 10 folds mahmood and khan 2009 ramezan et al 2019 use the k 1 folds for training and leave one out of the fold for validation this process of training and validation gives a percentage of prediction error and is regarded as one iteration the process is repeated for k iterations and each iteration uses a different leaving one out of the fold for validation finally after k iterations the average prediction error of k times is the overall prediction error and the classification accuracy is equal to 1 minus the overall prediction error note that the traditional leave one out cross validation is not used in this study due to the fact that 1 leave one out only works better than k fold when the number of training data is small and in this study we have 192 training datasets for each pixel 2 leave one out is computationally expensive in this study it is almost 19 times slower than k fold and we have about 11 000 pixels to train 3 leave one out could have a high variance when a dataset is large which leads to unreliable estimates according to ron 1995 in addition this study only cares about the overall accuracy of machine learning models i e if groundwater recharge and discharge are all correctly classified thus other metrics such as precision recall and f score that specifically look at true positive or false negative are not considered 2 4 ranking of the importance of threshold conditions since groundwater recharge is determined by multiple conditions ranking the importance of each condition is important to improve the understanding of the groundwater recharge mechanism for the cart and rf methods the importance of threshold conditions is calculated using mean decrease in gini mdg and mean decrease in accuracy mda respectively see e g breiman 2001 belgiu and drǎgut 2016 the mdg ranks the importance of conditions by measuring how much gini s diversity index can be reduced by a condition generally speaking the further the condition is from the top of the tree fig 1 the lower the importance sandri and zuccolotto 2008 is the mda estimates the importance of conditions by measuring the influence of a condition on the classification accuracy i e the larger the influence the higher the importance as for lr it is a generalized linear regression model the importance of conditions cannot be determined directly since the regression coefficient and its corresponding p value only indicate the influence of each condition on the probability of groundwater recharge rather than the importance of being a threshold condition 2 5 uncertainty from input datasets machine learning techniques are pure statistical tools for data mining e g awange et al 2020 and thus the performance of output depends on the accuracy of the input training data yin et al 2021 in our case some condition variables such as rainfall can be represented by multiple products e g in situ based satellite based and re analysis therefore the uncertainty generated by different input training data for the cart rf and lr methods needs to be compared and discussed previous studies e g von freyberg et al 2015 also strongly recommends using at least two methods while applying different input data to show the uncertainty of the groundwater models 2 6 lag issue despite many previous studies such as yu and lin 2015 hu et al 2017 kotchoni et al 2019 have indicated that there are lags between rainfall and groundwater recharge this study however does not consider the lag issue due to the fact that the lag indicated by previous studies is associated with groundwater level changes which are real observations gldas da is mainly a simulation product based on water balance calculation see e g li et al 2019 theoretically it is unable to reflect the lag between rainfall and groundwater recharge in addition hu et al 2019 indicated that many previous studies take the statistical lags e g calculated using cross correlation between rainfall and groundwater variation as the real lags this is a misunderstanding since rainfall has to reach a certain threshold to recharge groundwater otherwise the rainfall may evaporate or be absorbed by vegetation before it becomes groundwater finally the real lag between rainfall and groundwater mainly depends on the depth of aquifers as well as the surface terrain and the geological structure of the subsurface which is very complex and beyond the scope of this study 2 7 computation time since our target is to quantify groundwater threshold conditions on a large scale the computation time of each machine learning classification would be one of concern in our case the cart rf and lr classification methods are all processed using matlab 2018b software on a pc whose settings are intel r core tm i7 9750h cpu 2 60ghz and 16gb ram note that the computation time can also vary greatly if other techniques such as cloud computing and parallel computing are applied the computation time shown in the results is only a reference for the efficiency of each machine learning classification method 3 results 3 1 classification accuracy 3 1 1 cart method for the cart method the maximum split of five is set as the stopping criterion during the training process as mentioned in section 2 2 1 however during the results inspection phase we found that many pixels only needed one maximum split to achieve almost the same high classification accuracy usually above 75 as the five maximum splits this potentially means that in most parts of the australian continent a single threshold condition is sufficient to classify whether groundwater will be recharged or not this observation might however be different for other areas around the world to confirm this conjecture fig 3 a and b shows the classification accuracy of cart using k fold cross validation k is set as a default value of 10 see details in mahmood and khan 2009 ramezan et al 2019 at the five maximum splits using inputs of australian local and gldas global products respectively while fig 3c and d presents the difference in the classification accuracy between five and one maximum split considering the influence of random sampling on the k fold cross validation a maximum 5 2 5 accuracy error is assumed to be allowed based on our test thus values below 5 are not shown in fig 3c and d from fig 3a and b one can see that the cart method using five maximum splits using local and global products achieve high classification accuracies above 80 in the northern southeastern and southwestern parts of australia the middle inland areas and southern parts of australia have relatively low classification accuracy around 60 compared to the one maximum split cart fig 3c and d five maximum splits cart have significant accuracy advantages of 5 15 in the southwestern a and southeastern b parts of australia for the rest of the areas the five maximum splits cart have no accuracy advantage and are even worse than the one maximum split cart over fitting this confirms our conjecture that a single primary threshold condition is sufficient to classify groundwater recharge discharge in most parts of the australian continent groundwater recharge determined by multi threshold conditions only exists in the southwestern a and southeastern b parts of australia to evaluate the uncertainty caused by the different inputs australian local and gldas global products fig 3e and f presents a comparison of the local and global cart at one and five maximum splits respectively generally the cart trained by australian local products bom and awra l has better classification accuracy 5 11 in the middle inland areas however in the southwestern a and southeastern c and d parts of australia the cart trained by global products gldas noah has better classification accuracy 5 18 3 1 2 cart compared to rf as mentioned in section 2 2 2 rf requires a pre set number of trees to be generated before training belgiu and drǎgut 2016 considering there are about 11 000 pixels over the entire australian continent to be processed by the rf method blindly increasing the number of trees to be generated in each pixel will lead to a drastic increase in computation time for example we tried to generate 50 trees in each pixel and it took about 10 hours to complete more importantly it was found that the classification accuracy of the rf method with 50 trees did not significantly improve in comparison to that of the cart method see table 1 in supplementary material this is consistent with previous studies e g du et al 2015 reported similar situation and concluded that the classification accuracy is not very sensitive to the number of tree to be generated in rf belgiu and drǎgut 2016 awange et al 2020 therefore we reduced the number of trees from 50 to 10 and computed the classification accuracy of 4 rf models about 2 hours each under different settings maximum split and input data the classification accuracy of the 4 rf models is subsequently compared to cart as shown in fig 4 a d from fig 4a d there are many scattered pixels showing that the classification accuracy of rf is improved 6 on average compared to cart however in these scattered pixels from rf the five maximum splits for example fig 4c and d only account for 10 and 16 of the areas of australia this confirms that the cart and rf methods have almost the same classification accuracy over most parts of the australian continent however when compared to the computation time of the cart method 10 minutes rf took hours to calculate the results depending on the number of trees generated e g for 10 trees rf required 2 hours computation time for the entire australian continent while for 50 trees it took approximately 10 hours for 500 trees commonly seen in previous studies belgiu and drǎgut 2016 rf needs more than 100 hours to train if no other acceleration technique such parallel computing is invoiced to examine the uncertainty of rf caused by different maximum splits and the inputs between australian local and gldas global products fig 4e h compare the local and global rf at one and five maximum splits respectively one can see that the uncertainty results are similar to cart see fig 3c f for example rf with five maximum splits has obvious advantages in terms of classification accuracy 5 14 in the southwestern a and southeastern b parts of australia see red circles furthermore rf trained by local products have 5 11 higher classification accuracy in the middle inland areas while those trained by global products lead to 5 12 higher classification accuracy in the southwestern a and southeastern b parts of australia see red circles 3 1 3 cart compared to lr as for the lr fig 5 a d shows the comparison of classification accuracy difference between lr and cart one and five maximum splits one can see that the lr has advantages on classification accuracy for some pixels averagely improved 7 9 in terms of local and global lr rf has 6 improvement on average these pixels with classification accuracy improved cover around 33 35 areas of the australian continent rf only covers 10 16 for the uncertainty evaluation between the australian local and gldas global lr see fig 5e still local lr has higher classification accuracy in the middle inland areas while global lr has higher classification accuracy in the southwestern and southeastern parts of australia overall the classification accuracy rankings of the three methods local and global input training data are lr average 79 80 rf average 77 78 and cart on average 76 although the cart method presents a lower percentage the difference in average classification accuracy maximum 4 on a continent wide scale is not very obvious 3 2 ranking of the importance of threshold conditions as discussed in section 2 2 1 the cart method indicated that a single primary condition was sufficient to classify whether groundwater will be recharged or not in most parts of the australian continent except the southwestern and southeastern parts see red circles a and b in fig 3c or d thus for a single threshold condition it is important to identify the type of condition that mainly controls groundwater recharge in order to understand its recharge mechanism for the multiple threshold conditions in the southwestern and southeastern parts of australia the importance ranking will be presented in section 3 3 together with the illustration of threshold values since lr is unable to rank the condition s importance fig 6 presents the identified primary threshold conditions from cart and rf using inputs of local and global products note that cart at one maximum split can be regarded as the result of cart at five maximum splits after post pruning thus for identifying the primary threshold condition there is no difference between cart at one maximum split and five maximum splits as seen in fig 6 cart and rf have a similar spatial pattern of primary threshold conditions if they are derived from the same training data local or global see fig 6a c and b d respectively this confirms the reliability of cart for ranking the importance of threshold conditions specifically for the local product derived results fig 6a c rainfall 62 64 blue and soil moisture 24 26 black are the primary threshold conditions for the australian continent while for the global product derived results fig 6b d rainfall 69 71 blue runoff 14 16 white and evaporation 9 12 red are identified as the primary threshold conditions vegetation 1 2 green plays the role of the groundwater threshold condition only in a few pixels over southwestern and southeastern australia 3 3 the specific threshold values of each condition from cart 3 3 1 single threshold condition considering that cart is the only method that can provide the specific values of the threshold conditions fig 7 presents the values of each primary threshold condition derived from it as seen from fig 7 the monthly rainfall recharge groundwater threshold ranged from 10 to 150 mm fig 7a and b with the threshold in the northern parts of australia being above 70 mm while the threshold in the middle inland areas being below 50 mm for monthly evaporation in the northwestern parts of australia the global cart fig 7d shows some additional coverage in comparison to the local cart fig 7c with thresholds ranging from 10 to 50 mm the remaining parts have thresholds of generally above 40 mm in terms of soil moisture fig 7e and f cannot be compared due to the differences in the unit and spatial coverage between the local and global cart the spatial patterns and values of vegetation recharge threshold 0 15 0 30 evi are similar in fig 7g and h finally despite some differences in spatial coverage in the western parts of australia the runoff shown in fig 7i and j have similar ranges of threshold around 0 1 1 0 mm 3 3 2 multiple threshold conditions when groundwater is controlled by multiple threshold conditions a visual examination of the tree in a specific pixel is required to assess the structure of the tree and the specific values of each threshold condition for the cart fig 8 uses the local cart as an example and randomly selects one pixel a in the southwestern part of australia and one pixel b in the southeastern part of australia to show the thresholds of the multiple conditions as seen in fig 8a the structure of the tree shows that the recharge of groundwater in pixel a is determined by two threshold conditions rainfall and evaporation as the primary condition the threshold value of rainfall is 52 36 mm by only using this threshold the classification accuracy is about 76 results generated by one maximum split by adding evaporation as the second threshold i e 37 44 mm and 55 35 mm in fig 8a the classification accuracy improves to 89 results generated by five maximum splits rf also identifies rainfall and evaporation as the major threshold conditions for this pixel according to mda however such results are not stable since rf sometimes judges that evaporation is more important than rainfall and this is most likely due to the influence of random sampling or these two conditions have similar importance of being threshold conditions the pixel illustrated in the southeastern part of australia fig 8b is much more complex than the pixel in the southwestern part of australia which involves four threshold conditions evaporation rainfall runoff and soil moisture evaporation in this pixel is the primary threshold condition that determines whether groundwater recharges or not at this stage only using evaporation the classification accuracy is around 65 however if the complete tree that also includes the rainfall 31 65 mm and 83 65 mm runoff 3 57 mm and soil moisture 9 4 thresholds are used the classification accuracy improves to 83 for this pixel rf has the same ranking results as cart in terms of evaporation and rainfall for most of the tests according to mda however the ranking results of soil moisture and runoff are unstable this is also likely due to the influence of random sampling where such influence seems more obvious on those threshold conditions that are less important therefore non primary threshold conditions and their corresponding values may not be reliable 4 discussion 4 1 inferring groundwater recharge mechanism shallow aquifer through threshold conditions section 3 3 has shown the results of groundwater threshold conditions and their importance ranking mostly for primary threshold conditions by analysing this result and combining it with some simple hydrogeological knowledge as shown in fig 9 the groundwater recharge mechanism can be inferred fig 9 is a simple illustration of the land hydrological cycle one can see that rainfall as the major input of the land water cycle is very important to groundwater recharge some studies e g jones and banner 2003 directly define the groundwater recharge threshold as the amount of rainfall required to recharge an aquifer it can be said that without rainfall there is no groundwater recharge although moeck et al 2020 and barron et al 2012 indicate that most studies have not been able to confidently confirm that rainfall is the major determinant of groundwater recharge on a large scale due to the lack of data our results in figs 6 and 7 i e rainfall as the primary threshold condition covers 64 71 of the australian continent supports the validity of this idea when rainfall is identified as the primary threshold condition it could represent a direct recharge mechanism for the shallow aquifers within the pixel as well as an indication of variable rainfall or a clear seasonal pattern of rainfall the greater rainfall threshold may refer to a faster loss of groundwater due to evaporation or groundwater drainage and to a larger amplitude of seasonal groundwater variations the northern part of the australian continent is a good example that has a tropical climate clear seasonal rainfall during november april hu et al 2022b high evaporation and is almost fully covered by rainfall threshold conditions according to knapton et al 2019 the groundwater level in darwin capital city of northern territory changes rapidly during the recharge discharge period and the variation could be over 10 m for some boreholes according to moeck et al 2020 and fig 9 evaporation as the major output of the land water cycle is another threshold condition that significantly affects groundwater recharge globally however in the case of the australian continent see figs 6 and 7 only a few regions show that evaporation is the primary threshold condition in terms of groundwater recharge this is due to the fact that most parts of australia are very dry and with sparse vegetation cover so there is not much water for evaporation evaporation only occurs when rainfall arrives thus usually acts as the second threshold condition after rainfall as shown in fig 8a when evaporation is identified as the primary threshold condition it potentially infers a relatively constant monthly rainfall that generates a relatively constant groundwater input source and thus groundwater recharge depends largely on the variation of evaporation output according to johnson 1992 and hu et al 2022a the southeastern part of the australian continent indicated by both local and global results in fig 6c and d has uniform monthly rainfall the evaporation there is low during winter e g average below 30 mm in july and high in summer e g average of 90 100 mm in january see official statistics http www bom gov au jsp ncc climate averages evapotranspiration soil moisture and runoff are related conditions of rainfall thus they are usually discussed together alvarez garreton et al 2014 wasko and nathan 2019 from fig 9 one can see that rainfall needs to penetrate the soil and then can become groundwater thus soil moisture as the primary condition indicates the diffuse recharge and represents a threshold of hydraulic power zhang et al 1999 in other words the soil moisture must reach a certain capacity to allow the water in the soil to pass down and become groundwater this process relates to soil structure thickness and soil properties which are complex and hardly represented by a percentage or storage volume thus it is difficult to judge which is more representative in the local or global result since they are very different see fig 7e and f unlike soil moisture rainfall and evaporation runoff is usually less discussed in relation to groundwater because runoff is not obvious in some flat regions e g arid or semi arid areas while runoff in mountainous regions is complex chiew et al 2009 petheram et al 2012 silberstein et al 2012 when runoff is identified as the primary threshold condition it indicates that groundwater recharges when runoff appears and thus may refer to a focused recharge mechanism vegetation can have both positive and negative relationships with groundwater recharge on a global scale koirala et al 2017 this indicates that vegetation can help recharge groundwater on the one hand and prevent its recharge on the other hand the main role of vegetation in helping groundwater recharge is to retain surface water and soil water spreading branches and leaves can also reduce evaporation see fig 9 however the roots of vegetation need to absorb groundwater to grow or sustain life and as such to some extent they also consume groundwater in our case fig 7g and h both indicate that some southwestern kalgoorlie and southeastern mungo parts of the australian continent are covered by vegetation threshold condition all the classifications above the vegetation threshold are groundwater recharge this indicates that vegetation shows the function of helping groundwater recharge in these regions although the detailed mechanism is not clear we found that these two parts of regions both have many scattered lakes and are surrounded by massive vegetation this possibly indicates that vegetation is important in maintaining groundwater levels in wetlands for inference of multiple threshold conditions in southeastern and southwestern parts of the australian continent see e g a and b in fig 3d it requires the inspection of the tree due to the fact that each pixel has a different structure of the tree as shown in fig 8 here fig 8b is used as an example for inferring the groundwater recharge mechanism first evaporation and rainfall are the primary and the second threshold conditions because of the little seasonality of rainfall and strong seasonality of evaporation in southeastern australia see pixel location in fig 7b if the evaporation is high above 52 71 mm usually occurs in summer then the groundwater recharge depends on rainfall amount if the monthly rainfall is above 83 65 mm then groundwater will recharge vice versa under this scenario the groundwater recharge in this pixel only depends on the balance of rainfall and evaporation showing a direct recharge mechanism when the evaporation below 52 71 mm usually occurs in winter and rainfall below 31 65 mm are both low the groundwater recharge depends on the runoff flowing from other regions recharge when runoff above 3 57 mm when evaporation is low below 52 71 mm but there is some rainfall above 31 65 mm in this pixel the groundwater recharge depends on if soil moisture has enough hydrological power to penetrate the soil which associates with rainfall intensity and soil structure finally note that for the same machine learning classification using different data the results are still going to be different see e g figs 6 and 7 and as such the inference of groundwater recharge mechanism will be different the possible reason is likely to be the different ways of building models at this moment the reliability of results depends on the classification accuracy of models for example our results figs 3 5 show that the classifications using australian local products have better accuracy in the middle inland areas while global products have better accuracy in the southeastern and southwestern parts of the australian continent thus for the middle inland areas and the southeastern and southwestern parts of the australian continent we should use the models trained from australian local and gldas global products to infer groundwater recharge mechanisms respectively 4 2 strength limitations and future direction 4 2 1 strength this study offers a possible solution to quantify groundwater recharge threshold conditions at a large scale using machine learning classification to the best of the authors efforts no previous study has ever done this topic and our study is the first attempt by using and comparing three different machine learning classification methods cart as core rf and lr as supplements the results offer the specific threshold values for multiple conditions spatially with an average accuracy of 76 at least meanwhile the results also provide a ranking of importance for multiple threshold conditions so that the groundwater recharge mechanisms in different areas are able to be inferred more importantly in section 4 1 we show that the inferred groundwater recharge mechanism matches the physical reality to some extent this proves the potential of using machine learning techniques to interpret groundwater recharge mechanisms i e cheap fast and do not require geological investigation and isotopic knowledge compared to traditional physical measurement 4 2 2 limitations and future works this is the first attempt to quantify groundwater threshold conditions at a large scale using machine learning techniques although the possibility of using machine learning classification for such a task is well explored substantial work is required to address the current limitations presented in this manuscript first of all the reliability of the revealed groundwater recharge mechanism is the major concern since this study attempts to reproduce model simulated recharge rather than real recharge despite the fact that the revealed mechanism show some consistency with physical reality in section 4 1 the results still lack confidence due to the fact that most of the training data are simulated e g groundwater rather than real observation e g vegetation for example according to li et al 2019 and hu et al 2022b gldas da products for groundwater may not be reliable in central australia since it has not been validated there to address this issue as many real observational products from the field should be collected as possible however this is very difficult considering the expensive cost and time of building borehole networks on a large scale picking some regional areas that have sufficient data for validation could be a possible solution low prediction accuracy is another issue related to the reliability of the revealed mechanism as table 2 shown below this study explored three traditional machine learning methods i e cart rf and lr among them cart is the core classification method in this study since it is able to provide the specific values and the order of importance for threshold conditions which has good interpretability for recharge mechanisms most importantly it computes fast and can be further applied to a global scale study the problem with cart however is the lower classification accuracy compared to other advanced classification techniques although from the results of the australian continent the difference in average classification accuracy between cart rf and lr maximum 4 compared to lr table 2 is not obvious for some specific pixels the differences are over 10 20 see figs 4 and 5 and the using of the cart method will lead to unreliable mechanism interpretation thus the low prediction accuracy issue for the cart method needs to be solved one direction would be building some kind of new hybrid machine learning models e g wijaya and bisri 2016 presented an approach that uses lr to reduce the data noise and improves the classification accuracy of cart speaking to new machine learning models one can see that rf and lr have poor recharge mechanism interpretability see table 2 since they cannot provide the specific values and or the order of importance for threshold conditions this is commonly seen in other studies see e g tao et al 2022 that most machine learning methods only act as a prediction tool for groundwater level changes the interpretability is lost due to the fact that advanced machine learning training methods are not visible or too complex to understand e g neural networks and support vector machines yet such information from model interpretation is often the key to understanding groundwater mechanisms and developing policies therefore future studies about machine learning and groundwater should consider how to remain interpretability when designing new machine learning models 5 conclusion the task of large scale quantification of groundwater recharge threshold conditions is challenging due to the fact that groundwater recharge mechanisms are affected by multiple factors leading to high spatial heterogeneity traditional statistical methods can only focus on local to regional scales or are limited to a single factor such as rainfall because of insufficient power to handle big data and solve the issue of multiple factors this study thus employed machine learning techniques that have self learning capabilities to quantify groundwater recharge threshold conditions using the australian continent as an example specifically three traditional machine learning methods cart rf and lr are explored and compared the major results show that although the cart method has an average accuracy of 76 in classifying groundwater recharge discharge slightly lower than rf 77 78 and lr 79 80 it is the only method that ranks the importance of conditions and provides specific thresholds for each condition compared to the cart method rf and lr are more computationally expensive particularly rf is almost 10 11 times slower than cart and the overall classification accuracy is not significantly improved thus should be carefully used in studies at the global scale lr has a high overall prediction accuracy but its poor interpretability makes it only act as a prediction tool for groundwater recharge mechanism interpretation the cart indicates that a single primary condition is sufficient to classify groundwater recharge discharge and rainfall is the most common primary condition only the southeastern and southwestern parts of the australian continent are dominated by multiple threshold conditions the less more splits may indicate simpler more complex mechanisms in addition using different training data may generate different mechanism interpretations therefore the inferred mechanism particularly for those of pixels with low prediction accuracy should be treated cautiously since only limited data are tested in this study overall this is a successful attempt to use machine learning to quantify groundwater thresholds the results provide spatial maps of primary conditions that control groundwater recharge and their specific threshold values at a large scale which helps the global engineering community for purposes of building the plan that relates to groundwater use more importantly this study is novel since it first uses machine learning to analyse the groundwater recharge mechanism at a large scale although this attempt still lacks many considerations such as the proper selection of training data and lag issues it can serve as a guide for the future development of more rational and effective machine learning groundwater models declaration of competing interest

of bangladesh is situated within 23 09 15 n to 23 10 10 n latitude and 89 44 38 e to 89 46 46 e longitude fig 1 with an area of 27 km2 the annual maximum and minimum temperatures are 35 1 c and 12 1 c respectively whereas the annual rainfall of 1955 mm the soil of this union is soft to medium stiff due to the alluvial deposits of various rivers having low organic content and medium bearing capacity the study area is just located on the river bank of the madhumati river which is an important distributary of the padma river which falls under the ganga brahmaputra meghna gbm floodplain which is the primary reason for arsenic enrichment all over the country and believed to be the controller of the hydrogeochemistry of the study area huq et al 2020 the hydrology of the study area is crucially governed by storm surges and tropical cyclones with usual seasonal rainfall rahman et al 2018b most people in the area are dependent on tubewell extracted groundwater for their domestic activities and agricultural purposes another source of water is harvested rainwater a monitoring survey in 2004 reported that 905 tubewells out of 1930 tubewells in the union were as contaminated and they were marked with red other 1025 tubewells were considered to be safe and marked with green fig 1sa b bamwsp 2004 the water of the red marked tubewells is supposed to be used for non drinking purposes the tubewells installed after the survey bear no marks and their water quality has not been monitored arsenic has contaminated the groundwater of 47 of the study area and more than 35 thousand people are at high risk of arsenic hazards shaibur 2019 some alternative water sources rainwater harvesting system and homemade arsenic filters were also noticed but they are very limited and have low arsenic

each of the anticipated 12 parameters was given a unit weight w i value between 1 and 5 based on their importance in groundwater used for drinking 5 being the most important table 1 in the first stage eq 1 was used to compute the relative weight w i 1 w i w i i 0 n w i where w i stands for the relative weight of a parameter w i denotes the weight that has been allocated to an individual parameter and n means the number of used parameters the next step was to divide each parameter s concentration by the corresponding standard guideline for every water sample eq 2 in order to generate the quality rating scale q i 2 q i c i s i 100 where si represents the bangladesh standard water quality recommendations established by the department of public health engineering dphe table 1 and ci stands for the observed concentration of a specific parameter in a sample in mg l then using the equation below eq 3 a sub index si i was determined for each parameter 3 s i i w i q i finally wqi was formulated by aggregating all the sub indices eq 4 4 w q i i 0 n s i i the following classifications were used to categorize wqi s output wqi 50 means excellent category good when wpi ranges from 50 to 75 wpi in the range of 75 100 exemplifies a poor quality and wpi 100 indicates a very poor water quality horton 1965 hossain and patra 2020a 2 5 2 water pollution index wpi the extent of groundwater contamination was assessed through the wpi using a total of 14 water quality parameters including fe as ph tds ec f cl no3 hco3 so4 2 na mg2 k and ca2 based on their recommended guideline value of bangladesh standards and who table 1 the key difference between newly formulated wpi and other indices such as wqi is that wpi is not bound to a specific type of water parameter and theoretical ideal value or dissimilar weights hossain and patra 2020b first the following equation eq 5 was used to determine the pollutant load pl i of a single parameter 5 p l i 1 c i s i s i the ith parameter s measured concentration is indicated by the symbol ci while its maximum or standard permitted value is indicated by the symbol si for ph a value of both 7 or 7 is detrimental to human health though 7 is considered neutral in the case of ph 7 equation 5 1 and ph 7 equation 5 2 was suggested 5 1 p l i c i 7 s i a 7 5 2 p l i c i 7 s i b 7 here si a indicates the minimum acceptable value of ph i e 6 5 and si b designates the maximum acceptable value of ph i e 8 5 ultimately the total degree of pollution of a sample was assessed by the water pollution index wpi by aggregating all pollution load divided by n number of used variables parameters eq 6 6 w p i 1 n i 1 n p l i the wpi values categorized the water quality into four groups such as excellent when wpi 0 5 0 5 wpi 0 75 indicates good water quality 0 75 wpi 1 means moderately polluted water and the water is highly polluted when wpi 1 2 6 health risk assessment hra to determine exposure risk to harmful components fe and as in this study in groundwater hazard index hi cumulatively functions with reference to the human body was performed adimalla and qiana 2019 to quantify the hi in the first step of chronic daily intake cdi a factor for frequency magnitude exposure duration and concentration level of potentially toxic metal was estimated there are two major ways of exposure pathways to estimate the health risks for the human body such as direct or oral ingestion eq 7 and through the skin eq 8 usepa 1989 7 c d i i n g e s t i o n c i i r e f e d b w a t 8 c d i d e r m a l c i s a k p e t e f e d c f b w a t where ci indicates the concentration of a toxic element mg l ir means ingestion rate ed denotes the exposure duration ef is the symbol for exposure frequency bw signifies the average body weight sa designates the skin area at describes the average time the skin permeability coefficient is k p cm h the exposure time is et and a unit concentration factor for hazardous elements in water is denoted by cf the value of these factors was gathered from recent publications and is provided in table 2 hossain and patra 2020c the hazard quotient hq is a method for determining the potential health risks caused by a single toxic element through a particular exposure route generally hq is the ratio between cdi for a specific exposure route and its respective reference dose rfd the formulation of hq is as follows eq 9 9 h q i i n g e s t i o n d e r m a l c d i i n g e s t i o n d e r r m a l r f d i n g e s t i o n d e r m a l where hqi represents the hazard produced by the ith element for a certain exposure path the term reference dose rfd is the verge limit for a toxic substance above which adverse health consequences will start to occur in this study two potential toxic elements fe and as were considered for the estimation of probable health risks to human health the rfd values of fe for ingestion and dermal exposures are 0 7 and 0 045 mg kg day hossain and patra 2020c and for as it is 0 0003 and 0 00012 mg kg day shil and singh 2019 respectively in the next step the hazard index hi was calculated eq 10 which is the sum of all the hqi for individual toxic elements for a particular pathway mentioned previously for two population groups viz children and adults separately 10 h i i n g e s t i o n d e r m a l h q i i m g e s t i o n d e r m a l in the end thi or the total hazard index was calculated by adding together all the risks brought on by different exposure pathways eq 11 11 t h i h i i n g e s t i o n h i d e r m a l a value of thi less than one 1 is considered an acceptable level of risk whereas thi values greater than one 1 are considered a probable risk of potentially unacceptable health hazards hossain and patra 2020c 3 results and discussion 3 1 basic groundwater chemistry physico chemical factors indicate the nature character and quality of groundwater according to the ionic balance test table 1s in the supplemental materials 95 of prm and 94 of pom samples had an ion balance ib within 5 as per the apha 2012 recommendation ionic error balances were often found negative suggesting that anions are generally more common than cations nag and das 2014 the statistical summary of the groundwater quality parameters is represented in table 3 ph is a major influential parameter that governs the acidity alkalinity and chemical speciation of elements in groundwater ph values ranged from 6 4 to 7 1 and 7 1 to 7 7 in prm and pom respectively indicating that the groundwater is generally neutral ec is the indication of all charges and dissolved particles present in water 36 of the sample had greater ec than the who limit 750 μs cm ranging from 316 to 1060 μs cm with an average value of 721 3 μs cm and 529 57 μs cm in prm and pom respectively the mean tds values 461 63 mg l in prm and 338 92 mg l in pom were found to be lower than the bangladesh standard 1000 mg l according to table 3 the primary cation sequence is ca2 na mg2 k showing calcium and sodium to be the predominant ones all the cations were observed below their specified bangladesh and who permissible limit table 1 except ca2 which ranged from 47 42 to 144 9 mg l major anions were in the descending order of h c o 3 cl s o 4 2 n o 3 f table 3 all the anions were noticed within their permissible limit except the bicarbonate which showed a mean sd value of 498 77 75 8 and 340 53 41 31 mg l in prm and pom respectively the results summary indicates that the groundwater of the study area is influenced by carbonate minerals with moderate dissolution total fe varied between 0 01 and 0 85 with a mean value of 0 24 and 0 04 in prm and pom respectively signifying both the mean values are lower than who and bangladesh standards with a few higher values in some locations arsenic the most toxic element ranged from 0 03 to 0 18 mg l and bdl to 0 07 mg l with a mean value of 0 06 and 0 03 mg l in prm and pom respectively fig 2a and b indicating much higher values than the who and bangladesh permissible limit arsenic was found to show a negative correlation to ph and temperature and positively correlated with all other parameters it was previously estimated that when people consume arsenic levels 0 05 mg l in groundwater they are more suspected to experience dermatological manifestations and as skin lesions samal et al 2013b and thus residents of the study area are at a high risk of arsenic induced health hazards the study area is just located on the bank of the madhumati river which is a distributary of the padma river and a part of the gbm ganga brahmaputra meghna floodplain the sediments of the gbm flood plain are primarily basic and metallic and are a potential source of as huq et al 2020 oxidation of arsenopyrite causing arsenic enrichment is likely to be due to large scale groundwater extraction from shallow aquifer systems lowers et al 2007 3 2 source interpretation of water quality parameters a popular multivariate statistical method in hydrogeochemical research is principal component analysis pca here varimax rotation through the dimension reduction process was used to carry out pca the first four principal components d1 d2 d3 d4 explained a total of 78 76 variances in the data set the degree of factor loading with the cumulative variance of principal components eigenvalues 1 is summarized in table 2s fig 3 presents the biplots of the major components the first factor d1 contributed a maximum of 31 0 of the total variance having strong loading in ec tds ca2 mg2 k and h c o 3 the grouping of ca2 and mg2 with h c o 3 indicates their source to be carbonate minerals such as aragonite calcite and dolomite geochemical processes like ion exchange and weathering of silicate minerals have an impact on the remaining variables d2 accounted for 20 62 of the variance owing to the significant loading of ph na cl and f which are strongly associated with local geological settings such as halite and fluorite dissolution and interaction of sodium and fluoride bearing minerals with the groundwater d3 shared 15 37 indicating the strong loading of iron and arsenic which originated from iron bearing minerals such as arsenopyrite the fourth factor d4 contributed 11 76 of the total variance and includes so4 2 no3 directing their input from anthropogenic activities such as chemical fertilizer from the agricultural fields 3 3 hydrochemical characterization understanding hydrochemical principles help in clarifying the dynamics of groundwater systems and opens up clues to the ancient environments pierre et al 2005 hossain et al 2020 piper trilinear diagram was used for plotting the analytical values of principal cations and anions piper 1944 to understand the hydrochemical properties of the research area s groundwater in essence it shows whether the water is distinct or a mixture of different types in terms of chemical properties it also provides a clue to the possible origin of groundwater samples the diamond shaped area of the piper diagram is divided into four major categories such as ca so4 ca hco3 na cl and na hco3 each part represents a particular type of variation in water chemistry all the samples of this study of both prm and pom seasons have displayed a characteristic of ca hco3 type water with dominancy of calcium magnesium and carbonate ions fig 4 a and b indicating the presence of carbonate minerals with their probable origin from the sallow freshwater zone which is another reason for arsenic enrichment influential environmental mechanisms for above groundwater chemistry were identified through gibbs diagrams gibbs 1970 which investigate certain mechanisms like precipitation rock weathering and evaporation that regulate the chemistry of groundwater luo et al 2017 hossain and patra 2021 the scatter diagrams were plotted by applying the log scale values of tds concentrations vs na na ca2 fig 5 a and cl cl hco3 fig 5b the graphical interpretation clearly illustrated that the area s groundwater chemistry is profoundly impacted by the native geological foundation weathering of rock minerals ion exchange and water rock interaction since the rock dominant sector encompassed all of the groundwater samples 3 4 assessment of drinking water quality the water quality index wqi is a common and effective method for determining groundwater quality and suitability for drinking purposes fourteen water quality parameters such as tds ec ph h c o 3 cl f s o 4 2 n o 3 ca2 mg2 na k total fe and as were undertaken to determine the overall groundwater quality through wqi the values of wqi ranged from 54 91 to 214 02 and 17 93 to 95 88 in prm and pom seasons respectively the spatial variation map of wqi through idw interpolated gis technique indicated that during prm no sample was found in the excellent category 63 of samples showed good water class 33 of the sample were observed in poor category and 6 of the sample were categorized as very poor water fig 6 a contrastingly in pom 30 70 of samples were classified in the excellent and good category respectively fig 6b the water pollution index wpi proposed by hossain and patra 2020b was employed to assess the level of contamination for drinking purposes using 14 variables n 14 of water quality wpi values varied from 0 72 to 1 76 in prm with a mean value of 1 0 while in pom it was found in the range of 0 31 0 89 having an average of 0 62 among the 30 collected groundwater samples in premonsoon no sample was observed in the excellent category 7 of samples were found to be of good quality 60 were categorized as moderately polluted and 33 of the sample were found to be highly polluted or unfit for human consumption fig 6c in pom 26 of the sample were excellent 47 were good 27 were moderate and none was found in highly polluted category for drinking purposes fig 6d the results revealed that for drinking purpose the groundwater quality in the region is moderate to highly polluted in prm and good to moderately polluted in pom comparatively wpi presented a better report of water quality since it is an integrated approach that produces a single value index by converting n number of input parameters to classify the water quality some hydrochemical studies on groundwater of the region have been carried out for arsenic quantification and its relation with other water parameters and the health risks has been discussed based on arsenic quantification only rahman et al 2018a shaibur 2019 shaibur and howlader 2020 this study characterizes the water quality based on a new index system wpi wqi and application of gis for water quality as well as health hazards modelling using total hazard index thi the geospatial distribution map of wqi and wpi and thi with idw interpolation technique through the gis platform envisaged the seasonal as well as spatial variation in water quality of the entire study area this type of map is very useful for better groundwater management since it can easily delineate the water quality classes such as excellent good moderate and highly polluted in a broad region 3 5 heath risk assessment sequential computation of the chronic daily intake cdi hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi for ingestion and dermal exposures for the two potential toxic elements total fe and total as was obtained to estimate the total hazard index thi for adult and children age group in prm thi values for adults thia had a mean value of 11 60 with a range of 4 96 32 21 fig 7 a and for the child thic it ranged from 4 73 to 30 71 with a mean of 11 05 fig 7b in pom thi values for adults and children varied from 0 002 to 12 2 figs 7c and 0 002 to 11 63 fig 7d indicating lower health risk as compared to prm season in both seasons for both age groups 99 of health hazards were attributed to the ingestion route of exposure in all thi cases hq values of arsenic were found to be more dominant than iron indicating as is the most influential toxic element in total hazard prediction predicted risk values indicate that the residents of the selected area are prone to severe arsenical skin manifestations long time consumption of this arsenic contaminated groundwater may also induce cancer risks das et al 2021 joardar et al 2021 geospatial distribution maps of thi ingestion dermal values through the inverse distance weighting idw model displayed that residents of 100 of areas in prm and 87 areas in pom are highly prone to non carcinogenic health risks due to intake of as and fe contaminated groundwater fig 7 the resultant water quality and associated health risks was better and lower in pom as compared to prm which may be due to recharge of rainwater mainly through river water infiltration into the shallow groundwater zone that helped in the dilution of the groundwater contaminants sharma et al 2021 4 limitation and recommendation some important potential toxic elements such as cd pd hg and al have not been included in the present investigation their concentration in the groundwater samples could provide a better understanding of hydrogeochemistry and accurate health risks assessment the dietary intake of arsenic mainly through the consumption of locally produced rice and vegetables has not been considered in future there is a scope for cumulative health risks investigation from both consumptions of arsenic rich foodstuff and groundwater with a detailed epidemiological survey of affected people to acquire an accurate total risk and prepare a better report for social awareness and risk management in the present study it was observed that most of the newly installed tubewells and even some of the green marked tubewells are arsenic contaminated thus the red and green marks on tubewells for their safe use are no longer valid 5 conclusions the study revealed that arsenic concentration in all prm samples and 80 of pom samples were above the who criteria 0 01 mg l indicating the research area is an arsenic endemic region ca mg hco3 types of water in the shallow freshwater table originated from the gmb basin under the influence of arsenic bearing geological settings and sediment water interactions governed the hydrogeochemistry of arsenic the observed high values of arsenic correspond to poor water quality resulting in unsafe and high risks of waterborne health hazards due to the use of contaminated water for drinking and bathing purposes which is not appreciable in present days ensuring a low arsenic water supply should be the priority in these affected regions as the residents depend highly on groundwater for drinking and other domestic activities circulation and utilization of purified surface water are not provided in this region by the govt or other agencies and the purchase of residential water purifiers by every family is severely constrained due to high cost thus large scale or community arsenic water treatment and supply solutions may be considered in the region chemical arsenic removal technologies as well as provision for safe drinking water such as deep tubewells avoiding shallow tubewells rainwater harvesting sand filters and marking of safe and unsafe tubewells are some common practices that are now become popular methods for arsenic management and such methods are adopted in many parts of bangladesh with government initiatives so one of the viable options for delivering clean water in this region is community water treatment facilities sponsored by corporate entities and local and state governments in

11696,a total of 60 groundwater samples from an arsenic endemic region fukra union of gopalganj district bangladesh were collected during the premonsoon prm and postmonsoon pom season in 2016 and were assessed for arsenic quantification along with other physico chemical parameters such as ec ph tds total fe major anions cations and the health hazards associated with them anions content was found in the order of hco3 419 7 mg l cl 23 8 mg l so4 2 20 2 mg l no3 9 95 mg l f 0 43 mg l and cations in the order of ca2 76 4 mg l mg2 28 mg l na 14 mg l k 4 7 mg l arsenic concentration ranged from bdl to 0 18 mg l with 90 of samples exhibiting concentration above the who permissible limit 0 01 mg l the average concentration of total fe was 0 14 mg l considering both seasons mean sd values of the water quality index wqi and water pollution index wpi were 78 15 30 67 and 0 81 0 2 respectively groundwater quality was unsafe for drinking purposes in 30 of places in terms of wqi and wpi human health risk associated with groundwater consumption was assessed through the total hazard index thi the mean thi values were 11 32 and 5 45 in prm and pom respectively indicating a greater chance of non carcinogenic threat to the inhabitants as the final score is much greater than the acceptable limit of 1 gis distribution maps of thi indicated a severe threat to both children s and adults health principal component analysis pca and hydrogeochemical characterization of groundwater through the piper diagram and gibb s plot indicated that ca hco3 rich water and its reaction with arsenic bearing

neumann et al 2010 saha et al 2017 tweed et al 2020 in the aquifers the release and dispersion of as is often governed by a number of variables including competitive ion exchange pyrite oxidation and most critically redox disequilibrium which is frequently connected with iron chakraborti et al 2015 das et al 2021 arsenic is a highly toxic pollutant in its inorganic form and even in minute quantities it poses severe threats to human health common ailments associated with arsenic are kidney bladder lung and skin cancer as well as bowen s disease arsenicosis hyperkeratosis coronary heart

as through dermal and inhalation way also greco et al 2019 ruíz vera et al 2019 tabassum et al 2019 moreover arsenic is bioaccumulated in the plant body when arsenic contaminated groundwater and surface water are used for irrigation seriously affecting human health samal et al 2011 2021 santra et al 2013 moulick et al 2021 the existence of widespread arsenicosis in bangladesh and west bengal is supposed to be associated with changed rainfall patterns imbalanced nutritious intake a sharp rise in groundwater consumption and a decline in groundwater tables the arsenic level in groundwater has been reported to be much higher than 0 01 mg l i e who recommended upper limit for drinking water samal et al 2013b according to the recent figures on arsenic pollution out of 64 districts of

hydrochemical properties of groundwater and health risk assessment through the total hazard index thi is helpful in better understanding of arsenic enrichment process and associated health risks in the past several studies calculated the chronic daily intake cdi for computing the thi of arsenic through dietary intake and drinking water to evaluate both its carcinogenic and non carcinogenic health effects liao et al 2018 rezaei et al 2019 das et al 2021 joardar et al 2021 the hazard index hi of rice was found to be much higher than hi of groundwater contributing as high as 93 of the cumulative total hazard index thi mondal et al 2019 samal et al 2021 though regional scale studies have been carried out for arsenic quantification detailed hydrogeochemistry and health risk assessment of arsenic with new techniques are lacking the current hydrochemical investigation water quality modelling and health hazard assessment for as rich groundwater in an arsenic endemic region is a step towards that explanation a detailed investigation was carried out in the fukra union of gopalganj district bangladesh where arsenic in drinking water has produced alarming health problems the present work was conducted to i characterize the groundwater chemistry in an arsenic endemic region ii evaluate the water quality by using a newly proposed quality assessment tool wpi and conventional wqi method and their comparison iii estimate health risks for both the children and adult age groups considering various routes of exposure to arsenic contaminated groundwater and iv modelling of wpi wqi and health hazard index using gis technology the spatial distribution mapping of water quality indices and hazard index modelling designed in the arc gis platform were carried out to understand the present scenario and undertake the best effective management for as rich groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the fukra union of kashiani upazila of gopalganj district of bangladesh is situated within 23 09 15 n to 23 10 10 n latitude and 89 44 38 e to 89 46 46 e longitude fig 1 with an area of 27 km2 the annual maximum and minimum temperatures are 35 1 c and 12 1 c respectively whereas the annual rainfall of 1955 mm the soil of this union is soft to medium stiff due to the alluvial deposits of various rivers having low organic content and medium bearing capacity the study area is just located on the river bank of the madhumati river which is an important distributary of the padma river which falls under the ganga brahmaputra meghna gbm floodplain which is the primary reason for arsenic enrichment all over the country and believed to be the controller of the hydrogeochemistry of the study area huq et al 2020 the hydrology of the study area is crucially governed by storm surges and tropical cyclones with usual seasonal rainfall rahman et al 2018b most people in the area are dependent on tubewell extracted groundwater for their domestic activities and agricultural purposes another source of water is harvested rainwater a monitoring survey in 2004 reported that 905 tubewells out of 1930 tubewells in the union were as contaminated and they were marked with red other 1025 tubewells were considered to be safe and marked with green fig 1sa b bamwsp 2004 the water of the red marked tubewells is supposed to be used for non drinking purposes the tubewells installed after the survey bear no marks and their water quality has not been monitored arsenic has contaminated the groundwater of 47 of the study area and more than 35 thousand people are at high risk of arsenic hazards shaibur 2019 some alternative water sources rainwater harvesting system and homemade arsenic filters were also noticed but they are very limited and have low arsenic removal efficiency fig 1sc d 2 2 sampling and analytical strategies in the premonsoon prm and postmonsoon pom seasons in 2016 groundwater samples were taken from 30 chosen tubewells from the research region at a regular interval of 100 300 m fig 1 a gps receiver garmin montana 650 was used to record the locations of the sample sites pre cleaned tarson 500 ml ldpe bottles with 10 hno3 and ultrapure water were used for groundwater sample collection during collection preservation and transit to the laboratory standard protocols were followed apha 2012 who 2011 the samples were analyzed for ph temperature electrical conductivity ec temperature major cations na k ca2 mg2 and anions hco3 cl no3 so4 2 f total iron and total arsenic a pocket sized ph meter model hanna was used to evaluate the ph and temperature on the site and a conductivity meter thermo scientific conductivity cell orion 013605md was used to calculate the ec using ion chromatography 883 basic ic plus the major water soluble cations and anions were identified hossain et al 2021 total arsenic as was determined using anodic stripping voltammetry va 797 computerace and total iron fe was quantified using a spectrometric approach apha 2012 2 3 statistical and spatial analysis multivariate statistical analyses such as principal component analysis pca and correlation analysis were carried out by the xlstat 2016 tool generally pca method in hydrogeochemical studies condenses a big collection of data into a few components that have comparable properties chen et al 2007 matiatos et al 2014 kamtchueng et al 2016 in order to show relationships between data set variables and the influence of certain chemical parameters a correlation analysis was also carried out analytical programs such as ms excel 2016 and rockware aqqa 1 1 1 1 1 5 1 were used for plotting the various diagrams such as piper plots univariate plots and gibbs plots the inverse distance weightage idw interpolation method was used in arcgis 10 1 to create spatial distribution maps 2 4 quality control qc and quality assurance qa wells were pumped for many minutes before taking water samples to remove the impact of stagnant water all laboratory glassware and sample bottles were cleaned with detergent and rinsed repeatedly with ultrapure water followed by a 24 h immersion in a 10 hno3 solution and again with ultrapure water to remove any potential contamination triplicate analyses 3 times replication were performed for each parameter for each sample to ensure the maintenance of the analytical quality the reagents and standards were made with analytical grade chemicals from merck germany standard solutions of anions f h c o 3 cl n o 3 s o 4 2 and cations na k mg2 ca2 solutions were supplied as samples and the instrument s ic output values were recorded in the case of fluoride ions for instance the accuracy or correlation coefficient 0 999 and the rsd relative standard deviation value was 0 563 showing satisfactory precision of the ic fig 2 s in supplementary materials moreover the cations vs anions concentration ionic balance for all the samples were verified using matthess 1982 s method where the value of the ionic balance of less than 5 and certainly up to 10 is acceptable whereas a value greater than 10 is unacceptable singhal and gupta 1999 the used anodic stripping voltammetric analytical technique exhibited high precision within the examined concentration range as evidenced by the accuracy of recovery for the arsenic determination varied from 96 3 to 98 1 percentage and precision of relative sd utilized for multiple duplicate measurements values varied from 1 57 to 2 61 percentage i e 3 2 5 drinking water quality assessment 2 5 1 water quality index wqi wqi is a frequently used grading system that shows the combined impact of many water quality variables on the general fitness of water for ingestion by people horton 1965 hossain and patra 2020a 2020b to calculate the wqi each of the anticipated 12 parameters was given a unit weight w i value between 1 and 5 based on their importance in groundwater used for drinking 5 being the most important table 1 in the first stage eq 1 was used to compute the relative weight w i 1 w i w i i 0 n w i where w i stands for the relative weight of a parameter w i denotes the weight that has been allocated to an individual parameter and n means the number of used parameters the next step was to divide each parameter s concentration by the corresponding standard guideline for every water sample eq 2 in order to generate the quality rating scale q i 2 q i c i s i 100 where si represents the bangladesh standard water quality recommendations established by the department of public health engineering dphe table 1 and ci stands for the observed concentration of a specific parameter in a sample in mg l then using the equation below eq 3 a sub index si i was determined for each parameter 3 s i i w i q i finally wqi was formulated by aggregating all the sub indices eq 4 4 w q i i 0 n s i i the following classifications were used to categorize wqi s output wqi 50 means excellent category good when wpi ranges from 50 to 75 wpi in the range of 75 100 exemplifies a poor quality and wpi 100 indicates a very poor water quality horton 1965 hossain and patra 2020a 2 5 2 water pollution index wpi the extent of groundwater contamination was assessed through the wpi using a total of 14 water quality parameters including fe as ph tds ec f cl no3 hco3 so4 2 na mg2 k and ca2 based on their recommended guideline value of bangladesh standards and who table 1 the key difference between newly formulated wpi and other indices such as wqi is that wpi is not bound to a specific type of water parameter and theoretical ideal value or dissimilar weights hossain and patra 2020b first the following equation eq 5 was used to determine the pollutant load pl i of a single parameter 5 p l i 1 c i s i s i the ith parameter s measured concentration is indicated by the symbol ci while its maximum or standard permitted value is indicated by the symbol si for ph a value of both 7 or 7 is detrimental to human health though 7 is considered neutral in the case of ph 7 equation 5 1 and ph 7 equation 5 2 was suggested 5 1 p l i c i 7 s i a 7 5 2 p l i c i 7 s i b 7 here si a indicates the minimum acceptable value of ph i e 6 5 and si b designates the maximum acceptable value of ph i e 8 5 ultimately the total degree of pollution of a sample was assessed by the water pollution index wpi by aggregating all pollution load divided by n number of used variables parameters eq 6 6 w p i 1 n i 1 n p l i the wpi values categorized the water quality into four groups such as excellent when wpi 0 5 0 5 wpi 0 75 indicates good water quality 0 75 wpi 1 means moderately polluted water and the water is highly polluted when wpi 1 2 6 health risk assessment hra to determine exposure risk to harmful components fe and as in this study in groundwater hazard index hi cumulatively functions with reference to the human body was performed adimalla and qiana 2019 to quantify the hi in the first step of chronic daily intake cdi a factor for frequency magnitude exposure duration and concentration level of potentially toxic metal was estimated there are two major ways of exposure pathways to estimate the health risks for the human body such as direct or oral ingestion eq 7 and through the skin eq 8 usepa 1989 7 c d i i n g e s t i o n c i i r e f e d b w a t 8 c d i d e r m a l c i s a k p e t e f e d c f b w a t where ci indicates the concentration of a toxic element mg l ir means ingestion rate ed denotes the exposure duration ef is the symbol for exposure frequency bw signifies the average body weight sa designates the skin area at describes the average time the skin permeability coefficient is k p cm h the exposure time is et and a unit concentration factor for hazardous elements in water is denoted by cf the value of these factors was gathered from recent publications and is provided in table 2 hossain and patra 2020c the hazard quotient hq is a method for determining the potential health risks caused by a single toxic element through a particular exposure route generally hq is the ratio between cdi for a specific exposure route and its respective reference dose rfd the formulation of hq is as follows eq 9 9 h q i i n g e s t i o n d e r m a l c d i i n g e s t i o n d e r r m a l r f d i n g e s t i o n d e r m a l where hqi represents the hazard produced by the ith element for a certain exposure path the term reference dose rfd is the verge limit for a toxic substance above which adverse health consequences will start to occur in this study two potential toxic elements fe and as were considered for the estimation of probable health risks to human health the rfd values of fe for ingestion and dermal exposures are 0 7 and 0 045 mg kg day hossain and patra 2020c and for as it is 0 0003 and 0 00012 mg kg day shil and singh 2019 respectively in the next step the hazard index hi was calculated eq 10 which is the sum of all the hqi for individual toxic elements for a particular pathway mentioned previously for two population groups viz children and adults separately 10 h i i n g e s t i o n d e r m a l h q i i m g e s t i o n d e r m a l in the end thi or the total hazard index was calculated by adding together all the risks brought on by different exposure pathways eq 11 11 t h i h i i n g e s t i o n h i d e r m a l a value of thi less than one 1 is considered an acceptable level of risk whereas thi values greater than one 1 are considered a probable risk of potentially unacceptable health hazards hossain and patra 2020c 3 results and discussion 3 1 basic groundwater chemistry physico chemical factors indicate the nature character and quality of groundwater according to the ionic balance test table 1s in the supplemental materials 95 of prm and 94 of pom samples had an ion balance ib within 5 as per the apha 2012 recommendation ionic error balances were often found negative suggesting that anions are generally more common than cations nag and das 2014 the statistical summary of the groundwater quality parameters is represented in table 3 ph is a major influential parameter that governs the acidity alkalinity and chemical speciation of elements in groundwater ph values ranged from 6 4 to 7 1 and 7 1 to 7 7 in prm and pom respectively indicating that the groundwater is generally neutral ec is the indication of all charges and dissolved particles present in water 36 of the sample had greater ec than the who limit 750 μs cm ranging from 316 to 1060 μs cm with an average value of 721 3 μs cm and 529 57 μs cm in prm and pom respectively the mean tds values 461 63 mg l in prm and 338 92 mg l in pom were found to be lower than the bangladesh standard 1000 mg l according to table 3 the primary cation sequence is ca2 na mg2 k showing calcium and sodium to be the predominant ones all the cations were observed below their specified bangladesh and who permissible limit table 1 except ca2 which ranged from 47 42 to 144 9 mg l major anions were in the descending order of h c o 3 cl s o 4 2 n o 3 f table 3 all the anions were noticed within their permissible limit except the bicarbonate which showed a mean sd value of 498 77 75 8 and 340 53 41 31 mg l in prm and pom respectively the results summary indicates that the groundwater of the study area is influenced by carbonate minerals with moderate dissolution total fe varied between 0 01 and 0 85 with a mean value of 0 24 and 0 04 in prm and pom respectively signifying both the mean values are lower than who and bangladesh standards with a few higher values in some locations arsenic the most toxic element ranged from 0 03 to 0 18 mg l and bdl to 0 07 mg l with a mean value of 0 06 and 0 03 mg l in prm and pom respectively fig 2a and b indicating much higher values than the who and bangladesh permissible limit arsenic was found to show a negative correlation to ph and temperature and positively correlated with all other parameters it was previously estimated that when people consume arsenic levels 0 05 mg l in groundwater they are more suspected to experience dermatological manifestations and as skin lesions samal et al 2013b and thus residents of the study area are at a high risk of arsenic induced health hazards the study area is just located on the bank of the madhumati river which is a distributary of the padma river and a part of the gbm ganga brahmaputra meghna floodplain the sediments of the gbm flood plain are primarily basic and metallic and are a potential source of as huq et al 2020 oxidation of arsenopyrite causing arsenic enrichment is likely to be due to large scale groundwater extraction from shallow aquifer systems lowers et al 2007 3 2 source interpretation of water quality parameters a popular multivariate statistical method in hydrogeochemical research is principal component analysis pca here varimax rotation through the dimension reduction process was used to carry out pca the first four principal components d1 d2 d3 d4 explained a total of 78 76 variances in the data set the degree of factor loading with the cumulative variance of principal components eigenvalues 1 is summarized in table 2s fig 3 presents the biplots of the major components the first factor d1 contributed a maximum of 31 0 of the total variance having strong loading in ec tds ca2 mg2 k and h c o 3 the grouping of ca2 and mg2 with h c o 3 indicates their source to be carbonate minerals such as aragonite calcite and dolomite geochemical processes like ion exchange and weathering of silicate minerals have an impact on the remaining variables d2 accounted for 20 62 of the variance owing to the significant loading of ph na cl and f which are strongly associated with local geological settings such as halite and fluorite dissolution and interaction of sodium and fluoride bearing minerals with the groundwater d3 shared 15 37 indicating the strong loading of iron and arsenic which originated from iron bearing minerals such as arsenopyrite the fourth factor d4 contributed 11 76 of the total variance and includes so4 2 no3 directing their input from anthropogenic activities such as chemical fertilizer from the agricultural fields 3 3 hydrochemical characterization understanding hydrochemical principles help in clarifying the dynamics of groundwater systems and opens up clues to the ancient environments pierre et al 2005 hossain et al 2020 piper trilinear diagram was used for plotting the analytical values of principal cations and anions piper 1944 to understand the hydrochemical properties of the research area s groundwater in essence it shows whether the water is distinct or a mixture of different types in terms of chemical properties it also provides a clue to the possible origin of groundwater samples the diamond shaped area of the piper diagram is divided into four major categories such as ca so4 ca hco3 na cl and na hco3 each part represents a particular type of variation in water chemistry all the samples of this study of both prm and pom seasons have displayed a characteristic of ca hco3 type water with dominancy of calcium magnesium and carbonate ions fig 4 a and b indicating the presence of carbonate minerals with their probable origin from the sallow freshwater zone which is another reason for arsenic enrichment influential environmental mechanisms for above groundwater chemistry were identified through gibbs diagrams gibbs 1970 which investigate certain mechanisms like precipitation rock weathering and evaporation that regulate the chemistry of groundwater luo et al 2017 hossain and patra 2021 the scatter diagrams were plotted by applying the log scale values of tds concentrations vs na na ca2 fig 5 a and cl cl hco3 fig 5b the graphical interpretation clearly illustrated that the area s groundwater chemistry is profoundly impacted by the native geological foundation weathering of rock minerals ion exchange and water rock interaction since the rock dominant sector encompassed all of the groundwater samples 3 4 assessment of drinking water quality the water quality index wqi is a common and effective method for determining groundwater quality and suitability for drinking purposes fourteen water quality parameters such as tds ec ph h c o 3 cl f s o 4 2 n o 3 ca2 mg2 na k total fe and as were undertaken to determine the overall groundwater quality through wqi the values of wqi ranged from 54 91 to 214 02 and 17 93 to 95 88 in prm and pom seasons respectively the spatial variation map of wqi through idw interpolated gis technique indicated that during prm no sample was found in the excellent category 63 of samples showed good water class 33 of the sample were observed in poor category and 6 of the sample were categorized as very poor water fig 6 a contrastingly in pom 30 70 of samples were classified in the excellent and good category respectively fig 6b the water pollution index wpi proposed by hossain and patra 2020b was employed to assess the level of contamination for drinking purposes using 14 variables n 14 of water quality wpi values varied from 0 72 to 1 76 in prm with a mean value of 1 0 while in pom it was found in the range of 0 31 0 89 having an average of 0 62 among the 30 collected groundwater samples in premonsoon no sample was observed in the excellent category 7 of samples were found to be of good quality 60 were categorized as moderately polluted and 33 of the sample were found to be highly polluted or unfit for human consumption fig 6c in pom 26 of the sample were excellent 47 were good 27 were moderate and none was found in highly polluted category for drinking purposes fig 6d the results revealed that for drinking purpose the groundwater quality in the region is moderate to highly polluted in prm and good to moderately polluted in pom comparatively wpi presented a better report of water quality since it is an integrated approach that produces a single value index by converting n number of input parameters to classify the water quality some hydrochemical studies on groundwater of the region have been carried out for arsenic quantification and its relation with other water parameters and the health risks has been discussed based on arsenic quantification only rahman et al 2018a shaibur 2019 shaibur and howlader 2020 this study characterizes the water quality based on a new index system wpi wqi and application of gis for water quality as well as health hazards modelling using total hazard index thi the geospatial distribution map of wqi and wpi and thi with idw interpolation technique through the gis platform envisaged the seasonal as well as spatial variation in water quality of the entire study area this type of map is very useful for better groundwater management since it can easily delineate the water quality classes such as excellent good moderate and highly polluted in a broad region 3 5 heath risk assessment sequential computation of the chronic daily intake cdi hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi for ingestion and dermal exposures for the two potential toxic elements total fe and total as was obtained to estimate the total hazard index thi for adult and children age group in prm thi values for adults thia had a mean value of 11 60 with a range of 4 96 32 21 fig 7 a and for the child thic it ranged from 4 73 to 30 71 with a mean of 11 05 fig 7b in pom thi values for adults and children varied from 0 002 to 12 2 figs 7c and 0 002 to 11 63 fig 7d indicating lower health risk as compared to prm season in both seasons for both age groups 99 of health hazards were attributed to the ingestion route of exposure in all thi cases hq values of arsenic were found to be more dominant than iron indicating as is the most influential toxic element in total hazard prediction predicted risk values indicate that the residents of the selected area are prone to severe arsenical skin manifestations long time consumption of this arsenic contaminated groundwater may also induce cancer risks das et al 2021 joardar et al 2021 geospatial distribution maps of thi ingestion dermal values through the inverse distance weighting idw model displayed that residents of 100 of areas in prm and 87 areas in pom are highly prone to non carcinogenic health risks due to intake of as and fe contaminated groundwater fig 7 the resultant water quality and associated health risks was better and lower in pom as compared to prm which may be due to recharge of rainwater mainly through river water infiltration into the shallow groundwater zone that helped in the dilution of the groundwater contaminants sharma et al 2021 4 limitation and recommendation some important potential toxic elements such as cd pd hg and al have not been included in the present investigation their concentration in the groundwater samples could provide a better understanding of hydrogeochemistry and accurate health risks assessment the dietary intake of arsenic mainly through the consumption of locally produced rice and vegetables has not been considered in future there is a scope for cumulative health risks investigation from both consumptions of arsenic rich foodstuff and groundwater with a detailed epidemiological survey of affected people to acquire an accurate total risk and prepare a better report for social awareness and risk management in the present study it was observed that most of the newly installed tubewells and even some of the green marked tubewells are arsenic contaminated thus the red and green marks on tubewells for their safe use are no longer valid 5 conclusions the study revealed that arsenic concentration in all prm samples and 80 of pom samples were above the who criteria 0 01 mg l indicating the research area is an arsenic endemic region ca mg hco3 types of water in the shallow freshwater table originated from the gmb basin under the influence of arsenic bearing geological settings and sediment water interactions governed the hydrogeochemistry of arsenic the observed high values of arsenic correspond to poor water quality resulting in unsafe and high risks of waterborne health hazards due to the use of contaminated water for drinking and bathing purposes which is not appreciable in present days ensuring a low arsenic water supply should be the priority in these affected regions as the residents depend highly on groundwater for drinking and other domestic activities circulation and utilization of purified surface water are not provided in this region by the govt or other agencies and the purchase of residential water purifiers by every family is severely constrained due to high cost thus large scale or community arsenic water treatment and supply solutions may be considered in the region chemical arsenic removal technologies as well as provision for safe drinking water such as deep tubewells avoiding shallow tubewells rainwater harvesting sand filters and marking of safe and unsafe tubewells are some common practices that are now become popular methods for arsenic management and such methods are adopted in many parts of bangladesh with government initiatives so one of the viable options for delivering clean water in this region is community water treatment facilities sponsored by corporate entities and local and state governments in the future extensive epidemiological studies will be another scope to relate past arsenic exposure and real time arsenic causing illnesses in communities declaration of competing interest the authors

11697,this study aims to determine whether limestone mining does not affect the sustainability of the springs in the vicinity we simulated the linkages between several water sources in the prospective limestone mining area and its surroundings with various geological formations the approach in this study is by integrating hydrochemical analysis isotope data and mass balance calculations to understand the hydrological system s linkages in a geologically complex area particularly in the proposed limestone mining site twenty two samples for hydrochemical and isotopic analysis were taken spatially in each geological formation to represent various water sources springs caves shallow groundwater and deep groundwater hydrochemical analysis indicates that both caves and springs have a low degree of mineralization and mostly simple facies ca hco3 further both have lighter isotope values δ 18o and δ 2h meaning they are relatively younger and have not experienced advanced hydrochemical processes yet the most interesting point is that the mass balance modelling shows the bold information that the southern caves are not related to the springs it is due to the mismatch between the thermodynamic calculation and the actual condition the southern caves are primarily supplied by rainwater where 95 of the ions are evolved due to water rock interaction while the springs receive recharge from rainwater 40 and other systems synthesizing the information we hypothesize that mining the limestone in the southern part consisting of the caves will not disturb the springs as they are unrelated graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrochemistry isotope mass balance modelling limestone mining data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mining activities aim to extract certain minerals to fulfil society s needs mineral extraction can be used as raw materials for industrial production such as aluminium iron lithium and rare earth elements and building materials clay sand rock aggregates and others nevertheless extraction activities need to be carried out carefully concerning their impact on other aspects hydrological aspects both surface water and groundwater interact with various physiographic and climatic landscapes changnon et al 1988 winter 1999 romanelli et al 2014 haaf et al 2020 hare et al 2021 this concept means that if there is a change in physiographic configuration due to mineral extraction it will impact the hydrological system it should be noted that water resources are susceptible and often create and trigger conflicts of interest gleick 1993 kasymov 2011 therefore most of the time there will be a negative perception from the people especially the communities around the mine site that triggers disputation and open conflict between the mining industry and communities hilson 2002 mensah and okyere 2014 engels 2016 persson et al 2017 weiβ et al 2020 consequently many aspects of mining activities need to be taken care of such as legal aspects mine framework and surveillance in the mining cycle from exploration to reclamation reid et al 2009 gorman and dzombak 2018 asr et al 2019 pell et al 2019 if we look further exploration and planning are the most crucial in the mining cycle as this is the first wall to prevent the domino effect in this matter geological features must be well understood from the geological system to the hydrological system so that we can delineate the area that must be protected and allowed to be mined still this is not straightforward to be understood predominantly mining studies use geological and geophysical approaches for exploration sigurdsson and overgaard 1998 pesendorfer and loew 2010 pereira et al 2017 wang et al 2021 most of the cases the hydrochemical approach is only used for knowing the quality of the water during and post mining naja et al 2011 kusimi and kusimi 2012 atanacković et al 2013 favas et al 2016 batsaikhan et al 2017 xia et al 2017 li et al 2018 wang et al 2019 jiang et al 2022 kazemi et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 in this research we try to apply the hydrochemical methods in limestone mining exploration by integrating hydrogeochemical isotopic data analysis and mass balance calculations in determining areas where mining can be carried out concerning the state of the hydrological system particularly in a complex geological area this integration can be used as a recommendation and guide for mine planning exploration phase particularly in analysing the relationship of the hydrological system in the complex geological hydrological system such as limestone area hydrogeochemical analysis is one of the tools used to investigate and evaluate groundwater resources kalhor et al 2019 adimalla et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 chen et al 2021 el yousfi et al 2022 by using this technique information related to the origin and evolution of groundwater hydrochemical processes that occur sources of pollutants or contaminants and the relationship of groundwater in a hydrological system could be ascertained for multi purposes drew and goldscheider 2007 explained that hydrogeological investigations particularly in karst areas using hydrogeochemical methods have several limitations one of which is difficulties in developing an adequate sampling due to the high temporal variability however this problem could be subsided by combining isotopic methods that could be used as a tracer for the origin and movement of the water precisely koeniger et al 2016 jasechko 2019 leketa et al 2019 swetha et al 2020 gopinath et al 2021 jesiya et al 2021 khettoutch et al 2022 mass balance modelling can reconfirm the linkages of the system by knowing the chemical processes reactions poetra et al 2020 the mass balance modelling is based on thermodynamic law ion activity ph and temperature that will tell us the net and limit of the mass transfer due to water rock interaction by knowing how much substance ion has been transferred from the mineral to the water or vice versa mass balance modelling becomes the basis for determining the linkages from two observation points whether they are directly related indirectly related mixed by another point or separate systems for applying our approach we observed pracimantoro and eramoko java indonesia as they are 1 consist of a complex geological and hydrological system limestone clay and volcanic system and 2 have the potential for mineral extraction and quarries limestone and clay pracimantoro has a prominent and potential reserve in limestone wonosari formation extraction of limestone is commonly used for building purposes in the form of large blocks or agriculture industrial and pharmaceutical purposes in the form of small blocks further limestone is a raw material in manufacturing cement for building construction meanwhile the eromoko area is mostly located in the basin area baturetno formation qb which is rich in clay minerals therefore eromoko is also a potential area for extraction activities namely the extraction of clay from the brick pit the use of clay minerals is generally used for manufacturing bricks tiles pottery and natural seals the groundwater in the baturetno basin baturetno formation is stored in clay aquifers while the springs are still unknown they might be from the volcanic formation or limestone of the wonosari formation therewithal springs and groundwater are the primary clean water resources for domestic use by the communities in the observed area therefore it is necessary to have precise techniques in determining the linkages of the water sources in a hydrological system particularly the groundwater system in determining which area needs to be protected and could be extracted hopefully it could avoid conflicts of interest and maintain the sustainability of the water resource both quantity and quality related to the main idea of this research the integration of hydrogeochemical isotope analysis and mass balance calculation is expected to provide insight into the groundwater system in these areas primarily for caves and springs in the limestone area this information would be used as one of the databases in determining the area that can be extracted and the area that needs to be maintained to preserve the quantity and quality of water resources especially the springs in the observation area thus this research aims to provide an analysis of whether there is a relation between the caves and springs in the limestone area by integrating hydrochemical isotopic techniques and mass balance models this research wants to apply these methods for the exploration phase in mining activities that can be applied globally as a consideration in determining the area that needs to be maintained and can be extracted to preserve and sustain the water resource 2 site description 2 1 general description in order to get a correct analysis we must know the geological configuration in the observed area the geological and physiographic maps of the observed area are shown in fig 1 and its geological cross section is displayed in fig 2 the baturetno basin extends from wonogiri batuwarno giriwoyo and eromoko districts in particular the research location focuses on the southwestern part of the baturetno basin namely in the eromoko and pracimantoro districts in this section there are many features of caves and springs in the wonosari formation the communities in this area use springs in the northwest area and groundwater wells as their water resource it is common to find a lot of dug wells shallow groundwater drilled wells deep groundwater and pipes connecting the springs to the communal water storage morphologically the study area is divided into hill topography and the baturetno basin with 21 villages the baturetno basin has a population of 29 890 people with a population density of 514 km2 meanwhile the area with hilly topography limestone area has a population of 22 079 with a population density of 377 km2 the area of baturetno basin is approximately 235 km2 hydrologically the baturetno basin is drained by the bengawan solo river the longest river in java island indonesia the watershed area of the bengawan solo river is roughly 16 000 km2 starting from mt sewu south to the java sea north while the length of this river is around 600 km in the middle of baturetno basin there is an artificial reservoir namely gajah mungkur dam the primary function of this dam is to control flooding in the bengawan solo river the secondary function of this dam is used for agricultural purposes around the reservoir area hydroelectric power plants and recreation areas the climate of the whole baturetno basin is a dry tropical climate based on the recorded data from 2009 to 2019 from the weather station in wonosari city 27 km from the study area the highest average temperature in this area is 32 4 c october while the average lowest is 23 2 c january the annual temperature around this area is 27 7 c with annual precipitation of around 2007 mm year the wet season lasts six months from october to march whereas the dry season lasts from april to september 2 2 geomorphology and geology physiographically van bemmelen 1949 stated that the study area is part of the southern mountains of java island as for regionally pannekoek 1949 stated that the study area is part of the southern plateau of java island geological formations located around the study area are mandalika formation tomm semilir formation tms wuni formation tmw nampol formation tmn wonosari formation tmwl and baturetno formation qb specifically the study area is mostly laid in two geological formations namely wonosari formation tmwl and baturetno formation qb fig 1 the southern part of the study area is included in the hills of mt sewu which resulted from the uplift that began in the late pleiocene in this region it consists of layered limestone that can be found in the northern north eastern part and reef limestone in the southern part both of which are neogene limestones van bemmelen 1949 balazs 1968 waltham et al 1983 surono et al 2008 rahadjo et al al 1995 further this area is called as wonosari formation tmwl composed of layered limestone reef limestone sandstone and tuff fig 2 genetically this formation was deposited in shallow marine environments in the neritic zone during the middle miocene to pliocene its total thickness was estimated at more than 650 m the bedrock of the wonosari formation is composed of miocene clastic volcanic rock from wuni formation agglomerates with tuffaceous sandstone and coarse sandstone sambipitu formation sandstone and claystone semilir formation tuff pumice breccia sandstone tuff and claystone nglanggran formation volcanic rocks agglomerates tuffs and andesitic basaltic lava and nampol formation conglomerates sandstones agglomerates shale claystone and tuff the northern part of the observed area is part of the baturetno basin this basin separates the mt sewu area from the plopoh hills complex which is part of the gajah mungkur ancient volcano during its formation the baturetno basin was a lake as a paleolake during the holocene so the typical deposition of lake material could be found in this area namely black clay this formation is called as baturetno formation further the baturetno formation is composed of clay mud silt sand pebble and gravel the depositional process of the baturetno formation was related to the tectonic uplift in southern java in late pliocene lehmann 1936 van bemmelen 1949 lehmann 1936 concluded that baturetno basin used to be a lake paleolake due to the representation of black clay and the tilting process in the late pliocene that changed the main river direction in this area namely the bengawan solo river the tilting process which was caused by the tectonic uplift in late pliocene formed into a lake quaternary and dried up into the basin in the present nevertheless putra and yulianto 2015 argue that there was no shifting course of the bengawan solo river due to tectonic activities it means that the baturetno basin is not a paleolake mudflow alluvial fan processes deposited the clay layer in this area the gravels associated with mud flow deposits that could be found might be associated with alluvial fan origin as explained by blissenbach 1954 and bull 1977 the presence of the alluvial plain bajada in this area and lineaments north south could be found in this area putra and yulianto 2015 3 materials and methods tracer test was conducted and twenty two wells in the observation area were measured to acquire the hydraulic head data this dataset generated a hydroisophyses map in the observed area fig 3 that shows the direction of groundwater movement for sampling and further analysis concerning the issue by goldscheider 2007 about the difficulties in developing adequate sampling in the karst landscape we sampled in the dry season when the water discharge reached the lowest peak the diffuse slow flow became the main process during this time further it also minimizes dilution during the wet season due to high precipitation in the tropical regime therefore sampling in the dry season is the most suitable representation of the water condition to observe the mechanism of water rock interaction the artificial tracer test reveals no connection between the injection points inside the proposed limestone mining area c19 and c22 to the springs in baturetno basin a tracer injection from d5 drilled well was also not detected in the study area some springs in the basin are proved to be recharged by the underground water caves from the western part of the study area including golek cave c7 to pule and sawahan springs celeng cave c15 to sawahan spring and njlumbang cave to sambiroto spring s3 the samples were taken from various water sources springs caves shallow groundwater from dug wells and deep groundwater from drilled wells the sampling sites are displayed in fig 3 the sampling procedures referred to the regulation that has been explained by nielsen and nielsen 2006 the samples from wells were pumped before being taken until the psychochemical parameters stabilized to get the in situ groundwater conditions the physicochemical parameters namely ph electrical conductivity ec temperature and total dissolved solids tds were measured directly on the field using a portable water checker hi 98130 hanna usa the samples were stored in a clean

standard values in this research were using the international standard vienna standard mean ocean water v smow clark and fritz 1997 the result of hydrochemical testing and isotopic analysis is shown in table 1 the hydrochemical data were analysed using general statistical tools and diagrams to acquire further information hydrogeochemical facies was determined by referring kurlov method and the durov diagram this diagram provides information on the agglomeration of hydrogeochemical attributes and the initial guess of hydrogeochemical processes that work in the observed area saturation indices and hydrogeochemical mass balance modelling were calculated numerically using the phreeqc program parkhurst and appelo 1999 the calculation of inverse modelling aims to understand the mechanism that works in the system particularly chemical reactions resulting from water rock interaction processes plummer et al 1983 alpers and nordstrom 1997 adji and widyastuti 2005 kresic 2006 poetra et al 2020 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemical results first the hydrogeochemical result becomes the initial indicator for determining the sources and origins of the water total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec are quick and easy but also essential indicators by knowing these parameters we can see the degree of mineralization in the water moreover hydrochemical data will provide us with deeper information such as its facies and a hint about what kind of processes happened in each distinct attribute landform geological formation etc this information is important to know the linkages of the water in the observed area the value of tds in the study area is around 250 1300 ppm while the ec values are from 250 to 1800 μs cm specifically the average tds values for deep groundwater shallow groundwater springs and caves are 411 ppm 690 ppm 437 5 ppm and 253 5 ppm respectively in terms of ec the mean values for deep groundwater shallow groundwater springs and underground water caves are 578 μs cm 968 μs cm 622 μs cm and 505 μs cm respectively these data indicate that underground water caves does not undergo complex hydrogeochemical or evolutionary processes in short underground water caves is relatively young and role as a temporary storage after the precipitation on the other hand shallow groundwater in the baturetno basin has a relatively high mineralization value tds compared to other types of groundwater in contrast to the underground water caves the shallow groundwater may have undergone a more complex process this argument is in line with the gibbs diagram in fig 4 where evaporation also affects the shallow groundwater s hydrochemical processes on the other hand underground water cave is more straightforward relatively fresh and young and the precipitation slightly influences the system based on the classification of rhoades et al 1992 groundwaters in the deep layer drilled well caves and springs are classified as freshwater on the other hand the shallow groundwaters are mostly slightly saline with the most considerable value at w12 1865 μs cm considering the climate condition in the observed area evaporation affects the hydrochemical condition of the shallow groundwater the process will evaporate the water molecules and saturates the groundwater an interesting additional finding from this part is that the relationship between ec and tds values is positive as suggested by hem 1985 and hubert and wolkersdorfer 2015 the conversion constant of the tds value from the ec is 0 72 tds 0 72 ec spatially groundwater in the baturetno basin area baturetno clay formation has relatively greater ec and tds values than groundwater in the wonosari limestone formation the facies of the groundwater in this research are determined based on the content of dissolved cations and anions using a combination of the durov diagram fig 5 and the kurlov method table 2 ca hco3 n 15 is common facies found in the study area followed by mg ca hco3 n 5 na k mg ca hco3 n 1 and na k ca hco3 cl n 1 the groundwater facies of the caves and springs are mostly ca hco3 and mg ca hco3 facies furthermore the facies of shallow groundwater and deep groundwater are quite varied shallow and deep groundwater in the wonosari formation has the same facies as underground water caves and springs namely ca hco3 and mg ca hco3 it indicates that the carbonate minerals from limestone formation may influence them on the other hand the facies of groundwater in the baturetno basin are more complicated deep groundwater d11 and shallow groundwater w12 in the eastern basin area have a significant surge in alkaline concentrations especially in sodium suppose we overlay this information with the stratigraphy data in that case the deep groundwater for d11 is stored in volcanic formation and clay formation figs 1 and 2 contradictorily the deep groundwater d9 and shallow groundwater w10 in the northwest basin part have different facies which are calcium bicarbonate and low in alkaline here it seems that there are facies clustering for the deep and shallow groundwater in the basin area related to the limestone effect by looking at its facies the deep and shallow groundwater in the east south basin is not influenced by limestone in the southern part it is shown by the closest spring s1 having different facies low in alkaline and mostly calcium bicarbonate meanwhile deep and shallow groundwater have lower mineralization degrees than the closest spring s8 nevertheless we can conclude that deep groundwater strongly links with shallow groundwater furthermore from the hydrogeochemical analysis we get several key information first the northwest spring s8 has distinct facies compared to other springs where magnesium dominates the ions if we overlay this information with the geological formation s8 combines volcanic and clay formations it is relevant where the major cations particularly sodium calcium magnesium and dissolved silica are also high s8 is influenced by the water rock interaction by volcanic rocks that contain olivine from lava and basalt as the source of magnesium and silica and albite as the source of sodium and silica this spring s8 does not influence the groundwater in the surroundings as they have different facies d9 and w10 second even though the most common facies for underground water caves are calcium bicarbonate we can divide the caves into two groups by looking at their physicochemical indicator the northwest caves c7 and c15 have a 2 fold higher value of tds and ec than the southern caves c19 and c22 it means the southern caves have a small mineralization degree tds around 250 ppm and ec just around 380 μs cm they are unlikely to have a similar system and recharge point different entity moreover the degree of mineralization in the southern caves is relatively low it indicates that the residence time of the water in this area is pretty quick from the recharge in contrast to the southern caves the northwest caves are likely to have a more complex hydrological system therefore the cave in the south is not correlated to the caves or springs in the northwest in general the caves and springs also have a similar degree of mineralization and facies it might be that they are not correlated with each other third we tentatively could find that the underground water in the southern area is a distinct entity from other water resources west east and basin part suppose this area becomes the mine area for mineral extraction limestone in that case it is unlikely to disturb the other water resources particularly baturetno basin and the north west area where the urban area is located however this is too premature to be a conclusion therefore we need isotope data and mass balance modelling to reaffirm these initial results 4 1 1 isotopic results the δ18o of the groundwater in the observed area range from 5 to 8 while the δ2h range from 31 to 51 specifically the average values of δ18o in deep groundwater shallow groundwater springs and caves are 6 58 5 97 6 22 and 7 63 respectively the average values of δ2h in deep groundwater shallow groundwater springs and caves are 40 25 35 72 40 37 and 48 35 respectively both values indicate the characteristic of groundwater recharge in this area originating from precipitation in tropical climate regimes mcguire and mcdonnell 2007 the plotted data in fig 6 shows the relationship between the elevation against isotope data the goodness of fit r2 value for oxygen is 0 57 and for deuterium is 0 74 in this matter they are quite dispersed generally their relationship is positive but relatively moderate siegenthaler s 1979 research explained that heavy isotopes would preferentially form as a liquid and a solid phase on the other hand the lighter isotope has a robust composition in the gaseous liquid form the essential information from the sampled data is the depletion of the isotope from lower to higher altitudes in this matter the precipitation comes from the northern part mt merapi for the basin area and the southern part indian ocean for the limestone karst area fig 7 shows the plot of δ18o and δ2h values based on water types the meteoric line refers to the global meteoric water line from craig 1961 namely δ2h 8 δ18o d where d namely the y intercept with slope 8 following the explanation of dansgaard 1964 based on fig 7 the underground water caves is relatively lighter than other types of groundwater while shallow groundwater has a relatively heavier isotope value regarding altitude fig 3 the caves have the highest altitude combining these two data it makes sense that the groundwaters in the caves have the lightest isotope value in line with the theory of elevation effects on isotope conditions clark and fritz 1997 mcguire et al 2005 on the other hand the shallow groundwaters have the heaviest isotope values even compared to the deep groundwaters with the deepest altitude it becomes interesting fact that it might be due to two possibilities 1 evaporation works intensively and affects shallow groundwater and or 2 the shallow groundwater gets recharged from deep groundwater inverted process there is some essential information from the isotope data related to the aim of this research first the groundwater in the caves does not experience an advanced geochemical process it is reflected in the isotope data and the hydrochemical analysis uncomplicated type and low degree of mineralization second shallow groundwaters have the heaviest isotope data theoretically the deep groundwater should have the heaviest due to the depletion of gaseous form and intense process within water rock interaction the evaporation process in the shallow groundwater might be responsible for this condition figs 4 and 5 however there is also an eloquent example to support the argument that deep groundwater in the northwest recharges the shallow groundwater and spring it is reflected in the hydrochemical analysis from the previous section and fig 7 from s8 spring d9 deep groundwater and w10 shallow groundwater that they are all located in the same cluster by knowing the regional geological information and geological map we have to consider a lineament due to the fault across the observed area recalling that d9 is artesian groundwater it is likely that s8 spring and d9 artesian groundwater are controlled by the fault and pressure from the geological system in the northwest area with the source from the baturetno formation not the limestone area in the west and south area if we combine it with hydrochemical analysis from the previous section deep groundwater d9 has a simple hydrogeochemistry type and low degree of mineralization ca hco3 and tds 447 mg l compared to spring mg ca hco3 and 450 mg l and shallow groundwater ca hco3 and 645 mg l the evolution of deep water into as a spring is mainly because of water rock interaction i e calcite and dolomite as the spring is also influenced by wonosari limestone formation third interpretation of the isotope results in the study area reveals that underground water caves is thought to have exchanged process with carbon dioxide co2 the plot s direction denotes it is relative to the right lighter of the meteoric water line furthermore if this groundwater goes to the springs it can be seen that the water rock interactions were involved as shown that the plot tends to the right side as a consequence the value of oxygen 18 in the springs was relatively heavier these events were typical characteristics of the limestone area due to the water rock interaction process fourth the springs generally have heavier isotope values in limestone areas compared to the caves it means that caves might contribute and flow into the surface as a spring however they have a similar degree of mineralization and constituent particularly for southern caves and springs in the limestone formation it requires a short time and fast flow in a conduit system therefore it is unlikely they are in the one hydrological system and the water needs an advanced process infiltrate as a spring not as fast as caves 4 1 2 mass balance modelling mass balance modelling is fundamental for integrating the two previous approaches hydrogeochemical analysis and isotope data from the last section we have gathered some information 1 the southern caves c19 and c122 are distinct from other groundwater particularly in the basin area in this matter they do not have any linkage to other groundwater resources in the basin area springs as well as shallow and deep groundwater 2 the groundwaters in the northwest are influenced by their typical geological structure and formation particularly the fault system and combination of limestone volcanic formation distinct entity yet this argument should be strengthened by the mass balance modelling to know how much the mass transfer is due to water rock interaction regarding the gibbs plot fig 4 the evolution of the groundwater is mainly due to rock dominance except for shallow groundwater which is also influenced by evaporation in this case mass balance modelling is the appropriate approach moreover recall from the previous argument the cave s water could flow into as a spring or groundwater recharge therefore the mass balance modelling in this research will construct whether the mass transfer is rational and possible limestone wonosari formation in the observed area is dominated by carbonate minerals i e calcite and dolomite mixtures the dissolution reaction of calcite and dolomite is expressed as follows 5 dissolution of calcite 3 caco3 s h2co3 aq ca2 aq 2 hco3 aq or caco3 s h aq ca2 aq hco3 aq 5 1 dissolution of dolomite 4 2h aq camg co3 2 s ca2 aq mg2 aq 2 hco3 aq 5 1 1 dissolution of gypsum 5 caso4 2h2o s ca2 aq so4 2 aq 2h2o l we simulate the mass balance to calculate the mass transfer from minerals to the solution calcite dolomite and gypsum are selected as they are the dominant minerals in the wonogiri limestone area we used calcium as the proxy as this ion is mainly involved in the dissolution or precipitation of the observed minerals table 3 presents the result of the mass balance modelling the observation changes mean the actual difference in the concentration between two observation points meanwhile the percentage contribution implies the contribution of mass transfer from selected minerals compared to the actual net concentration we selected some points of observation for this section 1 rainwater is the main recharge for water resources initial point 2 c19 cave from the southern part is the point to represent the area of potential limestone mining from the previous section 3 s6 and s3 massive springs in the western part were observed to know whether there is a linkage between springs in the region of the west with the southern cave 4 d8 deep groundwater and s8 spring were observed to know whether they are influenced by limestone or a more complex process the first observation is the groundwater in the southern cave represented by c19 from hydrochemical and isotope analysis southern caves have a low degree of mineralization simple facies and lighter isotopes it implies that they are supplied purely by precipitation rainwater in order to reinforce this argument we performed the mass balance modelling from rainwater to the caves c19 if other hydrological systems do not supply southern caves except rainwater the water rock interaction process by the rainwater and minerals will primarily contribute to the evolution of groundwater in the caves dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum from rain water to southern cave c19 as follow a 1 687 caco3 s 1 687 h2co3 aq 1 687 ca2 aq 3 374 hco3 aq b 1 234 h aq 0 617 camg co3 2 s 0 617 ca2 aq 0 617 mg2 aq 1 234 hco3 aq c 0 054 caso4 2h2o s 0 054 ca2 aq 0 054 so4 2 aq 0 108 h2o l the mass balance calculation shows that the evolution of calcium as the proxy from rainwater to caves c19 is due to water rock interaction between rainwater and minerals in the limestone area 95 it is primarily due to calcite dissolution 68 99 followed by dolomite 25 21 and gypsum 2 20 the ratio between mass balance modelling and actual changes in the calcium from rainwater to the caves c19 is pretty significant and high just under 100 5 lower due to uncertainties it means that the hypothesis from hydrological and isotope analysis from the previous is correct where rainwater is the prime source of the caves second at this point the southern caves are the first entry of the rainwater as a recharge if we want to mine this area for limestone mining then we have to know if there is any continuity from the southern caves to the springs in the northern part i e s6 and s3 which are laid in the same geological formation we simulate two scenarios from the rainwater to the springs s6 and s3 and from the caves c19 to the springs s6 and s3 the reaction based on the mass balance modelling for these points are followed 5 1 2 rainwater to spring s6 a caco3 s 2 477 h2co3 aq 2 477 ca2 aq 4

0 010 ca2 aq 0 010 so4 2 aq 0 020 h2o l the interaction between rainwater and minerals in the limestone area calcite dolomite and gypsum accounts for about 50 of the total ions in the springs it means that other water sources are coming to springs furthermore the question is whether the cave in the south supplies these springs the results of mass balance modelling show that mass transfer from caves c19 to springs s6 and s3 does not fit the actual observations calcite is still undersaturated and dissolves contributing to the surging of the calcium concentration on the other hand dolomite and gypsum minerals are in a supersaturated state as a consequence calcium magnesium and sulphate concentration will decrease thermodynamically the water in the springs should have a lower concentration of magnesium and sulphate nevertheless these three ions are more concentrated in the spring than in the cave table 4 there is a mismatch between mass balance and actual condition it confirms the previous analysis that groundwater in the cave southern part does not contribute to the springs in the northern region instead they are in separate entities systems consequently if limestone mining is carried out in the southern area covering the cave area the water resources in the springs are maintained unaffected both in quantity and quality as there is no substantial evidence that they are in the same hydrological system the third is deep groundwater in volcanic formations to the northern spring s8 we also performed mass balance modelling in the northwest area to test our hypothesis that the spring s8 is supplied by deep groundwater d9 the mass balancing for these point are followed 6 1 rainwater to s8 a 1 149 caco3 s 1 149 h2co3 aq 1 149 ca2 aq 2 298 hco3 aq b 2 068 h aq 1 034 camg

that calcium magnesium and sulphate concentration surge due to the dissolution of minerals from limestone formation it provides information that the spring gets the supply from rainwater through the limestone hydrological system yet the spring also gets another source based on the mass balance calculation the results show that deep groundwater d9 is unlikely to recharge the springs through the limestone formation dolomite and gypsum are supersaturated meaning the sulphate and magnesium should decrease in contrast those ions are more concentrated in springs calcite also contributes only 7 there are two possibilities 1 the deep groundwater is not supplying the spring which breaks our hypothesis from isotope and hydrochemical analysis or 2 the deep groundwater recharge the spring but from the volcanic formation 7 conclusions mining activities need to be carried out carefully concerning their impact it will change the landform and might affect other geo aspect such as hydrological aspects which becomes a sensitive issue it can trigger disputation between the mining industry and communities as a water resource is a basic need for the people in order to minimize the impact mine planning is the crucial step as it becomes the first wall to prevent the domino effect a novel approach in mine planning exploration phase is needed to get more precise knowledge of the hydrological system in a mine area particularly in the limestone area which is a complicated system integrating hydrochemical isotopic data and mass balance calculations can help us understand and determine the sources and origins of groundwater in complex geological areas it will give an idea about the linkages of the hydrological system for mine planning understanding and knowing the connections will minimize the mining related impact on water resources and most importantly prevent the disputation and conflict between the communities and mine industry information from hydrochemical isotopic and mass balance analyses are complementary in this research the potential mining area for limestone extraction is located in the southern part it is determined by applying our approach which integrates three methods there are no linkages from the caves that laid in the potential mine area with the springs as they are in a different entity over time and at a particular condition the water should be evolved however the caves and the springs have a similar degree of mineralization hydrochemical facies and isotope values if they are in the same system the water discharge should be very fast and massive from caves to springs they are likely in the different systems as the mass balance modelling shows a mismatch between mass balance and actual condition by looking at the concentration of the primary ion in this research calcium synthesizing the gathered information from hydrochemical isotope and mass balance analysis we can conclude that the southern caves are unrelated to the springs the springs are likely receiving recharged from rainwater and another hydrological system i e a conduit from another system in this matter integrating hydrochemical isotope and mass balance analysis can help us understand the linkage of the complex hydrological system in mine exploration and planning regarding the mining phase these approaches and geophysical and geological methods should be considered in the mine exploration for the applicability this integration is suitable for at least but not limited to limestone areas for mining purposes where we can observe and appraise the

11697,this study aims to determine whether limestone mining does not affect the sustainability of the springs in the vicinity we simulated the linkages between several water sources in the prospective limestone mining area and its surroundings with various geological formations the approach in this study is by integrating hydrochemical analysis isotope data and mass balance calculations to understand the hydrological system s linkages in a geologically complex area particularly in the proposed limestone mining site twenty two samples for hydrochemical and isotopic analysis were taken spatially in each geological formation to represent various water sources springs caves shallow groundwater and deep groundwater hydrochemical analysis indicates that both caves and springs have a low degree of mineralization and mostly simple facies ca hco3 further both have lighter isotope values δ 18o and δ 2h meaning they are relatively younger and have not experienced advanced hydrochemical processes yet the most interesting point is that the mass balance modelling shows the bold information that the southern caves are not related to the springs it is due to the mismatch between the thermodynamic calculation and the actual condition the southern caves are primarily supplied by rainwater where 95 of the ions are evolved due to water rock interaction while the springs receive recharge from rainwater 40 and other systems synthesizing the information we hypothesize that mining the limestone in the southern part consisting of the caves will not disturb the springs as they are unrelated graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrochemistry isotope mass balance modelling limestone mining data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mining activities aim to extract certain minerals to fulfil society s needs mineral extraction can be used as raw materials for industrial production such as aluminium iron lithium and rare earth elements and building materials clay sand rock aggregates and others nevertheless extraction activities need to be carried out carefully concerning their impact on other aspects hydrological aspects both surface water and groundwater interact with various physiographic and climatic landscapes changnon et al 1988 winter 1999 romanelli et al 2014 haaf et al 2020 hare et al 2021 this concept means that if there is a change in physiographic configuration due to mineral extraction it will impact the hydrological system it should be noted that water resources are susceptible and often create and trigger conflicts of interest gleick 1993 kasymov 2011 therefore most of the time there will be a negative perception from the people especially the communities around the mine site that triggers disputation and open conflict between the mining industry and communities hilson 2002 mensah and okyere 2014 engels 2016 persson et al 2017 weiβ et al 2020 consequently many aspects of mining activities need to be taken care of such as legal aspects mine framework and surveillance in the mining cycle from exploration to reclamation reid et al 2009 gorman and dzombak 2018 asr et al 2019 pell et al 2019 if we look further exploration and planning are the most crucial in the mining cycle as this is the first wall to prevent the domino effect in this matter geological features must be well understood from the geological system to the hydrological system so that we can delineate the area that must be protected and allowed to be mined still this is not straightforward to be understood predominantly mining studies use geological and geophysical approaches for exploration sigurdsson and overgaard 1998 pesendorfer and loew 2010 pereira et al 2017 wang et al 2021 most of the cases the hydrochemical approach is only used for knowing the quality of the water during and post mining naja et al 2011 kusimi and kusimi 2012 atanacković et al 2013 favas et al 2016 batsaikhan et al 2017 xia et al 2017 li et al 2018 wang et al 2019 jiang et al 2022 kazemi et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 in this research we try to apply the hydrochemical methods in limestone mining exploration by integrating hydrogeochemical isotopic data analysis and mass balance calculations in determining areas where mining can be carried out concerning the state of the hydrological system particularly in a complex geological area this integration can be used as a recommendation and guide for mine planning exploration phase particularly in analysing the relationship of the hydrological system in the complex geological hydrological system such as limestone area hydrogeochemical analysis is one of the tools used to investigate and evaluate groundwater resources kalhor et al 2019 adimalla et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 chen et al 2021 el yousfi et al 2022 by using this technique information related to the origin and evolution of groundwater hydrochemical processes that occur sources of pollutants or contaminants and the relationship of groundwater in a hydrological system could be ascertained for multi purposes drew and goldscheider 2007 explained that hydrogeological investigations particularly in karst areas using hydrogeochemical methods have several limitations one of which is difficulties in developing an adequate sampling due to the high temporal variability however this problem could be subsided by combining isotopic methods that could be used as a tracer for the origin and movement of the water precisely koeniger et al 2016 jasechko 2019 leketa et al 2019 swetha et al 2020 gopinath et al 2021 jesiya et al 2021 khettoutch et al 2022 mass balance modelling can reconfirm the linkages of the system by knowing the chemical processes reactions poetra et al 2020 the mass balance modelling is based on thermodynamic law ion activity ph and temperature that will tell us the net and limit of the mass transfer due to water rock interaction by knowing how much substance ion has been transferred from the mineral to the water or vice versa mass balance modelling becomes the basis for determining the linkages from two observation points whether they are directly related indirectly related mixed by another point or separate systems for applying our approach we observed pracimantoro and eramoko java indonesia as they are 1 consist of a complex geological and hydrological system limestone clay and volcanic system and 2 have the potential for mineral extraction and quarries limestone and clay pracimantoro has a prominent and potential reserve in limestone wonosari formation extraction of limestone is commonly used for building purposes in the form of large blocks or agriculture industrial and pharmaceutical purposes in the form of small blocks further limestone is a raw material in manufacturing cement for building construction meanwhile the eromoko area is mostly located in the basin area baturetno formation qb which is rich in clay minerals therefore eromoko is also a potential area for extraction activities namely the extraction of clay from the brick pit the use of clay minerals is generally used for manufacturing bricks tiles pottery and natural seals the groundwater in the baturetno basin baturetno formation is stored in clay aquifers while the springs are still unknown they might be from the volcanic formation or limestone of the wonosari formation therewithal springs and groundwater are the primary clean water resources for domestic use by the communities in the observed area therefore it is necessary to have precise techniques in determining the linkages of the water sources in a hydrological system particularly the groundwater system in determining which area needs to be protected and could be extracted hopefully it could avoid conflicts of interest and maintain the sustainability of the water resource both quantity and quality related to the main idea of this research the integration of hydrogeochemical isotope analysis and mass balance calculation is expected to provide insight into the groundwater system in these areas primarily for caves and springs in the limestone area this information would be used as one of the databases in determining the area that can be extracted and the area that needs to be maintained to preserve the quantity and quality of water resources especially the springs in the observation area thus this research aims to provide an analysis of whether there is a relation between the caves and springs in the limestone area by integrating hydrochemical isotopic techniques and mass balance models this research wants to apply these methods for the exploration phase in mining activities that can be applied globally as a consideration in determining the area that needs to be maintained and can be extracted to preserve and sustain the water resource 2 site description 2 1 general description in order to get a correct analysis we must know the geological configuration in the observed area the geological and physiographic maps of the observed area are shown in fig 1 and its geological cross section is displayed in fig 2 the baturetno basin extends from wonogiri batuwarno giriwoyo and eromoko districts in particular the research location focuses on the southwestern part of the baturetno basin namely in the eromoko and pracimantoro districts in this section there are many features of caves and springs in the wonosari formation the communities in this area use springs in the northwest area and groundwater wells as their water resource it is common to find a lot of dug wells shallow groundwater drilled wells deep groundwater and pipes connecting the springs to the communal water storage morphologically the study area is divided into hill topography and the baturetno basin with 21 villages the baturetno basin has a population of 29 890 people with a population density of 514 km2 meanwhile the area with hilly topography limestone area has a population of 22 079 with a population density of 377 km2 the area of baturetno basin is approximately 235 km2 hydrologically the baturetno basin is drained by the bengawan solo river the longest river in java island indonesia the watershed area of the bengawan solo river is roughly 16 000 km2 starting from mt sewu south to the java sea north while the length of this river is around 600 km in the middle of baturetno basin there is an artificial reservoir namely gajah mungkur dam the primary function of this dam is to control flooding in the bengawan solo river the secondary function of this dam is used for agricultural purposes around the reservoir area hydroelectric power plants and recreation areas the climate of the whole baturetno basin is a dry tropical climate based on the recorded data from 2009 to 2019 from the weather station in wonosari city 27 km from the study area the highest average temperature in this area is 32 4 c october while the average lowest is 23 2 c january the annual temperature around this area is 27 7 c with annual precipitation of around 2007 mm year the wet season lasts six months from october to march whereas the dry season lasts from april to september 2 2 geomorphology and geology physiographically van bemmelen 1949 stated that the study area is part of the southern mountains of java island as for regionally pannekoek 1949 stated that the study area is part of the southern plateau of java island geological formations located around the study area are mandalika formation tomm semilir formation tms wuni formation tmw nampol formation tmn wonosari formation tmwl and baturetno formation qb specifically the study area is mostly laid in two geological formations namely wonosari formation tmwl and baturetno formation qb fig 1 the southern part of the study area is included in the hills of mt sewu which resulted from the uplift that began in the late pleiocene in this region it consists of layered limestone that can be found in the northern north eastern part and reef limestone in the southern part both of which are neogene limestones van bemmelen 1949 balazs 1968 waltham et al 1983 surono et al 2008 rahadjo et al al 1995 further this area is called as wonosari formation tmwl composed of layered limestone reef limestone sandstone and tuff fig 2 genetically this formation was deposited in shallow marine environments in the neritic zone during the middle miocene to pliocene its total thickness was estimated at more than 650 m the bedrock of the wonosari formation is composed of miocene clastic volcanic rock from wuni formation agglomerates with tuffaceous sandstone and coarse sandstone sambipitu formation sandstone and claystone semilir formation tuff pumice breccia sandstone tuff and claystone nglanggran formation volcanic rocks agglomerates tuffs and andesitic basaltic lava and nampol formation conglomerates sandstones agglomerates shale claystone and tuff the northern part of the observed area is part of the baturetno basin this basin separates the mt sewu area from the plopoh hills complex which is part of the gajah mungkur ancient volcano during its formation the baturetno basin was a lake as a paleolake during the holocene so the typical deposition of lake material could be found in this area namely black clay this formation is called as baturetno formation further the baturetno formation is composed of clay mud silt sand pebble and gravel the depositional process of the baturetno formation was related to the tectonic uplift in southern java in late pliocene lehmann 1936 van bemmelen 1949 lehmann 1936 concluded that baturetno basin used to be a lake paleolake due to the representation of black clay and the tilting process in the late pliocene that changed the main river direction in this area namely the bengawan solo river the tilting process which was caused by the tectonic uplift in late pliocene formed into a lake quaternary and dried up into the basin in the present nevertheless putra and yulianto 2015 argue that there was no shifting course of the bengawan solo river due to tectonic activities it means that the baturetno basin is not a paleolake mudflow alluvial fan processes deposited the clay layer in this area the gravels associated with mud flow deposits that could be found might be associated with alluvial fan origin as explained by blissenbach 1954 and bull 1977 the presence of the alluvial plain bajada in this area and lineaments north south could be found in this area putra and yulianto 2015 3 materials and methods tracer test was conducted and twenty two wells in the observation area were measured to acquire the hydraulic head data this dataset generated a hydroisophyses map in the observed area fig 3 that shows the direction of groundwater movement for sampling and further analysis concerning the issue by goldscheider 2007 about the difficulties in developing adequate sampling in the karst landscape we sampled in the dry season when the water discharge reached the lowest peak the diffuse slow flow became the main process during this time further it also minimizes dilution during the wet season due to high precipitation in the tropical regime therefore sampling in the dry season is the most suitable representation of the water condition to observe the mechanism of water rock interaction the artificial tracer test reveals no connection between the injection points inside the proposed limestone mining area c19 and c22 to the springs in baturetno basin a tracer injection from d5 drilled well was also not detected in the study area some springs in the basin are proved to be recharged by the underground water caves from the western part of the study area including golek cave c7 to pule and sawahan springs celeng cave c15 to sawahan spring and njlumbang cave to sambiroto spring s3 the samples were taken from various water sources springs caves shallow groundwater from dug wells and deep groundwater from drilled wells the sampling sites are displayed in fig 3 the sampling procedures referred to the regulation that has been explained by nielsen and nielsen 2006 the samples from wells were pumped before being taken until the psychochemical parameters stabilized to get the in situ groundwater conditions the physicochemical parameters namely ph electrical conductivity ec temperature and total dissolved solids tds were measured directly on the field using a portable water checker hi 98130 hanna usa the samples were stored in a clean sterilized polyethylene bottle at a constant temperature of 4 c in the cooling box moreover the water samples for the cation analysis were acidified to a ph 2 by ultrapure nitric acid hno3 all water samples were directly placed and tested in the laboratory laboratory testing for chemical constituents was conducted in the centre for environmental health engineering and disease control bbtklpp

volumetric method chloride cl with titration method using agno3 iron fe tot using atomic absorption spectroscopy aas method silicon si4 using inductively coupled plasma icp method meanwhile calcium ca2 and bicarbonate hco3 were tested in situ to get the appropriate result using the edta field titration method 1 11110 0001 and 1 11109 0001 merck darmstadt germany all chemical testing followed the procedures and regulations that determined the apha et al 2012 and the indonesian national standard sni 2009 procedures the chemical constituent of the sampled waters then calculated with the value of charge balance error cbe is as follows 1 e σ m c σ m a σ m c σ m a x 100 where e is the rate of equilibrium deviation mc is the total of the cation content meq liter and ma is the total of the anion meq liter the cbe was calculated to check the accuracy deviation with no more than 5 10 hiscock and bense 2014 the isotopic analyses were conducted at the isotope and radiation application centre testing laboratory national nuclear energy agency batan oxygen 18 18o and deuterium 2h were measured on a mass spectrometer with a precision of the instrument 1 0 and 1 respectively the δ values are expressed conventionally as 2 δ r s a m p l e r s m o w r s m o w x 1000 where rsample is the mass ratio of the stable isotope while the rsmow is the value of the standard mean ocean water the standard values in this research were using the international standard vienna standard mean ocean water v smow clark and fritz 1997 the result of hydrochemical testing and isotopic analysis is shown in table 1 the hydrochemical data were analysed using general statistical tools and diagrams to acquire further information hydrogeochemical facies was determined by referring kurlov method and the durov diagram this diagram provides information on the agglomeration of hydrogeochemical attributes and the initial guess of hydrogeochemical processes that work in the observed area saturation indices and hydrogeochemical mass balance modelling were calculated numerically using the phreeqc program parkhurst and appelo 1999 the calculation of inverse modelling aims to understand the mechanism that works in the system particularly chemical reactions resulting from water rock interaction processes plummer et al 1983 alpers and nordstrom 1997 adji and widyastuti 2005 kresic 2006 poetra et al 2020 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemical results first the hydrogeochemical result becomes the initial indicator for determining the sources and origins of the water total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec are quick and easy but also essential indicators by knowing these parameters we can see the degree of mineralization in the water moreover hydrochemical data will provide us with deeper information such as its facies and a hint about what kind of processes happened in each distinct attribute landform geological formation etc this information is important to know the linkages of the water in the observed area the value of tds in the study area is around 250 1300 ppm while the ec values are from 250 to 1800 μs cm specifically the average tds values for deep groundwater shallow groundwater springs and caves are 411 ppm 690 ppm 437 5 ppm and 253 5 ppm respectively in terms of ec the mean values for deep groundwater shallow groundwater springs and underground water caves are 578 μs cm 968 μs cm 622 μs cm and 505 μs cm respectively these data indicate that underground water caves does not undergo complex hydrogeochemical or evolutionary processes in short underground water caves is relatively young and role as a temporary storage after the precipitation on the other hand shallow groundwater in the baturetno basin has a relatively high mineralization value tds compared to other types of groundwater in contrast to the underground water caves the shallow groundwater may have undergone a more complex process this argument is in line with the gibbs diagram in fig 4 where evaporation also affects the shallow groundwater s hydrochemical processes on the other hand underground water cave is more straightforward relatively fresh and young and the precipitation slightly influences the system based on the classification of rhoades et al 1992 groundwaters in the deep layer drilled well caves and springs are classified as freshwater on the other hand the shallow groundwaters are mostly slightly saline with the most considerable value at w12 1865 μs cm considering the climate condition in the observed area evaporation affects the hydrochemical condition of the shallow groundwater the process will evaporate the water molecules and saturates the groundwater an interesting additional finding from this part is that the relationship between ec and tds values is positive as suggested by hem 1985 and hubert and wolkersdorfer 2015 the conversion constant of the tds value from the ec is 0 72 tds 0 72 ec spatially groundwater in the baturetno basin area baturetno clay formation has relatively greater ec and tds values than groundwater in the wonosari limestone formation the facies of the groundwater in this research are determined based on the content of dissolved cations and anions using a combination of the durov diagram fig 5 and the kurlov method table 2 ca hco3 n 15 is common facies found in the study area followed by mg ca hco3 n 5 na k mg ca hco3 n 1 and na k ca hco3 cl n 1 the groundwater facies of the caves and springs are mostly ca hco3 and mg ca hco3 facies furthermore the facies of shallow groundwater and deep groundwater are quite varied shallow and deep groundwater in the wonosari formation has the same facies as underground water caves and springs namely ca hco3 and mg ca hco3 it indicates that the carbonate minerals from limestone formation may influence them on the other hand the facies of groundwater in the baturetno basin are more complicated deep groundwater d11 and shallow groundwater w12 in the eastern basin area have a significant surge in alkaline concentrations especially in sodium suppose we overlay this information with the stratigraphy data in that case the deep groundwater for d11 is stored in volcanic formation and clay formation figs 1 and 2 contradictorily the deep groundwater d9 and shallow groundwater w10 in the northwest basin part have different facies which are calcium bicarbonate and low in alkaline here it seems that there are facies clustering for the deep and shallow groundwater in the basin area related to the limestone effect by looking at its facies the deep and shallow groundwater in the east south basin is not influenced by limestone in the southern part it is shown by the closest spring s1 having different facies low in alkaline and mostly calcium bicarbonate meanwhile deep and shallow groundwater have lower mineralization degrees than the closest spring s8 nevertheless we can conclude that deep groundwater strongly links with shallow groundwater furthermore from the hydrogeochemical analysis we get several key information first the northwest spring s8 has distinct facies compared to other springs where magnesium dominates the ions if we overlay this information with the geological formation s8 combines volcanic and clay formations it is relevant where the major cations particularly sodium calcium magnesium and dissolved silica are also high s8 is influenced by the water rock interaction by volcanic rocks that contain olivine from lava and basalt as the source of magnesium and silica and albite as the source of sodium and silica this spring s8 does not influence the groundwater in the surroundings as they have different facies d9 and w10 second even though the most common facies for underground water caves are calcium bicarbonate we can divide the caves into two groups by looking at their physicochemical indicator the northwest caves c7 and c15 have a 2 fold higher value of tds and ec than the southern caves c19 and c22 it means the southern caves have a small mineralization degree tds around 250 ppm and ec just around 380 μs cm they are unlikely to have a similar system and recharge point different entity moreover the degree of mineralization in the southern caves is relatively low it indicates that the residence time of the water in this area is pretty quick from the recharge in contrast to the southern caves the northwest caves are likely to have a more complex hydrological system therefore the cave in the south is not correlated to the caves or springs in the northwest in general the caves and springs also have a similar degree of mineralization and facies it might be that they are not correlated with each other third we tentatively could find that the underground water in the southern area is a distinct entity from other water resources west east and basin part suppose this area becomes the mine area for mineral extraction limestone in that case it is unlikely to disturb the other water resources particularly baturetno basin and the north west area where the urban area is located however this is too premature to be a conclusion therefore we need isotope data and mass balance modelling to reaffirm these initial results 4 1 1 isotopic results the δ18o of the groundwater in the observed area range from 5 to 8 while the δ2h range from 31 to 51 specifically the average values of δ18o in deep groundwater shallow groundwater springs and caves are 6 58 5 97 6 22 and 7 63 respectively the average values of δ2h in deep groundwater shallow groundwater springs and caves are 40 25 35 72 40 37 and 48 35 respectively both values indicate the characteristic of groundwater recharge in this area originating from precipitation in tropical climate regimes mcguire and mcdonnell 2007 the plotted data in fig 6 shows the relationship between the elevation against isotope data the goodness of fit r2 value for oxygen is 0 57 and for deuterium is 0 74 in this matter they are quite dispersed generally their relationship is positive but relatively moderate siegenthaler s 1979 research explained that heavy isotopes would preferentially form as a liquid and a solid phase on the other hand the lighter isotope has a robust composition in the gaseous liquid form the essential information from the sampled data is the depletion of the isotope from lower to higher altitudes in this matter the precipitation comes from the northern part mt merapi for the basin area and the southern part indian ocean for the limestone karst area fig 7 shows the plot of δ18o and δ2h values based on water types the meteoric line refers to the global meteoric water line from craig 1961 namely δ2h 8 δ18o d where d namely the y intercept with slope 8 following the explanation of dansgaard 1964 based on fig 7 the underground water caves is relatively lighter than other types of groundwater while shallow groundwater has a relatively heavier isotope value regarding altitude fig 3 the caves have the highest altitude combining these two data it makes sense that the groundwaters in the caves have the lightest isotope value in line with the theory of elevation effects on isotope conditions clark and fritz 1997 mcguire et al 2005 on the other hand the shallow groundwaters have the heaviest isotope values even compared to the deep groundwaters with the deepest altitude it becomes interesting fact that it might be due to two possibilities 1 evaporation works intensively and affects shallow groundwater and or 2 the shallow groundwater gets recharged from deep groundwater inverted process there is some essential information from the isotope data related to the aim of this research first the groundwater in the caves does not experience an advanced geochemical process it is reflected in the isotope data and the hydrochemical analysis uncomplicated type and low degree of mineralization second shallow groundwaters have the heaviest isotope data theoretically the deep groundwater should have the heaviest due to the depletion of gaseous form and intense process within water rock interaction the evaporation process in the shallow groundwater might be responsible for this condition figs 4 and 5 however there is also an eloquent example to support the argument that deep groundwater in the northwest recharges the shallow groundwater and spring it is reflected in the hydrochemical analysis from the previous section and fig 7 from s8 spring d9 deep groundwater and w10 shallow groundwater that they are all located in the same cluster by knowing the regional geological information and geological map we have to consider a lineament due to the fault across the observed area recalling that d9 is artesian groundwater it is likely that s8 spring and d9 artesian groundwater are controlled by the fault and pressure from the geological system in the northwest area with the source from the baturetno formation not the limestone area in the west and south area if we combine it with hydrochemical analysis from the previous section deep groundwater d9 has a simple hydrogeochemistry type and low degree of mineralization ca hco3 and tds 447 mg l compared to spring mg ca hco3 and 450 mg l and shallow groundwater ca hco3 and 645 mg l the evolution of deep water into as a spring is mainly because of water rock interaction i e calcite and dolomite as the spring is also influenced by wonosari limestone formation third interpretation of the isotope results in the study area reveals that underground water caves is thought to have exchanged process with carbon dioxide co2 the plot s direction denotes it is relative to the right lighter of the meteoric water line furthermore if this groundwater goes to the springs it can be seen that the water rock interactions were involved as shown that the plot tends to the right side as a consequence the value of oxygen 18 in the springs was relatively heavier these events were typical characteristics of the limestone area due to the water rock interaction process fourth the springs generally have heavier isotope values in limestone areas compared to the caves it means that caves might contribute and flow into the surface as a spring however they have a similar degree of mineralization and constituent particularly for southern caves and springs in the limestone formation it requires a short time and fast flow in a conduit system therefore it is unlikely they are in the one hydrological system and the water needs an advanced process infiltrate as a spring not as fast as caves 4 1 2 mass balance modelling mass balance modelling is fundamental for integrating the two previous approaches hydrogeochemical analysis and isotope data from the last section we have gathered some information 1 the southern caves c19 and c122 are distinct from other groundwater particularly in the basin area in this matter they do not have any linkage to other groundwater resources in the basin area springs as well as shallow and deep groundwater 2 the groundwaters in the northwest are influenced by their typical geological structure and formation particularly the fault system and combination of limestone volcanic formation distinct entity yet this argument should be strengthened by the mass balance modelling to know how much the mass transfer is due to water rock interaction regarding the gibbs plot fig 4 the evolution of the groundwater is mainly due to rock dominance except for shallow groundwater which is also influenced by evaporation in this case mass balance modelling is the appropriate approach moreover recall from the previous argument the cave s water could flow into as a spring or groundwater recharge therefore the mass balance modelling in this research will construct whether the mass transfer is rational and possible limestone wonosari formation in the observed area is dominated by carbonate minerals i e calcite and dolomite mixtures the dissolution reaction of calcite and dolomite is expressed as follows 5 dissolution of calcite 3 caco3 s h2co3 aq ca2 aq 2 hco3 aq or caco3 s h aq ca2 aq hco3 aq 5 1 dissolution of dolomite 4 2h aq camg co3 2 s ca2 aq mg2 aq 2 hco3 aq 5 1 1 dissolution of gypsum 5 caso4 2h2o s ca2 aq so4 2 aq 2h2o l we simulate the mass balance to calculate the mass transfer from minerals to the solution calcite dolomite and gypsum are selected as they are the dominant minerals in the wonogiri limestone area we used calcium as the proxy as this ion is mainly involved in the dissolution or precipitation of the observed minerals table 3 presents the result of the mass balance modelling the observation changes mean the actual difference in the concentration between two observation points meanwhile the percentage contribution implies the contribution of mass transfer from selected minerals compared to the actual net concentration we selected some points of observation for this section 1 rainwater is the main recharge for water resources initial point 2 c19 cave from the southern part is the point to represent the area of potential limestone mining from the previous section 3 s6 and s3 massive springs in the western part were observed to know whether there is a linkage between springs in the region of the west with the southern cave 4 d8 deep groundwater and s8 spring were observed to know whether they are influenced by limestone or a more complex process the first observation is the groundwater in the southern cave represented by c19 from hydrochemical and isotope analysis southern caves have a low degree of mineralization simple facies and lighter isotopes it implies that they are supplied purely by precipitation rainwater in order to reinforce this argument we performed the mass balance modelling from rainwater to the caves c19 if other hydrological systems do not supply southern caves except rainwater the water rock interaction process by the rainwater and minerals will primarily contribute to the evolution of groundwater in the caves dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum from rain water to southern cave c19 as follow a 1 687 caco3 s 1 687 h2co3 aq 1 687 ca2 aq 3 374 hco3 aq b 1 234 h aq 0 617 camg co3 2 s 0 617 ca2 aq 0 617 mg2 aq 1 234 hco3 aq c 0 054 caso4 2h2o s 0 054 ca2 aq 0 054 so4 2 aq 0 108 h2o l the mass balance calculation shows that the evolution of calcium as the proxy from rainwater to caves c19 is due to water rock interaction between rainwater and minerals in the limestone area 95 it is primarily due to calcite dissolution 68 99 followed by dolomite 25 21 and gypsum 2 20 the ratio between mass balance modelling and actual changes in the calcium from rainwater to the caves c19 is pretty significant and high just under 100 5 lower due to uncertainties it means that the hypothesis from hydrological and isotope analysis from the previous is correct where rainwater is the prime source of the caves second at this point the southern caves are the first entry of the rainwater as a recharge if we want to mine this area for limestone mining then we have to know if there is any continuity from the southern caves to the springs in the northern part i e s6 and s3 which are laid in the same geological formation we simulate two scenarios from the rainwater to the springs s6 and s3 and from the caves c19 to the springs s6 and s3 the reaction based on the mass balance modelling for these points are followed 5 1 2 rainwater to spring s6 a caco3 s 2 477 h2co3 aq 2 477 ca2 aq 4

0 010 ca2 aq 0 010 so4 2 aq 0 020 h2o l the interaction between rainwater and minerals in the limestone area calcite dolomite and gypsum accounts for about 50 of the total ions in the springs it means that other water sources are coming to springs furthermore the question is whether the cave in the south supplies these springs the results of mass balance modelling show that mass transfer from caves c19 to springs s6 and s3 does not fit the actual observations calcite is still undersaturated and dissolves contributing to the surging of the calcium concentration on the other hand dolomite and gypsum minerals are in a supersaturated state as a consequence calcium magnesium and sulphate concentration will decrease thermodynamically the water in the springs should have a lower concentration of magnesium and sulphate nevertheless these three ions are more concentrated in the spring than in the cave table 4 there is a mismatch between mass balance and actual condition it confirms the previous analysis that groundwater in the cave southern part does not contribute to the springs in the northern region instead they are in separate entities systems consequently if limestone mining is carried out in the southern area covering the cave area the water resources in the springs are maintained unaffected both in quantity and quality as there is no substantial evidence that they are in the same hydrological system the third is deep groundwater in volcanic formations to the northern spring s8 we also performed mass balance modelling in the northwest area to test our hypothesis that the spring s8 is supplied by deep groundwater d9 the mass balancing for these point are followed 6 1 rainwater to s8 a 1 149 caco3 s 1 149 h2co3 aq 1 149 ca2 aq 2 298 hco3 aq b 2 068 h aq 1 034 camg

that calcium magnesium and sulphate concentration surge due to the dissolution of minerals from limestone formation it provides information that the spring gets the supply from rainwater through the limestone hydrological system yet the spring also gets another source based on the mass balance calculation the results show that deep groundwater d9 is unlikely to recharge the springs through the limestone formation dolomite and gypsum are supersaturated meaning the sulphate and magnesium should decrease in contrast those ions are more concentrated in springs calcite also contributes only 7 there are two possibilities 1 the deep groundwater is not supplying the spring which breaks our hypothesis from isotope and hydrochemical analysis or 2 the deep groundwater recharge the spring but from the volcanic formation 7 conclusions mining activities need to be carried out carefully concerning their impact it will change the landform and might affect other geo aspect such as hydrological aspects which becomes a sensitive issue it can trigger disputation between the mining industry and communities as a water resource is a basic need for the people in order to minimize the impact mine planning is the crucial step as it becomes the first wall to prevent the domino effect a novel approach in mine planning exploration phase is needed to get more precise knowledge of the hydrological system in a mine area particularly in the limestone area which is a complicated system integrating hydrochemical isotopic data and mass balance calculations can help us understand and determine the sources and origins of groundwater in complex geological areas it will give an idea about the linkages of the hydrological system for mine planning understanding and knowing the connections will minimize the mining related impact on water resources and most importantly prevent the disputation and conflict between the communities and mine industry information from hydrochemical isotopic and mass balance analyses are complementary in this research the potential mining area for limestone extraction is located in the southern part it is determined by applying our approach which integrates three methods there are no linkages from the caves that laid in the potential mine area with the springs as they are in a different entity over time and at a particular condition the water should be evolved however the caves and the springs have a similar degree of mineralization hydrochemical facies and isotope values if they are in the same system the water discharge should be very fast and massive from caves to springs they are likely in the different systems as the mass balance modelling shows a mismatch between mass balance and actual condition by looking at the concentration of the primary ion in this research calcium synthesizing the gathered information from hydrochemical isotope and mass balance analysis we can conclude that the southern caves are unrelated to the springs the springs are likely receiving recharged from rainwater and another hydrological system i e a conduit from another system in this matter integrating hydrochemical isotope and mass balance analysis can help us understand the linkage of the complex hydrological system in mine exploration and planning regarding the mining phase these approaches and geophysical and geological methods should be considered in the mine exploration for the applicability this integration is suitable for at least but not limited to limestone areas for mining purposes where we can observe and appraise the

cardiovascular disease hyperkeratosis diabetes mellitus pigmentation changes alzheimer s as well as renal liver respiratory and neurological issues ghosh et al 2020a also unwanted iron consumption is linked to weariness weight loss joint pain cognitive difficulties and effects on the sex organs and may eventually impact the liver and heart induce pancreatic damage and result in diabetes australian academy of science 2019 researchers have conducted many investigations to uncover concrete proof of iron contamination in bangladesh s groundwater a study by tasneem et al 2020 found an iron concentration level of 0 175 13 865 mg l in the singair upazila of manikganj district which showed a high level of iron contamination in the groundwater of bangladesh another noteworthy study by ghosh et al 2020b calculated the iron concentration level at 0 02 6 2 mg l in several places in the jashore district a national level survey by the british geological survey 2001 found the highest concentration level of iron 6 44 mg l in ward no 3 of kushtia pourashava another national level survey found that 60 of samples met the bangladesh standard of 1 0 mg l for drinking water sources primarily groundwater n 2896 with contamination being higher in shallow tube wells 150 m in the same survey the maximum level of iron contamination 8 6 mg l in bangladesh was found in the kushtia district unicef 2009 the standard and considerable level of iron in the groundwater of bangladesh range from 0 30 to 1 00 mg l whereas the who standard level is 0 3 mg l dphe 2019 in order to eliminate iron from groundwater a common method involves either aerating the water or subjecting it to chemical oxidation and then swiftly filtering it through sand sharma et al 2005 despite its evident harmful effects on people industry and agriculture very limited research is currently available on iron contamination in bangladesh s groundwater suggests a lack of attention devoted to this issue previous research has mainly focused on technological solutions for removing iron from groundwater while a more spatially focused approach could be more convenient cost effective and sustainable for a developing country like bangladesh an integrated analysis technique utilizing a logical sample size can provide a better representation of the geographic distribution of iron its health effects and help identify suitable depths in the water table the main goal of this study was to determine the quantity of iron content in groundwater and zones with iron contaminated hotspots and cold spot groundwater in kushtia sadar upazila using the hazard quotient hq this study also sought to assess the probable risks to human health additionally two significant goals of this study were to examine the relationship between iron concentration level and well depth and to search for a potentially suitable depth in the groundwater table for considerable iron concentration in drinking water this study has the potential to serve as an approach to remediate and manage iron contaminated water while also aiding in public health protection and informing evidence based policy making in a scientific and cost effective manner additionally the findings of this study can serve as a reference for future geographic investigations into groundwater contamination 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling samples were collected from kushtia sadar upazila kushtia district bangladesh which is between 23 42 and 23 59 north latitudes and between 88 55 and 89 04 east longitudes the study area which is 318 22 sq km in size and one of bangladesh s most heavily populated regions with a population density of 1578 people per sq km bbs 2011 has experienced urbanization industrialization landfilling agricultural operations and so forth 100 predefined systematic sampling points were selected by fishnet in arcgis 10 4 1 the samples were physically collected in 100 ml plastic bottles with two capping protections and additional strong surgical tape to restrict sample contamination and then carefully transported to the lab to be tested for iron levels before the sample collection all the bottles were rinsed with distilled water also depth information on the groundwater sources was collected through personal interviews with the owners of the corresponding sources 2 2 sample analyzing the locations of the water sample points were measured using a digital global positioning system gps tool the samples iron concentrations were measured using a digital hanna hi 721 iron checker handheld colorimeter range 0 00 5 00 mg l and hanna hi 721 reagents all samples were examined 2 4 h after they were collected typical safety measures and protocols were followed when analyzing the sample 2 3 statistical analysis descriptive statistical analysis graphs and charts were produced using microsoft excel and past 4 03 the statistical package for social sciences spss usa version 26 0 was applied to perform a correlation study in order to look into the relationship between the concentration level and the depth of the sample water s source the correlation study was essential for finding a suitable depth in the water table a p value of 0 05 or lower was accepted as statistically significant for the two sided test the linear conversions of either variable have no influence on the non dimensional pearson correlation coefficient lee rodgers and alan nice wander 1988 the correlation coefficient can be determined using the formula asuero et al 2006 for two variables as follows 1 r x x y y x x 2 y y 2 the r coefficient s value is always between 1 and 1 the linear relation between two variables is stronger when the r coefficient s value is close to 1 taylor 1990 2 4 spatial autocorrelation spatial autocorrelation measures whether the distribution of iron is dispersed clustered or randomly distributed in the study area by taking the entire data set and producing a single output value using moran s i index prasannakumar et al 2011 moran s i use feature locations and attribute values to calculate the spatial autocorrelation scott and janikas 2010 the output value of moran s i index ranges from 1 to 1 moran s i values close to 1 indicate a distributed concentration while i close to 1 indicate a clustered concentration and a randomly distributed concentration when the i value is zero khosravi et al 2018 and the p value p 0 01 means the test is statistically significant the fundamental form is used to calculate moran s statistic based on the weight matrix by lee and wong 2001 as follows 2 i n w i j x i x x j x w x i x 2 where xi the interval variable s value in areal units i wij spatial weight between i and j the output figs 1 and 2 of the spatial autocorrelation of the iron dataset was obtained from the study area 2 5 incremental autocorrelation incremental autocorrelation determines the strength of spatial clustering by calculating the z score value at multiple distances for a single data set and the statistically significant peak z score shows the distance at which the spatial process that promotes clustering is most evident jossart et al 2020 parvin et al 2021 by considering the beginning distance as 5023 m and the increment distance as 1338 m the peak z score was found at a distance of 10378 m fig 3 which was used as the distance band while analyzing the hotspot 2 6 hotspot analysis hotspot analysis is a type of spatial analysis and mapping technique that focuses on identifying clusters of spatial phenomena using the getis ord gi statistic this statistic calculates the degree of suggestion that results from the concentration of weighted points getis and ord 2010 and identifies statistically significant hotspots and cold spots high value data points that cluster more strongly when there are positive z values reflect hot spots if z values are negative cold areas with low values will appear in clustered data aslam et al 2021 and values close to zero point to a random distribution of clusters with significance singh et al 2021 the getis ord local statistic by getis et al 2004 is given as 3 g i j 1 n w i j x j x j 1 n w i j s n j 1 n w i j 2 j 1 n w i j 2 n 1 where n is the number of features xj is the attribute value for feature j wi j is the spatial weights between the feature i and j and s is the standard deviation of all features 2 7 spatial interpolation in order to identify the continuous data of the studied area based on the actual results the spatial interpolation method was chosen to anticipate the unsampled areas cell values are determined via inverse distance weighing idw utilizing a linearly weighted combination set of sample points shekhar and xiong 2008 idw was applied using arcgis to forecast the location s concentration in order to display spatial distribution and conduct hotspot analysis 2 8 health risk assessment 2 8 1 chronic daily intake cdi in this study only the non carcinogenic health risk of oral ingestion was assessed mostly direct ingestion happens through oral ingestion which is the main route of contaminants toxicity to humans ni et al 2011 the cdi value of iron was calculated using the following equation muhammad et al 2011 boateng et al 2015 4 c d i c d i b w where c is the fe concentration in water mg l and di and bw represent the average daily intake and body weight for adults and children respectively according to asante duah 2002 the average daily intake of water is 2 and 1 l day and the body weight is 70 and 15 kg for adults and children 2 8 2 hazard quotient hq the hq for non carcinogenic risk can be calculated by the following equation usepa 2001 qasemi et al 2018 shams et al 2022 5 h q c d i r f d where cdi is the chronic daily dose of fe mg l and rfd is the reference dose the daily dosage that permits people to endure this amount of exposure for an extended length of time without encountering any negative effects the rfd value for iron is 0 7 mg kg day harmanescu et al 2011 usepa 2015 for calculating hq when the hq value is less than 1 hq 1 the exposed population is supposed to be safe muhammad et al 2010 yousefi et al 2018 2 9 suitability analysis a suitability analysis was performed by arcgis pro version 2 8 to analyze the potentially suitable depth in the groundwater table according to various weighted criteria suitability analysis ranks and rates sites and displays the final score in order from most to least suitable esri 2021 for suitable depth analysis concentration and depth data were used here in this analysis the suitability modeler was used to transform raster files of the depth and concentration level into a suitability value pixel value because of the negative linear relationship between depth and concentration level parameters they were set according to the rules low concentration levels and high depth values are the more suitable 3 results and discussions 3 1 summary statistics of iron and depth the minimum maximum and mean values for iron concentration levels are observed at 0 01 5 and 1 53 mg l respectively whereas the minimum maximum and mean depths of the water sample sources are 18 2 128 and 41 72 m 75 of the total iron concentration value falls at a depth of 45 m table 1 shows three scale categories for discussing the spatial distribution of iron safe areas who and bangladesh standards moderately contaminated areas and highly contaminated areas 3 2 spatial distribution the spatial distribution map of iron in fig 4 a depicts the results of groundwater samples collected from various locations in kushtia sadar upazila the result reveals that 77 of the total samples of groundwater exceed the who standard level and 80 exceed the bangladesh standard level which indicates that only 43 of the samples followed the who and bangladesh standards and the rest 57 of the total samples exceed both the who and bangladesh standards almost two thirds of the total area is found to be covered from the moderately contaminated area 1 01 2 mg l to the highly contaminated area 2 01 5 mg l as shown in fig 4 b only one third of the total area is considered safe 0 01 1 mg l the highly contaminated areas are found in paurashava mazampur barkhada and some parts of jagati and hatas haripur the highest concentration level 5 mg l is recorded in kushtia paurashava almost iron contamination free areas are found in ujangram manohardia gosind durgapur hariarayanpur and paitkabari 3 3 hotspot analysis in fig 5 the red and blue colors represent significant hotspot and cold spot locations respectively potential health risks are higher in hotspot areas than in coldspot areas the locations that are highly contaminated and almost risk free are shown separately by the hotspots and cold spots with 90 95 confidence levels barkhada hatas haripur kushtia paurashava and mazampur unions are assessed to be the majority of the hotspots in the northern part of kushtia sadar on the contrary considering similar confidence levels almost all the cold spots are in the southern part covered by the manohardia gosind durgapur jhaudia abdulpur and paitkabari unions the unions situated in the middle part of the kushtia sadar like ailchara alampur and ujangram are found to be not confident areas identified and predicted hotspots and cold spots are shown in fig 5 a and 5 b 3 4 health risk assessment 3 4 1 chronic daily intake cdi the chronic daily intake cdi of the 15 unions in kushtia sadar upazila is presented in table 2 both adults and children were taken into consideration while estimating the cdi the cdi values for adults range from 0 116 to 0 640 mg kg day on the other hand the cdi values for children are 0 272 1 47 mg kg day for both adults and children the lowest value is found in gosind durgapur and ujangram union while the highest value is found in paurashava 3 4 2 non carcinogenic health risk the results of the non carcinogenic risk assessment through calculating the hazard quotient are presented in table 3 according to the findings the hq values for ingestion of iron containing drinking water in adults and children are in the ranges of 0 16 0 92 and 39 2 13 respectively when the hq value is greater than 1 harmful health effects are typically detected however when the hq value is less than 1 it is considered safe in alampur jagati barkhada and paurashava the hq values for children 30 are above the safety range indicating that groundwater iron may have significant health effects on these age groups adults however don t have any significant negative health consequences consequently the order of human exposure to iron through ingestion is as follows children adults 3 5 relationship with depth and concentration level a correlation analysis was carried out to determine the strength of the linear relationship between the depth of the water sources and the concentration level the pearson correlation coefficient r 98 0 570 p 0 000 shows a strong negative linear relationship between depth and concentration level which means increasing the depth will reduce iron concentration the relationship is presented via a scatter diagram in fig 6 the greater the linear relationship between two variables the closer the points on a scatter plot are to a straight line bewick et al 2003 3 6 potential suitable depth from fig 7 the locations with a suitability score of 15 or more are taken as the most suitable locations in the study area and the depth values of those locations are also considered the most suitable the most suitable locations are green and the least suitable locations are red table 4 lists some of the best locations based on their suitability score the suitability map indicates that depth ranges of 66 128 m were the most suitable in this range of depth in the water table the concentration of iron varied from 0 01 to 0 21 mg l which follows the standard level of both the who and bangladesh so the depth from 66 to 128 m is the potentially suitable depth in the water table in kushtia sadar upazila for considerable iron concentrated groundwater 4 conclusion and recommendations kushtia sadar upazila can be designated as one of the most iron contaminated areas in bangladesh among 100 samples n 100 only 43 samples n 43 followed who and bangladesh standards whereas 77 samples n 77 exceeded the who standard and 80 samples n 80 exceeded the bangladesh standard the spatial distribution of these data shows two thirds of the area studied had moderate 1 01 2 mg l to high 2 01 5 mg l contamination levels the whole northern part of the study is found to be a contamination hotspot which is quite alarming for the people living there the health risk assessment result shows children hq 0 39 2 13 are more susceptive than adults hq 0 16 0 92 and face serious health issues depth is found as a limiting hypothetical factor of iron concentrations as depth increases iron concentrations decrease the calculated hazard quotient value through the depth range of 66 128 m is found to be potentially suitable but the analysis shows only 15 of the sample tube wells were in this range however many natural and anthropogenic factors are responsible for extreme iron concentration in groundwater which was not listed in this study also the study of seasonal and spatiotemporal variations of iron contamination was overlooked a comprehensive evaluation of health risks associated with excessive iron ingestion with proper demographic evidence can clarify the potential vulnerability which is not undertaken here therefore this study recommends further integrated research for analyzing natural and anthropogenic factors of iron scientifically seasonal and temporal variations spatially and health risks with proper demographic evidence that can provide a better understanding of iron contamination in groundwater funding this research did not receive any

correlation statistics hazard quotient evaluation and suitability analysis were used in this study the results reveal that 77 of the groundwater samples exceeded the who standard and 80 exceeded the bangladesh standard and only 43 met both standards about two thirds of the area studied found moderate 1 01 2 mg l to high 2 01 5 mg l contamination levels the hotspot analysis depicts that the majority of the hotspots are in the northern part and almost all the cold spots are in the southern part the hazard quotient value shows that the non carcinogenic health risks due to ingestion of iron in adults were 0 16 0 92 and in children were 0 39 2 13 and thus indicating the high health consequences for the children the result of the pearson correlation coefficient r 98 0 570 p 0 000 stated that there is a strong negative linear relationship between tube well depth and iron concentration level the suitability analysis found that the ideal depth for dealing with iron contamination was found to be between 66 and 128 m based on the linear relationship graphical abstract image 1 keywords iron contamination hotspot analysis geostatistics hazard quotient suitable depth analysis non

considered safe in alampur jagati barkhada and paurashava the hq values for children 30 are above the safety range indicating that groundwater iron may have significant health effects on these age groups adults however don t have any significant negative health consequences consequently the order of human exposure to iron through ingestion is as follows children adults 3 5 relationship with depth and concentration level a correlation analysis was carried out to determine the strength of the linear relationship between the depth of the water sources and the concentration level the pearson correlation coefficient r 98 0 570 p 0 000 shows a strong negative linear relationship between depth and concentration level which means increasing the depth will reduce iron concentration the relationship is presented via a scatter diagram in fig 6 the greater the linear relationship between two variables the closer the points on a scatter plot are to a straight line bewick et al 2003 3 6 potential suitable depth from fig 7 the locations with a suitability score of 15 or more are taken as the most suitable locations in the study area and the depth values of those locations are also considered the most suitable the most suitable locations are green and the least suitable locations are red table 4 lists some of the best locations based on their suitability score the suitability map indicates that depth ranges of 66 128 m were the most suitable in this range of depth in the water table the concentration of iron varied from 0 01 to 0 21 mg l which follows the standard level of both the who and bangladesh so the depth from 66 to 128 m is the potentially suitable depth in the water table in kushtia sadar upazila for considerable iron concentrated groundwater 4 conclusion and recommendations kushtia sadar upazila can be designated as one of the most iron contaminated areas in bangladesh among 100 samples n 100 only 43 samples n 43 followed who and bangladesh standards whereas 77 samples n 77 exceeded the who standard and 80 samples n 80 exceeded the bangladesh standard the spatial distribution of these data shows two thirds of the area studied had moderate 1 01 2 mg l to high 2 01 5 mg l contamination levels the whole northern part of the study is found to be a contamination hotspot which is quite alarming for the people living there the health risk assessment result shows children hq 0 39 2 13 are more susceptive than adults hq 0 16 0 92 and face serious health issues depth is found as a limiting hypothetical factor of iron concentrations as depth increases iron concentrations decrease the calculated hazard quotient value through the depth range of 66 128 m is found to be potentially suitable but the analysis shows only 15 of the sample tube wells were in this range however many natural and anthropogenic factors are responsible for extreme iron concentration in groundwater which was not listed in this study also the study of seasonal and spatiotemporal variations of iron contamination was overlooked a comprehensive evaluation of health risks associated with excessive iron ingestion with proper demographic evidence can clarify the potential vulnerability which is not undertaken here therefore this study recommends further integrated research for analyzing natural and anthropogenic factors of iron scientifically seasonal and temporal variations spatially and health risks with proper demographic evidence that can provide a better understanding of iron contamination in groundwater funding this research did not receive any

11699,textile industrial wastewater a major source of effluent coloration has been identified as a threat to human and animal health a difficult and significant challenge is the complete removal of poorly biodegradable dyestuffs from complex environmental matrices we synthesized a green iron oxide loaded douglas fir biochar fdbc hybrid using commercially available biochar dbc to effectively remove aqueous methylene blue mb both modified and pristine adsorbents are microporous and their mb removal speeds are very high equilibrate in 5 min at an initial mb concentration of 25 ppm large surface areas 640 m2 g versus 248 m2 g and pore volumes 0 13 cm3 g versus 0 07 cm3 g of dbc and fdbc partially facilitate mb surface physisorption compared to dbc the maximum langmuir adsorption capacity of fdbc is higher 634 0 mg g versus 740 5 mg g indicating the hybrid adsorbent design that involves the iron oxide phase plus the biochar backbone 1500 ppm initial mb t 5 min and ph 6 8 the addition of fe3o4 nanoparticles 11 0 nm promotes the adsorption of mb on fdbc due to the increase in the surface fe3o4 concentration while allowing small adsorbent particles of spent fdbc to be easily removed from batch treatments using a magnet the magnetic variant fdbc simultaneously adsorbs three co existing bp bg and mb with over 90 efficiency spent fdbc could be regenerated easily by stirring in methanol fdbc would be more economical in terms of its facile synthesis efficient and fast mb adsorption convenient recovery ph independent mb uptake and treatment of variety of wastewaters etc

wastewater kumar et al 2021 incomplete quenching of dyes and their successive washing leads to carry over of the contaminant further to downstream process streams these colorants can be toxic teratogenic and carcinogenic oladoye et al 2022 mb a common industrial dye is widely used in textile and paper production leather tanning hair and food coloring market insights reports 2018 predicted that the global value of mb production in 2025 will be 9 million us current production is 6 million us because of its common use in many industries santoso et al 2020 and the inappropriate treatment of industrial waste rafatullah et al 2010 large mb concentrations are discharged into groundwater and surface water oladoye et al 2022 adsorption has a great promise for the removal of colorants from industrial wastewater as a result of its simple operation and lack of harmful byproducts adsorbents such as clays kausar et al 2018 zeolites wang et al 2006 chitosan jawad et al 2020 cyclodextrin patil and shrivastava 2015 3d plymer metal carbon frameworks sasidharan et al 2021 biochar inyang et al 2014 agricultural wastes miyah et al 2018 and nanomaterials yi et al 2020 were previously used to adsorb dyes however green facile and effective synthesis adsorbents can be critical and extensive efforts are required biochar has been identified as a cost effective candidate when derived from biomass waste under thermal decomposition in a low oxygen environment pyrolysis conditions and the feedstock type determine the biochar properties qiu et al 2022 xie et al 2022 high surface area extensive porosity and variable surface structure allow biochar to support a dispersed deposited phase enabling the removal of toxic pollutants afroze and sen 2018 samaraweera et al 2021b santoso et

adjusted from ph 2 0 12 0 using 1 m hno3 and 1 m naoh with a ph meter total fe wt loading of fdbc was determined following sample digestion with 1 1 95 h2so4 70 hno3 50 ml and analyzed via aas 2 4 batch adsorption experiments adsorptions were conducted in batch mode using a thermo forma orbital shaker to study the effects of initial dye concentration ph contact time and temperature on dye adsorption in each experiment 0 05 g of adsorbent dbc or fdbc and 25 ppm methylene blue solution 25 ml were used all adsorption experiments were done in 45 ml plastic vials replicates and controls were added to each experiment after adsorption the samples were filtered using whatman no 1 filter papers amount retained on filter paper due to mb 1 2 and the adsorbent 1 was negligible and conserved for later analysis the dye solution ph values varied from ph 2 10 a 24 h kinetic study was conducted from 5 min to 24 h data were analyzed using pseudo first and second order kinetic models adsorption isotherm experiments varied the mb concentrations from 100 to 1500 ppm at 25 35 and 45 c this data was analyzed using the langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson isotherm models table s3 the kinetic and isotherm model equations are presented in section 1 supplementary information the desorption of mb laden dbc and fdbc were tested using 10 ml of methanol organic naoh basic and h2o2 redox at 25 c and ph 6 8 adsorbent eluent ratio 25 g l adsorption after regeneration was conducted using 25 ml mb 500 ppm solutions adsorbent adsorbate ratio 25 g l for 3 h 200 rpm at ph 6 8 both adsorptions and desorptions were conducted at 200 rpm shaking for 3 h the real wastewater study was conducted using water from chadwick lake located in starkville ms at 5 ppm of spiked mb

discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbents 3 1 1 biochar surface morphologies as in fig 1 a douglas fir biochar dbc retains some of the original surface morphology of the douglas fir biomass das and sharma 2012 the ray and lumen cells undergo longitudinal fractures and produce circular openings in dbc after iron oxide deposition the fdbc showed a rough exterior surface formation fig 1b due to the formation of iron oxide individual primary particles 10 15 nm and their aggregates 100 150 nm fig 1c the sem edx analysis illustrates c and o are highly distributed fig 1d f on the dbc surface on the contrary fe and o are more dispersed in the fdbc fig 1h k large fe 9 1 and o 15 5 atomic percentages further confirm the presence of fe3o4 on the fdbc fig 1j and k after fe3o4 deposition a decrease of carbon atomic percentage 73 9 versus 86 1 and a huge increase of fe percentage 9 1 versus 0 3 were found in the fdbc compared to dbc fig 2 e i g k iron oxide individual primary size 10 0 nm and overlapped particles were also visible in the fdbc tem image fig 2c which is consistent with sem and xrd analyses section 3 1 2 3 1 2 xrd ftir and tga analysis the dbc xrd pattern showed broad graphitic regions centered at 2θ 24 2 and 43 3 fig 2a denoting its highly amorphous nature also crystalline phases such as sio2 2θ 26 6 bardez et al 2008 caco3 2θ 29 4 bloise et al 2019 and mg oh 2 2θ 39 5 samaraweera et al 2021c were identified in the dbc originating from original biomass misra et al 1993 dbc a fast pyrolyzed product of douglas fir biomass was synthesized at 900 c elevated pyrolysis temperatures enhanced the basic oxide carbonate content in dbc resulted a high pzc table 1 the fdbc is less amorphous than dbc due to the iron oxide deposition the intense peak at 2θ 35 6 311 and other peaks at 2θ 43 3 400 30 1 220 57 1 511 and 62 9 440 are due to the magnetite octahedral phase that exists in the fdbc kim et al 2012 the calculated fe3o4 crystal size was 11 0 nm section 2 3 which is in good agreement with the sem analysis section 3 1 1 as in fig 3 b the dbc ftir spectrum shows peaks at 1107 cm 1 1511 cm 1 and 2291 cm 1 and were ascribed to si o aromatic skeletal in lignin and co2 stretching vibrations respectively larkin 2018 pandey and pitman 2003 sukprasert et al 2020 the dbc shows trace h and o containing functional groups during ftir analysis the dbc is expected to contain fewer surface oxygenated groups as it was produced using fast pyrolysis 1 10 s at 900 c at this high temperature dehydration and deoxygenation of the biomass occurs uchimiya et al 2011 high pyrolysis temperatures 600 c produce porous high surface area biochars which tend to efficiently adsorb bulky organic contaminants zhou et al 2018 the bet surface areas and the average pore volumes of dbc versus fdbc were 640 m2 g and 248 m2 g and 0 13 cm3 g and 0 07 cm3 g table 1 the fdbc ftir spectrum fig 2b displays new peaks from 500 to 1000 cm 1 due to feooh and fe oh fe vibrations liu et al 2012 resulting from after fe2 fe3 treatment followed by basification the peak at 556 cm 1 is attributed to the characteristic fe o functions in the fe3o4 phase in the fdbc ji et al 2018 silva et al 2013 peaks at 3294 cm 1 and 3500 cm 1 oh indicate the organic impurities present on it after adsorption no changes were visible in the dbc or fdbc ftir spectra data is not presented ftir provides information on functional groups present in the bulk structure of materials to track mild changes in surface chemistry more sensitive analytical techniques such as xps need to be utilized section 3 5 tga analysis was performed in air to determine the inorganic residue ash content of the materials samaraweera et al 2021a 2021c 2022 both fdbc and dbc exhibit a significant weight loss at 479 c fig 2d due to increased oxidation of the biomass phase in both biochars the weight loss is less in fdbc due to the deposited iron oxide and capture of some carbon as iron carbides at a higher temperature this implies that fdbc is more thermally stable than dbc the percentage yield of iron oxide 99 was calculated and shown in table s1 the high thermal stability of fdbc facilitates efficient carbon sequestration promoting the practical value of the adsorbent 3 2 physico chemical properties the fast pyrolysis of wet green wood at 900 c produces a high dbc surface area sbet 640 m2 g with a low ash content 2 9 table 1 similar to most wood based biochars wang et al 2020 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of both dbc and fdbc displayed type i adsorption isotherm n2 saturates pores within p po 0 2 fig 2e and fig s2a indicating the presence of well defined microporous structures the density functional theory dft analysis further confirmed that dbc fig s2b and fdbc fig 2f exhibited narrow pore size distributions 1 6 2 2 nm the porous dbc would disperse many fe3o4 particles efficiently as shown in sem analysis fig 1c after fe3o4 deposition a reduced surface area of fdbc sbet 248 m2 g was obtained indicating that precipitated iron oxide could cause partial filling intersection of the openings of some surface micro and ultramicropores this phenomenon prevents access to the internal surface area lowering the net surface area more than the added fe3o4 particles increase it chen et al 2011 mb has molecular dimensions of 1 43 nm 0 61 nm 0 4 nm pelekani and snoeyink 2000 allowing access to a fraction of the pores in fdbc and dbc in some cases the mesoporous structure of biochar is compatible with mb uptake other than large pore volume saeed et al 2020 the fdbc is less basic than dbc pzcs 8 2 versus 10 2 from the magnetite pzc 6 5 deposition table 1 its 16 4 wt fe content corresponds to 22 7 wt fe3o4 partly contributes to its high ash content 29 9 table 1 the carbon content in both biochars estimated by elemental combustion system table 1 and by edx section 3 1 1 are different each other obviously edx should provide higher elemental percentages for both dbc and fdbc 86 1 and 73 9 as it is more surface specific up to 3 1 μm than those acquired with elemental combustion 76 3 versus 50 7 which is a bulk analysis technique 3 3 methylene blue adsorption on biochars 3 3 1 effect of adsorbent dose generally when the adsorbent dose increases the adsorption efficiency also rises due to the availability of additional active sites and functional groups ballav et al 2018 in contrast when the doses of dbc and fdbc increased from 0 5 g l to 3 g l their mb removal capacities dropped from 12 3 mg g to 12 1 mg g dbc and 12 4 mg g to 12 3 mg g fdbc fig 3a adsorption is a surface phenomenon and the rate and the extent of adsorption depend on the available surface area large adsorbent doses cause overcrowding of adsorbent particles dropping the available area for adsorption manoko et al 2022 as in fig 3a the largest mb removal was reported at 0 5 g l further lowering adsorbent dose would earn even higher mb removal capacities additionally the mb uptake decrease with increasing adsorbent dose was more prominent in dbc than in fdbc 0 2 mg g versus 0 1 mg g 3 3 2 effect of contact time mb adsorption kinetics onto dbc and fdbc follow similar trends fig 3b the mb uptake was fast during the initial exposure due to the availability of active adsorbent sites and both surfaces reached saturation within 5 min initial mb concentration 25 ppm low adsorption equilibrium time would be probably caused by the high adsorbent dose 2 g l and low initial concentration of mb 25 ppm used however this hypothesis needs to be investigated further the uptake remained constant when the surface active sites had been saturated with mb adsorption using dbc or fdbc is faster than previously developed walnut shell powder miyah et al 2018 or a fe3o4 polyoxometalate composite ji et al 2018 high adsorption speed with large adsorption capacities of these adsorbents have had the added advantage of promoting commercialization kinetic data was analyzed with pseudo first pfo and second order pso models table s2 the pso model fits better r2 0 99 1 0 for both mb binding onto dbc or fdbc than the pfo model this observation implies that chemisorption plays a role in adsorbing mb onto dbc and fdbc 3 3 3 adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics mb adsorption isotherms onto dbc and fdbc were obtained at 25 35 and 45 c fig s3 the langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson isotherm model fittings are summarized in table s3 the langmuir modal fits well with both adsorptions and the maximum langmuir mb adsorption capacity by dbc was 634 0 mg g at 25 c and increased to 655 5 mg g at 45 c table s3 the mb uptake by fdbc was enhanced continuously with the temperature rise the maximum mb langmuir adsorption capacity by fdbc was 740 5 mg g at 25 c and rose to 800 0 mg g at 45 c however mb adsorption onto the fdbc is exothermic δ h 24 8 kj mol table s4 large mb adsorption uptake at high temperatures suggests the breakage of dye clusters at high temperatures improving the dispersion chakraborty 2014 all adsorptions in this study fit better to the langmuir model r2 0 90 table s3 than other isotherm models r2 0 90 the 1 n values for all adsorptions were less than 1 indicating favorable dye uptake on both sorbents table s3 the gibb s free energy δg values for mb adsorption on dbc 44 3 to 45 4 kj mol and fdbc 40 3 to 42 1 kj mol are spontaneous at 25 35 and 45 c table s4 the negative δh for mb binding onto dbc and fdbc 15 6 and 24 8 kj mol indicated that these processes are exothermic table s4 and the small magnitude implies that these mb bindings are governed via physisorption bergmann and machado 2015 often organic moieties physically bind onto porous adsorbent surfaces via weak van der waals forces the positive δs value 99 5 j mol 1 k 1 denotes that mb adsorption onto dbc increases the randomness mb binding to a solid adsorbent is an energetic process during mb adsorption onto a surface the activation energy e a is required to overcome the angle orientation the length of the interaction bond and the angle of the mb bond which consequently contributed to the energy barrier or the activation energy of the adsorption santoso et al 2020 e a values for mb uptake by dbc 32 3 kj mol and fdbc 6 4 kj mol are less than 40 kj mol further suggesting mb physisorption onto both surfaces many studies have employed different synthesis methods pyrolysis conditions feedstock types and modifying agents for magnetic adsorbent production to promote methylene blue uptake these investigations focused on changing biochar s physicochemical properties like surface area pore structure and volume mesopore volume and depth pore channels surface oxygenated functional groups etc a mesoporous seaweed biochar was synthesized by saeed et al 2020 showing a large pore volume 0 54 cm3 g and a mesopore surface structure pore size 2 3 nm that facilitates the removal of mb table 2 the increase in oxygenated surface groups has improved the electronic attraction of mb molecules liu et al 2019 have used the oxidative modification using phosphomolybdic acid to introduce surface oxygenated groups to the biochar and develop pore channels at 200 c comparatively both dbc and fdbc adsorption capacities are excellent and comparable to the better previously reported adsorbents 3 4 regeneration and practical applicability of biochars 3 4 1 regeneration potential adsorption desorption studies were conducted for both mb laden dbc and mb laden fdbc at 25 c fig 3c desorption employed three different stripping agents methanol organic naoh basic and h2o2 redox 10 ml each methanol gave greater mb desorption capacities of spent dbc and fdbc 0 4 mg g and 1 0 mg g than naoh and h2o2 less than 0 002 mg g data is not presented hence methanol was selected as the stripper for further regeneration cycles as seen in fig 3c both adsorbents absorb similar amounts of mb 43 mg g in the first cycle when an initial mb concentration of 500 ppm is used the dbc s mb uptake was unchanged in the second cycle 43 mg g and reduced to 22 mg g in the third cycle mb adsorption by fdbc drastically decreased in the second cycle 15 mg g and was maintained constant in the third cycle this could possibly be attributed to the loss blockage of active sites by leached fe3 ions from the fdbc or by products generated during the adsorption process 3 4 2 real wastewater study and simultaneous dye removal the practical applicability of dbc and fdbc adsorbents was checked using lake water collected from chadwick lake starkville ms 39762 mb was spiked at 5 ppm to this lake water before the adsorption experiments fig 3d both adsorbents show similar mb stripping capacities 2 5 mg g from lake water indicating their potential use in real time wastewater systems a major concern in practical usage of these adsorbents is simultaneous dye removal when multiple dyes and other contaminants are present in the wastewater in this study the simultaneous removal of mb bromophenol blue bp and bromocresol green bg was studied 1000 ppm each using both adsorbents at ph 7 fig 3e when the mixture of mb bp and bg was employed the fdbc showed higher combined mb bp and bg removals 49 6 mg g 46 2 mg g and 44 7 mg g respectively than dbc 49 5 mg g 43 0 mg g and 39 8 mg g further the fdbc removes three dyes with over 90 efficiency the highest value for mb 100 in the presence of bp and bg approx 5 7 reduction of mb removal capacity by the dbc from 52 0 mg g to 49 5 mg g and the fdbc from 52 0 mg g to 49 6 mg g surfaces were observed compared to their single adsorbate systems this observation implies that both surfaces have a little affinity to bp and bg this is because the positively charged dbc and fdbc pzcs 10 2 and 8 2 surfaces at ph 7 can attract negatively charged bp and bg further dbc s affinity for bp in the mixture was less than in a single solution due to the competitive adsorption of co existing mb and bg in contrast fdbc shows increased bp and bg 30 4 and 100 uptakes in the mixture compared to single systems attributing the mutual adsorption enhancement by mb molecules mb molecules form self aggregates e g dimers trimers etc depending on the concentration patil et al 2000 further mb dimerization rises in the presence of anionic molecules dimerized mb molecules can attach to the biochar surface at one end allowing the other end to attract anionic entities like bp and bg 3 5 ph dependence and adsorption interactions mb uptakes by both biochars are independent of ph fluctuations as their surfaces are protonated pzc 10 2 versus 8 2 over this entire range fig 3f thus coulombic interaction wouldn t be the dominant mb removal mechanism by both adsorbents and other mechanisms should consider organic molecules often tend to physically adsorb with the adsorbents elmorsi et al 2019 thermodynamic studies section 3 3 3 reveled that mb adsorption onto the fdbc can be occured via physisorption furthermore edx analysis reported that the existence of different na k mg2 and ca2 containing compounds in both adsorbents data is not presented facilitating ion exchange with mb molecules in the solution chen et al 2022 the ph independence nature of dbc and fdbc further explains that both biochars can be applied to treat mb contaminated wastewater over a wide ph range subsequent mb adsorption experiments in the current study were performed at the ph of the surface water ph 6 8 mb molecules have four heteroatoms with lone electron pairs fig s1 despite its delocalized positive charge the nitrogen sites provide h bonding acceptor interactions with the biochar and fe3o4 phase fdbc contains fe oh pka 5 6 and fe o fe surface functions daou et al 2007 fe oh and fe oh2 below ph 5 6 provide h bond donor sites mb exists in cationic form above ph 3 8 pka of mb therefore electrostatic attractions can occur between fe oh2 groups and mb molecules below ph 3 8 in which mb carries a negative charge electrostatic repulsions are possible when the solution ph 3 8 5 6 at basic conditions ph 8 10 the fe o sites in the fe3o4 surface provide electrostatic attractions for cationic mb xps provides surface sensitive information limited to a very small volume of the material with a thickness of a few nanometers piwowarczyk et al 2019 both low resolution lr and high resolution hr xps spectra were acquired for dbc and fdbc before and after mb uptake fig 4 a and fig s4 the xps survey spectra revealed that dbc has c and o prominent surface elements whereas c o and fe are dominant on the fdbc fig s4 five deconvoluted peaks were visible in both c1s and o1s hr spectra of fdbc fig 4a and b compared to dbc fdbc has a higher surface lattice oxygen o2 content 10 1 versus 1 8 table s6 due to an increase in fe3o4 content and is consistent with edx and xrd results furthermore fdbc has a higher surface atomic percentage of oh 7 8 versus 2 6 and c o 3 5 versus 2 1 than dbc suggesting a hydrophilic surface formation after iron oxide modification these enhanced acidic organic functional groups suggested the less basic surface nature of fdbc compared to dbc pzc 8 2 versus 10 2 fe2p hr xps analysis revealed that both fe2 and fe3 are present on the fdbc due to immobilized fe3o4 and fe2o3 phases on the surface fig 4c we acquired xps spectra and data to track the mild changes on the fdbc surface before and after mb uptake at different phs 3 7 and 10 after exposing the fdbc to mb molecules at ph 7 the atomic percentage of o2 groups slightly decreased from 10 1 to 8 4 on the surface the fdbc has magnetite with local pzc of 6 5 milonjić et al 1983 some deprotonated groups like fe o on the surface display little electrostatic mb attractions scheme 1 hydrogen bonding is also possible between the surfaces with a higher oxygen content and c s and c n functionalities of mb n1s spectrum fig 4f shows a new peak at 399 7 ev n atomic percentage 0 3 denoting n ch3 2 from mb is bound to the fdbc after mb uptake ren et al 2021 the aromatic groups of mb can react with graphitic carbons present in fdbc via π π interactions gong et al 2015 therefore in addition to the physisorption the mb removal by fdbc possibly occurs via coulombic interaction π π interactions and hydrogen bonding 4 conclusions the biochars wide availability fast kinetics and appreciable adsorption capacities are significantly important for large scale applications in this study facile synthesis of magnetic fe3o4 modified douglas fir biochar fdbc was carried out employing a commercial fast pyrolyzed douglas fir biochar dbc under neutral conditions the fdbc offers a larger methylene blue removal than the dbc 740 5 mg g versus 634 0 mg g at 1500 ppm initial mb concentration from aqueous solutions due to the large concentrations of surface deposited 11 0 nm fe3o4 particles narrow pores 1 6 2 2 nm were detected on the fdbc the fdbc has a less basic surface point of zero charges for fdbc versus dbc were 8 2 and 10 2 which is hydrophilic xps analysis revealed a higher surface oh 7 8 versus 2 6 and c o 3 5 versus 2 1 at percentages on the fdbc than on the dbc the current study showed that mb sorption onto the fdbc and dbc surfaces are fast and occurred with very high capacities at 25 c and ph 6 8 compared to dbc fdbc offers a larger mb removal capacity and is more economical as it can be easily synthesized from affordable and readily available fe2 fe3 salts and implemented without filtration the fdbc shows a ph independent mb uptake and facillitates with watewater treatment over a wide ph range further a slight decrease of fdbc s surface oxygen content at higher ph levels indicates the mb removal via coulombic interaction fdbc satisfactorily removes three co existing dyes mb bp and bg with a 100 mb removal dye uptakes on the dbc and fdbc are spontaneous and followed by pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir models magnetic modification may be important as these materials can avoid recovery problems of non magnetic sorbents direct application of magnetic variant fdbc saves both time and energy the fdbc can be regenerated and recycled for a few cycles further regeneration studies and simultaneous removal studies using multiple inorganic contaminants are required to assess the complete economic efficiency of these adsorbents funding this

11699,textile industrial wastewater a major source of effluent coloration has been identified as a threat to human and animal health a difficult and significant challenge is the complete removal of poorly biodegradable dyestuffs from complex environmental matrices we synthesized a green iron oxide loaded douglas fir biochar fdbc hybrid using commercially available biochar dbc to effectively remove aqueous methylene blue mb both modified and pristine adsorbents are microporous and their mb removal speeds are very high equilibrate in 5 min at an initial mb concentration of 25 ppm large surface areas 640 m2 g versus 248 m2 g and pore volumes 0 13 cm3 g versus 0 07 cm3 g of dbc and fdbc partially facilitate mb surface physisorption compared to dbc the maximum langmuir adsorption capacity of fdbc is higher 634 0 mg g versus 740 5 mg g indicating the hybrid adsorbent design that involves the iron oxide phase plus the biochar backbone 1500 ppm initial mb t 5 min and ph 6 8 the addition of fe3o4 nanoparticles 11 0 nm promotes the adsorption of mb on fdbc due to the increase in the surface fe3o4 concentration while allowing small adsorbent particles of spent fdbc to be easily removed from batch treatments using a magnet the magnetic variant fdbc simultaneously adsorbs three co existing bp bg and mb with over 90 efficiency spent fdbc could be regenerated easily by stirring in methanol fdbc would be more economical in terms of its facile synthesis efficient and fast mb adsorption convenient recovery ph independent mb uptake and treatment of variety of wastewaters etc

adjusted from ph 2 0 12 0 using 1 m hno3 and 1 m naoh with a ph meter total fe wt loading of fdbc was determined following sample digestion with 1 1 95 h2so4 70 hno3 50 ml and analyzed via aas 2 4 batch adsorption experiments adsorptions were conducted in batch mode using a thermo forma orbital shaker to study the effects of initial dye concentration ph contact time and temperature on dye adsorption in each experiment 0 05 g of adsorbent dbc or fdbc and 25 ppm methylene blue solution 25 ml were used all adsorption experiments were done in 45 ml plastic vials replicates and controls were added to each experiment after adsorption the samples were filtered using whatman no 1 filter papers amount retained on filter paper due to mb 1 2 and the adsorbent 1 was negligible and conserved for later analysis the dye solution ph values varied from ph 2 10 a 24 h kinetic study was conducted from 5 min to 24 h data were analyzed using pseudo first and second order kinetic models adsorption isotherm experiments varied the mb concentrations from 100 to 1500 ppm at 25 35 and 45 c this data was analyzed using the langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson isotherm models table s3 the kinetic and isotherm model equations are presented in section 1 supplementary information the desorption of mb laden dbc and fdbc were tested using 10 ml of methanol organic naoh basic and h2o2 redox at 25 c and ph 6 8 adsorbent eluent ratio 25 g l adsorption after regeneration was conducted using 25 ml mb 500 ppm solutions adsorbent adsorbate ratio 25 g l for 3 h 200 rpm at ph 6 8 both adsorptions and desorptions were conducted at 200 rpm shaking for 3 h the real wastewater study was conducted using water from chadwick lake located in starkville ms at 5 ppm of spiked mb

discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbents 3 1 1 biochar surface morphologies as in fig 1 a douglas fir biochar dbc retains some of the original surface morphology of the douglas fir biomass das and sharma 2012 the ray and lumen cells undergo longitudinal fractures and produce circular openings in dbc after iron oxide deposition the fdbc showed a rough exterior surface formation fig 1b due to the formation of iron oxide individual primary particles 10 15 nm and their aggregates 100 150 nm fig 1c the sem edx analysis illustrates c and o are highly distributed fig 1d f on the dbc surface on the contrary fe and o are more dispersed in the fdbc fig 1h k large fe 9 1 and o 15 5 atomic percentages further confirm the presence of fe3o4 on the fdbc fig 1j and k after fe3o4 deposition a decrease of carbon atomic percentage 73 9 versus 86 1 and a huge increase of fe percentage 9 1 versus 0 3 were found in the fdbc compared to dbc fig 2 e i g k iron oxide individual primary size 10 0 nm and overlapped particles were also visible in the fdbc tem image fig 2c which is consistent with sem and xrd analyses section 3 1 2 3 1 2 xrd ftir and tga analysis the dbc xrd pattern showed broad graphitic regions centered at 2θ 24 2 and 43 3 fig 2a denoting its highly amorphous nature also crystalline phases such as sio2 2θ 26 6 bardez et al 2008 caco3 2θ 29 4 bloise et al 2019 and mg oh 2 2θ 39 5 samaraweera et al 2021c were identified in the dbc originating from original biomass misra et al 1993 dbc a fast pyrolyzed product of douglas fir biomass was synthesized at 900 c elevated pyrolysis temperatures enhanced the basic oxide carbonate content in dbc resulted a high pzc table 1 the fdbc is less amorphous than dbc due to the iron oxide deposition the intense peak at 2θ 35 6 311 and other peaks at 2θ 43 3 400 30 1 220 57 1 511 and 62 9 440 are due to the magnetite octahedral phase that exists in the fdbc kim et al 2012 the calculated fe3o4 crystal size was 11 0 nm section 2 3 which is in good agreement with the sem analysis section 3 1 1 as in fig 3 b the dbc ftir spectrum shows peaks at 1107 cm 1 1511 cm 1 and 2291 cm 1 and were ascribed to si o aromatic skeletal in lignin and co2 stretching vibrations respectively larkin 2018 pandey and pitman 2003 sukprasert et al 2020 the dbc shows trace h and o containing functional groups during ftir analysis the dbc is expected to contain fewer surface oxygenated groups as it was produced using fast pyrolysis 1 10 s at 900 c at this high temperature dehydration and deoxygenation of the biomass occurs uchimiya et al 2011 high pyrolysis temperatures 600 c produce porous high surface area biochars which tend to efficiently adsorb bulky organic contaminants zhou et al 2018 the bet surface areas and the average pore volumes of dbc versus fdbc were 640 m2 g and 248 m2 g and 0 13 cm3 g and 0 07 cm3 g table 1 the fdbc ftir spectrum fig 2b displays new peaks from 500 to 1000 cm 1 due to feooh and fe oh fe vibrations liu et al 2012 resulting from after fe2 fe3 treatment followed by basification the peak at 556 cm 1 is attributed to the characteristic fe o functions in the fe3o4 phase in the fdbc ji et al 2018 silva et al 2013 peaks at 3294 cm 1 and 3500 cm 1 oh indicate the organic impurities present on it after adsorption no changes were visible in the dbc or fdbc ftir spectra data is not presented ftir provides information on functional groups present in the bulk structure of materials to track mild changes in surface chemistry more sensitive analytical techniques such as xps need to be utilized section 3 5 tga analysis was performed in air to determine the inorganic residue ash content of the materials samaraweera et al 2021a 2021c 2022 both fdbc and dbc exhibit a significant weight loss at 479 c fig 2d due to increased oxidation of the biomass phase in both biochars the weight loss is less in fdbc due to the deposited iron oxide and capture of some carbon as iron carbides at a higher temperature this implies that fdbc is more thermally stable than dbc the percentage yield of iron oxide 99 was calculated and shown in table s1 the high thermal stability of fdbc facilitates efficient carbon sequestration promoting the practical value of the adsorbent 3 2 physico chemical properties the fast pyrolysis of wet green wood at 900 c produces a high dbc surface area sbet 640 m2 g with a low ash content 2 9 table 1 similar to most wood based biochars wang et al 2020 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of both dbc and fdbc displayed type i adsorption isotherm n2 saturates pores within p po 0 2 fig 2e and fig s2a indicating the presence of well defined microporous structures the density functional theory dft analysis further confirmed that dbc fig s2b and fdbc fig 2f exhibited narrow pore size distributions 1 6 2 2 nm the porous dbc would disperse many fe3o4 particles efficiently as shown in sem analysis fig 1c after fe3o4 deposition a reduced surface area of fdbc sbet 248 m2 g was obtained indicating that precipitated iron oxide could cause partial filling intersection of the openings of some surface micro and ultramicropores this phenomenon prevents access to the internal surface area lowering the net surface area more than the added fe3o4 particles increase it chen et al 2011 mb has molecular dimensions of 1 43 nm 0 61 nm 0 4 nm pelekani and snoeyink 2000 allowing access to a fraction of the pores in fdbc and dbc in some cases the mesoporous structure of biochar is compatible with mb uptake other than large pore volume saeed et al 2020 the fdbc is less basic than dbc pzcs 8 2 versus 10 2 from the magnetite pzc 6 5 deposition table 1 its 16 4 wt fe content corresponds to 22 7 wt fe3o4 partly contributes to its high ash content 29 9 table 1 the carbon content in both biochars estimated by elemental combustion system table 1 and by edx section 3 1 1 are different each other obviously edx should provide higher elemental percentages for both dbc and fdbc 86 1 and 73 9 as it is more surface specific up to 3 1 μm than those acquired with elemental combustion 76 3 versus 50 7 which is a bulk analysis technique 3 3 methylene blue adsorption on biochars 3 3 1 effect of adsorbent dose generally when the adsorbent dose increases the adsorption efficiency also rises due to the availability of additional active sites and functional groups ballav et al 2018 in contrast when the doses of dbc and fdbc increased from 0 5 g l to 3 g l their mb removal capacities dropped from 12 3 mg g to 12 1 mg g dbc and 12 4 mg g to 12 3 mg g fdbc fig 3a adsorption is a surface phenomenon and the rate and the extent of adsorption depend on the available surface area large adsorbent doses cause overcrowding of adsorbent particles dropping the available area for adsorption manoko et al 2022 as in fig 3a the largest mb removal was reported at 0 5 g l further lowering adsorbent dose would earn even higher mb removal capacities additionally the mb uptake decrease with increasing adsorbent dose was more prominent in dbc than in fdbc 0 2 mg g versus 0 1 mg g 3 3 2 effect of contact time mb adsorption kinetics onto dbc and fdbc follow similar trends fig 3b the mb uptake was fast during the initial exposure due to the availability of active adsorbent sites and both surfaces reached saturation within 5 min initial mb concentration 25 ppm low adsorption equilibrium time would be probably caused by the high adsorbent dose 2 g l and low initial concentration of mb 25 ppm used however this hypothesis needs to be investigated further the uptake remained constant when the surface active sites had been saturated with mb adsorption using dbc or fdbc is faster than previously developed walnut shell powder miyah et al 2018 or a fe3o4 polyoxometalate composite ji et al 2018 high adsorption speed with large adsorption capacities of these adsorbents have had the added advantage of promoting commercialization kinetic data was analyzed with pseudo first pfo and second order pso models table s2 the pso model fits better r2 0 99 1 0 for both mb binding onto dbc or fdbc than the pfo model this observation implies that chemisorption plays a role in adsorbing mb onto dbc and fdbc 3 3 3 adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics mb adsorption isotherms onto dbc and fdbc were obtained at 25 35 and 45 c fig s3 the langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson isotherm model fittings are summarized in table s3 the langmuir modal fits well with both adsorptions and the maximum langmuir mb adsorption capacity by dbc was 634 0 mg g at 25 c and increased to 655 5 mg g at 45 c table s3 the mb uptake by fdbc was enhanced continuously with the temperature rise the maximum mb langmuir adsorption capacity by fdbc was 740 5 mg g at 25 c and rose to 800 0 mg g at 45 c however mb adsorption onto the fdbc is exothermic δ h 24 8 kj mol table s4 large mb adsorption uptake at high temperatures suggests the breakage of dye clusters at high temperatures improving the dispersion chakraborty 2014 all adsorptions in this study fit better to the langmuir model r2 0 90 table s3 than other isotherm models r2 0 90 the 1 n values for all adsorptions were less than 1 indicating favorable dye uptake on both sorbents table s3 the gibb s free energy δg values for mb adsorption on dbc 44 3 to 45 4 kj mol and fdbc 40 3 to 42 1 kj mol are spontaneous at 25 35 and 45 c table s4 the negative δh for mb binding onto dbc and fdbc 15 6 and 24 8 kj mol indicated that these processes are exothermic table s4 and the small magnitude implies that these mb bindings are governed via physisorption bergmann and machado 2015 often organic moieties physically bind onto porous adsorbent surfaces via weak van der waals forces the positive δs value 99 5 j mol 1 k 1 denotes that mb adsorption onto dbc increases the randomness mb binding to a solid adsorbent is an energetic process during mb adsorption onto a surface the activation energy e a is required to overcome the angle orientation the length of the interaction bond and the angle of the mb bond which consequently contributed to the energy barrier or the activation energy of the adsorption santoso et al 2020 e a values for mb uptake by dbc 32 3 kj mol and fdbc 6 4 kj mol are less than 40 kj mol further suggesting mb physisorption onto both surfaces many studies have employed different synthesis methods pyrolysis conditions feedstock types and modifying agents for magnetic adsorbent production to promote methylene blue uptake these investigations focused on changing biochar s physicochemical properties like surface area pore structure and volume mesopore volume and depth pore channels surface oxygenated functional groups etc a mesoporous seaweed biochar was synthesized by saeed et al 2020 showing a large pore volume 0 54 cm3 g and a mesopore surface structure pore size 2 3 nm that facilitates the removal of mb table 2 the increase in oxygenated surface groups has improved the electronic attraction of mb molecules liu et al 2019 have used the oxidative modification using phosphomolybdic acid to introduce surface oxygenated groups to the biochar and develop pore channels at 200 c comparatively both dbc and fdbc adsorption capacities are excellent and comparable to the better previously reported adsorbents 3 4 regeneration and practical applicability of biochars 3 4 1 regeneration potential adsorption desorption studies were conducted for both mb laden dbc and mb laden fdbc at 25 c fig 3c desorption employed three different stripping agents methanol organic naoh basic and h2o2 redox 10 ml each methanol gave greater mb desorption capacities of spent dbc and fdbc 0 4 mg g and 1 0 mg g than naoh and h2o2 less than 0 002 mg g data is not presented hence methanol was selected as the stripper for further regeneration cycles as seen in fig 3c both adsorbents absorb similar amounts of mb 43 mg g in the first cycle when an initial mb concentration of 500 ppm is used the dbc s mb uptake was unchanged in the second cycle 43 mg g and reduced to 22 mg g in the third cycle mb adsorption by fdbc drastically decreased in the second cycle 15 mg g and was maintained constant in the third cycle this could possibly be attributed to the loss blockage of active sites by leached fe3 ions from the fdbc or by products generated during the adsorption process 3 4 2 real wastewater study and simultaneous dye removal the practical applicability of dbc and fdbc adsorbents was checked using lake water collected from chadwick lake starkville ms 39762 mb was spiked at 5 ppm to this lake water before the adsorption experiments fig 3d both adsorbents show similar mb stripping capacities 2 5 mg g from lake water indicating their potential use in real time wastewater systems a major concern in practical usage of these adsorbents is simultaneous dye removal when multiple dyes and other contaminants are present in the wastewater in this study the simultaneous removal of mb bromophenol blue bp and bromocresol green bg was studied 1000 ppm each using both adsorbents at ph 7 fig 3e when the mixture of mb bp and bg was employed the fdbc showed higher combined mb bp and bg removals 49 6 mg g 46 2 mg g and 44 7 mg g respectively than dbc 49 5 mg g 43 0 mg g and 39 8 mg g further the fdbc removes three dyes with over 90 efficiency the highest value for mb 100 in the presence of bp and bg approx 5 7 reduction of mb removal capacity by the dbc from 52 0 mg g to 49 5 mg g and the fdbc from 52 0 mg g to 49 6 mg g surfaces were observed compared to their single adsorbate systems this observation implies that both surfaces have a little affinity to bp and bg this is because the positively charged dbc and fdbc pzcs 10 2 and 8 2 surfaces at ph 7 can attract negatively charged bp and bg further dbc s affinity for bp in the mixture was less than in a single solution due to the competitive adsorption of co existing mb and bg in contrast fdbc shows increased bp and bg 30 4 and 100 uptakes in the mixture compared to single systems attributing the mutual adsorption enhancement by mb molecules mb molecules form self aggregates e g dimers trimers etc depending on the concentration patil et al 2000 further mb dimerization rises in the presence of anionic molecules dimerized mb molecules can attach to the biochar surface at one end allowing the other end to attract anionic entities like bp and bg 3 5 ph dependence and adsorption interactions mb uptakes by both biochars are independent of ph fluctuations as their surfaces are protonated pzc 10 2 versus 8 2 over this entire range fig 3f thus coulombic interaction wouldn t be the dominant mb removal mechanism by both adsorbents and other mechanisms should consider organic molecules often tend to physically adsorb with the adsorbents elmorsi et al 2019 thermodynamic studies section 3 3 3 reveled that mb adsorption onto the fdbc can be occured via physisorption furthermore edx analysis reported that the existence of different na k mg2 and ca2 containing compounds in both adsorbents data is not presented facilitating ion exchange with mb molecules in the solution chen et al 2022 the ph independence nature of dbc and fdbc further explains that both biochars can be applied to treat mb contaminated wastewater over a wide ph range subsequent mb adsorption experiments in the current study were performed at the ph of the surface water ph 6 8 mb molecules have four heteroatoms with lone electron pairs fig s1 despite its delocalized positive charge the nitrogen sites provide h bonding acceptor interactions with the biochar and fe3o4 phase fdbc contains fe oh pka 5 6 and fe o fe surface functions daou et al 2007 fe oh and fe oh2 below ph 5 6 provide h bond donor sites mb exists in cationic form above ph 3 8 pka of mb therefore electrostatic attractions can occur between fe oh2 groups and mb molecules below ph 3 8 in which mb carries a negative charge electrostatic repulsions are possible when the solution ph 3 8 5 6 at basic conditions ph 8 10 the fe o sites in the fe3o4 surface provide electrostatic attractions for cationic mb xps provides surface sensitive information limited to a very small volume of the material with a thickness of a few nanometers piwowarczyk et al 2019 both low resolution lr and high resolution hr xps spectra were acquired for dbc and fdbc before and after mb uptake fig 4 a and fig s4 the xps survey spectra revealed that dbc has c and o prominent surface elements whereas c o and fe are dominant on the fdbc fig s4 five deconvoluted peaks were visible in both c1s and o1s hr spectra of fdbc fig 4a and b compared to dbc fdbc has a higher surface lattice oxygen o2 content 10 1 versus 1 8 table s6 due to an increase in fe3o4 content and is consistent with edx and xrd results furthermore fdbc has a higher surface atomic percentage of oh 7 8 versus 2 6 and c o 3 5 versus 2 1 than dbc suggesting a hydrophilic surface formation after iron oxide modification these enhanced acidic organic functional groups suggested the less basic surface nature of fdbc compared to dbc pzc 8 2 versus 10 2 fe2p hr xps analysis revealed that both fe2 and fe3 are present on the fdbc due to immobilized fe3o4 and fe2o3 phases on the surface fig 4c we acquired xps spectra and data to track the mild changes on the fdbc surface before and after mb uptake at different phs 3 7 and 10 after exposing the fdbc to mb molecules at ph 7 the atomic percentage of o2 groups slightly decreased from 10 1 to 8 4 on the surface the fdbc has magnetite with local pzc of 6 5 milonjić et al 1983 some deprotonated groups like fe o on the surface display little electrostatic mb attractions scheme 1 hydrogen bonding is also possible between the surfaces with a higher oxygen content and c s and c n functionalities of mb n1s spectrum fig 4f shows a new peak at 399 7 ev n atomic percentage 0 3 denoting n ch3 2 from mb is bound to the fdbc after mb uptake ren et al 2021 the aromatic groups of mb can react with graphitic carbons present in fdbc via π π interactions gong et al 2015 therefore in addition to the physisorption the mb removal by fdbc possibly occurs via coulombic interaction π π interactions and hydrogen bonding 4 conclusions the biochars wide availability fast kinetics and appreciable adsorption capacities are significantly important for large scale applications in this study facile synthesis of magnetic fe3o4 modified douglas fir biochar fdbc was carried out employing a commercial fast pyrolyzed douglas fir biochar dbc under neutral conditions the fdbc offers a larger methylene blue removal than the dbc 740 5 mg g versus 634 0 mg g at 1500 ppm initial mb concentration from aqueous solutions due to the large concentrations of surface deposited 11 0 nm fe3o4 particles narrow pores 1 6 2 2 nm were detected on the fdbc the fdbc has a less basic surface point of zero charges for fdbc versus dbc were 8 2 and 10 2 which is hydrophilic xps analysis revealed a higher surface oh 7 8 versus 2 6 and c o 3 5 versus 2 1 at percentages on the fdbc than on the dbc the current study showed that mb sorption onto the fdbc and dbc surfaces are fast and occurred with very high capacities at 25 c and ph 6 8 compared to dbc fdbc offers a larger mb removal capacity and is more economical as it can be easily synthesized from affordable and readily available fe2 fe3 salts and implemented without filtration the fdbc shows a ph independent mb uptake and facillitates with watewater treatment over a wide ph range further a slight decrease of fdbc s surface oxygen content at higher ph levels indicates the mb removal via coulombic interaction fdbc satisfactorily removes three co existing dyes mb bp and bg with a 100 mb removal dye uptakes on the dbc and fdbc are spontaneous and followed by pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir models magnetic modification may be important as these materials can avoid recovery problems of non magnetic sorbents direct application of magnetic variant fdbc saves both time and energy the fdbc can be regenerated and recycled for a few cycles further regeneration studies and simultaneous removal studies using multiple inorganic contaminants are required to assess the complete economic efficiency of these adsorbents funding this
