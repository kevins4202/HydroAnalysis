water quality and water quantity the long term quantification of these fluxes is difficult as field conditions dictate when data can be collected ultimately there is a pressing necessity to quantify these long term flow regimes as impacts from a changing climate are altering the timing and extent of key groundwater surface water interactions the use of periodic temperature time series data is one method that can be utilized to capture these fluxes over long periods of time long term deployment of temperature sensors continuously logging temperature time series data can be leveraged into time varying darcy fluxes via time series analysis and the advection dispersion equation however as hydrologic boundary conditions change fluxes transition in both magnitude and direction and these temperature time series based methods are less capable of accurately quantifying fluxes real world data taken from five existing united states geological survey paired stream gages and riparian

introduction the movement of water across the groundwater surface water gw sw interface is spatially and temporally dynamic due to changes in surface water and water table levels through time wondzell 2015 this movement of water acts to facilitate essential functions such as the cycling of nutrients like organic carbon nitrate and phosphate boulton et al 1998 findlay et al 1993 hill 1996 supporting ecological niches through thermal refugia briggs et al 2013 isaak et al 2015 kurylyk et al 2015 pollutant buffering and attenuation fuller and harvey 2000 gandy et al 2007 smith and lerner 2008 and providing baseflow to streams freeze 1972 neff et al 2005 winter 1999 zhang et al 2020 these interactions while difficult to conceptualize and measure due to their non uniform distribution in space and time cheng et al 2019 kong et al 2019 song et al 2019 are integral for stream health and function fleckenstein et al 2010 larned et al 2015 winter et al 1998 an often overlooked portion of the river network headwater streams stream order of 1 or 2 make up 75 of total stream length within the united states leopold et al 1995 playing a pivotal role in downstream water quality and quantity due to gw sw interactions headwater streams have been shown to retain and transform nutrients at a high rate playing a major role in downstream water quality by controlling the timing distance and form of solute transport that is exported downstream alexander et al 2007 peterson et al 2001 seybold and mcglynn 2018 in the context of a changing climate global flow regimes are anticipated to change dependent on regional changes in precipitation frequency and phase arnell and gosling 2013 d√∂ll and schmied 2012 knowles et al 2006 trenberth 2011 altering the timing extent and duration of peak stream flow through headwater systems potentially impacting future downstream water quality and availability of surface water for public consumption and agricultural needs rauscher et al 2008 stewart et al 2005 as gw sw interactions are vital for the health and function of water bodies the ability to quantify darcy fluxes also commonly referred to as seepage fluxes or specific discharges l t 1 across the gw sw interface continuously over longer periods of time e g months to years is essential for determining how these changes to flow regime magnitude and timing will influence water quality water supply and ecology in both the short and long term there are numerous methods that are capable of quantifying darcy fluxes across the gw sw interface these methods range from point in space measurements such as mini piezometers baxter et al 2003 lee and cherry 1979 pretty et al 2006 and seepage meters burnett et al 2006 lee 1977 rosenberry 2008 to spatially integrated measurements such as differential gaging mccallum et al 2012a 2012b ruehl et al 2006 unland et al 2013 and solute tracer tests langston et al 2013 leblanc et al 1991 payn et al 2009 typically these methods are applied under ideal conditions when field sites are safely accessible i e low flow conditions and over short periods of time ranging from days to weeks with multiple sampling events interspersed throughout the field campaign the limitations associated with these methods makes them ill suited to capture event based anthropogenic or meteorological changes to hydraulic head gradients as systems of interest may not be accessible during these times further for the capture of seasonal changes to gw sw interactions driven by processes such as snowmelt or baseflow recession these methods are incapable of the continuous collection of data through time and require an in field operator to physically collect these data with the advent of cost effective continuously logging waterproof temperature sensors coupled with new and improved methods the use of heat as an environmental tracer for the quantification of darcy fluxes through time is an attractive option to tackle this problem the earth is exposed to solar energy throughout the day warming surface waters and establishing thermal gradients in the subsurface due to the periodic conductive heat signal as water moves across the gw sw interface heat begins to be transferred through advective transport perturbing the established thermal gradient this perturbation allows for the quantification of darcy fluxes across the gw sw interface several methodologies have been developed on the basis of stallman s 1965 analytical solution for the vertical transport of heat and fluid through porous media and the collection of temperature time series data from beneath streams lapham 1989 to quantify darcy fluxes goto et al 2005 hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 luce et al 2013 mccallum et al 2012a 2012b these methods rely on the recording of temperatures at various vertically spaced depths beneath a surface water body through time from these temperature time series data amplitude ratios phase lags or the combination of amplitudes and phase lags for distinct sensor pairs are used to quantify darcy fluxes through time it is important to note that while stallman s 1965 analytical solution is valid only for the quantification of vertical fluxes lateral components of flux do occur in nature but are not considered when this solution is used in natural systems the fundamental assumptions that underpin the analytical solution for the one dimensional heat transport equation are often violated resulting in the introduction of error to darcy flux estimates these include converging and diverging flow fields cuthbert and mackay 2013 two dimensional roshan et al 2012 and three dimensional flow fields reeves and hatch 2016 assumed boundary condition violations lautz 2010 luce et al 2017 schornberg et al 2010 transient darcy fluxes rau et al 2015 and heterogeneous geologic and thermal properties birkel et al 2016 irvine et al 2015a 2015b shanafield et al 2011 although measurable error is introduced with each violation of a fundamental assumption the use of temperature time series methods is still a reliable and often used method for quantifying darcy fluxes across the gw sw interface when utilized in appropriate situations and in instances where there is uncertainty it is advised to apply an independent method to verify darcy flux estimates the objective of this work is to establish whether periodic temperature time series data can be used to continuously and successfully quantify darcy fluxes across the gw sw interface through time and if not to determine the underlying root cause of any inaccuracies we utilize a fully coupled one dimensional groundwater and heat transport numerical model that is driven by temperature and hydrologic boundary conditions specified using real world data collected as part of a previously completed united states geological survey usgs pilot program eddy miller et al 2012 darcy fluxes were quantified from the temperature time series data using the combined phase shift and amplitude ratio method and directly compared to darcy fluxes quantified using darcy s law if temperature as a tracer for the quantification of continuous darcy fluxes is shown to be successful through time it would allow for the continuous monitoring of gw sw interaction sites to determine the timing or duration of events of interest in a cost effective manner 2 methods using a fully coupled one dimensional groundwater flow and heat transport model developed in glose et al 2019 we performed forward numerical simulations to produce temperature time series data using real world boundary conditions obtained from usgs data these data were refined to reflect the resolution of a commonly used temperature sensor in groundwater surface water interaction studies irvine et al 2017 we then used the combined phase shift and amplitude ratio method luce et al 2013 to estimate darcy fluxes based on the periodic temperature time series data output by the forward model these temperature derived darcy fluxes were then compared to the hydrologically derived darcy fluxes quantified directly in the model finally the temperature derived darcy fluxes were used to calculate the inferred p√©clet number to determine the percentage of total darcy flux estimates that would require a secondary measurement to verify that they are accurate glose et al 2019 2 1 surface water groundwater data driven boundary conditions the united states geological survey began conducting a series of pilot studies within wyoming montana and mississippi in 2009 with the goal of collecting coupled groundwater and surface water data using co located active stream gaging sites with shallow groundwater wells to assist in evaluating gw sw interactions eddy miller et al 2012 these data include stream and groundwater temperature stream stage and groundwater head through time and are readily available through the usgs national water information system for this study five sites were selected three in wyoming one in montana and one in mississippi with data associated with each site being used as temperature and hydrologic boundary conditions for the one dimensional forward numerical model fig 1 each forward model scenario is not intended to be a site specific representation with real world implications rather the real world data is used to drive the forward model allowing for real world variability to be introduced and the ability of temperature time series methods to quantify darcy fluxes through time to be assessed temperature and water level data were collected at 15 minute intervals for the sites in wyoming and montana while these data were collected at hourly intervals for the site in mississippi 2 2 forward numerical modeling using a fully coupled one dimensional heat transport stallman 1965 eq 1 and groundwater flow eq 2 model glose et al 2019 developed in comsol multiphysics li et al 2009 temperature time series data were generated from the applied real world temperature and water level boundary conditions 1 Œª œÅ c 2 t z 2 œÅ w c w œÅ c t z q t t 2 k 2 h z 2 s y h t where t c is temperature z l is depth below the sediment water

have unique vertical domain lengths reflecting the varying depths at which groundwater temperature and hydraulic head data were collected in the field which resulted in changes to the number of nodes in each model in the field each stream and groundwater well contained a pressure transducer located in the stream and middle of the screened interval of each well respectively collecting data at 15 minute or hourly intervals we assumed that the pressure transducers collecting these data were vertically aligned in space transposing the groundwater data with the assumption that head at the groundwater well is the same as that beneath the stream this allows for vertical flow paths to be assumed fig 2 boano et al 2014 following stallman s 1965 assumption we assume the system to be homogeneous between the streambed and the pressure transducer as the usgs national water information system does not provide geologic information outside of general regional aquifer classification the authors relied on supplemental studies keefer 1970 lowham 1982 marvin and voeller 2000 saucier 1994 conducted along each river to gather sediment information which were then used to determine geologic and thermal property estimates from domenico and schwartz 1998 and lapham 1989 respectively table 1 we assume that all thermal and geologic properties remain constant in time for each model temperature time series data were exported on an hourly interval every five centimeters below the streambed up to and including 25 cm below the surface these five distinct depths are representative of locations within the subsurface where temperature sensors would be deployed within a typical field setting in order to capture useable data briggs et al 2014 sensor pairs were selected based on holding the sensor at five centimeters depth as the upper most sensor for each pairing and then selecting each subsequent sensor as the lower sensor e g sensor pairs of five and 10 cm five and 15 cm etc the matlab solver vflux2 was used to estimate darcy fluxes using the combined phase shift and amplitude ratio method gordon et al 2012 irvine et al 2015b vflux2 takes the input temperature time series filters and downsamples these data and extracts the isolated fundamental temperature signal based on the period of oscillation of interest in this case a diel signal using dynamic harmonic regression young et al 1999 darcy flux estimates based on darcy s law were also exported from the model domain for selected sensor pairs resulting in four unique darcy flux values calculated at depths of 7 5 cm 10 cm 12 5 cm and 15 cm the temperature time series exported from the forward model have a resolution that is far finer 10 15 c than sensors that are typically deployed in field settings e g 0 01 c 0 02 c 0 0625 c irvine et al 2017 prior to quantifying darcy fluxes via vflux2 using the combined phase shift and amplitude ratio method the temperature time series data were rounded to a temperature resolution of 0 02 c reflecting a commonly used sensor the daily average of the four unique darcy fluxes calculated and exported from comsol multiphysics hereafter referred to as the prescribed darcy fluxes were then directly compared to the daily average of the four unique darcy fluxes quantified from the combined phase shift and amplitude ratio method referred to as the temperature derived darcy fluxes the differences in the direction and magnitude between the prescribed and temperature derived darcy flux were quantified for each model as well as the absolute error between individual darcy flux estimates using the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient the temperature derived darcy fluxes compared to the prescribed darcy fluxes were evaluated for accuracy nash and sutcliffe 1970 defined as the ratio between advective and conductive heat transport the dimensionless p√©clet number can be used to determine which method of heat transport is most dominant in a system fowler 1990 glose et al 2019 proposed the use of inferred p√©clet numbers as a metric for the reliability of the combined amplitude phase shift method following that methodology we calculated inferred p√©clet numbers for each modeled scenario to provide a metric for the reliability of the temperature derived darcy fluxes 3 results three of the five sites selected for this study resulted in a quantification of temperature derived darcy fluxes through time across the gw sw interface that closely approximated the prescribed darcy fluxes stations along the wind green and new fork rivers as the differences between the three successful stations were minimal only the station along the wind river will be used from here on the remaining two can be found in the supplemental material figs s1 and s2 the remaining two sites while able to provide a continuous estimate of darcy flux through time did so inaccurately when compared to the prescribed darcy flux stations along the big hole and tallahatchie rivers for all following results we use the same coordinate convention that is used in vflux2 which specifies that a downward or recharging darcy flux is a positive value while an upward or discharging darcy flux is a negative value gordon et al 2012 irvine et al 2015b 3 1 wind river near kinnear wyoming usgs station 06227600 the wind river a 6th order stream located within the kinnear valley in wyoming has seasonal high flows occurring in mid june to mid july and seasonal lows occurring in mid april and mid october for the period of april 1 2012 to october 31 2012 the prescribed darcy flux and the temperature derived darcy flux are in good agreement capturing sudden changes in darcy flux see may 1 and june 1 with small deviations between each and oscillations of the temperature derived darcy fluxes above and below the prescribed darcy fluxes throughout the study period fig 3 a when directly comparing the two methods for darcy flux quantification the prescribed darcy flux and the temperature derived darcy flux fall closely to the one to one line with few exceptions resulting in a root mean square error of 0 0147 m d 1 which is 18 6 of the mean prescribed darcy flux value 0 0791 m d 1 fig 3b the temperature derived darcy fluxes matched the prescribed darcy fluxes well in both magnitude and direction with only 1 8 of the total number of darcy flux estimates indicating an opposite direction of flow fig 3b red triangles the small deviations in time can be more readily observed by looking at the absolute error between the prescribed darcy flux and temperature derived darcy flux fig 3c although there are periods in time that exhibit large absolute errors relative to the rest of these data the mean absolute error is 0 0087 m d 1 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient value was 0 81 indicating that the temperature derived darcy flux estimates are accurate in comparison to the prescribed darcy fluxes both the prescribed darcy flux and temperature derived darcy flux indicate the system is experiencing recharge conditions nearly the entire time which is mostly in agreement with the observed surface water and groundwater levels used to drive the forward model fig 3d the few instances of discharge that are captured by both the prescribed and temperature derived darcy flux are a result of localized changes in gradient instead of global changes as the temperature time series data are collected from the upper 25 cm of the model domain changes in surface water stage will drive localized changes 25 cm in gradient that are not reflective of the global gradient 200 cm 3 2 big hole river near melrose montana usgs station 062025500 before flowing into the ruby valley the big hole river near melrose montana a 5th order stream is marked by flows typically peaking around early june followed by a baseflow recession that ends in mid september for the time period of may 1 2012 until september 30 2012 the temperature derived darcy flux time series exhibits an oscillatory pattern that deviates above and below the prescribed darcy flux time series for the duration of the study fig 4 a unlike the wind river this oscillatory behavior is the root cause of temperature derived darcy flux estimates that are in the opposite direction of the prescribed darcy flux with 18 3 of the total darcy flux estimates being in the incorrect direction fig 4b red triangles this increase in darcy flux estimates indicating opposite directions of flow is due to the prescribed darcy flux being close to zero throughout the study period for both prescribed and temperature derived darcy fluxes small changes in localized gradients are much more influential when darcy fluxes are near zero causing oscillations between recharging and discharging conditions to occur throughout the study period although there are numerous darcy fluxes that are indicating an incorrect direction the root mean square error is 0 0107 m d 1 which is 315 larger than the mean prescribed darcy flux value 0 0034 m d 1 the absolute error between the prescribed darcy flux and the temperature derived darcy flux has the same oscillatory pattern that was observed in the darcy flux time series resulting in a small mean absolute error of 0 0082 m d 1 fig 4c however the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient value is 0 17 which indicates that the temperature derived darcy fluxes are not accurate when comparing to the prescribed darcy fluxes the darcy flux time series indicates the system starts in a state of recharge with swift changes in magnitude before transitioning to discharge conditions with the occasional transition from discharge to recharge conditions e g mid july this overall pattern is observed in the surface water and groundwater level data that are used to drive the forward model with the system starting out with transitions in the hydraulic gradient occurring before settling into a discharge driven system in the later portion of the time analyzed fig 4d 3 3 tallahatchie river near allen mississippi usgs station 07280010 located near allen mississippi the station along the tallahatchie river a 7th order stream is subjected to drastic increases in stream stage over short periods of time due to large precipitation events and upstream reservoir operations for most of the study period between april 1 2017 and october 31 2017 the temperature derived and prescribed darcy flux time series do not agree with each other for large portions of the record with large discrepancies in both magnitude and direction fig 5 a with 33 of temperature derived darcy flux estimates misidentifying the direction of flow the site along the tallahatchie river fig 5b red triangles this marked increase in misidentified darcy flux direction is associated with a dramatic increase in the root mean square error rmse 0 1939 m d 1 which is 1630 of the mean prescribed darcy flux value of 0 012 m d 1 there are also instances of large absolute errors between the prescribed darcy flux and the temperature derived darcy flux with the average absolute error being 0 1054 m d 1 fig 5c this inaccuracy is also captured by the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient with a value of 2 86 indicating that the variance in the residuals is greater than the variance of the prescribed darcy fluxes the darcy flux time series indicates the system transitions from gaining to losing conditions multiple times over the course of the year with extremely quick transitions on the order of two to three days being common this is evident from the groundwater and surface water level time series with large sudden shifts in surface water level commonly occurring due to large precipitation events fig 5d while the prescribed and temperature derived darcy flux estimates capture this pattern of transition from gaining to losing conditions and vice versa they do not do so accurately with instances of darcy flux estimates being in opposing directions commonly occurring and large values of absolute error between the prescribed and temperature derived darcy flux 3 4 inferred p√©clet number quantification as the combined phase shift and amplitude ratio method relies on advective transport being the dominant component of heat transport the p√©clet number is a natural choice for the evaluation of temperature time series based methods glose et al 2019 goto et al 2005 in glose et al 2019 a relationship between the theoretical p√©clet number calculated using the typical range of darcy fluxes observed in the field hatch et al 2006 and the inferred p√©clet number calculated using the temperature derived darcy fluxes quantified in the field was established over a range of sensor resolutions commonly used in hydrologic studies irvine et al 2017 this relationship allows for the assessment of the accuracy of temperature derived darcy fluxes quantified in a field setting and whether or not a secondary independent measurement is needed for a sensor resolution of 0 02 c the acceptable inferred p√©clet number threshold is 0 5 for recharge conditions equating to a darcy flux of 0 05 m d 1 with any value below this threshold suggesting that a secondary independent measurement be collected to ensure the magnitude and direction of temperature derived darcy fluxes is correct as an inferred p√©clet number threshold could not be established for discharging conditions only temperature derived darcy fluxes that indicated recharge conditions were considered for further explanation on how these thresholds were determined readers are directed to glose et al 2019 for the five sites used in this study results indicate that all streams would need some sort of independent verification table 2 4 discussion 4 1 violations of method assumptions drive errors in temperature derived darcy flux estimates for each of the sites that successfully produced darcy flux estimates through time the surface water and groundwater level boundary conditions exhibited the same general characteristics changes in surface water level are mirrored in the groundwater level and the general trend of increasing or decreasing level through time is preserved in contrast the tallahatchie river rmse of 0 1939 m d 1 exhibits a different trend large surface water level changes through time are common in the tallahatchie river over the duration of the study period with the largest being a 4 23 m change in stream level that occurred over five days causing rapid changes in hydraulic gradient fig s3 these peaks correlate with major rain events that occurred over the area with a 10 cm precipitation event immediately preceding the largest change in stream stage during these quick rises in stream level two fundamental assumptions are violated the violation is that these quick rises in stream stage drive surface water into the subsurface and create linear temperature time series at the locations where temperature signals are collected and subsequently used to quantify temperature derived darcy fluxes as vflux2 utilizes a signal processing routine the quality of the input data directly influences the output data in this case the input data does not exhibit the assumed diel periodicity that is expected leading to the signal processing routine that is used dynamic harmonic regression to extract the fundamental frequency associated with that diel periodicity even though it is not there this leads to erroneous temperature derived darcy flux estimates these violations are occurring within all of the data used in this study the largest absolute errors and wide variability of darcy fluxes figs 3 5 a c occur when there are large changes in head gradient figs 3 5 d at each location where the input data was collected in general it appears that sharp increases in stage correlate with negative absolute errors and sharp decreases in stage correlate to increases in stage e g fig 3 c d starting october 1 the second assumption violated is that the darcy flux in this case is unsteady flow within the daily period required for the use of temperature time series methods due to the changes in the hydraulic gradient ultimately leading to errors in darcy flux estimates when using vflux2 this is not to say that vflux2 is the reason for inaccurate darcy flux estimates but that using temperature time series data collected in periods of time where fundamental assumptions are violated stallman 1965 will inherently yield inaccurate darcy flux estimates in environments that are characterized by quick large transitions in hydrologic boundary conditions the use of heat as an environmental tracer for the quantification of darcy fluxes should be applied cautiously when analyzing the first derivative of temperature derived darcy flux versus the absolute error it is clear that the violation of these two assumptions contributes to the overall absolute error as the rate of change in the temperature derived darcy flux increases so does the absolute error i e the grosser the violation of the assumption the larger the absolute error is fig 6 4 2 low flux environment limitations the amplitude of the periodic temperature time series data collected by an individual sensor is dictated by the sensor resolution the depth of the sensor and thermal properties of the saturated media the amplitude of the observed temperature signal becomes damped with increasing depth until reaching a constant temperature which is equal to the annual average ambient air temperature of the region fig 7 a stallman 1965 the resolution of the sensor used to record this temperature signal dictates the possible range of amplitudes that can be observed any change in the temperature signal below the sensor resolution are recorded as the same temperature as the previous measurement creating a range of possible temperature values that are not expressed in these data fig 7b periodic temperature time series methods rely on the amplitude ratio between two sensors which is found by dividing the amplitude recorded at a deeper sensor by the amplitude recorded at a shallower sensor the uncertainty from the raw recorded temperature is propagated through the calculation of the amplitude ratio see color bands in fig 7b c for uncertainty associated with the amplitude ratio calculation sensor pairs closer to the surface assuming there is enough separation and sufficient sensor resolution to yield a useable signal will yield less uncertainty than those found using either deeper sensor pairs or sensors with large separation fig 7c this is due to the fact that shallower sensors record larger amplitudes where deeper sensors record smaller amplitudes and when dividing these two values the division of two larger values is more precise i e less uncertain when compared to the division of two smaller values in low flux environments the amplitude recorded at depth is even more muted than in high flux environments exacerbating this phenomenon lapham 1989 stallman 1965 additionally in low flux environments localized changes in gradient will have a greater impact on darcy fluxes causing fluctuations between recharging and discharging conditions to occur when considering the sites along the wind green new fork and big hole rivers each exhibits an oscillatory pattern in the temperature derived darcy flux estimate for some period of time across all four sites this oscillatory pattern occurs as darcy fluxes approach zero the big hole river site is unique in that for the entirety of the study period the prescribed darcy flux value is near zero which results in the oscillatory nature of the temperature derived darcy flux values as the amplitude ratio portion of the combined phase shift and amplitude ratio method provides the direction of flow it also dictates the oscillations observed in the temperature derived darcy fluxes the calculated amplitude ratio found by dividing the amplitude of the deeper sensor by the shallower sensor is dependent on the thermal properties of the system and the depth at which temperature time series data are collected as darcy fluxes approach zero there are associated depth dependent amplitude ratio threshold values that dictate whether a darcy flux estimate will indicate discharge or recharge conditions as the hydrologic system changes through time so does the recorded temperature time series and thus the amplitude ratio in low flux environments temporal changes in the amplitude ratio can drift above or below this depth dependent threshold value that dictates a discharge or recharge darcy flux estimate however the transition across this threshold value does not occur at the same instance in time for all sensor pairs uncertainty due to a combination of sensor resolution and sensor spacing can cause the magnitude of quantified darcy fluxes to indicate recharge conditions for some sensor pairs while indicating discharge conditions for others depending on the resolution of the sensor used there is a plausible range of amplitude ratios that can be quantified which results in a range of possible darcy flux estimates see fig 8 shaded areas when compared to the prescribed darcy flux estimates it is clear this oscillatory nature in temperature derived darcy fluxes is due to changes in the amplitude ratio over time causing temperature derived darcy flux estimates to cross over the threshold that discharge or recharge darcy flux estimates compare fig 8a d 4 3 other potential sources of error as this study utilizes publicly available groundwater and surface water data to generate synthetic temperature time series data numerous assumptions have been made that could potentially lead to sources of error when periodic temperature time series methods are applied in the field in natural settings riverbed sediment distribution and properties are dynamic as bedforms change the depths of the temperature sensors can change as well which leads to changes in the temperature derived darcy flux which were not considered in this study the geologic and thermal properties assigned are based on reported literature values for the individual field locations and sediment descriptions these values have an inherent uncertainty which was not considered in this study which could lead to an increase in the plausible range of both the prescribed and temperature derived darcy flux values the potential impact of these assumptions should be considered when transitioning to a field setting 5 conclusions the long term quantification of darcy fluxes across the gw sw interface has been shown to be possible using heat as an environmental tracer when compared to prescribed darcy fluxes temperature time series methods were able to closely approximate darcy flux estimates in more stable hydrologic settings and when darcy fluxes were not near zero in value however results demonstrate heat as an environmental tracer is not always an appropriate method dramatic changes in stream stage for example lead to violations of the fundamental assumptions underlying the method and thus to errors in temperature derived darcy fluxes technological limitations in the form of sensor resolution and deployment mistakes such as using an inappropriate sensor spacing can also lead to erroneous darcy flux estimates in low flux environments we demonstrate the utility of the inferred p√©clet number to identify instances in which temperature derived darcy flux estimates may be inaccurate indicating that intermittent independent secondary measurements of darcy flux are important in low flux environments the long term quantification of darcy fluxes has the potential to help later studies assess the timing and duration of important processes such as nutrient loading water supply and changes in baseflow conditions through time and under a changing climate however when transitioning to dynamic natural systems bed sediment aggradation or degradation and changes in hydraulic conductivity values due to sediment flushing potentially lead to erroneous measurements it is important to consider these changes when deploying temperature sensors over long time periods and to anticipate potential dynamic changes to mitigate the potential of using inaccurate data independent measurements of darcy flux using a secondary method should be conducted throughout the temperature data collection duration it is important to reiterate that the results from this work are for one dimensional vertical flow across the gw sw interface groundwater surface water interactions are an inherently three dimensional process and the use of one dimensional methods to infer more complex three dimensional flow fields is not advised credit authorship contribution statement thomas j glose conceptualization methodology formal analysis

stream flow through headwater systems potentially impacting future downstream water quality and availability of surface water for public consumption and agricultural needs rauscher et al 2008 stewart et al 2005 as gw sw interactions are vital for the health and function of water bodies the ability to quantify darcy fluxes also commonly referred to as seepage fluxes or specific discharges l t 1 across the gw sw interface continuously over longer periods of time e g months to years is essential for determining how these changes to flow regime magnitude and timing will influence water quality water supply and ecology in both the short and long term there are numerous methods that are capable of quantifying darcy fluxes across the gw sw interface these methods range from point in space measurements such as mini piezometers baxter et al 2003 lee and cherry 1979 pretty et al 2006 and seepage meters burnett et al 2006 lee 1977 rosenberry 2008 to spatially integrated measurements such as differential gaging mccallum et al 2012a 2012b ruehl et al 2006 unland et al 2013 and solute tracer tests langston et al 2013 leblanc et al 1991 payn et al 2009 typically these methods are applied under ideal conditions when field sites are safely accessible i e low flow conditions and over short periods of time ranging from days to weeks with multiple sampling events interspersed throughout the field campaign the limitations associated with these methods makes them ill suited to capture event based anthropogenic or meteorological changes to hydraulic head gradients as systems of interest may not be accessible during these times further for the capture of seasonal changes to gw sw interactions driven by processes such as snowmelt or baseflow recession these methods are incapable of the continuous collection of data through time and require an in field operator to physically collect these data with the advent of cost effective continuously logging waterproof temperature sensors coupled with new and improved methods the use of heat as an environmental tracer for the quantification of darcy fluxes through time is an attractive option to tackle this problem the earth is exposed to solar energy throughout the day warming surface waters and establishing thermal gradients in the subsurface due to the periodic conductive heat signal as water moves across the gw sw interface heat begins to be transferred through advective transport perturbing the established thermal gradient this perturbation allows for the quantification of darcy fluxes across the gw sw interface several methodologies have been developed on the basis of stallman s 1965 analytical solution for the vertical transport of heat and fluid through porous media and the collection of temperature time series data from beneath streams lapham 1989 to quantify darcy fluxes goto et al 2005 hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 luce et al 2013 mccallum et al 2012a 2012b these methods rely on the recording of temperatures at various vertically spaced depths beneath a surface water body through time from these temperature time series data amplitude ratios phase lags or the combination of amplitudes and phase lags for distinct sensor pairs are used to quantify darcy fluxes through time it is important to note that while stallman s 1965 analytical solution is valid only for the quantification of vertical fluxes lateral components of flux do occur in nature but are not considered when this solution is used in natural systems the fundamental assumptions that underpin the analytical solution for the one dimensional heat transport equation are often violated resulting in the introduction of error to darcy flux estimates these include converging and diverging flow fields cuthbert and mackay 2013 two dimensional roshan et al 2012 and three dimensional flow fields reeves and hatch 2016 assumed boundary condition violations lautz 2010 luce et al 2017 schornberg et al 2010 transient darcy fluxes rau et al 2015 and heterogeneous geologic and thermal properties birkel et al 2016 irvine et al 2015a 2015b shanafield et al 2011 although measurable error is introduced with each violation of a fundamental assumption the use of temperature time series methods is still a reliable and often used method for quantifying darcy fluxes across the gw sw interface when utilized in appropriate situations and in instances where there is uncertainty it is advised to apply an independent method to verify darcy flux estimates the objective of this work is to establish whether periodic temperature time series data can be used to continuously and successfully quantify darcy fluxes across the gw sw interface through time and if not to determine the underlying root cause of any inaccuracies we utilize a fully coupled one dimensional groundwater and heat transport numerical model that is driven by temperature and hydrologic boundary conditions specified using real world data collected as part of a previously completed united states geological survey usgs pilot program eddy miller et al 2012 darcy fluxes were quantified from the temperature time series data using the combined phase shift and amplitude ratio method and directly compared to darcy fluxes quantified using darcy s law if temperature as a tracer for the quantification of continuous darcy fluxes is shown to be successful through time it would allow for the continuous monitoring of gw sw interaction sites to determine the timing or duration of events of interest in a cost effective manner 2 methods using a fully coupled one dimensional groundwater flow and heat transport model developed in glose et al 2019 we performed forward numerical simulations to produce temperature time series data using real world boundary conditions obtained from usgs data these data were refined to reflect the resolution of a commonly used temperature sensor in groundwater surface water interaction studies irvine et al 2017 we then used the combined phase shift and amplitude ratio method luce et al 2013 to estimate darcy fluxes based on the periodic temperature time series data output by the forward model these temperature derived darcy fluxes were then compared to the hydrologically derived darcy fluxes quantified directly in the model finally the temperature derived darcy fluxes were used to calculate the inferred p√©clet number to determine the percentage of total darcy flux estimates that would require a secondary measurement to verify that they are accurate glose et al 2019 2 1 surface water groundwater data driven boundary conditions the united states geological survey began conducting a series of pilot studies within wyoming montana and mississippi in 2009 with the goal of collecting coupled groundwater and surface water data using co located active stream gaging sites with shallow groundwater wells to assist in evaluating gw sw interactions eddy miller et al 2012 these data include stream and groundwater temperature stream stage and groundwater head through time and are readily available through the usgs national water information system for this study five sites were selected three in wyoming one in montana and one in mississippi with data associated with each site being used as temperature and hydrologic boundary conditions for the one dimensional forward numerical model fig 1 each forward model scenario is not intended to be a site specific representation with real world implications rather the real world data is used to drive the forward model allowing for real world variability to be introduced and the ability of temperature time series methods to quantify darcy fluxes through time to be assessed temperature and water level data were collected at 15 minute intervals for the sites in wyoming and montana while these data were collected at hourly intervals for the site in mississippi 2 2 forward numerical modeling using a fully coupled one dimensional heat transport stallman 1965 eq 1 and groundwater flow eq 2 model glose et al 2019 developed in comsol multiphysics li et al 2009 temperature time series data were generated

have unique vertical domain lengths reflecting the varying depths at which groundwater temperature and hydraulic head data were collected in the field which resulted in changes to the number of nodes in each model in the field each stream and groundwater well contained a pressure transducer located in the stream and middle of the screened interval of each well respectively collecting data at 15 minute or hourly intervals we assumed that the pressure transducers collecting these data were vertically aligned in space transposing the groundwater data with the assumption that head at the groundwater well is the same as that beneath the stream this allows for vertical flow paths to be assumed fig 2 boano et al 2014 following stallman s 1965 assumption we assume the system to be homogeneous between the streambed and the pressure transducer as the usgs national water information system does not provide geologic information outside of general regional aquifer classification the authors relied on supplemental studies keefer 1970 lowham 1982 marvin and voeller 2000 saucier 1994 conducted along each river to gather sediment information which were then used to determine geologic and thermal property estimates from domenico and schwartz 1998 and lapham 1989 respectively table 1 we assume that all thermal and geologic properties remain constant in time for each model temperature time series data were exported on an hourly interval every five centimeters below the streambed up to and including 25 cm below the surface these five distinct depths are representative of locations within the subsurface where temperature sensors would be deployed within a typical field setting in order to capture useable data briggs et al 2014 sensor pairs were selected based on holding the sensor at five centimeters depth as the upper most sensor for each pairing and then selecting each subsequent sensor as the lower sensor e g sensor pairs of five and 10 cm five and 15 cm etc the matlab solver vflux2 was used to estimate darcy fluxes using the combined phase shift and amplitude ratio method gordon et al 2012 irvine et al 2015b vflux2 takes the input temperature time series filters and downsamples these data and extracts the isolated fundamental temperature signal based on the period of oscillation of interest in this case a diel signal using dynamic harmonic regression young et al 1999 darcy flux estimates based on darcy s law were also exported from the model domain for selected sensor pairs resulting in four unique darcy flux values calculated at depths of 7 5 cm 10 cm 12 5 cm and 15 cm the temperature time series exported from the forward model have a resolution that is far finer 10 15 c than sensors that are typically deployed in field settings e g 0 01 c 0 02 c 0 0625 c irvine et al 2017 prior to quantifying darcy fluxes via vflux2 using the combined phase shift and amplitude ratio method the temperature time series data were rounded to a temperature resolution of 0 02 c reflecting a commonly used sensor the daily average of the four unique darcy fluxes calculated and exported from comsol multiphysics hereafter referred to as the prescribed darcy fluxes were then directly compared to the daily average of the four unique darcy fluxes quantified from the combined phase shift and amplitude ratio method referred to as the temperature derived darcy fluxes the differences in the direction and magnitude between the prescribed and temperature derived darcy flux were quantified for each model as well as the absolute error between individual darcy flux estimates using the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient the temperature derived darcy fluxes compared to the prescribed darcy fluxes were evaluated for accuracy nash and sutcliffe 1970 defined as the ratio between advective and conductive heat transport the dimensionless p√©clet number can be used to determine which method of heat transport is most dominant in a system fowler 1990 glose et al 2019 proposed the use of inferred p√©clet numbers as a metric for the reliability of the combined amplitude phase shift method following that methodology we calculated inferred p√©clet numbers for each modeled scenario to provide a metric for the reliability of the temperature derived darcy fluxes 3 results three of the five sites selected for this study resulted in a quantification of temperature derived darcy fluxes through time across the gw sw interface that closely approximated the prescribed darcy fluxes stations along the wind green and new fork rivers as the differences between the three successful stations were minimal only the station along the wind river will be used from here on the remaining two can be found in the supplemental material figs s1 and s2 the remaining two sites while able to provide a continuous estimate of darcy flux through time did so inaccurately when compared to the prescribed darcy flux stations along the big hole and tallahatchie rivers for all following results we use the same coordinate convention that is used in vflux2 which specifies that a downward or recharging darcy flux is a positive value while an upward or discharging darcy flux is a negative value gordon et al 2012 irvine et al 2015b 3 1 wind river near kinnear wyoming usgs station 06227600 the wind river a 6th order stream located within the kinnear valley in wyoming has seasonal high flows occurring in mid june to mid july and seasonal lows occurring in mid april and mid october for the period of april 1 2012 to october 31 2012 the prescribed darcy flux and the temperature derived darcy flux are in good agreement capturing sudden changes in darcy flux see may 1 and june 1 with small deviations between each and oscillations of the temperature derived darcy fluxes above and below the prescribed darcy fluxes throughout the study period fig 3 a when directly comparing the two methods for darcy flux quantification the prescribed darcy flux and the temperature derived darcy flux fall closely to the one to one line with few exceptions resulting in a root mean square error of 0 0147 m d 1 which is 18 6 of the mean prescribed darcy flux value 0 0791 m d 1 fig 3b the temperature derived darcy fluxes matched the prescribed darcy fluxes well in both magnitude and direction with only 1 8 of the total number of darcy flux estimates indicating an opposite direction of flow fig 3b red triangles the small deviations in time can be more readily observed by looking at the absolute error between the prescribed darcy flux and temperature derived darcy flux fig 3c although there are periods in time that exhibit large absolute errors relative to the rest of these data the mean absolute error is 0 0087 m d 1 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient value was 0 81 indicating that the temperature derived darcy flux estimates are accurate in comparison to the prescribed darcy fluxes both the prescribed darcy flux and temperature derived darcy flux indicate the system is experiencing recharge conditions nearly the entire time which is mostly in agreement with the observed surface water and groundwater levels used to drive the forward model fig 3d the few instances of discharge that are captured by both the prescribed and temperature derived darcy flux are a result of localized changes in gradient instead of global changes as the temperature time series data are collected from the upper 25 cm of the model domain changes in surface water stage will drive localized changes 25 cm in gradient that are not reflective of the global gradient 200 cm 3 2 big hole river near melrose montana usgs station 062025500 before flowing into the ruby valley the big hole river near melrose montana a 5th order stream is marked by flows typically peaking around early june followed by a baseflow recession that ends in mid september for the time period of may 1 2012 until september 30 2012 the temperature derived darcy flux time series exhibits an oscillatory pattern that deviates above and below the prescribed darcy flux time series for the duration of the study fig 4 a unlike the wind river this oscillatory behavior is the root cause of temperature derived darcy flux estimates that are in the opposite direction of the prescribed darcy flux with 18 3 of the total darcy flux estimates being in the incorrect direction fig 4b red triangles this increase in darcy flux estimates indicating opposite directions of flow is due to the prescribed darcy flux being close to zero throughout the study period for both prescribed and temperature derived darcy fluxes small changes in localized gradients are much more influential when darcy fluxes are near zero causing oscillations between recharging and discharging conditions to occur throughout the study period although there are numerous darcy fluxes that are indicating an incorrect direction the root mean square error is 0 0107 m d 1 which is 315 larger than the mean prescribed darcy flux value 0 0034 m d 1 the absolute error between the prescribed darcy flux and the temperature derived darcy flux has the same oscillatory pattern that was observed in the darcy flux time series resulting in a small mean absolute error of 0 0082 m d 1 fig 4c however the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient value is 0 17 which indicates that the temperature derived darcy fluxes are not accurate when comparing to the prescribed darcy fluxes the darcy flux time series indicates the system starts in a state of recharge with swift changes in magnitude before transitioning to discharge conditions with the occasional transition from discharge to recharge conditions e g mid july this overall pattern is observed in the surface water and groundwater level data that are used to drive the forward model with the system starting out with transitions in the hydraulic gradient occurring before settling into a discharge driven system in the later portion of the time analyzed fig 4d 3 3 tallahatchie river near allen mississippi usgs station 07280010 located near allen mississippi the station along the tallahatchie river a 7th order stream is subjected to drastic increases in stream stage over short periods of time due to large precipitation events and upstream reservoir operations for most of the study period between april 1 2017 and october 31 2017 the temperature derived and prescribed darcy flux time series do not agree with each other for large portions of the record with large discrepancies in both magnitude and direction fig 5 a with 33 of temperature derived darcy flux estimates misidentifying the direction of flow the site along the tallahatchie river fig 5b red triangles this marked increase in misidentified darcy flux direction is associated with a dramatic increase in the root mean square error rmse 0 1939 m d 1 which is 1630 of the mean prescribed darcy flux value of 0 012 m d 1 there are also instances of large absolute errors between the prescribed darcy flux and the temperature derived darcy flux with the average absolute error being 0 1054 m d 1 fig 5c this inaccuracy is also captured by the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient with a value of 2 86 indicating that the variance in the residuals is greater than the variance of the prescribed darcy fluxes the darcy flux time series indicates the system transitions from gaining to losing conditions multiple times over the course of the year with extremely quick transitions on the order of two to three days being common this is evident from the groundwater and surface water level time series with large sudden shifts in surface water level commonly occurring due to large precipitation events fig 5d while the prescribed and temperature derived darcy flux estimates capture this pattern of transition from gaining to losing conditions and vice versa they do not do so accurately with instances of darcy flux estimates being in opposing directions commonly occurring and large values of absolute error between the prescribed and temperature derived darcy flux 3 4 inferred p√©clet number quantification as the combined phase shift and amplitude ratio method relies on advective transport being the dominant component of heat transport the p√©clet number is a natural choice for the evaluation of temperature time series based methods glose et al 2019 goto et al 2005 in glose et al 2019 a relationship between the theoretical p√©clet number calculated using the typical range of darcy fluxes observed in the field hatch et al 2006 and the inferred p√©clet number calculated using the temperature derived darcy fluxes quantified in the field was established over a range of sensor resolutions commonly used in hydrologic studies irvine et al 2017 this relationship allows for the assessment of the accuracy of temperature derived darcy fluxes quantified in a field setting and whether or not a secondary independent measurement is needed for a sensor resolution of 0 02 c the acceptable inferred p√©clet number threshold is 0 5 for recharge conditions equating to a darcy flux of 0 05 m d 1 with any value below this threshold suggesting that a secondary independent measurement be collected to ensure the magnitude and direction of temperature derived darcy fluxes is correct as an inferred p√©clet number threshold could not be established for discharging conditions only temperature derived darcy fluxes that indicated recharge conditions were considered for further explanation on how these thresholds were determined readers are directed to glose et al 2019 for the five sites used in this study results indicate that all streams would need some sort of independent verification table 2 4 discussion 4 1 violations of method assumptions drive errors in temperature derived darcy flux estimates for each of the sites that successfully produced darcy flux estimates through time the surface water and groundwater level boundary conditions exhibited the same general characteristics changes in surface water level are mirrored in the groundwater level and the general trend of increasing or decreasing level through time is preserved in contrast the tallahatchie river rmse of 0 1939 m d 1 exhibits a different trend large surface water level changes through time are common in the tallahatchie river over the duration of the study period with the largest being a 4 23 m change in stream level that occurred over five days causing rapid changes in hydraulic gradient fig s3 these peaks correlate with major rain events that occurred over the area with a 10 cm precipitation event immediately preceding the largest change in stream stage during these quick rises in stream level two fundamental assumptions are violated the violation is that these quick rises in stream stage drive surface water into the subsurface and create linear temperature time series at the locations where temperature signals are collected and subsequently used to quantify temperature derived darcy fluxes as vflux2 utilizes a signal processing routine the quality of the input data directly influences the output data in this case the input data does not exhibit the assumed diel periodicity that is expected leading to the signal processing routine that is used dynamic harmonic regression to extract the fundamental frequency associated with that diel periodicity even though it is not there this leads to erroneous temperature derived darcy flux estimates these violations are occurring within all of the data used in this study the largest absolute errors and wide variability of darcy fluxes figs 3 5 a c occur when there are large changes in head gradient figs 3 5 d at each location where the input data was collected in general it appears that sharp increases in stage correlate with negative absolute errors and sharp decreases in stage correlate to increases in stage e g fig 3 c d starting october 1 the second assumption violated is that the darcy flux in this case is unsteady flow within the daily period required for the use of temperature time series methods due to the changes in the hydraulic gradient ultimately leading to errors in darcy flux estimates when using vflux2 this is not to say that vflux2 is the reason for inaccurate darcy flux estimates but that using temperature time series data collected in periods of time where fundamental assumptions are violated stallman 1965 will inherently yield inaccurate darcy flux estimates in environments that are characterized by quick large transitions in hydrologic boundary conditions the use of heat as an environmental tracer for the quantification of darcy fluxes should be applied cautiously when analyzing the first derivative of temperature derived darcy flux versus the absolute error it is clear that the violation of these two assumptions contributes to the overall absolute error as the rate of change in the temperature derived darcy flux increases so does the absolute error i e the grosser the violation of the assumption the larger the absolute error is fig 6 4 2 low flux environment limitations the amplitude of the periodic temperature time series data collected by an individual sensor is dictated by the sensor resolution the depth of the sensor and thermal properties of the saturated media the amplitude of the observed temperature signal becomes damped with increasing depth until reaching a constant temperature which is equal to the annual average ambient air temperature of the region fig 7 a stallman 1965 the resolution of the sensor used to record this temperature signal dictates the possible range of amplitudes that can be observed any change in the temperature signal below the sensor resolution are recorded as the same temperature as the previous measurement creating a range of possible temperature values that are not expressed in these data fig 7b periodic temperature time series methods rely on the amplitude ratio between two sensors which is found by dividing the amplitude recorded at a deeper sensor by the amplitude recorded at a shallower sensor the uncertainty from the raw recorded temperature is propagated through the calculation of the amplitude ratio see color bands in fig 7b c for uncertainty associated with the amplitude ratio calculation sensor pairs closer to the surface assuming there is enough separation and sufficient sensor resolution to yield a useable signal will yield less uncertainty than those found using either deeper sensor pairs or sensors with large separation fig 7c this is due to the fact that shallower sensors record larger amplitudes where deeper sensors record smaller amplitudes and when dividing these two values the division of two larger values is more precise i e less uncertain when compared to the division of two smaller values in low flux environments the amplitude recorded at depth is even more muted than in high flux environments exacerbating this phenomenon lapham 1989 stallman 1965 additionally in low flux environments localized changes in gradient will have a greater impact on darcy fluxes causing fluctuations between recharging and discharging conditions to occur when considering the sites along the wind green new fork and big hole rivers each exhibits an oscillatory pattern in the temperature derived darcy flux estimate for some period of time across all four sites this oscillatory pattern occurs as darcy fluxes approach zero the big hole river site is unique in that for the entirety of the study period the prescribed darcy flux value is near zero which results in the oscillatory nature of the temperature derived darcy flux values as the amplitude ratio portion of the combined phase shift and amplitude ratio method provides the direction of flow it also dictates the oscillations observed in the temperature derived darcy fluxes the calculated amplitude ratio found by dividing the amplitude of the deeper sensor by the shallower sensor is dependent on the thermal properties of the system and the depth at which temperature time series data are collected as darcy fluxes approach zero there are associated depth dependent amplitude ratio threshold values that dictate whether a darcy flux estimate will indicate discharge or recharge conditions as the hydrologic system changes through time so does the recorded temperature time series and thus the amplitude ratio in low flux environments temporal changes in the amplitude ratio can drift above or below this depth dependent threshold value that dictates a discharge or recharge darcy flux estimate however the transition across this threshold value does not occur at the same instance in time for all sensor pairs uncertainty due to a combination of sensor resolution and sensor spacing can cause the magnitude of quantified darcy fluxes to indicate recharge conditions for some sensor pairs while indicating discharge conditions for others depending on the resolution of the sensor used there is a plausible range of amplitude ratios that can be quantified which results in a range of possible darcy flux estimates see fig 8 shaded areas when compared to the prescribed darcy flux estimates it is clear this oscillatory nature in temperature derived darcy fluxes is due to changes in the amplitude ratio over time causing temperature derived darcy flux estimates to cross over the threshold that discharge or recharge darcy flux estimates compare fig 8a d 4 3 other potential sources of error as this study utilizes publicly available groundwater and surface water data to generate synthetic temperature time series data numerous assumptions have been made that could potentially lead to sources of error when periodic temperature time series methods are applied in the field in natural settings riverbed sediment distribution and properties are dynamic as bedforms change the depths of the temperature sensors can change as well which leads to changes in the temperature derived darcy flux which were not considered in this study the geologic and thermal properties assigned are based on reported literature values for the individual field locations and sediment descriptions these values have an inherent uncertainty which was not considered in this study which could lead to an increase in the plausible range of both the prescribed and temperature derived darcy flux values the potential impact of these assumptions should be considered when transitioning to a field setting 5 conclusions the long term quantification of darcy fluxes across the gw sw interface has been shown to be possible using heat as an environmental tracer when compared to prescribed darcy fluxes temperature time series methods were able to closely approximate darcy flux estimates in more stable hydrologic settings and when darcy fluxes were not near zero in value however results demonstrate heat as an environmental tracer is not always an appropriate method dramatic changes in stream stage for example lead to violations of the fundamental assumptions underlying the method and thus to errors in temperature derived darcy fluxes technological limitations in the form of sensor resolution and deployment mistakes such as using an inappropriate sensor spacing can also lead to erroneous darcy flux estimates in low flux environments we demonstrate the utility of the inferred p√©clet number to identify instances in which temperature derived darcy flux estimates may be inaccurate indicating that intermittent independent secondary measurements of darcy flux are important in low flux environments the long term quantification of darcy fluxes has the potential to help later studies assess the timing and duration of important processes such as nutrient loading water supply and changes in baseflow conditions through time and under a changing climate however when transitioning to dynamic natural systems bed sediment aggradation or degradation and changes in hydraulic conductivity values due to sediment flushing potentially lead to erroneous measurements it is important to consider these changes when deploying temperature sensors over long time periods and to anticipate potential dynamic changes to mitigate the potential of using inaccurate data independent measurements of darcy flux using a secondary method should be conducted throughout the temperature data collection duration it is important to reiterate that the results from this work are for one dimensional vertical flow across the gw sw interface groundwater surface water interactions are an inherently three dimensional process and the use of one dimensional methods to infer more complex three dimensional flow fields is not advised credit authorship contribution statement thomas j glose conceptualization methodology formal analysis

4831,attachment is an important strategy for microorganisms to survive grow and perform biogeochemical functions in soil and groundwater systems this study investigated the effect of flow interruption fi that is common in subsurface environments on bacterial attachment detachment using a metal reducing bacterium shewanella oneidensis strain mr1 as an example column experiments and one dimensional bacterial transport models were performed by varying flow interruption duration fluid ionic strength and solid grain surface electrostatic properties with a goal to understand the effect of fi on bacterial attachment detachment the results indicated that mr1 generally behaved as colloidal particles in transport and attachment detachment under continuous flow conditions however the fi events induced a significant release of mr1 in both injection and elution phases showing a peak mr1 concentration which was higher than that in the injecting solution immediately after the fi events the peak mr1 concentrations were higher in systems with lower adhesive forces between bacteria and solid grains a lower attachment site capacity in porous media and a longer fi duration the diffusive release of the previously attached bacteria during the fi events and the momentum force when flow re started immediately after the fi events were likely the mechanisms leading to bursting release of bacteria with the release concentrations higher than that in the influent solutions the results have important implication for understanding bacterial migration and attachment and their subsequent functions especially in dynamic hydraulic environments such as in hyporheic zones or in soils subject to dynamic changes in infiltration rates under for example extreme precipitation and drought conditions

hyporheic zones where water flow velocity may behave in repeated cycles of flow and stop flow mode in response to groundwater and river water level changes boano et al 2014 liu et al 2017 when river water and groundwater levels were different water flows from one side to the other through the hyporheic zone and when the difference of the water levels is minimal flow diminished or stopped collectively generating fi events water infiltration in soil systems may also behave in fi mode in response to precipitation events and between them the effect of fi interruption on microbial attachment and detachment however has not been well understood this study investigated the effect of fi on the attachment and detachment of microorganisms using shewanella oneidensis strain mr1 as an example mr1 is a facultative iron reducing bacterium that plays an important role in metal and contaminant transformation in subsurface environments hossain et al 2005 liu et al 2002 perujo et al 2017 the research is the part of a major project of investigating the effect of dynamic hydrological conditions on microbial transport growth and biogeochemical functions in hyporheic zones in this study column experiments were performed to investigate the effect of fi events on the attachment detachment of microorganisms in porous media electrolyte chemical composition and ionic strength porous media

groundwater and surface water interaction zones 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganisms and characterization the metal reducing bacteria shewanella oneidensis strain mr1 used in this study was cultivated in a luria broth growth medium lb 15 h at 34 c while shaking at 140 rpm fredrickson et al 2008 liu et al 2002 the cells were harvested at the stationary growth phase by centrifugation 4600g for 5 min more details are available elsewhere ning et al 2019 the average sizes and mean zeta potentials of the bacteria in different chemical solutions used in the experiments were measured using dynamic light scattering dls instrument nanozs90 malvern instruments ltd 2 2 porous media quartz and dolomite sands that have different surface charges were used as the porous media materials in this study both sands had a mean diameter d50 of 0 30 mm mineralogical compositions of the materials were determined using x ray diffraction xrd that confirmed these two minerals as described previously ning et al 2019 before the use the quartz was treated by sequentially soaking in 12 m concentrated hcl followed by 1 m concentrated naoh and 30 h2o2 at least for 24 h to remove metal oxides and clay particles and then rinsed with deionized water repeatedly until ph stabilized ph about 7 the treated quartz sand was dried at 105 c for 24 h and stored in hermetic plastic bag until use the dolomite sands were treated with 1 hcl ultrasonically cleaned in acetone followed by rinsing with distilled water several times the treated dolomite sands were dried in an oven overnight at 60 c and were stored in hermetic plastic bag until use the zeta potentials of both sands were measured using the dls instrument 2 3 column experiments sands of either dolomite or quartz were wet packed into cylindrical plexiglass columns 12 cm length and 2 5 cm inner diameter layer by layer and each layer was well agitated to minimize air entrapment a 100 mesh screen about 150 Œºm pore size was equipped at each end of the column to retain sands the packed column had a porosity of 0 35 that was determined using weight the packed column was saturated by flowing deionized water for 24 pore volumes pvs in an up flow mode using a peristaltic pump the velocity of all experiments was set to be 5 9 m d 1 which is in the range of natural groundwater flow rates jahan et al 2019 solutions of 100 mm of nacl 10 mm of nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 with and without containing microorganisms were used as the injection solutions the microorganism free electrolyte solution with desired chemical compositions was first introduced into the sand packed column for at least 24 pvs to chemically equilibrate the sands with the desired solution flow interruption was performed in both the injection phase phase 1 and elution phase phase 2 of the column experiments in the injection phase flow was interrupted stopped for 1 3 6 and 12 h after 14 5 pvs 7 3 pvs for the quartz packed columns of the bacteria containing solution were injected upwards into the dolomite packed column at a darcy velocity of 0 41 cm min 1 using a peristaltic pump respectively to generate the fi events in the column after 29 pvs 14 5 pvs for the quartz columns of the injection of the microorganism containing solution the microorganism free solution with the same chemical composition was injected into the dolomite column to promote microorganism detachment in the elution phase the flow was also interrupted with stop flow durations of 1 3 6 and 12 h to generate the fi events the dolomite packed column experiments were conducted in 100 mm of nacl solutions 10 mm of nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 solutions respectively and in the quartz paced column with 100 mm nacl solution only as a control the column experiments without fluid flow interruption were also performed under the same conditions as described before the effluent samples from all the columns were collected using a fraction collector and sterilized glass tubes the number of microorganisms in the effluent samples was enumerated using acridine orange ao beijing solarbio science technology co ltd china staining method and flow cytometry facscanto becton dickinson and company america ning et al 2019 2 4 bacterial transport model a colloidal transport model in saturated porous media that was commonly used to describe bacteria transport behavior was first used to

Œ∏ k att 1 s att s max c œÅ k det s att where k att and k det are the first order bacteria attachment and detachment coefficient min 1 and the s max is the maximum concentration of attached bacteria

lib are the first order bacteria straining and liberation coefficient min 1 respectively while d is the average particle size of the packing material m and is the distance from the column inlet it is worth mentioning that both k str and k lib were set to 0 during the fi duration because the straining and subsequent liberation processes were mainly driven by the advection from upstream to downstream xu et al 2006 in this study eqs 1 3 were first coupled to simulate bacterial transport and the model was named model 1 as shown later in results section model 1 was not able to simulate the

simulation results to the measured effluent mr1 concentrations without fi events and parameter k lib 2 was also obtained by fitting the measured effluent concentration of mr1 with fi events the fitted parameters were provided in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface properties of sands and microorganisms quartz and dolomite sands had different surface charge properties table 1 the zeta potentials of the quartz sands were all negative in the electrolyte solutions used in this study increasing from 58 92 to 36 54 mv when solution ionic strength increased from 1 to 100 mm the zeta potential of the dolomite was negative and only minorly increased with increasing ionic strength in nacl electrolytes in contrast the zeta potentials of the dolomite were positive in cacl2 and mgcl2 solutions increasing from 7 72 to 18 69 mv in cacl2 electrolytes and from 4 75 to 8 11 mv in mgcl2 electrolytes when their concentrations increased from 1 to 10 mm the positive zeta potential of the dolomite particles in cacl2 or mgcl2 solutions is likely due to the sorption of ca2 or mg2 cations on the dolomite surfaces through inner sphere complexation kasha et al 2015 the zeta potentials of bacteria mr1 were all negative and increased with increasing ionic strength in all the solutions used in this study table 1 the negatively charged mr1 indicated that their attachment would be unfavorable to negatively charged quartz sands and to dolomite sands in nacl solutions mondal and sleep 2012 shang et al 2013 torkzaban et al 2008 however their attachment would be favorable to positively charged dolomite sands in cacl2 and mgcl2 solutions the average hydrodynamic diameter of mr1 was at the micrometer scale and was slightly larger at higher ionic strength likely reflecting the effect of aggregation on the average hydrodynamic diameter in higher ionic strength solutions the average hydrodynamic diameter of mr1 was also larger in cacl2 solution than that in nacl solution 1541 nm versus 1208 nm table 1 the results were consistent with the bridging and complexation effects of ca2 ion chowdhury et al 2012 yang et al 2016 3 2 effect of fi events on mr1 attachment detachment and transport the effluent breakthrough curves btcs from the column experiments showed that mr1 gradually increased with time during the injection phase and decreased in the elution phase under continuous flow conditions without fi regardless of solution composition and ionic strength fig 1 the peak concentrations of mr1 were always less than that in the inject solutions and were lower in solutions when porous media dolomite surfaces had more positive charges cacl2 mgcl2 nacl the results reflected the effect of attachment of mr1 during their transport as a result of the surface interaction between negatively charged mr1 and differently charged dolomite surfaces in the solutions the results are generally consistent with colloidal particle transport in porous media that particle attachment is stronger under favorable conditions bradford et al 2012 wang et al 2013 jahan et al 2019 wu et al 2017 the fi events had a strong effect on mr1 transport and attachment detachment in both injection and elution phases fig 1 there were the release peaks of effluent mr1 concentrations occurring at 1 2 pvs in both phases immediately after water flow restarted at the end of fi events under all ionic strength conditions the fi events in the injection phase resulted in a sharp decrease in effluent mr1 concentration within one pore volume followed by a rapid rebounding to reach a peak and then a quick decrease in effluent mr1 concentrations all the mr1 peak concentrations in different solutions were higher than that in the influent solution c max c 0 1 the sharp decrease in effluent mr1 concentration during the injection phase within one pore volume immediately after the fi was consistent with the previous observations on colloidal transport shang et al 2013 the phenomenon was attributed to the continuous mr1 attachment during the fi events resulting in lower mr1 concentration in effluent solution when flow restarted this phenomenon was well simulated by model 1 fig 2 which considered the kinetic process of attachment note that the straining effect was excluded during the fi duration because the flow was considered as the primary driving force of the straining the quick rebounding to a peak concentration that was higher than that in the injection solution after the fi events during the injection phase was unexpected and was not consistent with the simulation results from model 1 the results indicated that strong release of mr1 occurred following with the flow interruption the mr1 release is expected to be stronger near the column inlet because more attached and strained mr1 accumulated during continuous injection the released mr1 added to the influent solution resulting in a higher mr1 concentration in aqueous phase near the column inlet side immediately after the fi event the subsequent mr1 attachment along the flow paths was apparently not strong enough to significantly decrease the solution mr1 concentration resulting in a spike of the mr1 concentration in the effluent solution fig 1 the attachment of mr1 near the column outlet side during the fi event may also have diminished the ability of the mr1 attachment when it was transported from the inlet to the outlet side leading the peak mr1 concentration in the effluent higher than that in the influent solution after the fi event however the duration of the peak concentration was short and quickly dropped back to the concentration similar as those without fi event cases the result suggested that the remobilization of the attached mr1 only occurred immediately after the restart of the fluid flow the sudden fluid momentum changes resulting from the restart of fluid flow apparently induced the detachment of some loosely attached mr1 and once these loosely attached mr1 was removed mr1 transport and attachment detachment returned to normal condition as the case without fi event model 2 which considers the effect of sudden momentum change on bacterial release significantly improved the simulation results fig 3 supporting that the sudden fluid momentum is a likely mechanism for the sharp increase of mr1 release the results also suggested that the mr1 remobilization as a result of fluid momentum changes mainly occurred in the regions with the higher attached mr1 concentrations i e inlet side for the injection phase and the locations with lower attached mr1 outlet side for the injection phase was in the attachment process because the effluent mr1 concentration immediately after the fi event was lower than that before the fi event another possible interpretation is that the attached mr1 in all the column were mobilized by the fluid momentum induced by the restart of fluid flow however at the outlet side the remobilized mr1 by fluid restart was not enough to compensate for the attachment of mr1 during the fi event resulting in a lower mr1 concentration in the effluent immediately after fi event both speculations were supported by simulation results fig 4 the fi event also induced mr1 remobilization during the elution phase in all the electrolyte solutions fig 1 immediately after the fi event the effluent mr1 concentration gradually increased toward a peak and then quickly decreased back within 3 pv to follow the gradual decrease trend typically observed in the elution phase there was no decrease immediately after the fi event as observed for the injection phase indicating that in the elution phase the mr1 was in the detachment during the fi event and the momentum induced by the restart of fluid flow enhanced the mr1 release the gradual increase of mr1 concentration with a peak concentration at about one pv after the fi event indicated that more mr1 was remobilized in the inlet side fig 4a c consistent with the explanation that more attached mr1 was remobilized in the region with a higher concentration of the attached mr1 model 1 also simulated a rebounding as a result of fi in the elution phase fig 2 however the simulated rebounding peak c max was much lower than the measured values model 2 fig 3 also significantly improved the simulation results indicating that the sudden flow restart could cause strong mr1 release in both injection and elution phase and can be described using the same expression resulting from the fluid momentum changes the peak concentrations of effluent mr1 immediately after the fi events changed with the solution composition and ionic strengths in both injection and elution phases in solutions with lower ionic strength 10 mm nacl the peak concentrations were higher than those observed at higher ionic strength 100 mm nacl fig 1 indicating that the fi event induced more mr1 release at lower ionic strength the mr1 cells were retained more by the porous media in the divalent ion solutions ca2 mg2 under the same ion concentration condition 10 mm however the larger amount of the retained mr1 in the column did not lead to the higher peak concentrations these results reflected the effect of adhesive force between mr1 and sands in electrolyte solutions in the solutions with higher ionic strength double layers on both mr1 and sand surfaces were depressed leading to a stronger adhesion of mr1 to sands bradford et al 2015 2012 torkzaban et al 2015 and thus resulting in the smaller amount of mr1 detached the favorable condition for mr1 attachment on sands because of their opposite surface charges table 1 in the divalent ion solutions ca2 mg2 also contributed to the diminished remobilization of mr1 despite that more mr1 was attached before the fi events the result also indicated that the fluid momentum induced by the restart of fluid flow was able to overcome the attraction force between mr1 and sands resulting in the spike release of mr1 after fi events the peak of effluent mr1 concentration in 10 mm ca2 solution was lower than that in 10 mm mg2 solution the result was consistent with the interpretation above because the zeta potential of dolomite surface was more positive in ca2 than that in mg2 solution with the same ionic strength the larger average diameter of mr1 in ca2 solution 1540 6 nm that in mg2 solution 1255 3 nm may also have contributed to the more mr1 attachment as larger particles are more likely to be filtered cai et al 2015 shang et al 2013 wang et al 2015 the bridge effect of ca2 ions that can enhance particle attachment may also have played a role here chowdhury et al 2012 ning et al 2018 the energy barriers between bacteria and sand surfaces under various ionic strength and in solutions of different cation types can be calculated using the extend derjaguin landau verwey overbeek theory edlvo derjaguin et al 1987 loveland et al 1996 ortega vinuesa et al 1996 rijnaarts et al 1999 our previous calculated results using the edlvo theory indicated that dolomite surface has lower energy barrier than quartz surface in general for cases with the same mineral surface the energy barrier is lower in presence of divalent cation and higher ionic strength ning et al 2019 the lower energy barrier would promote bacterial attachment the abovementioned diminishing effect of mr1 release in dolomite columns divalent ion solutions and in higher ionic strength solutions was consistent with the calculated values of energy barrier from the edlvo theory the increase in fi event duration slightly increased the magnitudes of mr1 concentration decrease immediately after the fi event and increased the subsequent peak concentrations in the injection phase in the dolomite columns fig 1 in the injection phase the longer fi duration increased the residence time for mr1 to attach during the fi event the slight increase of the peak mr1 concentration with the fi event duration was consistent with the notion that more attached mr1 before the fi events would lead to more detachment induced by the fluid momentum changes when all other conditions were the same in the elution phase mr1 was in the detachment mode and longer fi duration gave a longer residence for mr1 to detach so that mr1 concentration immediately after the fi events increased with the fi duration the effect of the fi was only slightly stronger in the columns packed with quartz sand than that in the dolomite columns likely reflecting the fact that quartz sands had negative surface charges and were unfavorable for negatively charged mr1 to attach on sand surfaces however in the quartz sands the amount of the attached mr1 before the fi event was less than that in the dolomite columns which would decrease the fi effect consequently the effect of the fi event on mr1 detachment was only slightly stronger in the quartz columns than that in the dolomite columns the results in the quartz columns also showed that longer fi duration led to more mr1 detachment regardless in the injection or elution phases in both dolomite and quartz columns the fi duration had more effect on the elution phase because mr1 was in the detachment mode and longer duration gave longer duration for the detachment 3 3 possible mechanisms for mr1 release after fi attachment detachment and straining liberation have been considered as two major processes that control the transport of colloids bacteria in porous media bai et al 2016 shang et al 2013 attachment detachment of microorganisms reflected the net effect of the adhesive and hydrodynamic forces bradford and torkzaban 2008 sharma et al 1992 the change of the forces for example the decrease of the adhesive force by decreasing ionic strength bradford et al 2015 2012 or the increase in hydrodynamic force by increasing flow velocity henry and minier 2014 hubbe 1986 would lead to the detachment of the retained microorganisms from the solid surfaces the straining liberation process is the phenomenon of particle trapping to and release from narrow pore throats or solid water interfaces like grain grain contacts or wedging johnson et al 2010 2007 li et al 2006 the domains at pore throats with retained cells grain grain contacts or wedging in porous media have relatively low velocity bradford et al 2016 the retained microorganisms in these domains can release to nearby flow streamlines via brownian diffusion and then be removed by advection these processes can partially explain the fi induced spikes in the effluent mr1 concentrations in the elution phase fig 1 the sharp drop in effluent mr1 concentration immediately after the fi events in the injection phase was also consistent with this diffusion interpretation in the injection phase diffusion would enhance particle attachment shang et al 2013 leading to the decrease of mr1 concentrations in the effluent when flow was re started however the diffusion interpretation was not applicable to the fi induced rebounding of effluent mr1 in the injection phase extensive theoretical and experimental studies indicated that shearing force from fluid flow can lead to the release of colloidal particles from the attached wall hubbe 1986 mcdowellboyer 1992 1997 bergendahl and grasso 2000 cyril et al 2010 moreover recent study on the highly transient flow indicated that the sudden fluid momentum changes i e the sudden restart of the fluid flow from the static state after the fi events can alter the velocity profiles in the cross sections comparing with the steady state flow and may enhance the local shearing stress near the solid surface blythman et al 2017 leading to the release of the previously attached mr1 such a local shearing stress effect should have occurred in the elution phase however in the elution phase both diffusion and fi induced local shearing stress promoted the release of mr1 and thus cannot be distinguished from the effluent profiles of mr1 concentrations combining the results and discussion above the fi induced effect can be summarized in the following the diffusion of microorganisms led to the attachment of mr1 in the injection phase and detachment in the elution phase during the fi event fig 5 a resulting in lower effluent mr1 concentrations in the injection phase and higher effluent mr1 concentrations in the elution phase immediately after fi events the sudden fluid momentum changes induced by the re start of fluid flow might change velocity field that promotes the release of the attached mr1 fig 5b resulting in the spike increase of effluent mr1 concentrations the diffusion and sudden fluid momentum changes should occur in the columns simultaneously however the effect from the fluid momentum changes likely had more effect in the inlet locations with higher attached mr1 so that there was a time delay of the peak effluent mr1 concentrations in the injection phase the starving of the bacteria in the grown biofilm was proposed as another possible mechanism that can promote the release of bacteria after the fi events thormann et al 2005 in this study however due to the absence of the nutrient substrates required for continuous mr1 growth the biofilm was unlikely to grow and the effect of the starving induced bacteria release was expected to be minimal 4 conclusions this study investigated the attachment detachment and transport of microorganisms in columns packed with sand grains with different surface charge properties using a common bacteria mr1 as an example and with a focus on the effect of fi on microbial release the effects of the flow interruption in a mode of flow stop flow and flow on mr1 attachment detachment and transport in porous media were further investigated in detail an important finding from this study is that the release of the mr1 retained in porous media can be significantly promoted by fi in both injection and elution phases the difference is that in the injection phase there was a sharp drop of effluent mr1 concentrations immediately after the fi events the results were generally consistent with the diffusion interpretation the diffusion promoted attachment in the injection phase and detachment in the elution phase leading to the different response of effluent mr1 concentrations immediately after the fi events the rebounding in mr1 concentration in the injection phase following the sharp drop immediately after fi suggested the sudden fluid momentum change can induce mr1 release the changes of flow velocity profiles resulting from the sudden fluid momentum changes may be responsible for the rebounding of mr1 concentration after fi event such an effect of sudden fluid momentum changes may also exist in the elution phase although this effect was obscured by the diffusion effect because both processes promoted the release of particles further studies however are needed to elucidate the mechanistic relationship between the sudden fluid momentum change flow velocity profile change and shearing force that can be used to quantitatively interpret the fi effects credit authorship contribution statement zigong ning conceptualization methodology writing

4831,attachment is an important strategy for microorganisms to survive grow and perform biogeochemical functions in soil and groundwater systems this study investigated the effect of flow interruption fi that is common in subsurface environments on bacterial attachment detachment using a metal reducing bacterium shewanella oneidensis strain mr1 as an example column experiments and one dimensional bacterial transport models were performed by varying flow interruption duration fluid ionic strength and solid grain surface electrostatic properties with a goal to understand the effect of fi on bacterial attachment detachment the results indicated that mr1 generally behaved as colloidal particles in transport and attachment detachment under continuous flow conditions however the fi events induced a significant release of mr1 in both injection and elution phases showing a peak mr1 concentration which was higher than that in the injecting solution immediately after the fi events the peak mr1 concentrations were higher in systems with lower adhesive forces between bacteria and solid grains a lower attachment site capacity in porous media and a longer fi duration the diffusive release of the previously attached bacteria during the fi events and the momentum force when flow re started immediately after the fi events were likely the mechanisms leading to bursting release of bacteria with the release concentrations higher than that in the influent solutions the results have important implication for understanding bacterial migration and attachment and their subsequent functions especially in dynamic hydraulic environments such as in hyporheic zones or in soils subject to dynamic changes in infiltration rates under for example extreme precipitation and drought conditions

parameters were provided in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface properties of sands and microorganisms quartz and dolomite sands had different surface charge properties table 1 the zeta potentials of the quartz sands were all negative in the electrolyte solutions used in this study increasing from 58 92 to 36 54 mv when solution ionic strength increased from 1 to 100 mm the zeta potential of the dolomite was negative and only minorly increased with increasing ionic strength in nacl electrolytes in contrast the zeta potentials of the dolomite were positive in cacl2 and mgcl2 solutions increasing from 7 72 to 18 69 mv in cacl2 electrolytes and from 4 75 to 8 11 mv in mgcl2 electrolytes when their concentrations increased from 1 to 10 mm the positive zeta potential of the dolomite particles in cacl2 or mgcl2 solutions is likely due to the sorption of ca2 or mg2 cations on the dolomite surfaces through inner sphere complexation kasha et al 2015 the zeta potentials of bacteria mr1 were all negative and increased with increasing ionic strength in all the solutions used in this study table 1 the negatively charged mr1 indicated that their attachment would be unfavorable to negatively charged quartz sands and to dolomite sands in nacl solutions mondal and sleep 2012 shang et al 2013 torkzaban et al 2008 however their attachment would be favorable to positively charged dolomite sands in cacl2 and mgcl2 solutions the average hydrodynamic diameter of mr1 was at the micrometer scale and was slightly larger at higher ionic strength likely reflecting the effect of aggregation on the average hydrodynamic diameter in higher ionic strength solutions the average hydrodynamic diameter of mr1 was also larger in cacl2 solution than that in nacl solution 1541 nm versus 1208 nm table 1 the results were consistent with the bridging and complexation effects of ca2 ion chowdhury et al 2012 yang et al 2016 3 2 effect of fi events on mr1 attachment detachment and transport the effluent breakthrough curves btcs from the column experiments showed that mr1 gradually increased with time during the injection phase and decreased in the elution phase under continuous flow conditions without fi regardless of solution composition and ionic strength fig 1 the peak concentrations of mr1 were always less than that in the inject solutions and were lower in solutions when porous media dolomite surfaces had more positive charges cacl2 mgcl2 nacl the results reflected the effect of attachment of mr1 during their transport as a result of the surface interaction between negatively charged mr1 and differently charged dolomite surfaces in the solutions the results are generally consistent with colloidal particle transport in porous media that particle attachment is stronger under favorable conditions bradford et al 2012 wang et al 2013 jahan et al 2019 wu et al 2017 the fi events had a strong effect on mr1 transport and attachment detachment in both injection and elution phases fig 1 there were the release peaks of effluent mr1 concentrations occurring at 1 2 pvs in both phases immediately after water flow restarted at the end of fi events under all ionic strength conditions the fi events in the injection phase resulted in a sharp decrease in effluent mr1 concentration within one pore volume followed by a rapid rebounding to reach a peak and then a quick decrease in effluent mr1 concentrations all the mr1 peak concentrations in different solutions were higher than that in the influent solution c max c 0 1 the sharp decrease in effluent mr1 concentration during the injection phase within one pore volume immediately after the fi was consistent with the previous observations on colloidal transport shang et al 2013 the phenomenon was attributed to the continuous mr1 attachment during the fi events resulting in lower mr1 concentration in effluent solution when flow restarted this phenomenon was well simulated by model 1 fig 2 which considered the kinetic process of attachment note that the straining effect was excluded during the fi duration because the flow was considered as the primary driving force of the straining the quick rebounding to a peak concentration that was higher than that in the injection solution after the fi events during the injection phase was unexpected and was not consistent with the simulation results from model 1 the results indicated that strong release of mr1 occurred following with the flow interruption the mr1 release is expected to be stronger near the column inlet because more attached and strained mr1 accumulated during continuous injection the released mr1 added to the influent solution resulting in a higher mr1 concentration in aqueous phase near the column inlet side immediately after the fi event the subsequent mr1 attachment along the flow paths was apparently not strong enough to significantly decrease the solution mr1 concentration resulting in a spike of the mr1 concentration in the effluent solution fig 1 the attachment of mr1 near the column outlet side during the fi event may also have diminished the ability of the mr1 attachment when it was transported from the inlet to the outlet side leading the peak mr1 concentration in the effluent higher than that in the influent solution after the fi event however the duration of the peak concentration was short and quickly dropped back to the concentration similar as those without fi event cases the result suggested that the remobilization of the attached mr1 only occurred immediately after the restart of the fluid flow the sudden fluid momentum changes resulting from the restart of fluid flow apparently induced the detachment of some loosely attached mr1 and once these loosely attached mr1 was removed mr1 transport and attachment detachment returned to normal condition as the case without fi event model 2 which considers the effect of sudden momentum change on bacterial release significantly improved the simulation results fig 3 supporting that the sudden fluid momentum is a likely mechanism for the sharp increase of mr1 release the results also suggested that the mr1 remobilization as a result of fluid momentum changes mainly occurred in the regions with the higher attached mr1 concentrations i e inlet side for the injection phase and the locations with lower attached mr1 outlet side for the injection phase was in the attachment process because the effluent mr1 concentration immediately after the fi event was lower than that before the fi event another possible interpretation is that the attached mr1 in all the column were mobilized by the fluid momentum induced by the restart of fluid flow however at the outlet side the remobilized mr1 by fluid restart was not enough to compensate for the attachment of mr1 during the fi event resulting in a lower mr1 concentration in the effluent immediately after fi event both speculations were supported by simulation results fig 4 the fi event also induced mr1 remobilization during the elution phase in all the electrolyte solutions fig 1 immediately after the fi event the effluent mr1 concentration gradually increased toward a peak and then quickly decreased back within 3 pv to follow the gradual decrease trend typically observed in the elution phase there was no decrease immediately after the fi event as observed for the injection phase indicating that in the elution phase the mr1 was in the detachment during the fi event and the momentum induced by the restart of fluid flow enhanced the mr1 release the gradual increase of mr1 concentration with a peak concentration at about one pv after the fi event indicated that more mr1 was remobilized in the inlet side fig 4a c consistent with the explanation that more attached mr1 was remobilized in the region with a higher concentration of the attached mr1 model 1 also simulated a rebounding as a result of fi in the elution phase fig 2 however the simulated rebounding peak c max was much lower than the measured values model 2 fig 3 also significantly improved the simulation results indicating that the sudden flow restart could cause strong mr1 release in both injection and elution phase and can be described using the same expression resulting from the fluid momentum changes the peak concentrations of effluent mr1 immediately after the fi events changed with the solution composition and ionic strengths in both injection and elution phases in solutions with lower ionic strength 10 mm nacl the peak concentrations were higher than those observed at higher ionic strength 100 mm nacl fig 1 indicating that the fi event induced more mr1 release at lower ionic strength the mr1 cells were retained more by the porous media in the divalent ion solutions ca2 mg2 under the same ion concentration condition 10 mm however the larger amount of the retained mr1 in the column did not lead to the higher peak concentrations these results reflected the effect of adhesive force between mr1 and sands in electrolyte solutions in the solutions with higher ionic strength double layers on both mr1 and sand surfaces were depressed leading to a stronger adhesion of mr1 to sands bradford et al 2015 2012 torkzaban et al 2015 and thus resulting in the smaller amount of mr1 detached the favorable condition for mr1 attachment on sands because of their opposite surface charges table 1 in the divalent ion solutions ca2 mg2 also contributed to the diminished remobilization of mr1 despite that more mr1 was attached before the fi events the result also indicated that the fluid momentum induced by the restart of fluid flow was able to overcome the attraction force between mr1 and sands resulting in the spike release of mr1 after fi events the peak of effluent mr1 concentration in 10 mm ca2 solution was lower than that in 10 mm mg2 solution the result was consistent with the interpretation above because the zeta potential of dolomite surface was more positive in ca2 than that in mg2 solution with the same ionic strength the larger average diameter of mr1 in ca2 solution 1540 6 nm that in mg2 solution 1255 3 nm may also have contributed to the more mr1 attachment as larger particles are more likely to be filtered cai et al 2015 shang et al 2013 wang et al 2015 the bridge effect of ca2 ions that can enhance particle attachment may also have played a role here chowdhury et al 2012 ning et al 2018 the energy barriers between bacteria and sand surfaces under various ionic strength and in solutions of different cation types can be calculated using the extend derjaguin landau verwey overbeek theory edlvo derjaguin et al 1987 loveland et al 1996 ortega vinuesa et al 1996 rijnaarts et al 1999 our previous calculated results using the edlvo theory indicated that dolomite surface has lower energy barrier than quartz surface in general for cases with the same mineral surface the energy barrier is lower in presence of divalent cation and higher ionic strength ning et al 2019 the lower energy barrier would promote bacterial attachment the abovementioned diminishing effect of mr1 release in dolomite columns divalent ion solutions and in higher ionic strength solutions was consistent with the calculated values of energy barrier from the edlvo theory the increase in fi event duration slightly increased the magnitudes of mr1 concentration decrease immediately after the fi event and increased the subsequent peak concentrations in the injection phase in the dolomite columns fig 1 in the injection phase the longer fi duration increased the residence time for mr1 to attach during the fi event the slight increase of the peak mr1 concentration with the fi event duration was consistent with the notion that more attached mr1 before the fi events would lead to more detachment induced by the fluid momentum changes when all other conditions were the same in the elution phase mr1 was in the detachment mode and longer fi duration gave a longer residence for mr1 to detach so that mr1 concentration immediately after the fi events increased with the fi duration the effect of the fi was only slightly stronger in the columns packed with quartz sand than that in the dolomite columns likely reflecting the fact that quartz sands had negative surface charges and were unfavorable for negatively charged mr1 to attach on sand surfaces however in the quartz sands the amount of the attached mr1 before the fi event was less than that in the dolomite columns which would decrease the fi effect consequently the effect of the fi event on mr1 detachment was only slightly stronger in the quartz columns than that in the dolomite columns the results in the quartz columns also showed that longer fi duration led to more mr1 detachment regardless in the injection or elution phases in both dolomite and quartz columns the fi duration had more effect on the elution phase because mr1 was in the detachment mode and longer duration gave longer duration for the detachment 3 3 possible mechanisms for mr1 release after fi attachment detachment and straining liberation have been considered as two major processes that control the transport of colloids bacteria in porous media bai et al 2016 shang et al 2013 attachment detachment of microorganisms reflected the net effect of the adhesive and hydrodynamic forces bradford and torkzaban 2008 sharma et al 1992 the change of the forces for example the decrease of the adhesive force by decreasing ionic strength bradford et al 2015 2012 or the increase in hydrodynamic force by increasing flow velocity henry and minier 2014 hubbe 1986 would lead to the detachment of the retained microorganisms from the solid surfaces the straining liberation process is the phenomenon of particle trapping to and release from narrow pore throats or solid water interfaces like grain grain contacts or wedging johnson et al 2010 2007 li et al 2006 the domains at pore throats with retained cells grain grain contacts or wedging in porous media have relatively low velocity bradford et al 2016 the retained microorganisms in these domains can release to nearby flow streamlines via brownian diffusion and then be removed by advection these processes can partially explain the fi induced spikes in the effluent mr1 concentrations in the elution phase fig 1 the sharp drop in effluent mr1 concentration immediately after the fi events in the injection phase was also consistent with this diffusion interpretation in the injection phase diffusion would enhance particle attachment shang et al 2013 leading to the decrease of mr1 concentrations in the effluent when flow was re started however the diffusion interpretation was not applicable to the fi induced rebounding of effluent mr1 in the injection phase extensive theoretical and experimental studies indicated that shearing force from fluid flow can lead to the release of colloidal particles from the attached wall hubbe 1986 mcdowellboyer 1992 1997 bergendahl and grasso 2000 cyril et al 2010 moreover recent study on the highly transient flow indicated that the sudden fluid momentum changes i e the sudden restart of the fluid flow from the static state after the fi events can alter the velocity profiles in the cross sections comparing with the steady state flow and may enhance the local shearing stress near the solid surface blythman et al 2017 leading to the release of the previously attached mr1 such a local shearing stress effect should have occurred in the elution phase however in the elution phase both diffusion and fi induced local shearing stress promoted the release of mr1 and thus cannot be distinguished from the effluent profiles of mr1 concentrations combining the results and discussion above the fi induced effect can be summarized in the following the diffusion of microorganisms led to the attachment of mr1 in the injection phase and detachment in the elution phase during the fi event fig 5 a resulting in lower effluent mr1 concentrations in the injection phase and higher effluent mr1 concentrations in the elution phase immediately after fi events the sudden fluid momentum changes induced by the re start of fluid flow might change velocity field that promotes the release of the attached mr1 fig 5b resulting in the spike increase of effluent mr1 concentrations the diffusion and sudden fluid momentum changes should occur in the columns simultaneously however the effect from the fluid momentum changes likely had more effect in the inlet locations with higher attached mr1 so that there was a time delay of the peak effluent mr1 concentrations in the injection phase the starving of the bacteria in the grown biofilm was proposed as another possible mechanism that can promote the release of bacteria after the fi events thormann et al 2005 in this study however due to the absence of the nutrient substrates required for continuous mr1 growth the biofilm was unlikely to grow and the effect of the starving induced bacteria release was expected to be minimal 4 conclusions this study investigated the attachment detachment and transport of microorganisms in columns packed with sand grains with different surface charge properties using a common bacteria mr1 as an example and with a focus on the effect of fi on microbial release the effects of the flow interruption in a mode of flow stop flow and flow on mr1 attachment detachment and transport in porous media were further investigated in detail an important finding from this study is that the release of the mr1 retained in porous media can be significantly promoted by fi in both injection and elution phases the difference is that in the injection phase there was a sharp drop of effluent mr1 concentrations immediately after the fi events the results were generally consistent with the diffusion interpretation the diffusion promoted attachment in the injection phase and detachment in the elution phase leading to the different response of effluent mr1 concentrations immediately after the fi events the rebounding in mr1 concentration in the injection phase following the sharp drop immediately after fi suggested the sudden fluid momentum change can induce mr1 release the changes of flow velocity profiles resulting from the sudden fluid momentum changes may be responsible for the rebounding of mr1 concentration after fi event such an effect of sudden fluid momentum changes may also exist in the elution phase although this effect was obscured by the diffusion effect because both processes promoted the release of particles further studies however are needed to elucidate the mechanistic relationship between the sudden fluid momentum change flow velocity profile change and shearing force that can be used to quantitatively interpret the fi effects credit authorship contribution statement zigong ning conceptualization methodology writing

4832,broadleaf or conifer forest an ongoing dilemma as regards water resource and flood prevention although conifer trees use less water and are hydrophobic existing studies at the watershed scale have shown varying results due to variability in meteorological conditions and forestry practices in this study two adjacent headwater catchments 2 42 ha cypress cf 2 08 ha mixed broadleaf mb were gauged the study area in central japan has a warm temperate climate with high annual rainfall and typhoons daily discharge n 1398 and storm event hydrographs n 242 were compared between cf and mb and discussed in light of water availability and storm event runoff characteristics overall water yield in cf was 6 4 lower than in mb but this was caused by lower streamflow on high discharge periods 30 frequency thus may not adversely affect municipal agricultural water supply for 70 of the time including during dry periods water yield was higher in cf this agrees with the principle that conifers use less water than broadleaf trees even at the forested catchment scale discharge in the cf stream is also less variable than that in the mb stream during storm events the cf stream has higher flashiness shorter response time to rainfall and higher peak discharge than the mb stream but in larger storms 70 mm the mb stream may have higher peak discharge our data demonstrates that a well managed plantation forest does not necessarily have inferior hydrological function compared to a natural broadleaf forest which differs from the stereotype frequencies of high and low flows as well as runoff characteristics were also presented in hopes of promoting better forestry decisions when considering water demand and existing stormwater drainage infrastructures keywords forest conifer broadleaf transpiration runoff water resource 1 introduction generally evergreen conifers are quick to regulate stomatal opening in times of low water availability chirino et al 2011 link et al 2014 high solar irradiance kaufmann 1982a and high temperature kaufmann 1982b whereas anisohydric broadleaf trees maintain high transpiration rates despite low soil moisture as long as leaves are still present chirino et al 2011 link et al 2014 studies on tree water relationships have been conducted since the 1900s but most of these are laboratory or plot scale experiments that use tree seedlings perhaps one of the earliest thorough experiment comparing transpiration rates between broadleaf and deciduous plants is that by weaver and mogensen 1919 in which various species of conifer and broadleaf seedlings were planted in equally watered containers which were sealed and then weighed at intervals the study found lower transpirational losses in conifer compared to broadleaf seedlings unlike the sudden decrease in conifers caused by stomatal restriction the decrease in water loss following leaf abscission in broadleaf trees is gradual brodribb et al 2014 more recent studies have shown that older and taller trees have reduced water use due to reduced carbon fixation increased gravitational resistance to water uptake and enhanced stomatal control ambrose et al 2010 delzon et al 2004 delzon loustau 2005 ryan et al 2000 therefore there is a need to understand water uptake by older trees instead of seedlings in japan tree water relationship studies spiked during the recovery of the timber market crash 1970 2000 in which annual roundwood production has been increasing every year at present approximately 65 25 million ha of the country s land is forested 40 10 million ha of this is mature plantation forest with japanese cedar cypress and larch being the major species forestry agency 2017 seedling production has undergone exponential increase 110 thousand in 2006 to 5 33 million in 2016 for low pollen cedar alone which is a sign of continuous conifer centred policy by the government forestry agency 2017 this has resulted in large scale forest conversions that spurred concerns over impacts on water resources and hillslope stability as an effort to restore water availability some conifer plantations were even reverted back to broadleaf forests in recent years forestry agency 2015 the japanese forest society 2010 however studies that back up the validity the effectiveness of such methods remain scarce and inconclusive with regard to water uptake by trees komatsu et al 2007 found that et in broadleaf forests is approximately the same as that in young conifer plantations and even slightly higher than in older conifer plantations which suggests that plant water dynamics changes with tree age in the real world however how these changes are expressed in terms of runoff are complicated by energy and water availability tree age and the degree to which trees respond to a combination of these factors baldocchi and ryu 2011 vinukollu et al 2011 at the regional and global scale field experiments have been conducted to better understand the effects of forest conversion on runoff but only to yield varying inconclusive results komatsu et al 2009 in southwestern japan and fahey and jackson 1997 in new zealand found no differences in annual water yield between conifer and broadleaf forests hisada et al 2011 found higher runoff in a broadleaf forest compared to in a conifer plantation in gifu japan and have further specified that the differences were contributed by higher baseflow a study in south korea found faster baseflow recession in a conifer forest compared to in a broadleaf forest and has linked this to higher water uptake by conifer trees yang et al 2018 such findings differed from that in a recently published study conducted in the present study area nainar et al 2020 water resource availability aside studies such as miyata et al 2007 investigated storm runoff in a japanese cypress plantation and found high direct runoff as a result of water repellency similar to pine and eucalyptus plantations sidle et al 2007 also documented rapid runoff and thus introduced the concept of biomat flow in cypress plantations which is 3 2 to 8 3 times higher than overland flow in a deciduous forest plot pizarro et al 2006 however concluded that variation in peakflow cannot be attributed to variation in vegetative cover all these conflicting findings have caused uncertainties in designing policies for forestry operations such as the back and forth shift in species prioritization for reforestation komatsu et al 2009 komatsu et al 2011 have identified climate water and energy availability and tree species as the main cause for such disparity in tree water relationships all these varying findings signify that we are still far from being able to synthesise regional models and indicate the need for more rigorous investigations covering different species and climatic conditions especially that of latitudinal regions with highly heterogenous climate although studies on water uptake by trees have been conducted in the temperate region those from the warm humid temperate climate with influence from tropical cyclones are still lacking which is what this study aims to contribute this study took place in inuyama city of aichi prefecture central japan in this paired catchment study we analysed stream discharge data to ascertain the differences in hydrological characteristics between a japanese cypress plantation and secondary mixed broadleaf forest to achieve this we seek answers to these three questions 1 how does stream discharge compare between a cypress plantation and a natural secondary mixed broadleaf catchment specifically which forest type has higher water yield and better flow stability 2 during storm events how does stream discharge compare between a cypress plantation and a natural secondary mixed broadleaf forest which catchment has higher water yield and flashiness 3 how do the two catchments compare in terms of water resource availability and flood attenuation results were discussed from the aspect of water resource and storm runoff characteristics with consideration to rainfall preceding moisture vegetation and evapotranspiration et with reforestation initiatives including monoculture plantation increasing at the global scale fao 2015 forestry agency 2017 these findings may provide insights on water resource and flood management to regions with similar climate 2 study area 2 1 catchment history geology and climate this study compares runoff characteristics between two forested headwater catchments cf cypress forest and mb mixed broadleaf in inuyama city aichi prefecture central japan fig 1 these experimental catchments are located within the area of the ecohydrology research institute the university of tokyo forests major land use changes and heavy timber exploitation occurred during the meiji period 1868 1912 resulting in completely bare and denuded hills around the area the university forest area was first established in 1922 previously tokyo imperial university with the aim to restore forests and prevent hillslope disasters the earliest phase of restoration works include the planting of black pine pinus thunbergii and alder alnus japonica between 1922 and 1942 construction of sediment control check dams by the prefectural government took place between 1950 and 1952 starting from the early 1980s japanese hinoki cypresses were planted in small patches of land as of today the total area of the university of tokyo forests in inuyama city is 443 ha and comprises patches of cypress plantation and natural secondary mixed broadleaf forests the university of tokyo forests 2019 these two contrasting vegetation types represent the common forestry scenario in japan today being first order headwater

rainfall and discharge days without full records 288 5 minute data were excluded most data gaps occurred simultaneously in both catchments because they were caused by unfavourable natural conditions that affected the whole area other isolated sporadic data gaps were standardized deleted for both catchments for the sake of uniformity considering the abundance of data in total 1398 daily totals of discharge and rainfall 634 days in the growth 764 days in the dormant period over 5 years were available for analysis based on the local phenological scenario we define the growth period as 1st may to 31st october while the dormant period 1st november to 30th april of the following year for the storm event dataset hydrographs were separated according to the following criteria at least 0 0012 mm h 1 5 min 1 rise in discharge marks the start of a storm event storm event ends when discharge recedes to within 1 2 times the discharge at the start of an event or up to a maximum of 6 h after the last recorded rainfall in an event whichever occurs first a straight line connecting the initial discharge q initial to the end discharge q end of a storm event arbitrarily separates quickflow from baseflow fig 3 this is an improvisation of the hewlett hibbert and threshold method hewlett and hibbert 1967 after multiple tries via other hydrograph separation methods such as the hewlett hibbert method digital recursive filtering and usgs hysep we found that this percentage threshold method performed optimally in our study site due to two reasons i it is flexible enough to be applied via programming to both headwater catchments of differing hydrograph characteristics hence practical and effective and ii it applies a standardised and equal rule to hydrographs in both catchments therefore although the absolute quantity of old and new water is not exact its ratio old water new water between both catchments is a fair comparison even with the separation line being static the proportion separation of quickflow and baseflow still depends on hydrograph properties height and shape of peak and duration hence allowing each storm event to express its characteristics through this technique all hydrograph components are of real measured values with exception to the proportion of quickflow and baseflow which is a relative value this does not affect the objective of this study that is comparing discharge characteristics between a cypress and mixed broadleaf catchment for each hydrograph the following characteristics were determined instantaneous discharge at the start peak and end of an event q initial q peak and q end respectively total quickflow baseflow and discharge q quick q base and q tot respectively and time taken from the start of rain to q initial t res and from q initial to q peak t peak total rainfall that contributed to each storm event hydrograph is defined as the sum of rainfall between the first occurrence of rainfall and q end hydrograph separation storm event separation and extraction of the hydrograph metrics discharge components were done via the software fortran gcc 4 9 2 followed by visual inspection to exclude erroneous data a total of 242 common storm events in the cf and mb catchments over the same five year period were used in the storm event timescale analysis 3 2 data analysis and statistical methods indices such as the runoff coefficient c coefficients of variation in daily discharge var q and daily rainfall var p were calculated from daily totals nainar et al 2018 ochoa tocachi et al 2016 for use in conjunction with the flow duration curve fdc to describe and compare runoff characteristics during the study period may 2013 april 2018 at the storm event scale two kinds analysis were performed for differing purposes first the mann whitney u test was used to test for significant differences in the hydrograph components q tot q quick q base qi nitial q peak q end t res and t peak between catchments cf and mb following this the analysis of covariance ancova was performed to ascertain differences between the two forest type f the hydrograph component of interest y and their relationships with rainfall p

in units of millimetres mm instantaneous discharge rate components q initial q peak q end have units of cubic meters per second per square kilometres m3 s 1 km 2 and time components t peak t res are in minutes 3 3 application of storage function model statistical comparison of stream discharge between two catchments may show differences in discharge characteristics however establishing causality to differences in evapotranspiration remains a challenge because other properties may also differ between cf and mb for this reason we have employed the storage function model and water balance equation to isolate and control for the effects of catchment properties the storage function model was initially developed for forecasting floods in large catchments sugiyama et al 1997 but its application have been extended to predicting water budget predicting runoff in ungauged basins and simulating storm runoff responses in catchments of various scales and orders gopalan et al 2020 gunaratne et al 2010 tani et al 2020 this issue wu et al 2011 the basic equation of the storage function model is 2 s k q p where s is the hypothetical water storage in the catchment in mm q is discharge in mm per unit time k and p are model parameters to be determined in line with the initial hypothesis that there are differences in stream discharge driven by differences in et we have employed the conceptual model water balance equation 3 ds dt p e t q where p is effective precipitation et is evapotranspiration q is discharge and ds dt is change in storage by focusing only on recession limbs during rain free periods the component p can be excluded excluding p and substituting 2 in to 3 resulted in 4 dq dt 1 kp q 1 p e t q based on the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 5 et Œ± Œ¥ r n g Œª v Œ¥ Œ≥ 1000 where et is evapotranspiration mm day 1 Œ¥ is the slope of saturation vapour pressure temperature curve kpa c 1 r n is net radiation mj m 2 day 1 g is soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 Œª v is the volumetric latent heat of vaporisation 2453 mj m 3 Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 and Œ± is a constant accounting for the vapour pressure deficit and resistance values including stomatal control and is unique to specific land uses or crops we assumed negligible g due to the relatively closed canopy cover ai and yang 2016 gunston and batchelor 1983 substituting 5 in 4 6 dq dt 1 kp q 1 p Œ± Œ¥ r n Œª v Œ¥ Œ≥ 1000 q hourly discharge q and potential evapotranspiration et p data were used in equation 6 to optimise the parameters k and p in the dormant period we assumed negligible differences in actual et between cf and mb in the dormant period thus potential evapotranspiration et p values calculated by Œ± 1 26 were used in the parameter optimisation stage for both cf and mb allen et al 1998 parameter optimisation was performed on extended periods of flow recession during the dormant period in order to minimise the effects of et and to avoid saturated conditions only discharge data on the secondary falling limb after a storm event after the inflexion point on log scales that are rain free for at least 72 h were used by these criteria three common recession events in cf and mb 1 10 february 23 28 march and 26 april 3 may 2015 were available for parameter optimisation the necessary parameters were derived using measured meteorological data where Œ¥ Œª v Œ≥ were derived after dingman 2002 while r n was derived by multiplying solar irradiance with the factor 0 8 komatsu et al 2007 optimisation was based on minimisation of root mean square error rmse between modelled q and measured q after parameter optimisation of k and p Œ± values for cf and mb were produced by applying eq 6 to recession events in the growth period using r n Œ¥ Œª v Œ≥ and measured q from each catchment recession events used for producing Œ± growth period were also selected based on the same criteria as in event selection for parameterisation dormant period where only the secondary recession limb of at least 72 h in length and rain free were qualified by these rigorous criteria four events in cf and five events in mb three common events in both catchments in the growth period were available production of Œ± in the growth period was also based on minimisation of rmse between modelled q and measured q as with most storage function models the physical significance of the parameters k and p have not been established without further expansion k and p can be considered as collective catchment characteristics that influence ds dt and q therefore we considered this model to be parsimonious for isolating collective catchment factors to highlight the effects of et the limited number of recession events available for parameter optimisation and production of Œ± is owing to the strict criteria that was set for event selection the main challenge was in obtaining rain free recession events of sufficient length in this region of high rainfall nevertheless we deem that stricter criteria minimizes influence from externalities and improves certainty of the model 4 results 4 1 overall flow characteristics fig 4 shows daily totals for rainfall and discharge in the cf and mb catchment 1 may 2013 30 april 2018 rainfall records are without gaps daily discharge average of cf and mb in the growth period was 57 higher than in the dormant period and corresponds to a 58 increase in rainfall resulting in similar runoff coefficients in the two periods 0 496 in the growth 0 499 in the dormant period daily discharge in all periods was 6 4 lower in cf compared to in mb as shown by the runoff coefficient c in table 4 significantly different mann whitney p 0 05 although cf had higher discharge than mb for most of the year 38 100 frequency it was lower on periods of high discharge 3 32 frequency fig 5 a this is better elucidated in fig 5b by plotting discharge in cf against that in mb we were able to observe their prevailing frequency in either catchments fig 5b shows that cf has higher frequency of higher discharge than mb n cf 954 n mb 444 especially when discharge is lower daily discharge 20 mm similar to daily discharge daily baseflow was slightly lower 3 84 in the cf but the ratio of daily baseflow to daily discharge daily q base daily q was slightly higher 0 727 in cf 0 707 in mb table 4 var q was 6 4 higher in mb 1 832 compared to in cf 1 722 signifying more stable flows in cf in the different phenological periods growth and dormant periods discharge in cf and mb had the same frequency distribution as in the all period comparison fig 5a c d daily discharge in both the growth and dormant periods were significantly different between cf and mb mann whitney p 0 05 but differences were more pronounced in the growth period overall discharge in cf was lower than in mb in both growth 4 11 and dormant 9 88 periods table 4 but discharge was higher for most of the time especially during no rain and moderate rain days this is shown in the 40 100 exceedance range of the fdc fig 5c d instead daily discharge on days of high flow was lower in cf fig 5 difference in var q between cf and mb was larger in the dormant period where var q in cf was 15 less than that in mb analyses in distinct phenological periods showed the similar results as that in all periods the ratio of daily baseflow to daily discharge daily q base daily q was higher in cf compared to in mb in both growth 0 682 in cf 0 669 in mb and dormant 0 799 in cf 0 764 in mb periods respectively table 4 4 2 priestley taylor coefficient Œ± parameter optimisation of the storage function model resulted in k and p values of 0 6048 and 1811 in cf rmse 0 0026 mm h 1 and 0 5430 and 1041 in mb rmse 0 0052 mm h 1 from various recession events in the growth period the priestley taylor coefficient Œ± ranged between 0 370 and 1 485 mean 1 012 in cf and 1 033 2 950 mean 1 827 in mb in general Œ± values were lower in cf than in mb in the growth period although intra catchment variation exists table 5 4 3 storm event scale peak discharge q peak and the time taken from the initial rise in discharge to peak discharge t peak were statistically significantly different between cf and mb when assessed throughout all periods and in the growth period mann whitney p 0 05 in all periods q peak was 2 21 higher whereas t peak was 19 32 shorter in cf compared to in mb indicating faster response in cf fig 6 a in the growth period q peak and t peak in cf was 7 5 higher and 23 01 shorter than in mb respectively fig 6b in the dormant period only the response time from the start of rain to the initial rise in discharge t res was statistically significantly different mann whitney p 0 05 where t res in cf is 6 35 shorter than in mb fig 6c both cf and mb had decreased t peak enhanced hydrograph flashiness when moving from the growth to the dormant period but difference between catchments was insignificant the multiple regression models for all hydrograph components show moderate to strong positive relationships with p and q initial as indicated by the adjusted r squared values with exception to t res table 6 in each period the metrices q tot q quick and q base have relatively strong coefficient of determination the inclusion of q initial as a second predictor significantly improved the coefficient of determination r 2 of the multiple regression this can be seen in fig 7 a and b where larger points higher q initial corresponding to higher preceding moisture are distributed higher in the y axis because t res did not correlate with p the ancova was performed to control for only q initial however the resulting r 2 was relatively low results from the ancova reinforces that from the mann whitney test whereby discharge characteristics during storm events differ significantly between cf and mb cf have shorter t peak t res and is more responsive fig 7a and b shows the regression of selected hydrograph components q tot and q peak between the different forest type tested via ancova results of the stepwise selection of variables coefficients and r squared of the multiple linear regressions are summarized in table 6 4 3 1 hydrograph characteristics from fig 7 a and b q tot and q peak values were higher in cf during events of lower rainfall but lower in events of higher rainfall for this reason in addition to statistical testing q tot and q peak in cf were plotted against that in mb and visualised with reference to a 1 1 line fig 7c d peak discharge during storm events q peak is higher in cf in small to medium events which are more frequent n 172 in larger events q peak is higher in mb n 70 despite catchment relief in cf being slightly steeper table 1 example hydrographs that depict these situations are in fig 8 5 discussion 5 1 overall discharge characteristics of cypress and mixed broadleaf forest the fdc curve of cf is flatter than that of mb indicating better regulation on discharge distribution increased discharge during dry periods and decrease discharge during wet periods fig 5 in addition it is understood that the 6 4 lower daily discharge in cf is a result of lower flows on days with high discharge and rainfall which should not be disadvantageous to water resource the conventional principle that conifer species uses less water compared to broadleaf species komatsu et al 2007 kusano 1901 weaver and mogensen 1919 yan et al 2018 is demonstrated here this is also supported by the higher proportion of baseflow in cf than in mb differences in water yield between cf and mb corresponds to the Œ± values in table 5 abe et al 2017 hattori et al 1992 tanaka et al 2005 similar results were also observed by regional studies focusing on the tree scale kusano 1901 weaver and mogensen 1919 a more recent tree scale investigation in the jiuzhaigou valley of china also reported that conifer species transpire between 30 and 50 less water compared to broadleaf species yan et al 2018 the reason as to why cf have lower discharge on high flow days needs further investigation though a possible factor is that wetter periods may decrease hydrophobicity in cypress catchments kobayashi and shimizu 2007 leelamanie and nishiwaki 2019 miyata et al 2007 that have higher storage capacity at both the ground and tree level compared to in broadleaf forests crockford and richardson 2000 sidle et al 2007 schooling 2014 levia and germer 2015 iida et al 2017 also in appendix a compared to other cypress catchments this factor may be of higher prominence in the present study due to the practice of placing felled logs along slope contours fig 2 other recent studies crockford and richardson 2000 iida et al 2017 levia et al 2010 levia and germer 2015 schooling 2014 have also highlighted the significance of tree physiology and morphology surface area roughness continuity etc in determining whether water is stored or drained away reid and lewis 2009 found that up to 54 of rainfall may be stored in the bark lower var q in cf demonstrates better flow regulation and could be due to a myriad of factors ground and aboveground processes greater differences in var q between cf and mb in the dormant period suggest that tree crowns may play a role via interception and or transpiration despite the considerable reduction in rain amount and frequency when moving from the growth to the dormant period var q in mb did not change by the same degree which suggest less interception and transpiration caused by leaf abscission 5 2 storm event scale at the storm event scale only q peak and t peak were statistically significantly different in the growth period mann whitney p 0 05 the 7 5 higher peak discharge and 23 01 shorter time to peak in cf in the growth period indicate rapid response after commencement of the rising limb which may be attributed to preferential flow due to water repellency as reported in existing studies kobayashi et al 2006 kobayashi and shimizu 2007 miyata et al 2007 although studies in the region sun et al 2015b 2015a tanaka et al 2005 have established that canopy interception is higher in cypress than in mixed broadleaf forests the relatively open canopy in cf fig 2 compared to that in unthinned cypress forests may have resulted in lower canopy interception and consequently quicker streamflow response nagano et al 2017 found that the relationship between stand density and interception is exponential rather than linear for japanese cypress plantation thus pointing to the possibility of an exponentially reduced interception in this study in the dormant period t res in cf was 32 93 lower than in mb but q peak and t peak did not differ significantly compared to mb this translates to faster responses from the onset of rain to the first rise in discharge but peak discharge characteristics in the hydrograph itself remains similar between both catchments the lower t res in cf in the dormant period may again be linked to the relatively dry surface conditions that has led to increased hydrophobicity in cypress forests leelamanie and nishiwaki 2019 however the fact that t res in mb is not shorter than in cf despite defoliation also suggests that the increase in ground litter interception may up to some extent compensate for the decrease in canopy interception the lack of differences in q peak and t peak between cf and mb however may indicate the limited effectiveness of ground litter interception in mb whereby after ground litter interception capacity is exceeded q peak and t peak in mb can be as high as in cf this follows observation by butzen et al 2015 where a continuous concentrated flow on the surface of ground litter is possible as soon as the litter surface becomes well wetted the mann whitney test assesses differences in the respective discharge characteristics between catchments cf and mb inclusive of environmental factors such as precipitation and preceding moisture conditions that is to say results from the mann whitney test are more representative of actual conditions in this field study and may apply to similar regional climatic scenarios the more rigorous ancova may isolate up to a certain degree the influence of precipitation and preceding moisture thus reinforcing that forest type is the driver of change in discharge dynamics integrating results from both analyses we can deduce that streams in cf have higher flashiness lower t peak and t res than in mb during storm events differences in q peak between cf and mb are no longer prominent upon controlling for the effects of rainfall p and preceding moisture q initial which imply that differences in q peak arise from differences in effective rainfall and or preceding moisture between cf and mb 5 3 discrepancy synthesis and past studies from previous sections the overall lower water yield in cf compared to mb despite its higher fdc limb was provisionally attributed to lower water yield on days of high flow seen in fig 5 however q tot from analysis at the event scale does not indicate this no significant differences between cf and mb which may be due to either of the following reasons i these events although large in magnitude occurred only occasionally hence not statistically significant ii differences occured over prolonged periods as days of high discharge instead of total discharge during the storm event itself fig 5b shows that in the 954 occurrences when daily discharge in cf is higher than in mb there was a total of 330 mm higher discharge in cf whereas in the 444 occurrences of higher daily discharge in mb there was a total of 555 mm higher discharge in mb this supports the observation from the fdc fig 5 where discharge in cf is lower than in mb on occasional days of high flows but higher than in mb for most of the time thereby confirming both hypotheses above this also agrees with the modelled priestley taylor coefficients Œ± values table 5 therefore despite the lack of statistically significant differences these characteristics may be of high physical significance from the aspect of tree water uptake similar results were reported by yan et al 2018 who found relatively conservative water use by conifer compared to broadleaf trees in china streamflow however was not measured in the study making it difficult to translate these results to impacts on water resource and flood risk the present study advances that of yan et al 2018 by interpreting differences in tree transpiration in to catchment discharge and water availability perhaps the most comparable study to date is that by hisada et al 2011 where the short term water budget and priestly taylor method were used to assess the difference in discharge and between japanese cypress and mizunara oak the resulting lower discharge from the cypress catchment was claimed to have resulted from reduced baseflow on days without rain our study advances that of hisada et al 2011 by exploring overall water yield as well as individual storm events which has led to two standpoints i we agree that overall cypress forests have lower stream discharge ii however evidence from our study shows that the lower stream discharge in cypress forests occurred on days of high flow instead of baseflow throughout 70 of the time water yield in the cypress catchment was higher than in the broadleaf catchment from a water resource management aspect especially in an agriculture intensive region cypress forests may be beneficial because of its higher water availability especially in the growth season when agricultural water demand is at its peak however results may differ from catchments with different stem density and management practices besides water yield discrepancies were also found in hydrograph characteristics in cf and mb between events of different magnitude in storms of around 50 mm and less the rising limb in mb appears to follow the saturation excess concept fig 8a on the other hand the rising limb in cf exhibited quick response that is characteristic of the hortonion concept or the more recent biomat flow concept sato et al 2020 sidle et al 2007 sato et al 2019 however during events of higher rainfall and likely higher rainfall intensity both catchments show little difference in the shape and angle of the rising limb but the magnitude of peak discharge is higher in mb observation from this paired catchment comparison agrees in part with past observations gomi et al 2008 kobayashi et al 2006 kobayashi and shimizu 2007 leelamanie and nishiwaki 2019 miyata et al 2007 including those from outside japan butzen et al 2015 doerr et al 2009 where cypress catchments exhibit high water repellency however in addition to that we also observed that above a certain storm threshold magnitude natural mixed broadleaf forests may display higher peak discharge and water yield fig 7c d fig 8 these results have led us to believe that cypress plantation forests may not necessarily be inferior to natural mixed broadleaf forests in terms of flood mitigation our data have demonstrated that cypress plantation forest may afford better flood attenuation capabilities in larger storms especially when well managed which may be contrary to popular belief and findings from other regions however the exact mechanisms to this require further investigation 6 conclusions and recommendations we have assessed the differences in discharge characteristics between an intensively thinned japanese cypress plantation forest and a naturally regenerated mixed broadleaf forest and came to the following conclusions 1 overall the cypress forest had lower 6 4 water yield compared to the mixed broadleaf forest but this occurred only during high flow periods for most 70 of the time including in dry periods the cypress forest had higher water yield this agrees with the conservative water use characteristics of conifer species as also indicated by the storage function model the cypress forest also have a relatively stable stream discharge compared to the mixed broadleaf forest 2 water yield during storm events did not differ between the cypress and mixed broadleaf forest in small to large rain events up to 50 mm the cypress forest exhibited higher hydrograph flashiness in larger magnitude rain events 70 mm the mixed broadleaf forest exhibited higher flashiness 3 in light of water resource and flood attenuation a well managed cypress plantation forest may not be as detrimental as stereotypically thought our data has shown that the inverse is possible cypress forests have increased water availability and buffered stream response compared to mixed broadleaf forests this study has addressed some long standing uncertainties in streamflow dynamics and water resource issues that stems from forest type conversion in a warm japanese temperate climate findings can also be extended and applied to regions of warm temperate climate with or without the extremities of typhoons the decision of whether to prioritise conifer or broadleaf species should be made with consideration to downstream water demand climate and existing stormwater drainage capacity this study is however limited in several aspects namely tree species manipulation management techniques and climate it may be beneficial to investigate the mechanisms of stormwater channelling attenuation in cypress forests during large storms which should involve studies on overland flow generation hydrophobicity tree canopy and bark

4832,broadleaf or conifer forest an ongoing dilemma as regards water resource and flood prevention although conifer trees use less water and are hydrophobic existing studies at the watershed scale have shown varying results due to variability in meteorological conditions and forestry practices in this study two adjacent headwater catchments 2 42 ha cypress cf 2 08 ha mixed broadleaf mb were gauged the study area in central japan has a warm temperate climate with high annual rainfall and typhoons daily discharge n 1398 and storm event hydrographs n 242 were compared between cf and mb and discussed in light of water availability and storm event runoff characteristics overall water yield in cf was 6 4 lower than in mb but this was caused by lower streamflow on high discharge periods 30 frequency thus may not adversely affect municipal agricultural water supply for 70 of the time including during dry periods water yield was higher in cf this agrees with the principle that conifers use less water than broadleaf trees even at the forested catchment scale discharge in the cf stream is also less variable than that in the mb stream during storm events the cf stream has higher flashiness shorter response time to rainfall and higher peak discharge than the mb stream but in larger storms 70 mm the mb stream may have higher peak discharge our data demonstrates that a well managed plantation forest does not necessarily have inferior hydrological function compared to a natural broadleaf forest which differs from the stereotype frequencies of high and low flows as well as runoff characteristics were also presented in hopes of promoting better forestry decisions when considering water demand and existing stormwater drainage infrastructures keywords forest conifer broadleaf transpiration runoff water resource 1 introduction generally evergreen conifers are quick to regulate stomatal opening in times of low water availability chirino et al 2011 link et al 2014 high solar irradiance kaufmann 1982a and high temperature kaufmann 1982b whereas anisohydric broadleaf trees maintain high transpiration rates despite low soil moisture as long as leaves are still present chirino et al 2011 link et al 2014 studies on tree water relationships have been conducted since the 1900s but most of these are laboratory or plot scale experiments that use tree seedlings perhaps one of the earliest thorough experiment comparing transpiration rates between broadleaf and deciduous plants is that by weaver and mogensen 1919 in which various species of conifer and broadleaf seedlings were planted in equally watered containers which were sealed and then weighed at intervals the study found lower transpirational losses in conifer compared to broadleaf seedlings unlike the sudden decrease in conifers caused by stomatal restriction the decrease in water loss following leaf abscission in broadleaf trees is gradual brodribb et al 2014 more recent studies have shown that older and taller trees have reduced water use due to reduced carbon fixation increased gravitational resistance to water uptake and enhanced stomatal control ambrose et al 2010 delzon et al 2004 delzon loustau 2005 ryan et al 2000 therefore there is a need to understand water uptake by older trees instead of seedlings in japan tree water relationship studies spiked during the recovery of the timber market crash 1970 2000 in which annual roundwood production has been increasing every year at present approximately 65 25 million ha of the country s land is forested 40 10 million ha of this is mature plantation forest with japanese cedar cypress and larch being the major species forestry agency 2017 seedling production has undergone exponential increase 110 thousand in 2006 to 5 33 million in 2016 for low pollen cedar alone which is a sign of continuous conifer centred policy by the government forestry agency 2017 this has resulted in large scale forest conversions that spurred concerns over impacts on water resources and hillslope stability as an effort to restore water availability some conifer plantations were even reverted back to broadleaf forests in recent years forestry agency 2015 the japanese forest society 2010 however studies that back up the validity the effectiveness of such methods remain scarce and inconclusive with regard to water uptake by trees komatsu et al 2007 found that et in broadleaf forests is approximately the same as that in young conifer plantations and even slightly higher than in older conifer plantations which suggests that plant water dynamics changes with tree age in the real world however how these changes are expressed in terms of runoff are complicated by energy and water availability tree age and the degree to which trees respond to a combination of these factors baldocchi and ryu 2011 vinukollu et al 2011 at the regional and global scale field experiments have been conducted to better understand the effects of forest conversion on runoff but only to yield varying inconclusive results komatsu et al 2009 in southwestern japan and fahey and jackson 1997 in new zealand found no differences in annual water yield between conifer and broadleaf forests hisada et al 2011 found higher runoff in a broadleaf forest compared to in a conifer plantation in gifu japan and have further specified that the differences were contributed by higher baseflow a study in south korea found faster baseflow recession in a conifer forest compared to in a broadleaf forest and has linked this to higher water uptake by conifer trees yang et al 2018 such findings differed from that in a recently published study conducted in the present study area nainar et al 2020 water resource availability aside studies such as miyata et al 2007 investigated storm runoff in a japanese cypress plantation and found high direct runoff as a result of water repellency similar to pine and eucalyptus plantations sidle et al 2007 also documented rapid runoff and thus introduced the concept of biomat flow in cypress plantations which is 3 2 to 8 3 times higher than overland flow in a deciduous forest plot pizarro et al 2006 however concluded that variation in peakflow cannot be attributed to variation in vegetative cover all these conflicting findings have caused uncertainties in designing policies for forestry operations such as the back and forth shift in species prioritization for reforestation komatsu et al 2009 komatsu et al 2011 have identified climate water and energy availability and tree species as the main cause for such disparity in tree water relationships all these varying findings signify that we are still far from being able to synthesise regional models and indicate the need for more rigorous investigations covering different species and climatic conditions especially that of latitudinal regions with highly heterogenous climate although studies on water uptake by trees have been conducted in the temperate region those from the warm humid temperate climate with influence from tropical cyclones are still lacking which is what this study aims to contribute this study took place in inuyama city of aichi prefecture central japan in this paired catchment study we analysed stream discharge data to ascertain the differences in hydrological characteristics between a japanese cypress plantation and secondary mixed broadleaf forest to achieve this we seek answers to these three questions 1 how does stream discharge compare between a cypress plantation and a natural secondary mixed broadleaf catchment specifically which forest type has higher water yield and better flow stability 2 during storm events how does stream discharge compare between a cypress plantation and a natural secondary mixed broadleaf forest which catchment has higher water yield and flashiness 3 how do the two catchments compare in terms of water resource availability and flood attenuation results were discussed from the aspect of water resource and storm runoff characteristics with consideration to rainfall preceding moisture vegetation and evapotranspiration et with reforestation initiatives including monoculture plantation increasing at the global scale fao 2015 forestry agency 2017 these findings may provide insights on water resource and flood management to regions with similar climate 2 study area 2 1 catchment history geology and climate this study compares runoff characteristics between two forested headwater catchments cf cypress forest and mb mixed broadleaf in inuyama city aichi prefecture central japan fig 1 these experimental catchments are located within the area of the ecohydrology research institute the university of tokyo forests major land use changes and heavy timber exploitation occurred during the meiji period 1868 1912 resulting in completely bare and denuded hills around the area the university forest area was first established in 1922 previously tokyo imperial university with the aim to restore forests and prevent hillslope disasters the earliest phase of restoration works include the planting of black pine pinus thunbergii and alder alnus japonica between 1922 and 1942 construction of sediment control check dams by the prefectural government took place between 1950 and 1952 starting from the early 1980s japanese hinoki cypresses were planted in small patches of land as of today the total area of the university of tokyo forests in inuyama city is 443 ha and comprises patches of cypress plantation and natural secondary mixed broadleaf forests the university of tokyo forests 2019 these two contrasting vegetation types represent the common forestry scenario in japan today being first order headwater catchments the topography is mountainous and steep but small variations exist between catchments table 1 the cf mean slope 25 catchment is generally steeper than mb mean slope 20 and has a higher proportion of slopes above 20 78 in cf 37 in mb elevation ranges from 140 to 187 m in the cf and 148 to 200 m in the mb the geology comprises a m√©lange matrix sandstone and mudstone from the middle to the late jurassic mesozoic jurassic middle callovian early cretaceous barremian and accretionary complexes geological survey of japan 2019 based on in situ observations and from kuraji et al 2019 impermeable paleozoic bedrock were found to underlie shallow tertiary sediment soils are shallow with parent material visibly exposed especially at higher parts of the catchment existing soils are not well developed and consist mainly of tertiary sediment in the b horizon in the cf catchment the uppermost a horizon topsoil is almost non existent but there was a layer of biomat fine root and organic material with varying degree of thickness throughout the catchment though these patches of biomat are not necessarily contiguous in mb very thin topsoil was found only in some lower reaches near the stream but a thick layer of litter covers the forest floor soil characteristics was determined at several points within each catchment and results show little differences between cf and mb mean bulk density was 1 004 g cm 3 in cf and 0 881 g cm 3 in mb respectively mean porosity and effective saturation were 0 621 and 45 19 in cf and 0 667 and 43 99 in mb respectively in each catchment soils from all sampled points have varying degree of particle composition but belong to the sandy loam class united states department of agriculture n d infiltration tests revealed that both cf and mb have high mean infiltration rates of 319 and 364 mm min 1 respectively which are characteristics of the high sand 47 89 72 97 and low clay 2 63 10 34 particle proportions inuyama city in aichi prefecture has a warm temperate climate k√∂ppen geiger cfa characterised by very hot and humid summers and moderate winters beck et al 2018 neither oceanic nor continental influences dominate rainfall is generally high and occurs all year round but most of the rainfall occurs between may to november rain events are of moderate amount and intensity rain occurs all year round without long dry periods but is more frequent during the rainy season baiu early june to mid july whereas sporadic tropical cyclones occur between august and october agency 2019 the wettest season coincides with the phenological growth period 1 may to 31 october while the remaining months are in the dormant period mean annual rainfall is 1860 mm year 1 2013 2018 with maximum daily totals between 67 and 148 mm day 1 daily mean temperatures recorded by the weather station in the study area 2013 2018 ranged from 1 to 4 c in winter and 27 to 29 c in summer with an annual mean of 14 to 16 c though the daily extremes may reach 9 c in winter and 38 c in summer respectively table 2 relative humidity ranges from 30 6 to 87 7 daily means of 47 8 86 1 2 2 catchment treatments vegetation and forestry practices catchment cf 2 42 ha is a japanese cypress chamaecyparis obtusa plantation forest at 31 34 years of age this area was planted between 1985 and 1988 at an initial stand density of 2 731 stem ha 1 and was managed according to the common forest management practices in the region up to the time of study the catchment has undergone two rounds of selective thinning the first round was a light thinning in the year 2000 while the second round was a high intensity 50 thinning divided into two phases middle of 2011 25 and early 2012 25 resulting in a tree density of 1036 stem ha 1 with an average basal area of 32 88 m2 ha 1 measured in july 2019 stem biomass and whole tree biomass estimated via allometric equations were 95 4 t ha sd 0 71 and 120 t ha sd 0 73 respectively hosoda and iehara 2010 catchment mb 2 08 ha is an unmanaged secondary mixed broadleaf forest this catchment has a mixture of evergreen and deciduous broadleaf trees with a stem density of 2188 stem ha 1 and average basal area of 25 3 m2 ha 1 the dominant species quercus serrata ilex pedunculosa clethra barbinervis and quercus glauca are anisohydric in nature harayama et al 2019 though a few individuals of red pine and cypress can be found at the ridge and bottom of the catchment table 3 a and b show the major species composition and the proportion of evergreen and deciduous trees respectively fig 2 shows photographs of the mb catchment in the growth and dormant period as well as photographs of the canopy and ground condition in cf 3 methodology 3 1 data collection and processing streams in both cf and mb were instrumented with 90 v notch weirs and trutrack dataloggers recording water levels at 5 minute intervals weirs were built by excavating soils up to the bedrock layer and then the concrete weir dams were sealed to the bedrock water level dataloggers at the weir were installed inside perforated pvc pipes that protect against debris impact while still allowing for water to pass through water level data were converted into discharge by means of a calibration curve obtained by measuring outflow from the weirs using a measuring cylinder and stopwatch calibration between datalogger water level weir water level and water level measured at a reference point were performed monthly during data collection and site maintenance data from five hydrological years may 2013 april 2018 were used in this study at the nearby weather station rainfall and other meteorological data were recorded rainfall was recorded by an ota keiki ow 34 bp tipping bucket raingauge 0 5 mm tip solar irradiance by a campbell scientific li200x pyranometer temperature and humidity by a vaisala hmp155 probe all connected to a campbell scientific cr10x datalogger that stores data at 5 minute intervals whose time is synchronized to that of the stream water level dataloggers considering scale and proximity we assume that rainfall is homogenous over both catchments the 5 minute interval raw data were processed into three datasets daily totals storm event hydrographs and hourly totals to be used in analyses at the overall scale storm event scale and application of the storage function model respectively in producing the daily totals for rainfall and discharge days without full records 288 5 minute data were excluded most data gaps occurred simultaneously in both catchments because they were caused by unfavourable natural conditions that affected the whole area other isolated sporadic data gaps were standardized deleted for both catchments for the sake of uniformity considering the abundance of data in total 1398 daily totals of discharge and rainfall 634 days in the growth 764 days in the dormant period over 5 years were available for analysis based on the local phenological scenario we define the growth period as 1st may to 31st october while the dormant period 1st november to 30th april of the following year for the storm event dataset hydrographs were separated according to the following criteria at least 0 0012 mm h 1 5 min 1 rise in discharge marks the start of a storm event storm event ends when discharge recedes to within 1 2 times the discharge at the start of an event or up to a maximum of 6 h after the last recorded rainfall in an event whichever occurs first a straight line connecting the initial discharge q initial to the end discharge q end of a storm event arbitrarily separates quickflow from baseflow fig 3 this is an improvisation of the hewlett hibbert and threshold method hewlett and hibbert 1967 after multiple tries via other hydrograph separation methods such as the hewlett hibbert method digital recursive filtering and usgs hysep we found that this percentage threshold method performed optimally in our study site due to two reasons i it is flexible enough to be applied via programming to both headwater catchments of differing hydrograph characteristics hence practical and effective and ii it applies a standardised and equal rule to hydrographs in both catchments therefore although the absolute quantity of old and new water is not exact its ratio old water new water between both catchments is a fair comparison even with the separation line being static the proportion separation of quickflow and baseflow still depends on hydrograph properties height and shape of peak and duration hence allowing each storm event to express its characteristics through this technique all hydrograph components are of real measured values with exception to the proportion of quickflow and baseflow which is a relative value this does not affect the objective of this study that is comparing discharge characteristics between a cypress and mixed broadleaf catchment for each hydrograph the following characteristics were determined instantaneous discharge at the start peak and end of an event q initial q peak and q end respectively total quickflow baseflow and discharge q quick q base and q tot respectively and time taken from the start of rain to q initial t res and from q initial to q peak t peak total rainfall that contributed to each storm event hydrograph is defined as the sum of rainfall between the first occurrence of rainfall and q end hydrograph separation storm event separation and extraction of the hydrograph metrics discharge components were done via the software fortran gcc 4 9 2 followed by visual inspection to exclude erroneous data a total of 242 common storm events in the cf and mb catchments over the same five year period were used in the storm event timescale analysis 3 2 data analysis and statistical methods indices such as the runoff coefficient c coefficients of variation in daily discharge var q and daily rainfall var p were calculated from daily totals nainar et al 2018 ochoa tocachi et al 2016 for use in conjunction with the flow duration curve fdc to describe and compare runoff characteristics during the study period may 2013 april 2018 at the storm event scale two kinds analysis were performed for differing purposes first the mann whitney u test was used to test for significant differences in the hydrograph components q tot q quick q base qi nitial q peak q end t res and t peak between catchments cf and mb following this the analysis of covariance ancova was performed to ascertain differences between the two forest type f the hydrograph component of interest y and their relationships with rainfall p and q initial via the software r v 3 4 1 predictors and their level of influence slope or intercept were retained by the backward elimination processes via the analysis of variance anova Œ± 0 05 the resulting multiple regression model 1 for different timeframes growth dormant and all period can be computed by substituting in the coefficients produced from ancova in table 6 in the results sections

the initial discharge rate in a storm event and f is a dummy variable for forest type f 1 for cypress forest f 0 for mixed broadleaf summed discharge components q tot q quick q base and rainfall p are in units of millimetres mm instantaneous discharge rate components q initial q peak q end have units of cubic meters per second per square kilometres m3 s 1 km 2 and time components t peak t res are in minutes 3 3 application of storage function model statistical comparison of stream discharge between two catchments may show differences in discharge characteristics however establishing causality to differences in evapotranspiration remains a challenge because other properties may also differ between cf and mb for this reason we have employed the storage function model and water balance equation to isolate and control for the effects of catchment properties the storage function model was initially developed for forecasting floods in large catchments sugiyama et al 1997 but its application have been extended to predicting water budget predicting runoff in ungauged basins and simulating storm runoff responses in catchments of various scales and orders gopalan et al 2020 gunaratne et al 2010 tani et al 2020 this issue wu et al 2011 the basic equation of the storage function model is 2 s k q p where s is the hypothetical water storage in the catchment in mm q is discharge in mm per unit time k and p are model parameters to be determined in line with the initial hypothesis that there are differences in stream discharge driven by differences in et we have employed the conceptual model water balance equation 3 ds dt p e t q where p is effective precipitation et is evapotranspiration q is discharge and ds dt is change in storage by focusing only on recession limbs during rain free periods the component p can be excluded excluding p and substituting 2 in to 3 resulted in 4 dq dt 1 kp q 1 p e t q based on the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 5 et Œ± Œ¥ r n g Œª v Œ¥ Œ≥ 1000 where et is evapotranspiration mm day 1 Œ¥ is the slope of saturation vapour pressure temperature curve kpa c 1 r n is net radiation mj m 2 day 1 g is soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 Œª v is the volumetric latent heat of vaporisation 2453 mj m 3 Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 and Œ± is a constant accounting for the vapour pressure deficit and resistance values including stomatal control and is unique to specific land uses or crops we assumed negligible g due to the relatively closed canopy cover ai and yang 2016 gunston and batchelor 1983 substituting 5 in 4 6 dq dt 1 kp q 1 p Œ± Œ¥ r n Œª v Œ¥ Œ≥ 1000 q hourly discharge q and potential evapotranspiration et p data were used in equation 6 to optimise the parameters k and p in the dormant period we assumed negligible differences in actual et between cf and mb in the dormant period thus potential evapotranspiration et p values calculated by Œ± 1 26 were used in the parameter optimisation stage for both cf and mb allen et al 1998 parameter optimisation was performed on extended periods of flow recession during the dormant period in order to minimise the effects of et and to avoid saturated conditions only discharge data on the secondary falling limb after a storm event after the inflexion point on log scales that are rain free for at least 72 h were used by these criteria three common recession events in cf and mb 1 10 february 23 28 march and 26 april 3 may 2015 were available for parameter optimisation the necessary parameters were derived using measured meteorological data where Œ¥ Œª v Œ≥ were derived after dingman 2002 while r n was derived by multiplying solar irradiance with the factor 0 8 komatsu et al 2007 optimisation was based on minimisation of root mean square error rmse between modelled q and measured q after parameter optimisation of k and p Œ± values for cf and mb were produced by applying eq 6 to recession events in the growth period using r n Œ¥ Œª v Œ≥ and measured q from each catchment recession events used for producing Œ± growth period were also selected based on the same criteria as in event selection for parameterisation dormant period where only the secondary recession limb of at least 72 h in length and rain free were qualified by these rigorous criteria four events in cf and five events in mb three common events in both catchments in the growth period were available production of Œ± in the growth period was also based on minimisation of rmse between modelled q and measured q as with most storage function models the physical significance of the parameters k and p have not been established without further expansion k and p can be considered as collective catchment characteristics that influence ds dt and q therefore we considered this model to be parsimonious for isolating collective catchment factors to highlight the effects of et the limited number of recession events available for parameter optimisation and production of Œ± is owing to the strict criteria that was set for event selection the main challenge was in obtaining rain free recession events of sufficient length in this region of high rainfall nevertheless we deem that stricter criteria minimizes influence from externalities and improves certainty of the model 4 results 4 1 overall flow characteristics fig 4 shows daily totals for rainfall and discharge in the cf and mb catchment 1 may 2013 30 april 2018 rainfall records are without gaps daily discharge average of cf and mb in the growth period was 57 higher than in the dormant period and corresponds to a 58 increase in rainfall resulting in similar runoff coefficients in the two periods 0 496 in the growth 0 499 in the dormant period daily discharge in all periods was 6 4 lower in cf compared to in mb as shown by the runoff coefficient c in table 4 significantly different mann whitney p 0 05 although cf had higher discharge than mb for most of the year 38 100 frequency it was lower on periods of high discharge 3 32 frequency fig 5 a this is better elucidated in fig 5b by plotting discharge in cf against that in mb we were able to observe their prevailing frequency in either catchments fig 5b shows that cf has higher frequency of higher discharge than mb n cf 954 n mb 444 especially when discharge is lower daily discharge 20 mm similar to daily discharge daily baseflow was slightly lower 3 84 in the cf but the ratio of daily baseflow to daily discharge daily q base daily q was slightly higher 0 727 in cf 0 707 in mb table 4 var q was 6 4 higher in mb 1 832 compared to in cf 1 722 signifying more stable flows in cf in the different phenological periods growth and dormant periods discharge in cf and mb had the same frequency distribution as in the all period comparison fig 5a c d daily discharge in both the growth and dormant periods were significantly different between cf and mb mann whitney p 0 05 but differences were more pronounced in the growth period overall discharge in cf was lower than in mb in both growth 4 11 and dormant 9 88 periods table 4 but discharge was higher for most of the time especially during no rain and moderate rain days this is shown in the 40 100 exceedance range of the fdc fig 5c d instead daily discharge on days of high flow was lower in cf fig 5 difference in var q between cf and mb was larger in the dormant period where var q in cf was 15 less than that in mb analyses in distinct phenological periods showed the similar results as that in all periods the ratio of daily baseflow to daily discharge daily q base daily q was higher in cf compared to in mb in both growth 0 682 in cf 0 669 in mb and dormant 0 799 in cf 0 764 in mb periods respectively table 4 4 2 priestley taylor coefficient Œ± parameter optimisation of the storage function model resulted in k and p values of 0 6048 and 1811 in cf rmse 0 0026 mm h 1 and 0 5430 and 1041 in mb rmse 0 0052 mm h 1 from various recession events in the growth period the priestley taylor coefficient Œ± ranged between 0 370 and 1 485 mean 1 012 in cf and 1 033 2 950 mean 1 827 in mb in general Œ± values were lower in cf than in mb in the growth period although intra catchment variation exists table 5 4 3 storm event scale peak discharge q peak and the time taken from the initial rise in discharge to peak discharge t peak were statistically significantly different between cf and mb when assessed throughout all periods and in the growth period mann whitney p 0 05 in all periods q peak was 2 21 higher whereas t peak was 19 32 shorter in cf compared to in mb indicating faster response in cf fig 6 a in the growth period q peak and t peak in cf was 7 5 higher and 23 01 shorter than in mb respectively fig 6b in the dormant period only the response time from the start of rain to the initial rise in discharge t res was statistically significantly different mann whitney p 0 05 where t res in cf is 6 35 shorter than in mb fig 6c both cf and mb had decreased t peak enhanced hydrograph flashiness when moving from the growth to the dormant period but difference between catchments was insignificant the multiple regression models for all hydrograph components show moderate to strong positive relationships with p and q initial as indicated by the adjusted r squared values with exception to t res table 6 in each period the metrices q tot q quick and q base have relatively strong coefficient of determination the inclusion of q initial as a second predictor significantly improved the coefficient of determination r 2 of the multiple regression this can be seen in fig 7 a and b where larger points higher q initial corresponding to higher preceding moisture are distributed higher in the y axis because t res did not correlate with p the ancova was performed to control for only q initial however the resulting r 2 was relatively low results from the ancova reinforces that from the mann whitney test whereby discharge characteristics during storm events differ significantly between cf and mb cf have shorter t peak t res and is more responsive fig 7a and b shows the regression of selected hydrograph components q tot and q peak between the different forest type tested via ancova results of the stepwise selection of variables coefficients and r squared of the multiple linear regressions are summarized in table 6 4 3 1 hydrograph characteristics from fig 7 a and b q tot and q peak values were higher in cf during events of lower rainfall but lower in events of higher rainfall for this reason in addition to statistical testing q tot and q peak in cf were plotted against that in mb and visualised with reference to a 1 1 line fig 7c d peak discharge during storm events q peak is higher in cf in small to medium events which are more frequent n 172 in larger events q peak is higher in mb n 70 despite catchment relief in cf being slightly steeper table 1 example hydrographs that depict these situations are in fig 8 5 discussion 5 1 overall discharge characteristics of cypress and mixed broadleaf forest the fdc curve of cf is flatter than that of mb indicating better regulation on discharge distribution increased discharge during dry periods and decrease discharge during wet periods fig 5 in addition it is understood that the 6 4 lower daily discharge in cf is a result of lower flows on days with high discharge and rainfall which should not be disadvantageous to water resource the conventional principle that conifer species uses less water compared to broadleaf species komatsu et al 2007 kusano 1901 weaver and mogensen 1919 yan et al 2018 is demonstrated here this is also supported by the higher proportion of baseflow in cf than in mb differences in water yield between cf and mb corresponds to the Œ± values in table 5 abe et al 2017 hattori et al 1992 tanaka et al 2005 similar results were also observed by regional studies focusing on the tree scale kusano 1901 weaver and mogensen 1919 a more recent tree scale investigation in the jiuzhaigou valley of china also reported that conifer species transpire between 30 and 50 less water compared to broadleaf species yan et al 2018 the reason as to why cf have lower discharge on high flow days needs further investigation though a possible factor is that wetter periods may decrease hydrophobicity in cypress catchments kobayashi and shimizu 2007 leelamanie and nishiwaki 2019 miyata et al 2007 that have higher storage capacity at both the ground and tree level compared to in broadleaf forests crockford and richardson 2000 sidle et al 2007 schooling 2014 levia and germer 2015 iida et al 2017 also in appendix a compared to other cypress catchments this factor may be of higher prominence in the present study due to the practice of placing felled logs along slope contours fig 2 other recent studies crockford and richardson 2000 iida et al 2017 levia et al 2010 levia and germer 2015 schooling 2014 have also highlighted the significance of tree physiology and morphology surface area roughness continuity etc in determining whether water is stored or drained away reid and lewis 2009 found that up to 54 of rainfall may be stored in the bark lower var q in cf demonstrates better flow regulation and could be due to a myriad of factors ground and aboveground processes greater differences in var q between cf and mb in the dormant period suggest that tree crowns may play a role via interception and or transpiration despite the considerable reduction in rain amount and frequency when moving from the growth to the dormant period var q in mb did not change by the same degree which suggest less interception and transpiration caused by leaf abscission 5 2 storm event scale at the storm event scale only q peak and t peak were statistically significantly different in the growth period mann whitney p 0 05 the 7 5 higher peak discharge and 23 01 shorter time to peak in cf in the growth period indicate rapid response after commencement of the rising limb which may be attributed to preferential flow due to water repellency as reported in existing studies kobayashi et al 2006 kobayashi and shimizu 2007 miyata et al 2007 although studies in the region sun et al 2015b 2015a tanaka et al 2005 have established that canopy interception is higher in cypress than in mixed broadleaf forests the relatively open canopy in cf fig 2 compared to that in unthinned cypress forests may have resulted in lower canopy interception and consequently quicker streamflow response nagano et al 2017 found that the relationship between stand density and interception is exponential rather than linear for japanese cypress plantation thus pointing to the possibility of an exponentially reduced interception in this study in the dormant period t res in cf was 32 93 lower than in mb but q peak and t peak did not differ significantly compared to mb this translates to faster responses from the onset of rain to the first rise in discharge but peak discharge characteristics in the hydrograph itself remains similar between both catchments the lower t res in cf in the dormant period may again be linked to the relatively dry surface conditions that has led to increased hydrophobicity in cypress forests leelamanie and nishiwaki 2019 however the fact that t res in mb is not shorter than in cf despite defoliation also suggests that the increase in ground litter interception may up to some extent compensate for the decrease in canopy interception the lack of differences in q peak and t peak between cf and mb however may indicate the limited effectiveness of ground litter interception in mb whereby after ground litter interception capacity is exceeded q peak and t peak in mb can be as high as in cf this follows observation by butzen et al 2015 where a continuous concentrated flow on the surface of ground litter is possible as soon as the litter surface becomes well wetted the mann whitney test assesses differences in the respective discharge characteristics between catchments cf and mb inclusive of environmental factors such as precipitation and preceding moisture conditions that is to say results from the mann whitney test are more representative of actual conditions in this field study and may apply to similar regional climatic scenarios the more rigorous ancova may isolate up to a certain degree the influence of precipitation and preceding moisture thus reinforcing that forest type is the driver of change in discharge dynamics integrating results from both analyses we can deduce that streams in cf have higher flashiness lower t peak and t res than in mb during storm events differences in q peak between cf and mb are no longer prominent upon controlling for the effects of rainfall p and preceding moisture q initial which imply that differences in q peak arise from differences in effective rainfall and or preceding moisture between cf and mb 5 3 discrepancy synthesis and past studies from previous sections the overall lower water yield in cf compared to mb despite its higher fdc limb was provisionally attributed to lower water yield on days of high flow seen in fig 5 however q tot from analysis at the event scale does not indicate this no significant differences between cf and mb which may be due to either of the following reasons i these events although large in magnitude occurred only occasionally hence not statistically significant ii differences occured over prolonged periods as days of high discharge instead of total discharge during the storm event itself fig 5b shows that in the 954 occurrences when daily discharge in cf is higher than in mb there was a total of 330 mm higher discharge in cf whereas in the 444 occurrences of higher daily discharge in mb there was a total of 555 mm higher discharge in mb this supports the observation from the fdc fig 5 where discharge in cf is lower than in mb on occasional days of high flows but higher than in mb for most of the time thereby confirming both hypotheses above this also agrees with the modelled priestley taylor coefficients Œ± values table 5 therefore despite the lack of statistically significant differences these characteristics may be of high physical significance from the aspect of tree water uptake similar results were reported by yan et al 2018 who found relatively conservative water use by conifer compared to broadleaf trees in china streamflow however was not measured in the study making it difficult to translate these results to impacts on water resource and flood risk the present study advances that of yan et al 2018 by interpreting differences in tree transpiration in to catchment discharge and water availability perhaps the most comparable study to date is that by hisada et al 2011 where the short term water budget and priestly taylor method were used to assess the difference in discharge and between japanese cypress and mizunara oak the resulting lower discharge from the cypress catchment was claimed to have resulted from reduced baseflow on days without rain our study advances that of hisada et al 2011 by exploring overall water yield as well as individual storm events which has led to two standpoints i we agree that overall cypress forests have lower stream discharge ii however evidence from our study shows that the lower stream discharge in cypress forests occurred on days of high flow instead of baseflow throughout 70 of the time water yield in the cypress catchment was higher than in the broadleaf catchment from a water resource management aspect especially in an agriculture intensive region cypress forests may be beneficial because of its higher water availability especially in the growth season when agricultural water demand is at its peak however results may differ from catchments with different stem density and management practices besides water yield discrepancies were also found in hydrograph characteristics in cf and mb between events of different magnitude in storms of around 50 mm and less the rising limb in mb appears to follow the saturation excess concept fig 8a on the other hand the rising limb in cf exhibited quick response that is characteristic of the hortonion concept or the more recent biomat flow concept sato et al 2020 sidle et al 2007 sato et al 2019 however during events of higher rainfall and likely higher rainfall intensity both catchments show little difference in the shape and angle of the rising limb but the magnitude of peak discharge is higher in mb observation from this paired catchment comparison agrees in part with past observations gomi et al 2008 kobayashi et al 2006 kobayashi and shimizu 2007 leelamanie and nishiwaki 2019 miyata et al 2007 including those from outside japan butzen et al 2015 doerr et al 2009 where cypress catchments exhibit high water repellency however in addition to that we also observed that above a certain storm threshold magnitude natural mixed broadleaf forests may display higher peak discharge and water yield fig 7c d fig 8 these results have led us to believe that cypress plantation forests may not necessarily be inferior to natural mixed broadleaf forests in terms of flood mitigation our data have demonstrated that cypress plantation forest may afford better flood attenuation capabilities in larger storms especially when well managed which may be contrary to popular belief and findings from other regions however the exact mechanisms to this require further investigation 6 conclusions and recommendations we have assessed the differences in discharge characteristics between an intensively thinned japanese cypress plantation forest and a naturally regenerated mixed broadleaf forest and came to the following conclusions 1 overall the cypress forest had lower 6 4 water yield compared to the mixed broadleaf forest but this occurred only during high flow periods for most 70 of the time including in dry periods the cypress forest had higher water yield this agrees with the conservative water use characteristics of conifer species as also indicated by the storage function model the cypress forest also have a relatively stable stream discharge compared to the mixed broadleaf forest 2 water yield during storm events did not differ between the cypress and mixed broadleaf forest in small to large rain events up to 50 mm the cypress forest exhibited higher hydrograph flashiness in larger magnitude rain events 70 mm the mixed broadleaf forest exhibited higher flashiness 3 in light of water resource and flood attenuation a well managed cypress plantation forest may not be as detrimental as stereotypically thought our data has shown that the inverse is possible cypress forests have increased water availability and buffered stream response compared to mixed broadleaf forests this study has addressed some long standing uncertainties in streamflow dynamics and water resource issues that stems from forest type conversion in a warm japanese temperate climate findings can also be extended and applied to regions of warm temperate climate with or without the extremities of typhoons the decision of whether to prioritise conifer or broadleaf species should be made with consideration to downstream water demand climate and existing stormwater drainage capacity this study is however limited in several aspects namely tree species manipulation management techniques and climate it may be beneficial to

4833,the analysis of unsteady flows in natural rivers is highly complicated one of the most important factors that causes errors in calculating the flow depth and discharge is the inability to accurately estimate the values of manning s roughness coefficient n for longitudinal river cross sections most conventional methods for calibrating n only provide a mean value for longitudinal river cross sections which can significantly increase errors in flood routing therefore a new method is presented herein for identifying the distribution functions of n along natural rivers based on modified random search optimization and clustering mrsoc in this method only the inflow and outflow hydrographs need be determined to obtain the minimum data required the proposed method was verified using synthetic field and experimental data the results indicate that using the proposed method all the gradual and abrupt changes of the n value at longitudinal cross sections of natural rivers can be estimated with sufficient accuracy and the equations for these changes can also be obtained this can eventually lead to a noticeable reduction in errors in flood routing keywords manning s roughness coefficient gradual and abrupt changes distribution functions flood routing unsteady flow hydrograph 1 introduction in hydraulics most problems related to flow analysis generally require an estimation of manning s roughness coefficient n and several studies have been performed to estimate and adjust n butler et al 2015 kamali et al 2018 li et al 2017 mohammadpour et al 2020 seyedzadeh et al 2019 one of the fields of hydraulic science in which a suitable estimation of n is of high importance is flood routing in natural rivers manning s equation as an empirical relationship is not applicable for unsteady flow conditions and compound channels with high accuracy and aspects like inertia diffusive waves and kinematic waves are neglected in this equation ardƒ±√ßlƒ±oƒülu and kuriqi 2019 chatila and townsend 1996 moreover other available empirical relationships which were reviewed by papaioannou et al 2017 can generally present only a uniform or constant n value for longitudinal river cross sections thus none of the currently available equations or tables can accurately estimate the value of this coefficient under all circumstances coon 1995 ardƒ±√ßlƒ±oƒülu and kuriqi 2019 in natural rivers the roughness coefficient may noticeably change along the longitudinal direction ramesh et al 2000 timbadiya et al 2011 and this change affects the precise determination of hydraulic parameters such as discharge and river stage due to the dependency of these parameters on the channel s roughness characteristics timbadiya et al 2011 for instance around a 40 percent discharge error was reported with a change of 50 percent in the manning s n for a palaeoflood in a bedrock river kidson et al 2006 knowing the water levels and peak discharge information for rivers and open channels is extremely vital at the time of flood events in order to appropriately design hydraulic structures employ protection measures and protect lives bao et al 2009 rashid and chaudhry 1995 accordingly the importance of accurate n value estimation must be highlighted in unsteady flow analysis for flood routing n carries the highest level of complexity among all the parameters involved johnson 1996 this parameter is dependent on many factors including channel irregularities and alignment vegetation surface roughness characteristics sediment grain diameter in the main channel and floodplains etc which causes numerous complexities regarding its proper estimation ramesh et al 2000 timbadiya et al 2011 with the consideration of the uncertainties involved in estimating n a calibration method which uses observed inflow and outflow hydrographs as available flow data is a common method in this method the estimation of n is adjusted by minimizing the difference between the observed outflow hydrograph and the one obtained by a flood routing model for the corresponding inflow hydrograph several studies have been carried out to calibrate the manning s n parameters and develop hydraulic models for different rivers ardƒ±√ßlƒ±oƒülu and kuriqi 2019 bao et al 2009 lal 1995 pappenberger et al 2005 patro et al 2009 timbadiya et al 2011 usul and turan 2006 vijay et al 2007 in the study by kidson et al 2006 the uncertainty of the roughness coefficient was investigated for a river located in northern thailand and the authors concluded that semi empirical equations may underestimate the n values in comparison with those obtained from the calibrated roughness coefficient in another study by song et al 2014 using the proper n value to decrease the estimation errors in hydraulic models was also emphasized boulomytis et al 2017 estimated and calibrated the manning s n values by using cowan s methodology and the hec ras model respectively for the juqueriquere river basin in northern sao paulo brazil although an acceptable agreement was generally obtained for both the estimation and calibration methods a discrepancy in the derived n values was also reported in some cross sections which requires further study despite extensive research that has focused on n value calibration the possibility of changes in this parameter has been disregarded along river reaches between two gauging stations variations in n along the length of a river can increase errors in the estimation of this parameter and the results of different studies on natural rivers have clearly shown that the use of a fixed value for n along a river may consequently lead to errors in its flood routing timbadiya et al 2011 this issue is important particularly in long river reaches where the number of hydrometric stations is restricted as it is not possible to identify the changes in n along natural rivers by using conventional methods the number of these stations should be increased to have a better evaluation of n variations ramesh et al 2000 given the importance of changes in n on flood routing attari and hosseini 2019 investigated the calibration of n in rivers by using the random search optimization and clustering rsoc approach their proposed method could identify and determine distinct regions with different n values and their lengths along a river reach despite the fact that this method was not able to adequately detect gradual changes in n the results showed that by identifying the distribution of n with greater accuracy flood routing errors were significantly decreased as well the inability to use this method for compound channels in which the n values of the main channel and the floodplains are different was raised as a limitation of this methodology in the present study as a novel approach the method proposed by attari and hosseini 2019 is improved to facilitate the determination of gradual and sudden changes in n parameter this is followed by applying the presented methodology to two different synthetic data sets as well as experimental data for a compound channel and field data for the tiber river also the capability of this approach known as modified random search optimization and clustering mrsoc is investigated in order to provide the distribution functions of all changes in n by using only observed input and output hydrographs enhancing the prediction accuracy of n variations along a river is expected as a main benefit of the mrsoc approach as compared to conventional methods 2 methodology in this section the framework of the proposed method is explained based on the flood routing model including governing equations and their numerical solutions along with the methodology for optimizing or calibrating n to identify the functions of all gradual and abrupt changes of the n value along a river or channel 2 1 flood routing model to analyze the gradually varied unsteady open channel flow and in the absence of lateral flow the saint venant equations can be considered as the governing equations eqs 1 and 2 these equations are derived by applying the continuity and momentum equations to a differential control volume of flow i e 1 a t q x 0 2 q t Œ≤ q 2 a x g a y x g a s 0 s f 0 in the above equations y is the flow depth Œ≤ is the momentum correction factor a is the flow area g is the gravitational acceleration q is the discharge s0 is the longitudinal channel slope sf is the friction slope t is the time and x is the displacement in the main flow direction the friction slope parameter in saint venant equations can be defined as follows jain 2001 3 s f œÑ 0 Œ≥ r where Œ≥ is the specific weight of the fluid r is the hydraulic radius and œÑ 0 is the average wall shear stress based on the current knowledge of hydraulics and from a practical point of view this parameter can be calculated as jain 2001 4 s f q 2 k 2 where k is the conveyance factor of the channel at normal depth and is defined for a single channel by eq 5 jain 2001 5 k a n r 2 3 where a is the cross sectional area of the channel and n is the manning s roughness coefficient the momentum correction factor is formulated as follows jain 2001 6 Œ≤ i 1 n k i 2 a i i 1 n k i 2 i 1 n a i where n represents the number of subsections and subscript i stands for the i th subsection except for idealized situations no analytical solution is available for these equations among the various numerical methods that can be used to solve the saint venant equations the preissman method was applied in this study this method is also known as the weighted four point implicit finite difference scheme fread 1993 it should be noted that based on fread s suggestion for flood waves the weighting factor was selected as 0 55 fread 1974 2 2 calibration of n this section aims to introduce a new method to identify regions with distinct n functions along a river or channel a set of inflow and outflow hydrographs supplies the minimum information required in this method according to fig 1 it is also assumed that the longitudinal section of the river is composed of n regions with varying roughness functions fig 2 a illustrates the distinct functions of n considered at the two gauging stations 1 and 2 in the first step of the proposed method the n value is estimated at designated points on a longitudinal cross section of the river in accordance with fig 2 b afterward using the clustering method each of these points is assigned to a cluster and the optimal number of clusters is determined finally according to fig 2 c the optimal curve is fitted using the points for each cluster and then the equation of the roughness distribution function of that cluster is specified this procedure can be described and followed through seven steps the first six steps of the proposed method illustrate the way to estimate the n values along the river reach as shown in fig 2 b and in the seventh step of the proposed method the method of identifying the optimal number of clusters and the distribution function of n is described as shown in fig 2 c it is worthwhile to note that in the proposed mrsoc method the monte carlo simulation is applied to perform the random search optimization procedure the monte carlo simulation is a numerical technique to generate random values of the desired variable according to a probabilistic distribution this method which was introduced by metropolis and ulam 1949 provides a robust statistical approach and various distribution types in our case based on engineering experience and or field surveys a broad interval should be considered for the n distribution such that the actual n value falls within the range of the produced data accordingly using the monte carlo simulation a series of randomized n values by assuming a uniform distribution is generated and assigned to each of the sub reaches for each monte carlo simulation run and the generated n values the saint venant equations are used to obtain and calibrate the outflow hydrographs based on the model output the best values of the generated random n values as well as their related statistical properties can be achieved the details of proposed mrsoc method are explained through the following seven steps step 1 the river is partitioned into two equivalent sub reaches and the best n for each sub reach is then specified initially the river is partitioned into two equivalent sub reaches each with a series of n data randomly produced using the monte carlo simulation while assuming a uniform distribution on the basis of the inflow hydrograph outflow hydrographs are developed for the entire range of n values by using the saint venant equations next the optimal n values for both sub reaches are determined such that the error between the calculated and observed outflow hydrographs is minimized as shown in eq 7 7 sse i 1 w h oi h ci 2 where sse is the sum of the square of the errors w is the overall number of data points and hci and hoi are the ordinates of the calculated and observed depth or discharge outflow hydrographs respectively step 2 the river is partitioned into three equivalent sub reaches and the best n for each sub reach is then specified step 2 follows the process detailed in step 1 except that three sub reaches are involved step 3 the river is partitioned into four sub reaches and the initial approximation of the n value for each sub reach is obtained according to the findings of steps 1 and 2 optimization is carried out subsequently in step 3 as the main step the river is partitioned into four sub reaches and the mean n value of each sub reach is then computed by eqs 8 11 the n value of each sub reach in the following equations is approximated by using the n values estimated for the two prior runs for instance eq 9 is utilized to estimate the weighted mean n value of sub reach number 2 for the third run n 2 3 according to eq 9 the weighting parameter is dependent on the length and sse values of the two prior runs as related to n 2 3 and l 3 fig 3 shows the partitioning of the river for different runs 8 n 1 3 n 1 1 l 3 1 s s e 1 n 1 2 l 3 1 s s e 2 l 3 1 s s e 1 l 3 1 s s e 2 n 1 1 1 s s e 1 n 1 2 1

refers to the n of sub reach i for run 3 and ss e 1 and ss e 2 represent the least summation of the squared errors for runs 1 and 2 respectively the lengths x 1 and x 2 with dissimilar n values also have an impact on n 2 3 and n 3 3 as presented in fig 3 following the initial approximation of the n value for all sub reaches the range of possible n for the third step is produced using the monte carlo simulation while assuming a uniform distribution as shown in eq 12 12 1 Œ± i 3 n i 3 n 1 Œ± i 3 n i 3 where Œ± i 3 indicates the interval definition parameter Œ± of sub reach i for run 3 it is necessary to choose a greater Œ± i 3 for the sub reaches affected by more dissimilar n values including sub reaches 2 and 3 fig 3 the Œ± i 3 value is obtained by using eq 13 on the basis of the uppermost and lowermost values of n that control n i 3 13 Œ± i 3 max n 1 n 2 min n 1 n 2 2 n i 3 where n1 and n2 represent the n values for runs 1 and 2 respectively considering eqs 8 11 these values affect the estimation of n i 3 in the primary runs inaccurate identification of n may occur in some sub reaches due to the value of Œ± i k for these sub reaches approaching zero considering a minimal value of Œ± i k for every sub reach may improve the accurate estimation of n in fact this minimal value which must theoretically decline with an increasing number of sub reaches allows more degrees of freedom for approaching the actual n value for every sub reach various case studies were tested to propose eq 14 14 Œ± i min k 0 25 c 0 25 k 1 where k denotes the run number and c refers to the number of sub reaches it should be mentioned that according to the presented definitions c is equal to k 1 as a result of this step by using the monte carlo simulation a series of n values is produced randomly for all the sub reaches and based on the saint venant equations and given that the input hydrograph is specified the output hydrographs for flow depth and or discharge can be computed then by comparing the observational and computational hydrographs using eq 7 the initial n values of all the sub reaches can be calibrated to arrive at the optimal n values step 4 the number of sub reaches is increased by repeating the procedure described in step 3 following the algorithm detailed in step 3 the number of sub reaches is increased through each run the initial n values are calculated for all the sub reaches and the intervals are obtained based on the investigations of the two prior runs for each sub reach by eqs 15 16 and 14 a series of randomized data is then produced and assigned to each of the sub reaches by using the monte carlo simulation ultimately the initial n values are calibrated by applying the saint venant equations to the produced data and the optimal n values for all sub reaches are obtained with the consideration of eq 7 15 1 Œ± i k n i k n 1 Œ± i k n i k 16 Œ± i k max n k 2 n k 1 min n k 2 n k 1 2 n i k step 5 a satisfactory condition is examined to end the calculations the calculation completion condition is described based on eq 17 17 l k l k 1 Œ¥ in which Œ¥ refers to the length difference between two sub reaches in runs k and k 1 a Œ¥ value of lower than 1 of the length of the river reach is recommended in order for pattern identification step 6 the best run needs to be specified it can be assumed that every sub reach in run k is partitioned into two sub reaches with an equivalent length in run 2 k 1 identification of n will be acceptable if the n values for all sub reaches at run 2 k 1 have no significant difference with the equivalent n values for run k additionally another parameter that contributes to choosing the best run is the sse between the observed and calculated outflow hydrographs eq 18 comprises the combinatory impacts of the similarity between the n values and sse as 18 e i 1 c n 2 i 2 k 1 n i k i 1 c n 2 i 1 2 k 1 n i k l 2 k 1 ss e k s s e 2 k 1 in which c is the number of river sub reaches at run k the e value should be considered for all the conjugate runs k and 2 k 1 beginning from k 1 the best of the conjugate runs are considered to be those with a minimal e value as the final answer the one with a relatively lower sse would be introduced among the two best conjugate runs k and 2 k 1 based on the procedures explained in these six steps the points shown in fig 2 b can be determined the position of these points is actually the center of each of the sub reaches except for the first sub reach at x 0 and the last sub reach at x l and the manning s roughness coefficient corresponding to these points is the average roughness coefficient for each sub reach step 7 determining the optimal number of clusters and deriving the manning s roughness distribution function for each cluster to obtain the final answer if the river is divided into a large number of sub reaches it is possible to consider the sub reaches with values of manning s roughness coefficient that are close to each other as one region by using a clustering method in this approach the k means method is employed for clustering hartigan and wong 1979 after calculation a number of points are selected as the seeds each seed contains the distance information from the beginning of the river x and the manning s roughness coefficient next each sub reach is assigned to the nearest cluster and the new center of each cluster is determined these centers play the role of seeds for the next iteration of the algorithm in the next step each sub reach is reassigned to the nearest cluster and a new center is assigned to each cluster these stages are repeated until the center of each cluster remains constant and once completed the manning s roughness distribution function can be determined for each cluster it is important to note that to perform the clustering the normalized n and logarithm x values are used to carry out n normalization the value of n in each sub reach is divided by the greatest amount of n obtained along the river also to normalize the x parameter the central distance of each sub reach from the beginning of the river is divided by the total length of the study area the optimal number of seeds is chosen through the following algorithm 1 initially the number of seeds is assumed as one thus the optimal roughness distribution function is determined for all the points obtained in step 6 and shown in fig 2 b 2 after determining the roughness distribution function the corresponding output hydrograph is calculated then by comparing the computed and observed hydrographs the sse is calculated 3 next one seed is added and a roughness function is re obtained for each cluster the output hydrograph is then calculated based on the manning s roughness coefficient functions and the sse is determined 4 the number of seeds continues to increase until a maximum of two points is situated in each cluster in this case there is no need to increase the number of seeds any further finally the answer that results in the least sse is selected as the best answer 3 results and discussion applicability of the proposed method different examples including synthetic real world and experimental data are investigated in this section in order to show the capabilities of the proposed method for identifying all the possible changes in the value of n 3 1 example 1 synthetic data the main aim of this example is to recognize the pattern of distribution of n through an inverse problem by using the steps presented in section 2 2 while applying the inflow and outflow hydrographs as data sources this hypothetical rectangular river is assumed to have a 3000 m length 10 m width and a bed slope of 0 0001 in this example the river includes three distinct regions with various n values the first and last regions have 500 m lengths with n values of 0 02 and 0 03 respectively the middle part is 2 km in length and the corresponding n rises linearly from 0 02 to 0 03 the initial and boundary conditions are as follows the initial condition is a subcritical flow with a constant discharge of 1 69 m3 s and a stage discharge relationship controlling the flow downstream s 0 s f 0 is considered as a boundary condition the flow initial depth was calculated through the use of the conventional standard step method fig 4 a the depth hydrographs for inflow and corresponding outflow are also demonstrated in fig 4 b using the preissman scheme introduced in section 2 1 the outflow hydrograph was computed assuming the mentioned downstream boundary condition a uniformly distributed random error with an interval of 1 1 cm was also added to the ordinates of the outflow hydrograph in accordance with the steps given in section 2 2 assigning the values of some parameters is needed as follows from the uniform distribution 0 015 0 04 the n values were sampled in steps 1 and 2 and using monte carlo simulation a series of random n values were produced for all runs a termination condition Œ¥ 25 m was determined to end the calculations in step 5 fig 5 illustrates the schematic view of manning s roughness distribution obtained for different runs using the presented methodology moreover fig 6 demonstrates the sse for all the 11 runs conducted in this example fig 7 demonstrates the e values calculated by eq 18 in step 6 in order to choose the best pattern the lowest e values and sse between the ordinates of the outflow hydrographs should be considered the results for the e values showed that for the 6 and 12 sub reaches the lowest value of this parameter was obtained subsequently the results for the run 11 corresponding to the 12 sub reaches had the best answer this can be confirmed by the lowest sse results for the run 11 in fig 6 after determining the optimal answer the points shown in fig 2 b can be determined as mentioned in section 2 2 the arrangement of these points is shown in fig 8 then the optimum number of clusters should be specified according to the statements in section 2 2 and in the seventh step the relationship between the number of clusters and the sse should be examined as shown in fig 9 the minimum value of the sse occurs when the number of clusters is equal to one while the manning s roughness coefficient distribution function is in accordance with eq 19 19 n 1 86 10 16 x 4 2 21 10 12 x 3 6 79 10 9 x 2 2 07 10 6 x 0 0197 a comparison between the results obtained from the rsoc method attari and hosseini 2019 and those from eq 19 based on the mrsoc method is presented in fig 10 as seen in fig 10 the sse decreased from 0 0452 m2 in the rsoc method to 0 000574 m2 in the mrsoc method this confirms the capability of the proposed methodology to accurately recognize possible changes in the n values 3 2 example 2 synthetic data similar to example 1 the aim of this example is to evaluate the applicability of the methodology through an inverse problem with different conditions a hypothetical rectangular river with a 10 m width 3000 m length and bed slope of 0 0001 is assumed as a second case study in this example the river has two distinct regions with different n values the n value in the first region which is 1500 m long rises linearly from 0 02 to 0 03 the second part is 1500 m in length with an n value of 0 02 the initial condition is a subcritical flow with a constant discharge of 4 126 m3 s this is the condition before the arrival of the flood wave in addition the boundary conditions are the same as those considered in example 1 the initial flow depth was obtained through the use of the conventional standard step method fig 11 a the depth hydrographs for the inflow and corresponding outflow are depicted in fig 11 b the outflow hydrograph was computed by applying the downstream boundary condition and the preissman scheme as the numerical approach a uniformly distributed random error with an interval of 1 1 cm was also added to the ordinates of the outflow hydrograph the parameters of the method were considered to be as follows regarding the steps given in section 2 2 1 from the uniform distribution 0 015 0 04 the n values were sampled in steps 1 and 2 2 using a monte carlo simulation one thousand random values of n were produced for all runs 3 a termination condition of Œ¥ 25 m was determined to end the calculations in step 5 the schematic view of manning s roughness distribution and the sse for the conducted runs using the presented methodology are demonstrated in figs 12 and 13 respectively fig 14 shows the values for e determined by eq 18 in this example the lowest values for e and sse were found for runs 5 and 11 when the river reach was divided into 6 and 12 sub reaches among them the results for the 12 sub reaches were more acceptable due to the lowest obtained values for sse the arrangement of points related to the distribution of the roughness coefficient is shown in fig 15 this verifies the accurate recognition of the two distinct regions now optimal clustering must be performed and then the function of n in each cluster must be estimated the relationship between the number of clusters and the sse values showed that if the number of clusters was greater than or equal to two significant changes might not occur in the sse fig 16 consequently the minimum value of the sse could be obtained when the number of clusters is equal to two while the distribution functions of the roughness coefficient are in accordance with eq 20 20 n 0 x 1500 1 6 10 9 x 2 9 10 6 x 0 0199 n 1500 x 3000 0 97 10 9 x 2 4 2 10 6 x 0 016 the values of the roughness coefficient calculated based on eq 20 and its actual values for the second example are shown in fig 17 the results show that the mrsoc method is able to identify gradual and sudden changes in manning s roughness coefficient in the channel s longitudinal section it is also important to note that if the mean value of n for this example is calculated according to conventional methods the value will be 0 0205 and the corresponding value of the sse will be 3 3 m2 in the first two examples which were based on the synthetic data the effectiveness of the proposed method was examined to determine the roughness distribution function if the longitudinal section of the river includes significant variations in the roughness coefficient using the manning s roughness coefficient distribution function instead of assuming a fixed value for the parameter n can lead to more accurate flood routing this issue is also investigated in the following examples through the use of field and laboratory data 3 3 example 3 tiber river data the objective of this example is to identify the pattern of the roughness distribution for the tiber river located in central italy as a real world problem by applying the presented methodology a length of 15 km with a bed slope of 0 0016 between the gauged stations upstream at pierantonio and downstream at ponte felcino in the river reach was considered as the case study it should be noted that perumal et al 2007 reported a uniform value of n 0 049 for this river reach fig 18 shows the tiber river s cross sections at the mentioned stations one dataset for the flood in december 1996 was used to identify the possible distribution of n in the river reach and then the november 1997 flood s dataset was employed for the validation of the results their relevant depth hydrographs of the observed inflow and outflow are illustrated in fig 19 the stage discharge relationship q y was also considered as a downstream boundary condition fig 20 perumal et al 2007 the parameters were considered to be as follows referring to the steps given in section 2 2 1 from the uniform distribution 0 04 0 06 the n values were randomly sampled in steps 1 and 2 2 using monte carlo simulation two hundred random values of n were produced for all runs 3 a termination condition of Œ¥ 125 m was determined to end the calculations in step 5 finally the results from this example show that the roughness distribution function for the tiber river can be expressed according to eq 21 21 n 0 x 15000 1 99 10 11 x 2 6 4 10 7 x 0 0483 eq 21 indicates there is a small change in the roughness coefficient in the river reach and that the minimum and maximum values of n over the reach are 0 0483 and 0 0534 respectively additionally the results show that higher values of n are obtained downstream in comparison with the upstream region fig 21 represents the comparison between the observed outflow depth y and discharge q hydrographs and the calculated ones obtained from the mrsoc method and the uniform roughness coefficient proposed by perumal et al 2007 as a result the presented methodology provides a reliable outcome in both the calibration and validation phases for a real world problem to show the precision of the results the normalized root mean square error nrmse the absolute value of relative error in peak depth or discharge arepd and absolute value of relative error in peak depth or discharge time arepdt are presented in table 1 the results suggest that applying the proposed method can decrease the error rates for depth and discharge flow estimation however this reduction was not noticeable for the tiber river due to the lack of significant changes in the manning s roughness coefficient over a time scale of about one year it is worthwhile to mention that although changes in the n value were not considerable with time for the tiber river this may not happen with other natural river systems therefore the possibility of variations in n during different seasons and with channel changes over time due to the dependency of the n value on factors like vegetation cover riverbed geomorphology local conditions and so on should not be ignored hence this issue should be studied further by obtaining more field data 3 4 example 4 experimental data in this example the experimental data reported by rashid and chaudhry 1995 are applied in order to examine the applicability of the mrsoc method for a compound channel consisting of a main channel section and floodplains on either side the length of the working section of the flume was 18 6 m and the cross section of the flume is illustrated in fig 22 table 2 presents the variations of the equivalent n with the flow depth it is necessary to separately generate the roughness coefficient data for the main channel and the floodplain for our study thus based on the data presented in table 2 and horton s equation which is expressed via eq 22 jain 2001 the range of the roughness coefficient for the floodplain can be obtained 22 n e i 1 n p i n i 1 5 2 3 p 2 3 in which ne represents the equivalent roughness coefficient for the compound channel and pi is the wetted perimeter of the i th part of the cross section which has a manning roughness coefficient of ni in addition p refers to the wetted perimeter of the entire section more details regarding horton s equation can be found in the literature jain 2001 table 3 shows the resulting roughness coefficients for the floodplains according to the table the range of manning s roughness coefficient varied nonlinearly from 0 013 to 0 022 since the flow in rashid and chaudhry s study was a subcritical flow rashid and chaudhry 1995 both the upstream and downstream boundary conditions were required the upstream boundary condition was the inflow depth hydrograph those researchers defined the relationship between the flow depth and discharge for the gate at the end of the channel as the downstream boundary condition by extracting their experimental data this relationship is expressed via eq 23 rashid and chaudhry 1995 23 q 9 35 h 1 14 here q is the discharge m3 s and h is the depth of flow behind the gate m the initial discharge in the experiment was 0 0385 m3 s and the initial flow conditions and inflow depth hydrograph are depicted in fig 23 in the study by rashid and chaudhry 1995 the depth hydrograph was recorded at 5 stations along the channel length as illustrated in fig 24 station 1 was the inflow boundary condition and data from the other stations were considered for the validation of the proposed method in this step it is necessary to apply a conveyance estimation method to calculate the amount of discharge for this purpose the area method which is a modified version of the divided channel method dcm was considered this was originally introduced by holden as described in stephenson and kolovopoulos 1990 by modifying the areas the discharge in each subsection was calculated and added together to obtain the total discharge to follow the steps mentioned in section 2 2 the parameters of the method were chosen as follows 1 in steps 1 and 2 for the main channel the n values were randomly sampled from the uniform distribution 0 0125 0 014 2 in steps 1 and 2 for the floodplain the n values were randomly sampled from the uniform distribution 0 013 0 023 3 using monte carlo simulation five hundred n values were generated for all runs 4 a termination condition of Œ¥ 0 155 m was determined to end the calculations in step 5 using the results of example 4 and the solution procedure discussed for the first and second examples eqs 24 and 25 were attained the difference between this example and the previous ones is that after the seven steps were complete the equations related to the roughness distribution functions were determined separately for the main channel section nc and for the floodplain nf 24 n 0 x 3 87 c 8 62 10 5 x 0 0148 n 3 87 x 11 6 c 3 15 10 5 x 3 7 87 10 4 x 2

the optimal values for the equivalent roughness in this example for the main channel and the floodplain were 0 0135 and 0 022 respectively fig 25 represents a comparison of the outflow hydrographs for the values shown in eqs 24 and 25 and the equivalent roughness values the results for this example indicate that the difference between the proposed method and the conventional methods in the calibration of n increases towards the downstream region table 4 presents a comparison of the sse results obtained by the use of the mrsoc method and the use of the constant roughness value the results in table 4 reveal the superiority of the proposed method compared to the conventional methods in calibration as well as efficiency in estimating changes in the n value especially as the channel length increases the significant rise in the percentage of sse decline is the evidence of this issue as we move towards station 5 it is noteworthy that in addition to the abovementioned examples the applicability of proposed mrsoc method was verified for a wide range of hydraulic problems such as a thin layer water flow the results of which were similar to the present examples with good accuracy it is expected that the method can be applied to similar problems when only one recorded inflow and corresponding outflow hydrographs are available hence the applicability of method which utilizes the pattern recognition framework accompanied with the optimization and calibration procedure was confirmed through the different case studies the results indicated that the proposed methodology is successful to precisely identify possible gradual and abrupt variations in the n values for the introduced problems even when no information regarding regions with distinct roughness is available also providing the distribution functions of n can reduce the amount of error caused by changes in this value along river reaches in flood routing this reduction is more obvious for the case of long river reaches compared to the conventional calibration methods considering a fixed n value presenting an acceptable performance in the calibration of n value for compound channels in which the roughness of main channel is distinct from that of floodplains is another benefit of this methodology obtaining such information with a minimum amount of data may also decrease the amount of fieldwork as well as the cost of river engineering projects however uncertainties regarding the effect of factors like vegetation cover river bed geomorphology and channel changes over time on the calibration of n value should be further investigated for hydraulic approaches 4 conclusions the flood phenomenon is one of the most complex and destructive natural events that threatens the lives and properties of many people every year flood routing has many applications in issues related to flood forecasting reservoir design river management calculating the height of flood dams and so on in order to achieve high precision answers in flood routing it is necessary to properly estimate the parameters of the model used among these model parameters estimating the n value has the highest level of complexity which can change along the natural river the more the n value changes in the river s longitudinal cross section the higher the errors caused by taking an average n value and thus the greater the error rate in flood routing in this paper a new method was introduced for the first time for identifying the distribution functions of the n value various case studies including two different synthetic data sets as well as experimental data for a compound channel and field data for the tiber river were investigated in order to show the capabilities of the introduced method to recognize all possible changes in the value of n some of the most important advantages of the method are summarized as follows in order to determine the roughness distribution functions only two hydrometric stations are needed recording only one inflow and outflow hydrographs are sufficient for the calibration of n different regions with distinct lengths and n values can be recognized this method is able to identify gradual or abrupt changes in the n value this method is also applicable to compound channels consisting of a main channel section and floodplains with different n values and thin layer water flows the results of this study also reveal that the use of the proposed mrsoc method can be very efficient particularly in long river reaches and when the roughness coefficient changes considerably along the longitudinal section compared to the conventional methods providing a mean n value for longitudinal river cross sections information regarding the distinct distribution functions of n can be achieved with the same amount of data such information not only enhances the prediction accuracy of flood routing models but can also provide more guidance for river engineering

4833,the analysis of unsteady flows in natural rivers is highly complicated one of the most important factors that causes errors in calculating the flow depth and discharge is the inability to accurately estimate the values of manning s roughness coefficient n for longitudinal river cross sections most conventional methods for calibrating n only provide a mean value for longitudinal river cross sections which can significantly increase errors in flood routing therefore a new method is presented herein for identifying the distribution functions of n along natural rivers based on modified random search optimization and clustering mrsoc in this method only the inflow and outflow hydrographs need be determined to obtain the minimum data required the proposed method was verified using synthetic field and experimental data the results indicate that using the proposed method all the gradual and abrupt changes of the n value at longitudinal cross sections of natural rivers can be estimated with sufficient accuracy and the equations for these changes can also be obtained this can eventually lead to a noticeable reduction in errors in flood routing keywords manning s roughness coefficient gradual and abrupt changes distribution functions flood routing unsteady flow hydrograph 1 introduction in hydraulics most problems related to flow analysis generally require an estimation of manning s roughness coefficient n and several studies have been performed to estimate and adjust n butler et al 2015 kamali et al 2018 li et al 2017 mohammadpour et al 2020 seyedzadeh et al 2019 one of the fields of hydraulic science in which a suitable estimation of n is of high importance is flood routing in natural rivers manning s equation as an empirical relationship is not applicable for unsteady flow conditions and compound channels with high accuracy and aspects like inertia diffusive waves and kinematic waves are neglected in this equation ardƒ±√ßlƒ±oƒülu and kuriqi 2019 chatila and townsend 1996 moreover other available empirical relationships which were reviewed by papaioannou et al 2017 can generally present only a uniform or constant n value for longitudinal river cross sections thus none of the currently available equations or tables can accurately estimate the value of this coefficient under all circumstances coon 1995 ardƒ±√ßlƒ±oƒülu and kuriqi 2019 in natural rivers the roughness coefficient may noticeably change along the longitudinal direction ramesh et al 2000 timbadiya et al 2011 and this change affects the precise determination of hydraulic parameters such as discharge and river stage due to the dependency of these parameters on the channel s roughness characteristics timbadiya et al 2011 for instance around a 40 percent discharge error was reported with a change of 50 percent in the manning s n for a palaeoflood in a bedrock river kidson et al 2006 knowing the water levels and peak discharge information for rivers and open channels is extremely vital at the time of flood events in order to appropriately design hydraulic structures employ protection measures and protect lives bao et al 2009 rashid and chaudhry 1995 accordingly the importance of accurate n value estimation must be highlighted in unsteady flow analysis for flood routing n carries the highest level of complexity among all the parameters involved johnson 1996 this parameter is dependent on many factors including channel irregularities and alignment vegetation surface roughness characteristics sediment grain diameter in the main channel and floodplains etc which causes numerous complexities regarding its proper estimation ramesh et al 2000 timbadiya et al 2011 with the consideration of the uncertainties involved in estimating n a calibration method which uses observed inflow and outflow hydrographs as available flow data is a common method in this method the estimation of n is adjusted by minimizing the difference between the observed outflow hydrograph and the one obtained by a flood routing model for the corresponding inflow hydrograph several studies have been carried out to calibrate the manning s n parameters and develop hydraulic models for different rivers ardƒ±√ßlƒ±oƒülu and kuriqi 2019 bao et al 2009 lal 1995 pappenberger et al 2005 patro et al 2009 timbadiya et al 2011 usul and turan 2006 vijay et al 2007 in the study by kidson et al 2006 the uncertainty of the roughness coefficient was investigated for a river located in northern thailand and the authors concluded that semi empirical equations may underestimate the n values in comparison with those obtained from the calibrated roughness coefficient in another study by song et al 2014 using the proper n value to decrease the estimation errors in hydraulic models was also emphasized boulomytis et al 2017 estimated and calibrated the manning s n values by using cowan s methodology and the hec ras model respectively for the juqueriquere river basin in northern sao paulo brazil although an acceptable agreement was generally obtained for both the estimation and calibration methods a discrepancy in the derived n values was also reported in some cross sections which requires further study despite extensive research that has focused on n value calibration the possibility of changes in this parameter has been disregarded along river reaches between two gauging stations variations in n along the length of a river can increase errors in the estimation of this parameter and the results of different studies on natural rivers have clearly shown that the use of a fixed value for n along a river may consequently lead to errors in its flood routing timbadiya et al 2011 this issue is important particularly in long river reaches where the number of hydrometric stations is restricted as it is not possible to identify the changes in n along natural rivers by using conventional methods the number of these stations should be increased to have a better evaluation of n variations ramesh et al 2000 given the importance of changes in n on flood routing attari and hosseini 2019 investigated the calibration of n in rivers by using the random search optimization and clustering rsoc approach their proposed method could identify and determine distinct regions with different n values and their lengths along a river reach despite the fact that this method was not able to adequately detect gradual changes in n the results showed that by identifying the distribution of n with greater accuracy flood routing errors were significantly decreased as well the inability to use this method for compound channels in which the n values of the main channel and the floodplains are different was raised as a limitation of this methodology in the present study as a novel approach the method proposed by attari and hosseini 2019 is improved to facilitate the determination of gradual and sudden changes in n parameter this is followed by applying the presented methodology to two different synthetic data sets as well as experimental data for a compound channel and field data for the tiber river also the capability of this approach known as modified random search optimization and clustering mrsoc is investigated in order to provide the distribution functions of all changes in n by using only observed input and output hydrographs enhancing the prediction accuracy of n variations along a river is expected as a main benefit of the mrsoc approach as compared to conventional methods 2 methodology in this section the framework of the proposed method is explained based on the flood routing model including governing equations and their numerical solutions along with the methodology for optimizing or calibrating n to identify the functions of all gradual and abrupt changes of the n value along a river or channel 2 1 flood routing model to analyze the gradually varied unsteady open channel flow and in the absence of lateral flow the saint venant equations can be considered as the governing equations eqs 1 and 2 these equations are derived by applying the continuity and momentum equations to a differential control volume of flow i e 1 a t q x 0 2 q t Œ≤ q 2 a x g a y x g a s 0 s f 0 in the above equations y is the flow depth Œ≤ is the momentum correction factor a is the flow area g is the gravitational acceleration q is the discharge s0 is the longitudinal channel slope sf is the friction slope t is the time and x is the displacement in the main flow direction the friction slope parameter in saint venant equations can be defined as follows jain 2001 3 s f œÑ 0 Œ≥ r where Œ≥ is the specific weight of the fluid r is the hydraulic radius and œÑ 0 is the average wall shear stress based on the current knowledge of hydraulics and from a practical point of view this parameter can be calculated as jain 2001 4 s f q 2 k 2 where k is the conveyance factor of the channel at normal depth and is defined for a single channel by eq 5 jain 2001 5 k a n r 2 3 where a is the cross sectional area of the channel and n is the manning s roughness coefficient the momentum correction factor is formulated as follows jain 2001 6 Œ≤ i 1 n k i 2 a i i 1 n k i 2 i 1 n a i where n represents the number of subsections and subscript i stands for the i th subsection except for idealized situations no analytical solution is available for these equations among the various numerical methods that can be used to solve the saint venant equations the preissman method was applied in this study this method is also known as the weighted four point implicit finite difference scheme fread 1993 it should be noted that based on fread s suggestion for flood waves the weighting factor was selected as 0 55 fread 1974 2 2 calibration of n this section aims to introduce a new method to identify regions with distinct n functions along a river or channel a set of inflow and outflow hydrographs supplies the minimum information required in this method according to fig 1 it is also assumed that the longitudinal section of the river is composed of n regions with varying roughness functions fig 2 a illustrates the distinct functions of n considered at the two gauging stations 1 and 2 in the first step of the proposed method the n value is estimated at designated points on a longitudinal cross section of the river in accordance with fig 2 b afterward using the clustering method each of these points is assigned to a cluster and the optimal number of clusters is determined finally according to fig 2 c the optimal curve is fitted using the points for each cluster and then the equation of the roughness distribution function of that cluster is specified this procedure can be described and followed through seven steps the first six steps of the proposed method illustrate the way to estimate the n values along the river reach as shown in fig 2 b and in the seventh step of the proposed method the method of identifying the optimal number of clusters and the distribution function of n is described as shown in fig 2 c it is worthwhile to note that in the proposed mrsoc method the monte carlo simulation is applied to perform the random search optimization procedure the monte carlo simulation is a numerical technique to generate random values of the desired variable according to a probabilistic distribution this method which was introduced by metropolis and ulam 1949 provides a robust statistical approach and various distribution types in our case based on engineering experience and or field surveys a broad interval should be considered for the n distribution such that the actual n value falls within the range of the produced data accordingly using the monte carlo simulation a series of randomized n values by assuming a uniform distribution is generated and assigned to each of the sub reaches for each monte carlo simulation run and the generated n values the saint venant equations are used to obtain and calibrate the outflow hydrographs based on the model output the best values of the generated random n values as well as their related statistical properties can be achieved the details of proposed mrsoc method are explained through the following seven steps step 1 the river is partitioned into two equivalent sub reaches and the best n for each sub reach is then specified initially the river is partitioned into two equivalent sub reaches each with a series of n data randomly produced using the monte carlo simulation while assuming a uniform distribution on the basis of the inflow hydrograph outflow hydrographs are developed for the entire range of n values by using the saint venant equations next the optimal n values for both sub reaches are determined such that the error between the calculated and observed outflow hydrographs is minimized as shown in eq 7 7 sse i 1 w h oi h ci 2 where sse is the sum of the square of the errors w is the overall number of data points and hci and hoi are the ordinates of the calculated and observed depth or discharge outflow hydrographs respectively step 2 the river is partitioned into three equivalent sub reaches and the best n for each sub reach is then specified step 2 follows the process detailed in step 1 except that three sub reaches are involved step 3 the river is partitioned into four sub reaches and the initial approximation of the n value for each sub reach is obtained according to the findings of steps 1 and 2 optimization is carried out subsequently in step 3 as the main step the river is partitioned into four sub reaches and the mean n value of each sub reach is then computed by eqs 8 11 the n value of each sub reach in the following equations is approximated by using the n values estimated for the two prior runs for instance eq 9 is utilized to estimate the weighted mean n value of sub reach number 2 for the third run n 2 3 according to eq 9 the weighting parameter is dependent on the length and sse values of the two prior runs as related to n 2 3 and l 3 fig 3 shows the partitioning of the river for different runs 8 n 1 3 n 1 1 l 3 1 s s e 1 n 1 2 l 3 1 s s e 2 l 3 1 s s e 1 l 3 1 s s e 2 n 1 1 1 s s e 1 n 1 2 1

refers to the n of sub reach i for run 3 and ss e 1 and ss e 2 represent the least summation of the squared errors for runs 1 and 2 respectively the lengths x 1 and x 2 with dissimilar n values also have an impact on n 2 3 and n 3 3 as presented in fig 3 following the initial approximation of the n value for all sub reaches the range of possible n for the third step is produced using the monte carlo simulation while assuming a uniform distribution as shown in eq 12 12 1 Œ± i 3 n i 3 n 1 Œ± i 3 n i 3 where Œ± i 3 indicates the interval definition parameter Œ± of sub reach i for run 3 it is necessary to choose a greater Œ± i 3 for the sub reaches affected by more dissimilar n values including sub reaches 2 and 3 fig 3 the Œ± i 3 value is obtained by using eq 13 on the basis of the uppermost and lowermost values of n that control n i 3 13 Œ± i 3 max n 1 n 2 min n 1 n 2 2 n i 3 where n1 and n2 represent the n values for runs 1 and 2 respectively considering eqs 8 11 these values affect the estimation of n i 3 in the primary runs inaccurate identification of n may occur in some sub reaches due to the value of Œ± i k for these sub reaches approaching zero considering a minimal value of Œ± i k for every sub reach may improve the accurate estimation of n in fact this minimal value which must theoretically decline with an increasing number of sub reaches allows more degrees of freedom for approaching the actual n value for every sub reach various case studies were tested to propose eq 14 14 Œ± i min k 0 25 c 0 25 k 1 where k denotes the run number and c refers to the number of sub reaches it should be mentioned that according to the presented definitions c is equal to k 1 as a result of this step by using the monte carlo simulation a series of n values is produced randomly for all the sub reaches and based on the saint venant equations and given that the input hydrograph is specified the output hydrographs for flow depth and or discharge can be computed then by comparing the observational and computational hydrographs using eq 7 the initial n values of all the sub reaches can be calibrated to arrive at the optimal n values step 4 the number of sub reaches is increased by repeating the procedure described in step 3 following the algorithm detailed in step 3 the number of sub reaches is increased through each run the initial n values are calculated for all the sub reaches and the intervals are obtained based on the investigations of the two prior runs for each sub reach by eqs 15 16 and 14 a series of randomized data is then produced and assigned to each of the sub reaches by using the monte carlo simulation ultimately the initial n values are calibrated by applying the saint venant equations to the produced data and the optimal n values for all sub reaches are obtained with the consideration of eq 7 15 1 Œ± i k n i k n 1 Œ± i k n i k 16 Œ± i k max n k 2 n k 1 min n k 2 n k 1 2 n i k step 5 a satisfactory condition is examined to end the calculations the calculation completion condition is described based on eq 17 17 l k l k 1 Œ¥ in which Œ¥ refers to the length difference between two sub reaches in runs k and k 1 a Œ¥ value of lower than 1 of the length of the river reach is recommended in order for pattern identification step 6 the best run needs to be specified it can be assumed that every sub reach in run k is partitioned into two sub reaches with an equivalent length in run 2 k 1 identification of n will be acceptable if the n values for all sub reaches at run 2 k 1 have no significant difference with the equivalent n values for run k additionally another parameter that contributes to choosing the best run is the sse between the observed and calculated outflow hydrographs eq 18 comprises the combinatory impacts of the similarity between the n values and sse as 18 e i 1 c n 2 i 2 k 1 n i k i 1 c n 2 i 1 2 k 1 n i k l 2 k 1 ss e k s s e 2 k 1 in which c is the number of river sub reaches at run k the e value should be considered for all the conjugate runs k and 2 k 1 beginning from k 1 the best of the conjugate runs are considered to be those with a minimal e value as the final answer the one with a relatively lower sse would be introduced among the two best conjugate runs k and 2 k 1 based on the procedures explained in these six steps the points shown in fig 2 b can be determined the position of these points is actually the center of each of the sub reaches except for the first sub reach at x 0 and the last sub reach at x l and the manning s roughness coefficient corresponding to these points is the average roughness coefficient for each sub reach step 7 determining the optimal number of clusters and deriving the manning s roughness distribution function for each cluster to obtain the final answer if the river is divided into a large number of sub reaches it is possible to consider the sub reaches with values of manning s roughness coefficient that are close to each other as one region by using a clustering method in this approach the k means method is employed for clustering hartigan and wong 1979 after calculation a number of points are selected as the seeds each seed contains the distance information from the beginning of the river x and the manning s roughness coefficient next each sub reach is assigned to the nearest cluster and the new center of each cluster is determined these centers play the role of seeds for the next iteration of the algorithm in the next step each sub reach is reassigned to the nearest cluster and a new center is assigned to each cluster these stages are repeated until the center of each cluster remains constant and once completed the manning s roughness distribution function can be determined for each cluster it is important to note that to perform the clustering the normalized n and logarithm x values are used to carry out n normalization the value of n in each sub reach is divided by the greatest amount of n obtained along the river also to normalize the x parameter the central distance of each sub reach from the beginning of the river is divided by the total length of the study area the optimal number of seeds is chosen through the following algorithm 1 initially the number of seeds is assumed as one thus the optimal roughness distribution function is determined for all the points obtained in step 6 and shown in fig 2 b 2 after determining the roughness distribution function the corresponding output hydrograph is calculated then by comparing the computed and observed hydrographs the sse is calculated 3 next one seed is added and a roughness function is re obtained for each cluster the output hydrograph is then calculated based on the manning s roughness coefficient functions and the sse is determined 4 the number of seeds continues to increase until a maximum of two points is situated in each cluster in this case there is no need to increase the number of seeds any further finally the answer that results in the least sse is selected as the best answer 3 results and discussion applicability of the proposed method different examples including synthetic real world and experimental data are investigated in this section in order to show the capabilities of the proposed method for identifying all the possible changes in the value of n 3 1 example 1 synthetic data the main aim of this example is to recognize the pattern of distribution of n through an inverse problem by using the steps presented in section 2 2 while applying the inflow and outflow hydrographs as data sources this hypothetical rectangular river is assumed to have a 3000 m length 10 m width and a bed slope of 0 0001 in this example the river includes three distinct regions with various n values the first and last regions have 500 m lengths with n values of 0 02 and 0 03 respectively the middle part is 2 km in length and the corresponding n rises linearly from 0 02 to 0 03 the initial and boundary conditions are as follows the initial condition is a subcritical flow with a constant discharge of 1 69 m3 s and a stage discharge relationship controlling the flow downstream s 0 s f 0 is considered as a boundary condition the flow initial depth was calculated through the use of the conventional standard step method fig 4 a the depth hydrographs for inflow and corresponding outflow are also demonstrated in fig 4 b using the preissman scheme introduced in section 2 1 the outflow hydrograph was computed assuming the mentioned downstream boundary condition a uniformly distributed random error with an interval of 1 1 cm was also added to the ordinates of the outflow hydrograph in accordance with the steps given in section 2 2 assigning the values of some parameters is needed as follows from the uniform distribution 0 015 0 04 the n values were sampled in steps 1 and 2 and using monte carlo simulation a series of random n values were produced for all runs a termination condition Œ¥ 25 m was determined to end the calculations in step 5 fig 5 illustrates the schematic view of manning s roughness distribution obtained for different runs using the presented methodology moreover fig 6 demonstrates the sse for all the 11 runs conducted in this example fig 7 demonstrates the e values calculated by eq 18 in step 6 in order to choose the best pattern the lowest e values and sse between the ordinates of the outflow hydrographs should be considered the results for the e values showed that for the 6 and 12 sub reaches the lowest value of this parameter was obtained subsequently the results for the run 11 corresponding to the 12 sub reaches had the best answer this can be confirmed by the lowest sse results for the run 11 in fig 6 after determining the optimal answer the points shown in fig 2 b can be determined as mentioned in section 2 2 the arrangement of these points is shown in fig 8 then the optimum number of clusters should be specified according to the statements in section 2 2 and in the seventh step the relationship between the number of clusters and the sse should be examined as shown in fig 9 the minimum value of the sse occurs when the number of clusters is equal to one while the manning s roughness coefficient distribution function is in accordance with eq 19 19 n 1 86 10 16 x 4 2 21 10 12 x 3 6 79 10 9 x 2 2 07 10 6 x 0 0197 a comparison between the results obtained from the rsoc method attari and hosseini 2019 and those from eq 19 based on the mrsoc method is presented in fig 10 as seen in fig 10 the sse decreased from 0 0452 m2 in the rsoc method to 0 000574 m2 in the mrsoc method this confirms the capability of the proposed methodology to accurately recognize possible changes in the n values 3 2 example 2 synthetic data similar to example 1 the aim of this example is to evaluate the applicability of the methodology through an inverse problem with different conditions a hypothetical rectangular river with a 10 m width 3000 m length and bed slope of 0 0001 is assumed as a second case study in this example the river has two distinct regions with different n values the n value in the first region which is 1500 m long rises linearly from 0 02 to 0 03 the second part is 1500 m in length with an n value of 0 02 the initial condition is a subcritical flow with a constant discharge of 4 126 m3 s this is the condition before the arrival of the flood wave in addition the boundary conditions are the same as those considered in example 1 the initial flow depth was obtained through the use of the conventional standard step method fig 11 a the depth hydrographs for the inflow and corresponding outflow are depicted in fig 11 b the outflow hydrograph was computed by applying the downstream boundary condition and the preissman scheme as the numerical approach a uniformly distributed random error with an interval of 1 1 cm was also added to the ordinates of the outflow hydrograph the parameters of the method were considered to be as follows regarding the steps given in section 2 2 1 from the uniform distribution 0 015 0 04 the n values were sampled in steps 1 and 2 2 using a monte carlo simulation one thousand random values of n were produced for all runs 3 a termination condition of Œ¥ 25 m was determined to end the calculations in step 5 the schematic view of manning s roughness distribution and the sse for the conducted runs using the presented methodology are demonstrated in figs 12 and 13 respectively fig 14 shows the values for e determined by eq 18 in this example the lowest values for e and sse were found for runs 5 and 11 when the river reach was divided into 6 and 12 sub reaches among them the results for the 12 sub reaches were more acceptable due to the lowest obtained values for sse the arrangement of points related to the distribution of the roughness coefficient is shown in fig 15 this verifies the accurate recognition of the two distinct regions now optimal clustering must be performed and then the function of n in each cluster must be estimated the relationship between the number of clusters and the sse values showed that if the number of clusters was greater than or equal to two significant changes might not occur in the sse fig 16 consequently the minimum value of the sse could be obtained when the number of clusters is equal to two while the distribution functions of the roughness coefficient are in accordance with eq 20 20 n 0 x 1500 1 6 10 9 x 2 9 10 6 x 0 0199 n 1500 x 3000 0 97 10 9 x 2 4 2 10 6 x 0 016 the values of the roughness coefficient calculated based on eq 20 and its actual values for the second example are shown in fig 17 the results show that the mrsoc method is able to identify gradual and sudden changes in manning s roughness coefficient in the channel s longitudinal section it is also important to note that if the mean value of n for this example is calculated according to conventional methods the value will be 0 0205 and the corresponding value of the sse will be 3 3 m2 in the first two examples which were based on the synthetic data the effectiveness of the proposed method was examined to determine the roughness distribution function if the longitudinal section of the river includes significant variations in the roughness coefficient using the manning s roughness coefficient distribution function instead of assuming a fixed value for the parameter n can lead to more accurate flood routing this issue is also investigated in the following examples through the use of field and laboratory data 3 3 example 3 tiber river data the objective of this example is to identify the pattern of the roughness distribution for the tiber river located in central italy as a real world problem by applying the presented methodology a length of 15 km with a bed slope of 0 0016 between the gauged stations upstream at pierantonio and downstream at ponte felcino in the river reach was considered as the case study it should be noted that perumal et al 2007 reported a uniform value of n 0 049 for this river reach fig 18 shows the tiber river s cross sections at the mentioned stations one dataset for the flood in december 1996 was used to identify the possible distribution of n in the river reach and then the november 1997 flood s dataset was employed for the validation of the results their relevant depth hydrographs of the observed inflow and outflow are illustrated in fig 19 the stage discharge relationship q y was also considered as a downstream boundary condition fig 20 perumal et al 2007 the parameters were considered to be as follows referring to the steps given in section 2 2 1 from the uniform distribution 0 04 0 06 the n values were randomly sampled in steps 1 and 2 2 using monte carlo simulation two hundred random values of n were produced for all runs 3 a termination condition of Œ¥ 125 m was determined to end the calculations in step 5 finally the results from this example show that the roughness distribution function for the tiber river can be expressed according to eq 21 21 n 0 x 15000 1 99 10 11 x 2 6 4 10 7 x 0 0483 eq 21 indicates there is a small change in the roughness coefficient in the river reach and that the minimum and maximum values of n over the reach are 0 0483 and 0 0534 respectively additionally the results show that higher values of n are obtained downstream in comparison with the upstream region fig 21 represents the comparison between the observed outflow depth y and discharge q hydrographs and the calculated ones obtained from the mrsoc method and the uniform roughness coefficient proposed by perumal et al 2007 as a result the presented methodology provides a reliable outcome in both the calibration and validation phases for a real world problem to show the precision of the results the normalized root mean square error nrmse the absolute value of relative error in peak depth or discharge arepd and absolute value of relative error in peak depth or discharge time arepdt are presented in table 1 the results suggest that applying the proposed method can decrease the error rates for depth and discharge flow estimation however this reduction was not noticeable for the tiber river due to the lack of significant changes in the manning s roughness coefficient over a time scale of about one year it is worthwhile to mention that although changes in the n value were not considerable with time for the tiber river this may not happen with other natural river systems therefore the possibility of variations in n during different seasons and with channel changes over time due to the dependency of the n value on factors like vegetation cover riverbed geomorphology local conditions and so on should not be ignored hence this issue should be studied further by obtaining more field data 3 4 example 4 experimental data in this example the experimental data reported by rashid and chaudhry 1995 are applied in order to examine the applicability of the mrsoc method for a compound channel consisting of a main channel section and floodplains on either side the length of the working section of the flume was 18 6 m and the cross section of the flume is illustrated in fig 22 table 2 presents the variations of the equivalent n with the flow depth it is necessary to separately generate the roughness coefficient data for the main channel and the floodplain for our study thus based on the data presented in table 2 and horton s equation which is expressed via eq 22 jain 2001 the range of the roughness coefficient for the floodplain can be obtained 22 n e i 1 n p i n i 1 5 2 3 p 2 3 in which ne represents the equivalent roughness coefficient for the compound channel and pi is the wetted perimeter of the i th part of the cross section which has a manning roughness coefficient of ni in addition p refers to the wetted perimeter of the entire section more details regarding horton s equation can be found in the literature jain 2001 table 3 shows the resulting roughness coefficients for the floodplains according to the table the range of manning s roughness coefficient varied nonlinearly from 0 013 to 0 022 since the flow in rashid and chaudhry s study was a subcritical flow rashid and chaudhry 1995 both the upstream and downstream boundary conditions were required the upstream boundary condition was the inflow depth hydrograph those researchers defined the relationship between the flow depth and discharge for the gate at the end of the channel as the downstream boundary condition by extracting their experimental data this relationship is expressed via eq 23 rashid and chaudhry 1995 23 q 9 35 h 1 14 here q is the discharge m3 s and h is the depth of flow behind the gate m the initial discharge in the experiment was 0 0385 m3 s and the initial flow conditions and inflow depth hydrograph are depicted in fig 23 in the study by rashid and chaudhry 1995 the depth hydrograph was recorded at 5 stations along the channel length as illustrated in fig 24 station 1 was the inflow boundary condition and data from the other stations were considered for the validation of the proposed method in this step it is necessary to apply a conveyance estimation method to calculate the amount of discharge for this purpose the area method which is a modified version of the divided channel method dcm was considered this was originally introduced by holden as described in stephenson and kolovopoulos 1990 by modifying the areas the discharge in each subsection was calculated and added together to obtain the total discharge to follow the steps mentioned in section 2 2 the parameters of the method were chosen as follows 1 in steps 1 and 2 for the main channel the n values were randomly sampled from the uniform distribution 0 0125 0 014 2 in steps 1 and 2 for the floodplain the n values were randomly sampled from the uniform distribution 0 013 0 023 3 using monte carlo simulation five hundred n values were generated for all runs 4 a termination condition of Œ¥ 0 155 m was determined to end the calculations in step 5 using the results of example 4 and the solution procedure discussed for the first and second examples eqs 24 and 25 were attained the difference between this example and the previous ones is that after the seven steps were complete the equations related to the roughness distribution functions were determined separately for the main channel section nc and for the floodplain nf 24 n 0 x 3 87 c 8 62 10 5 x 0 0148 n 3 87 x 11 6 c 3 15 10 5 x 3 7 87 10 4 x 2 0 00586 x 0 00096 n 11 6 x 18 57 c 1 8 10 5 x 2 0 00045 x 0 0153 25 n 0 x 3 87 f 0 0001 x 2 0 0007 x 0 0217 n 3 87 x 10 05 f 8 56 10 4 x 2 0 0115 x 0 0149 n 10 05 x 18 57 f 10 5 x 2 0 0004 x 0 0174 the optimal values for the equivalent roughness in this example for the main channel and the floodplain were 0 0135 and 0 022 respectively fig 25 represents a comparison of the outflow hydrographs for the values shown in eqs 24 and 25 and the equivalent roughness values the results for this example indicate that the difference between the proposed method and the conventional methods in the calibration of n increases towards the downstream region table 4 presents a comparison of the sse results obtained by the use of the mrsoc method and the use of the constant roughness value the results in table 4 reveal the superiority of the proposed method compared to the conventional methods in calibration as well as efficiency in estimating changes in the n value especially as the channel length increases the significant rise in the percentage of sse decline is the evidence of this issue as we move towards station 5 it is noteworthy that in addition to the abovementioned examples the applicability of proposed mrsoc method was verified for a wide range of hydraulic problems such as a thin layer water flow the results of which were similar to the present examples with good accuracy it is expected that the method can be applied to similar problems when only one recorded inflow and corresponding outflow hydrographs are available hence the applicability of method which utilizes the pattern recognition framework accompanied with the optimization and calibration procedure was confirmed through the different case studies the results indicated that the proposed methodology is successful to precisely identify possible gradual and abrupt variations in the n values for the introduced problems even when no information regarding regions with distinct roughness is available also providing the distribution functions of n can reduce the amount of error caused by changes in this value along river reaches in flood routing this reduction is more obvious for the case of long river reaches compared to the conventional calibration methods considering a fixed n value presenting an acceptable performance in the calibration of n value for compound channels in which the roughness of main channel is distinct from that of floodplains is another benefit of this methodology obtaining such information with a minimum amount of data may also decrease the amount of fieldwork as well as the cost of river engineering projects however uncertainties regarding the effect of factors like vegetation cover river bed geomorphology and channel changes over time on the calibration of n value should be further investigated for hydraulic approaches 4 conclusions the flood phenomenon is one of the most complex and destructive natural events that threatens the lives and properties of many people every year flood routing has many applications in issues related to flood forecasting reservoir design river management calculating the height of flood dams and so on in order to achieve high precision answers in flood routing it is necessary to properly estimate the parameters of the model used among these model parameters estimating the n value has the highest level of complexity which can change along the natural river the more the n value changes in the river s longitudinal cross section the higher the errors caused by taking an average n value and thus the greater the error rate in flood routing in this paper a new method was introduced for the first time for identifying the distribution functions of the n value various case studies including two different synthetic data sets as well as experimental data for a compound channel and field data for the tiber river were investigated in order to show the capabilities of the introduced method to recognize all possible changes in the value of n some of the most important advantages of the method are summarized as follows in order to determine the roughness distribution functions only two hydrometric stations are needed recording only one inflow and outflow hydrographs are sufficient for the calibration of n different regions with distinct lengths and n values can be recognized this method is able to identify gradual or abrupt changes in the n value this method is also applicable to compound channels consisting of a main channel section and floodplains with different n values and thin layer water flows the results of this study also reveal that the use of the proposed mrsoc method can be very efficient particularly in long river reaches and when the roughness coefficient changes considerably along the longitudinal section compared to the conventional methods providing a mean n value for longitudinal river cross sections information regarding the distinct distribution functions of n can be achieved with the same amount of data such information not only enhances the prediction accuracy of flood routing models but can also provide more guidance for river engineering

4834,excess nitrate no3 discharge into fresh water resources poses detrimental effects on ecosystems and human health yet the understanding of its potential sources is lacking in many parts of sub

nyando river basin of lake victoria kenya river water was monitored spatially in the basin for hydro chemical and isotopic parameters from july 2016 to may 2018 the data shows that no3 concentrations in the basin are governed by the predominant land use mixed agriculture ma land use recorded significantly higher no3 concentrations 8 8 10 6 mg l 1 compared to other land use zones residential industrial ri 3 4 2 2 mg l 1 sugarcane s 3 2 1 5 mg l 1 and tea forest areas tf 3 0 1 1 mg l 1 stable isotope data and hydrochemistry complemented each other in identifying the potential no3 sources and their spatial temporal variation in the basin boron isotope Œ¥11b data was categorically helpful in overcoming the limitations of Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 to discriminate between manure and sewage sources Œ¥11b specifically identified manure as the dominant source of river no3 input in the ma ri and s land use zones and also indicated soil n as the main river no3 source in the tf land use these findings were substantiated via nitrate source apportionment using a bayesian isotopic mixing model which showed manure and or sewage were the leading sources of river no3 input in the basin

contributing 1 across the basin in order to control excess no3 discharge in the basin better guidelines for animal manure use land conservation measures and improvement of sanitation systems should be prioritized keywords nitrate apportionment nyando river basin stable isotopes mixsiar 1 introduction tropical catchments are being subjected to increasing population growth urbanization and increasing intensification of agricultural practices it raises concern on nitrate no3 pollution in river systems the negative impacts associated with excess no3 discharges in water bodies include eutrophication proliferation of aquatic weeds and algal blooms and consequently it causes the decline of local fish population and general disruption of aquatic ecosystems additionally high no3 levels in drinking water pose high risks to human health in form of both methemoglobinemia in infants blue baby syndrome and cancer kendall et al 2007 schullehner et al 2018 as such the world health organization who has defined 50 mg l 1 no3 in potable water as the maximum concentration threshold an increasing demand for feeding a growing population has led to a sharp rise in agricultural production and also the use of nitrogen n based compounds inorganic organic fertilizers to boost agricultural production galloway et al 2008 therefore the distribution and adoption of n based inorganic fertilizers are becoming more common in the sub saharan african ssa region where traditionally animal manure was the main agricultural input for soil fertility improvement the increase in n production and distribution if not controlled results in detrimental impacts on the receiving ecosystems the situation in the ssa region is exemplified in the lake victoria basin where insufficient sewage treatment systems and human encroachment of forests and wetlands result in elevated discharges of no3 into surface water resources raburu et al 2012 wang et al 2012 this has led to clear impacts of eutrophication being witnessed in the lake which includes occurrence of dense algal blooms water hyacinth invasion of the lake fish population decrease and a general decline of portable water quality lung ayia et al 2001 nyilitya et al 2020b the lake victoria is africa s largest fresh water lake with a surface area of around 68 000 km2 which is shared by three east african countries kenya tanzania and uganda the lake basin provides immense socio economic and ecological services to its riparian population estimated to be currently above 45 million people worldbank 2018 these includes basic needs services food water and transport commercial fishery hydroelectric power trade industry wildlife tourism and is the sources of the white nile nyilitya 2020 the nyando river is one of the major rivers draining into lake victoria from the kenyan side of the basin river nyando is subjected to a variety of human related pressures it drains a diverse land use pattern including forests pristine and planted agricultural areas commercial mixed farming of crops and livestock residential areas urban and industrial centers and a wetland its headwater catchments are located in the mau forest complex a major water tower of the lake victoria basin which experiences severe deforestation and human encroachment for instance it has been reported that about 7084 ha of mau forest land was cleared between the years 2000 and 2003 lvbc 2007 this triggers accelerated run off in the upstream steep gradient areas during rain events resulting in severe soil erosion and sediment deposition into lake victoria icraf 2003 olang and f√ºrst 2011 additionally commercial tea farming dominates the upstream tinderet while the midstream and the low lands of the kano plains are under commercial sugarcane and rice farming where inorganic fertilizers are commonly applied maghanga et al 2013 twesigye 2011 mixed farming of food crops sugarcane and free range livestock keeping is highly practiced in the river basin concurrently the basin has a high population density fast growing urban centers londiani muhoroni awasi ahero and industries including sugar agrochemical rice lime and cement production factories most of these urban centers lack conventional sewage treatment infrastructure while the industrial waste treatment facilities operate below capacity and often discharge untreated effluents into the nyando river juma et al 2014 lvemp 2005 on the other hand the nyando wetland at the river mouth which acts as a natural nutrient pollution buffer zone to the lake has been extensively reclaimed and converted into farmland and livestock feeding area raburu et al 2012 overall the basin is a complex matrix of human land use systems which all potentially impact the river chemistry and no3 loads in their own way however no3 data from the river basin is highly limited with an available study by triest et al 2012 reporting data only at a sub basin scale the lake victoria basin commission lvbc through its lake victoria environmental management project lvemp used to run a basin wide water quality monitoring program in the period between 2000 and 2005 and generated a comprehensive nutrient dataset in terms of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp lvemp 2005 however since that period there has been an information gap in terms of n data from the lvemp and its activities are currently focused on intervention strategies to control pollution but still the lack of recent n data and especially information on the key sources of riverine no3 pollution is a major impediment for the development of effective no3 pollution control measures indeed for a basin with a diverse land use and anthropogenic interferences like the nyando conventional hydrochemistry is insufficient neither for identifying the potential sources of river no3 contamination nor for estimating the source contributions consequently this hinders proper knowledge based management guidelines to be introduced therefore an effective apportionment of no3 pollution of the nyando basin requires a land use based understanding of the dominating no3 sources and their associated contributions to the catchment level no3 loads many studies have demonstrated the applicability of the dual isotopes of no3 Œ¥15n Œ¥18o and boron b Œ¥11b to identify and apportion no3 sources in water e g widory et al 2013 xue et al 2009 different no3 sources i e atmospheric n soil n mineral fertilizers manure and sewage have a wide range of n Œ¥15n and oxygen Œ¥18o isotope signatures however n transformation processes nitrification denitrification and mixing of several no3 sources alter this signature of isotopes in no3 consequently complicating apportionment of no3 sources however b is ubiquitous in nature and its isotope composition Œ¥11b is largely not affected by no3 transformation processes except perhaps during adsorption desorption interactions with clay minerals iron and aluminum oxide surfaces bassett et al 1995 vengosh et al 1994 in addition Œ¥11b discriminates between manure and sewage sources and therefore can be used to improve source identification where mixing and transformation processes are involved widory et al 2004 consequently the value of integrating Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 and Œ¥11b data in determining no3 sources and associated transformation processes has been recently demonstrated nyilitya et al 2020a widory et al 2013 xue et al 2013 in addition researchers have developed and applied an isotopic mixing model mixsiar which uses a bayesian framework to quantify proportional source contributions and determines the probability distribution for the proportional contribution of each source to the mixture matiatos 2016 parnell et al 2010 xue et al 2012 a few studies which applies isotopic techniques for nitrate source apportionment have been conducted in tropical river basins among them is work by minh et al 2020 which applied dual no3 isotopes Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 to study sources and conversion of no3 in the day river basin of vietnam work by anornu et al 2017 integrated hydro chemical and the dual no3 isotopes to trace sources of groundwater and surface contamination in the white volta river basin in ghana however this study integrates a multi isotope Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥11b hydro chemical and mixsiar approach to identify and apportion potential sources of no3 input into the river nyando the state of the art approach is the first of its kind in the region for a river basin and should significantly contribute to the development of effective no3 pollution control measures in the basin 2 material and methods 1 1 study area the nyando river basin lies between longitudes 34 47 e and 35 44 e and latitudes 0 07 n and 0 20 s fig 1 b it is 153 km long originates from the mau and the nandi escarpments and drains an area of about 3600 km2 before its discharge into the winam gulf of lake victoria the altitude in the basin varies from 1134 m a s l at the lake victoria to about 3000 m a s l in the mau and nandi escarpments the escarpment areas have a steep sloping topography with a slope ranging between 19 and 43 while the lowlands in the kano plains have a subdued topography and a slope of 0 4 the kano plain is a gently undulating alluvial plain ranging 1135 1170 m a s l at the base of the escarpments and occupies two thirds of the lower half of the nyando river basin raburu et al 2012 the nyando wetland is situated at the river mouth and along the shores of lake victoria covering an area of about 14 4 km2 raburu et al 2012 the basin has a tropical moist climate ranging from humid in the highlands to sub humid in the low lying kano plains near the lake it experiences a bi modal rainfall pattern with a long rain season occurring between march july while a short rain season occurs between september november the mean annual rainfall ranges from 1100 to 1600 mm with the upper reaches of the basin receiving higher amounts as compared to the middle and lower reaches mean annual minimum and maximum temperature are 16 and 29 c respectively the spatial variation in climate is attributed to altitude proximity to the highlands and nearness to the lakeshore soils in the highland areas consist of high silt and clay containing soils ferrasols nitisols cambisols while the lowlands have mainly alluvial soils which are highly vulnerable to soil erosion during the wet seasons olang and f√ºrst 2011 the river consists of two main tributaries the ainapngetuny which originates from the nandi hills and the kipchorian which originates from the mau forests upstream of londiani fig 1b the long term annual average discharge of the nyando river based on river discharge data from the year 1950 to 2000 has been reported to be 18 m3 s 1 with peak discharges normally witnessed in april or early may cowi 2002 the basin has a diverse land use ranging from pristine and planted forests commercial tea and sugarcane mixed agriculture food crops cash crops free range animal keeping human settlements industries and urban centers 2 1 sampling and analysis for an effective basin wide study in the nyando river spatially distributed sampling stations were identified along the main river and its tributaries and covering the key land use zones of the basin in consultation with the kisumu based water resources authority wra a total of 23 sampling stations were set up covering pristine kipkoil forest commercial tea and sugarcane estates horticulture mixed agricultural areas crops and livestock keeping industrial and urban centres wetland and river mouth fig 1b to study seasonal variability in isotopic and hydro chemical parameters sampling was conducted during four main seasons per hydrological year 1 the transition period between dry and

season d in december as described in nyilitya et al 2020b field sampling was conducted for nine seasons consisting of 2 sw 3 pw 2 ew and 2 d seasons from july 2016 to may 2018 the sampling stations could be grouped into four clusters corresponding to the main land use classes in the basin therefore the sample point labelling fig 1b is based on the four land use classes which are 1 mixed agriculture ma consisting of five stations ma1 ma5 in the upper reaches of the kipchorian tributary 2 residential industrial ri consisting of seven stations ri1 ri7 located in the midstream kipchorian tributary and the downstream reaches of the main nyando river 3 sugarcane s including eight stations s1 s8 seven of them located in the sugarcane belt in the mid downstream reaches of the ainapngetuny tributary and one in the koru tributary and 4 tea and forests tf consisting of three stations tf1 tf3 located in the kipkoil forest and tinderet commercial tea estates the clustering was performed by analyzing water physico chemical data from these stations using hierarchical cluster analysis hca as described in earlier work by nyilitya et al 2020b in the field water was taken as a grab sample in

sugarcane factories muhoroni chemelil and from agrochemical and lime factories manure was sampled for cow goat and sheep collected from animal droppings in the basin inorganic fertilizer samples of the commonly used types can dap npk urea were purchased from farmers and suppliers in the basin precipitation samples were collected from rainfall stations in ahero kakamega and kericho towns while soil n samples were collected by filtering suspended soil sediments in river water using 11 ¬µm filters whatmann ge healthcare life sciences chicago il usa in the laboratory all samples for Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o no3 analysis were filtered again through 0 45 ¬µm membrane filters and stored frozen 17 c awaiting analysis laboratory determination of na k ca2 mg2 no3 no2 cl and so4 2 concentrations was carried out using an ion chromatograph 930 compact ic flex metrohm switzerland it should be noted that nitrate concentrations in this study were analyzed and expressed as no3 the Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o no3

conversion of no3 by denitrifying bacteria which naturally lack n2o reductase activity the Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o analyses of the produced n2o were carried out using a trace gas preparation unit anca tgii

concentrations ranged from 0 1 mg l 1 recorded in ri4 during the dry season of 2016 to 56 3 mg l 1 obtained in ma3 during the start of the wet season in 2018 the highest concentrations in the basin were obtained for ma land use in all seasons with 90 of all ma samples recording no3 concentration above 4 0 mg l 1 the mean no3 concentrations in ma samples were significantly higher than the concentrations in the other land uses ri p 0 001 s p 0 001 and tf p 0 004 in particular the ma3 samples recorded peak values ranging between 23 and 56 3 mg l 1 in the different sampling seasons fig 2 the ma3 station is located in a stream which drains a commercial horticultural flower farm finlay lemotit fig 1b under irrigated greenhouse farming conditions where no3 and nh4 based fertilizers can dap are perennially applied nyilitya et al 2020b however no seasonal differences in mean no3 concentrations were observed in the ma land use most likely due to the perennial anthropogenic activities in the area the ma land use is mainly situated in the upstream part of the kipchorian tributary fig 1b at an altitude ranging between 1900 and 2300 m a s l it is a highly populated zone and most residents practice mixed farming of food crops maize beans and potatoes and livestock in small holder farms 5 ha where the use of both animal manure and inorganic fertilizers to maximize yields is common in addition sanitation is a major challenge in the area since residences and urban centers in the vicinity e g londiani kipkelion fig 1b lack a formal sanitary system nyilitya et al 2020b for ri land use no3 ranged from a minimum of 0 1 mg l 1 to a maximum value of 7 5 mg l 1 here significantly lower no3 concentrations were obtained during the dry season recording an average value of 1 4 mg l 1 compared to 4 0 3 9 and 4 3 for the sw pw and ew respectively fig 2 located in the downstream part of the nyando basin which is characterised by residential industrial and urban areas the no3 concentration in ri was expected to be high during the study period however the dry season no3 values were even lower than the background values for instance the average no3 concentration in ri in the december 2016 dry season was 0 4 mg l 1 which was lower than the natural forest sample tf1 value of 1 9 mg l 1 in the same season see supplementary table 1 this may suggest no3 removal to be taking place for the s land use no3 ranged from 0 4 to 7 4 mg l 1 similar to the ri significantly lower no3 concentrations in the s land use were recorded during the dry season compared to the other seasons no3 in the tf land use ranged from 1 5 to 5 2 mg l 1 there were no seasonal differences in no3 concentrations observed in the tf land use a trend which can be attributed to the relatively low human activities implying fewer sources of no3 contamination generally the three land uses ri s and tf had similar no3 concentrations although not significantly different rather higher no3 concentrations were recorded in ma s and tf during the wet seasons pw ew than in the dry seasons sw d normally inorganic and organic fertilizers can dap urea npk manure are applied in the basin during the april july pw and september november ew seasons this suggests that fertilizer use influences river no3 directly during the wet seasons similar studies by maghanga et al 2013 in a neighboring basin in the nandi hills monitored the effect of fertilizer application on no3 concentration in streams draining tea farms they observed that fertilizer application contributed to stream water no3 increase and reported higher values ranging between 22 and 36 mg l 1 no3 studies done in the nyando basin are limited to work done by triest et al 2012 at sub basin level located in the ri land use the study reported no3 concentrations ranging between 1 2 mg l 1 in ahero ri3 and 2 4 mg l 1 measured downstream of muhoroni ri4 their findings were lower than the current mean values obtained in ri for all seasons except the dry season fig 2 in comparison to previous studies in other river basins of lake victoria kenya work done in the chemosit sub basin of the sondu miriu river basin reported mean no3 concentrations ranging from 1 3 0 4 mg l 1 in natural forest to 7 1 2 6 mg l 1 in tea and forest plantations jacobs et al 2017 the tea and forest plantation values obtained by jacobs et al 2017 were higher than the tf values obtained in this study this can be attributed to the significantly large area occupied by commercial tea farms in the chemosit sub basin as compared to the smaller area of tea plantations tinderet tea estates in the tf land use of the nyando the mara river basin in kenya which has its origin at the western side of the mau forest reported no3 concentrations between 3 5 and 8 5 mg l 1 for agricultural land use kipkemboi et al 2014 masese et al 2017 mwanake et al 2019 the studies in the mara basin obtained similar values to those obtained for ri and s in the current study but lower than the no3 concentrations in ma studies done by marwick et al 2014 in the athi galana sabaki river basin draining the central and south eastern kenya reported similar no3 concentrations 0 01 53 2 mg

study are higher than those reported for tropical rivers in zambia 0 3 1 4 mg l 1 kennedy et al 2016 r pangani in tanzania 2 1 3 1 mg l 1 selemani et al 2018 and senegal river in west africa 0 2 0 8

applied in order to improve no3 source apportionment in the different land use classes of the nyando river basin no3 isotope values in the basin varied spatially as shown in fig 3 Œ¥15n no3 ranged from 3 8 to 15 1 in the basin with values obtained in tf being significantly lower compared to values of the other land uses the highest Œ¥15n no3 were observed in ma and ri recording mean values of 10 0 and 9 6 respectively mean values ranging 8 7 10 obtained in s and ma respectively being dominated by agricultural activities were lower than reported literature ranges for agricultural areas 11 17 kellman and hillaire marcel 2003 however the Œ¥15n no3 values in this study were in the range of similar river basin studies 4 14 zeng and wu 2015 and 3 15 yevenes et al 2016 Œ¥18o no3 on the other hand ranged from 4 5 to 19 7 and gave similar values in most of the land use areas except in tf which recorded significantly lower values compared to the ma land use Œ¥18o no3 values in the basin were in the nitrified no3 range of 10 to 15 mayer et al 2001 xue et al 2009 except for samples from a stream ma3 draining a commercial flower farm which recorded a mean value of 16 2 supplementary table 3 fig 3 reveals a gradual increase in no3 isotopic values from low levels in tf to higher levels in ri and ma a pattern which indicates an increase in recycled no3 apparently driven by human activities this spatial variation also enables the identification of the potential no3 sources controlling these isotopic signatures Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 values for local no3 sources were also determined these sources were nitrate fertilizers nf ammonium in fertilizer rain nfr nitrate in precipitation np soil nitrogen sn manure and sewage m s as shown in fig 4a the Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o no3 values of the local sources were found to be within the literature range reported in kendall et al 2007 mayer et al 2001 and xue et al 2009 on the other hand composite samples from each land use different seasons were analyzed for b and Œ¥11b values in addition these values were also determined for the potential local no3 sources manure sewage and inorganic solid fertilizers the b concentrations of the local no3 sources ranged for the fertilizers npk dap can from 15 to 2500 ¬µg l 1 for manure from 127 to 581 ¬µg l 1 and for sewage from 25 to 46 ¬µg l 1 boron concentrations in the surface water samples ranged from 2 to 14 ¬µg l 1 and were generally low as also indicated by tirez et al 2010 the Œ¥11b value of fertilizers ranged from 4 3 to 7 8 of sewage from 16 to 22 and of manure from 31 to 37 the Œ¥11b values obtained in this study fall within the range of values reported in previous studies for inorganic fertilizers 9 to 15 and for animal manure 6 9 to 42 1 komor 1997 widory et al 2013 2005 2004 however sewage Œ¥11b values obtained in this study were higher than values reported in previous studies by widory et al 2013 in fig 4a a Œ¥15n no3 versus Œ¥18o no3 bi plot of seasonal mean values per land use was plotted against source ranges of the potential local sources samples from ma ri and s plotted predominantly in the manure sewage source range but showed clear seasonal trends however for tf land use samples plotted mainly in the soil n source range the tf land use consisted of the kipkoil forest a pristine part of the mau forest complex and commercial tea farms in tinderet which also operate planted forests to supply wood for use in tea processing therefore it seems that leaching of mineralized soil organic n was the main process controlling river no3 input in tf however seasonal variation in tf is observed in fig 4a whereby during the wet pw ew seasons samples plotted dominantly in the soil n source on the other hand during dry seasons sw d tf samples plotted in the mixed range of soil n and manure sewage sources the decrease in soil n in the dry seasons can be attributed to reduced water discharge from the natural forest in addition domestic and animal wastes from small scale farmers who border the forest and practice mixed farming of tea food crops and open grazing of dairy cows may also contribute to the manure and sewage source observed during the dry seasons based on b data fig 5 the tf station f and t samples had the lowest b concentrations ranging between 2 and 4 ¬µg l 1 being similar to b values 3 3 4 4 ¬µg l 1 reported by widory et al 2013 for a natural case study in addition mean Œ¥11b values of the t 35 and f 45 stations fall in the wider range of Œ¥11b values reported for natural environments and rainfall ranging from 10 to 48 mather and porteous 2001 millot et al 2010 widory et al 2013 therefore the tf values can be taken to represent the natural b and Œ¥11b value ranges of the nyando basin supporting the no3 isotope data indications that soil n natural is the main no3 source in this land use the ma land use which reported the highest no3 concentrations fig 2 showed relatively enriched Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o values especially in the pw season and data plotted predominantly in the manure and sewage source range during all seasons fig 4a in particular ma3 samples which drain a commercial flower farm gave significantly high isotopic signatures Œ¥15n 9 0 to 14 0 Œ¥18o 11 1 to 19 6 compared to the other samples of the entire basin given that the Œ¥18o values of the station mean 16 2 2 5 were within the no3 fertilizer source range it implies that leaching of no3 from inorganic fertilizers applied on farms significantly contributes to river no3 input in addition the flower farm has a water pond see supplementary fig 2 located upstream of ma3 therefore the isotopic enrichment may also be caused by in situ denitrification taking place in the pond before water discharge into the river no3 versus cl correlation is an effective tool applied to determine mixing or denitrification processes and also useful in indicating anthropogenic sources of water solutes mengis et al 1999 widory et al 2005 in the current study both anions recorded significantly higher values in ma compared to the other land use classes table 1 however they did not show any correlation implying that the no3 cl ratio would not be a good indicator of mixing or denitrification processes in this area however the variation of no3 cl molar ratios with cl concentrations provides more insight to differentiate between inorganic fertilizers sewage and manure sources of no3 li et al 2010 liu et al 2006 meghdadi and javar 2018 in the current study a plot of no3 cl molar ratios versus cl concentrations was generated fig 4b for the ma samples together with samples from sewage contaminated streams in kisumu city fig 1a based on fig 4b ma3 samples plot together showing a significantly higher no3 cl ratio but low cl concentrations which is characteristic of the dominance of inorganic fertilizers as sources of river water solute input liu et al 2006 on the other hand the sewage contaminated streams showed a low no3 cl ratio but a relatively high cl concentration sewage and animal wastes have been found to be high in cl concentrations and low in no3 cl ratio chen et al 2009 liu et al 2006 zeng and wu 2015 the low no3 cl ratio in sewage and animal wastes is partly because their nitrogen is more in the nh4 form as opposed to the no3 form chen et al 2009 the other ma stations ma1 ma2 ma4 ma5 plot in between the ma3 and the sewage contaminated streams implying that they may be influenced by either inorganic fertilizers or by municipal wastes the ma2 and ma4 stations are located downstream of the londiani and kipkelion towns respectively fig 1b while ma1 and ma5 locations are characterized by populated residences and mixed farming of food crops and free range livestock keeping this may point out to animal manure and or sewage being the probable sources of river solutes in these four ma stations in order to overcome the limitations of Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 and hydrochemistry data in discriminating between manure and sewage sources the Œ¥11b analysis was integrated from fig 5 b and Œ¥11b values in ma3 samples were in the natural no3 source range for the nyando basin however both Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 and hydrochemical data strongly indicate the inorganic fertilizer source in ma3 in addition the significantly higher no3 concentrations recorded in the ma3 station than anywhere else in the land use or basin is consistent with an inorganic fertilizer source widory et al 2013 this implies that both inorganic fertilizers and mineralized organic soil n natural are the main no3 sources in ma3 but in situ denitrification taking place in the water pond located upstream of ma3 supplementary fig 2 causes isotopic enrichment Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 consequently blurring the natural source signal in fig 4a on the other hand an increase in b concentration was observed in the other four ma stations which are geographically located downstream of ma3 this means that apart from background concentrations b increase in the ma land use is controlled by either manure or sewage sources as opposed to inorganic fertilizer sources however the Œ¥11b values for the ma samples rule out the sewage source implying that no3 is mainly sourced from manure and or natural soil n sources therefore animal manure use in small scale mixed farming and animal feces from free range livestock keeping and leaching of mineralized soil organic n are the main sources of river no3 input in these four ma stations no3 sources in the sugarcane land use varied seasonally fig 4a during the sw and d seasons s samples indicated a predominantly manure sewage source while in the pw and ew seasons they moved in the direction of nh4 in the fertilizer and rainfall source range typically urea is the most commonly used inorganic fertilizer in the sugarcane plantations nyilitya et al 2020b and is applied during the wet seasons and therefore could be the probable cause of the alignment towards the nh4 in fertilizer and rainfall source during pw and ew seasons however the dominance of manure sewage no3 source in this land use is due to domestic and industrial effluents from village residences and the chemelil sugar industry complex fig 1b which houses a sugarcane factory farm residences and schools in addition the practice of free range livestock feeding and watering in rivers is common in the area which leaves animal feces littering around the water points and eventually leaches no3 into the river water Œ¥11b data for the s samples fig 5 shows that sewage sources dominated the sw season while during the pw and d seasons manure and soil n natural were the dominant sources for the ri land use fig 4a shows that manure sewage sources dominated the river no3 in all seasons except the ew season when samples move in the direction of nh4 in fertilizer and rainfall source range the ri is a relatively densely populated and urbanized area of the nyando basin which extends from the midstream of the kipchorian tributary up to the nyando wetland and river mouth the area has industrializing towns including muhoroni awasi and ahero fig 1b with several industries including sugar agrochemical rice lime and cement factories mainly mixed farming of sugarcane food crops and free range livestock keeping are the common agricultural activities in this zone small scale farmers commonly use animal manure or sugarcane bagasse compost manure made from sugarcane wastes for soil fertility improvement the urban centers lack formal sewage treatment facilities while effluent treatment facilities of the sugarcane and allied industries are insufficient and ends up in discharging untreated sewage into the nyando river lvemp 2005 Œ¥11b data fig 5 on the other hand shows manure as the main anthropogenic no3 source of river no3 for the ri land use however seasonal patterns are evident during wet seasons a mixture of manure and natural sources soil n dominates while in dry seasons manure is the main source but with some level of contribution from sewage sources this is expected because as river water discharge declines during the dry season natural no3 sources from the upstream tf catchments decline while anthropogenic sources animal manure and sewage remain constant and act as main sources of river solute inputs similarly lin et al 2019 observed the dominance of urban wastewater no3 sources in the upper illinois river during the dry and low river flow season while agricultural no3 sources dominated during the wet season the ew season in all land uses of the nyando basin showed significantly lower Œ¥15n values p 0 02 compared to the other seasons sw pw d and water samples plotted in the soil n source range fig 4a in the nyando basin most food crops take 3 4 months to mature therefore during the ew season they are already harvested this consequently leaves farm land bare and prone to erosion during this short rain season in addition most farmers do not cultivate in this season which means less agricultural inputs therefore it implies that leaching of nitrified soil organic n which may be enhanced by soil erosion is the main pathway of river no3 input during the ew season therefore through the integration of Œ¥11b data into the Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 and hydrochemical data it appears that manure and soil n natural are the dominant sources of river no3 input in the nyando river basin however sewage was the major source in the sugarcane land use during the sw season and also contributed to river no3 in the residential industrial land use during the d season the findings in this study to a much extend agrees with similar work in tropical river basins anornu et al 2017 minh et al 2020 the study by minh et al 2020 in the day river basin of vietnam reported the dominance of natural no3 sources soil groundwater in upstream catchments dominance of sewage manure in the midstream sections discharging hanoi city especially in the dry season while mineral fertilizers urea were the main no3 source in the basin during the wet season this is similar to the current spatiotemporal variations in no3 sources observed in the nyando basin the study by anornu et al 2017 in the white volta river basin in ghana identified animal manure and domestic sewage as the primary sources of no3 contamination into surface water which is similar to the current study observations this trend in the sub saharan african region reflects to the rapid population growth being experienced there but which has not been matched with the corresponding investment in domestic urban sewage management infrastructure leading to high discharge of untreated sewage into surface water resources white et al 2017 in addition animal manure is the most commonly used agricultural input in sub saharan africa due to its local availability and affordability to most households 3 3 estimating proportional contribution of potential no3 sources to the river nitrate multiple sources are involved as potential no3 sources in the different land use areas of the nyando basin although the multi isotope Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥11b approach has so far been successful in identifying the dominant sources of river no3 for each land use it is of greater benefit to estimate the quantities associated with the river no3 sources for the targeted implementation of no3 pollution control measures in the basin therefore it was necessary to use a quantitative method based on the bayesian isotopic mixing model siar to estimate the proportional contributions of these sources spatio temporal Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 data of the nyando river were analyzed using mixsiar to estimate the contribution of five potential no3 sources np nf nf r sn and m s seasonal variations in source contribution in each land use area are presented in fig 6 a d each season represents at least two sampling campaigns 2sw 3pw 2ew 2d which had no significant differences p 0 05 in their Œ¥15n or Œ¥18o values i e sw1 and sw2 p 0 4 pw1 pw3 p 0 4 0 5 ew1 and ew2 p 0 8 0 08 and d1 and d2 p 0 4 0 5 the spatial no3 source contributions in the whole basin are shown in fig 6e fig 6a c clearly shows that manure or sewage m s was the dominant no3 source in ma ri and s land uses in all seasons however based on Œ¥11b findings it should be noted that manure was the dominant no3 source over sewage therefore in this case manure has the highest contribution in the m s source in addition the mixsiar output to some extend supports Œ¥11b findings regarding seasonal patterns of source contribution for instance for the ri and s land uses fig 6b and c there is a higher soil n source contribution during the wet seasons pw ew relative to the dry seasons sw d similarly Œ¥11b data fig 5 indicates that the natural source was likely the dominant source in ri and s during the pw and ew seasons while sewage had more influence during the sw and d seasons the proportional no3 source contribution in the three land use classes followed the order m s sn nf r nf np however for tf land use fig 6d the other potential sources sn nf r nf np increased in proportional source contribution but the m s source decreased consequently soil n became a co dominating no3 source in tf especially during the pw and ew seasons fig 6d this is also indicated in fig 5 because the b concentration and Œ¥11b values of tf samples are in the natural source range widory et al 2013 mixsiar estimation of spatial no3 source contributions to the whole basin fig 6e shows that manure dominant m s is the leading source of the river no3 input for each land use contributing for 70 ma 65 ri s 60 and tf 46 soil n ranked second with its highest proportional contribution of 41 recorded for the tf land use followed by 29 s 24 ri and 18 ma nf r was third contributing for about 10 no3 for all land uses this reflects the use of ammonium based fertilizers in the basin as opposed to nf which showed 1 2 contribution to the basin np was the least contributing 1 in the whole basin the contribution of inorganic fertilizers nf r or nf in the nyando basin is generally low compared to river basin studies in other regions which reports inorganic fertilizers as a major source or river no3 input chen et al 2009 lin et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a 2018b for instance the studies by zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2018b reported inorganic fertilizer contributions of 38 82 and 29 2 17 7 respectively this can be attributed to the relatively low inorganic fertilizer use rate in the larger part of the nyando basin 50 kg n ha 1 which when coupled with the inadequate sanitation systems and relatively higher manure use in the region makes inorganic fertilizer contribution less significant a clear spatial trend in the proportional contribution of the five potential sources to the nyando basin is evident in fig 6e the m s source which was highest for ma land use characterized by a combination of commercial mixed agriculture and urban effluents decreased steadily moving to the tf land use forests and commercial tea the trend corresponds to a soil n source increase from the lowest proportional contribution in ma to the leading no3 source for tf land use fig 6e this clearly indicates the impact that land use has on no3 sources with land uses under intense human activities i e ma ri being dominated by anthropogenic sources m s while those under low human pressure tf were dominated by natural soil n sources 4 conclusions no3 discharge in the nyando basin varies spatially and is driven by intensive land use patterns the combined application of multi isotope Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥11b data and mixsiar reveals that animal manure either from free range livestock keeping or manure application in mixed farming dominates no3 inputs in the basin soil n is the second most important source of river no3 especially in the tea and forest land use and in the whole basin during the agriculturally dormant short rainy season however sewage sources influence river no3 during the dry seasons and especially for the sugarcane residential industrial land use classes where industries are located on the other hand inorganic fertilizers are the major sources of river no3 in an area under commercial flower farming therefore in order to control excess no3 discharges and ensure sustainable water quality management in the basin good manure use guidelines and better animal husbandry methods like paddocking or zero grazing which controls the spread of animal wastes should be adopted in the basin in addition technological advancement and expansion of the existing waste water treatment infrastructure is key for the control of the sewage sourced no3 contamination of river water also the restoration of previously degraded water sources wetlands and forests and improvement of land management practices is necessary for the control of soil erosion driven no3 losses declaration of competing interest

nyando river basin of lake victoria kenya river water was monitored spatially in the basin for hydro chemical and isotopic parameters from july 2016 to may 2018 the data shows that no3 concentrations in the basin are governed by the predominant land use mixed agriculture ma land use recorded significantly higher no3 concentrations 8 8 10 6 mg l 1 compared to other land use zones residential industrial ri 3 4 2 2 mg l 1 sugarcane s 3 2 1 5 mg l 1 and tea forest areas tf 3 0 1 1 mg l 1 stable isotope data and hydrochemistry complemented each other in identifying the potential no3 sources and their spatial temporal variation in the basin boron isotope Œ¥11b data was categorically helpful in overcoming the limitations of Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 to discriminate between manure and sewage sources Œ¥11b specifically identified manure as the dominant source of river no3 input in the ma ri and s land use zones and also indicated soil n as the main river no3 source in the tf land use these findings were substantiated via nitrate source apportionment using a bayesian isotopic mixing model which showed manure and or sewage were the leading sources of river no3 input in the basin contributing 70 ma 65 ri 60 s and 46 tf soil n ranked second with its highest proportional river no3 contribution of 41 recorded for the tf land use followed by 29 s 24 ri and 18 ma ammonium in fertilizers and or rain was third contributing about 10 no3 for all land uses while no3 fertilizers showed 1 2 contribution across the basin nitrate in precipitation was the least no3 source contributing 1 across the basin in order to control excess no3 discharge in the basin better guidelines for animal manure use land conservation measures and improvement of sanitation systems should be prioritized keywords nitrate apportionment nyando river basin stable isotopes mixsiar 1 introduction tropical catchments are being subjected to increasing population growth urbanization and increasing intensification of agricultural practices it raises concern on nitrate no3 pollution in river systems the negative impacts associated with excess no3 discharges in water bodies include eutrophication proliferation of aquatic weeds and algal blooms and consequently it causes the decline of local fish population and general disruption of aquatic ecosystems additionally high no3 levels in drinking water pose high risks to human health in form of both methemoglobinemia in infants blue baby syndrome and cancer kendall et al 2007 schullehner et al 2018 as such the world health organization who has defined 50 mg l 1 no3 in potable water as the maximum concentration threshold an increasing demand for feeding a growing population has led to a sharp rise in agricultural production and also the use of nitrogen n based compounds inorganic organic fertilizers to boost agricultural production galloway et al 2008 therefore the distribution and adoption of n based inorganic fertilizers are becoming more common in the sub saharan african ssa region where traditionally animal manure was the main agricultural input for soil fertility improvement the increase in n production and distribution if not controlled results in detrimental impacts on the receiving ecosystems the situation in the ssa region is exemplified in the lake victoria basin where insufficient sewage treatment systems and human encroachment of forests and wetlands result in elevated discharges of no3 into surface water resources raburu et al 2012 wang et al 2012 this has led to clear impacts of eutrophication being witnessed in the lake which includes occurrence of dense algal blooms water hyacinth invasion of the lake fish population decrease and a general decline of portable water quality lung ayia et al 2001 nyilitya et al 2020b the lake victoria is africa s largest fresh water lake with a surface area of around 68 000 km2 which is shared by three east african countries kenya tanzania and uganda the lake basin provides immense socio economic and ecological services to its riparian population estimated to be currently above 45 million people worldbank 2018 these includes basic needs services food water and transport commercial fishery hydroelectric power trade industry wildlife tourism and is the sources of the white nile nyilitya 2020 the nyando river is one of the major rivers draining into lake victoria from the kenyan side of the basin river nyando is subjected to a variety of human related pressures it drains a diverse land use pattern including forests pristine and planted agricultural areas commercial mixed farming of crops and livestock residential areas urban and industrial centers and a wetland its headwater catchments are located in the mau forest complex a major water tower of the lake victoria basin which experiences severe deforestation and human encroachment for instance it has been reported that about 7084 ha of mau forest land was cleared between the years 2000 and 2003 lvbc 2007 this triggers accelerated run off in the upstream steep gradient areas during rain events resulting in severe soil erosion and sediment deposition into lake victoria icraf 2003 olang and f√ºrst 2011 additionally commercial tea farming dominates the upstream tinderet while the midstream and the low lands of the kano plains are under commercial sugarcane and rice farming where inorganic fertilizers are commonly applied maghanga et al 2013 twesigye 2011 mixed farming of food crops sugarcane and free range livestock keeping is highly practiced in the river basin concurrently the basin has a high population density fast growing urban centers londiani muhoroni awasi ahero and industries including sugar agrochemical rice lime and cement production factories most of these urban centers lack conventional sewage treatment infrastructure while the industrial waste treatment facilities operate below capacity and often discharge untreated effluents into the nyando river juma et al 2014 lvemp 2005 on the other hand the nyando wetland at the river mouth which acts as a natural nutrient pollution buffer zone to the lake has been extensively reclaimed and converted into farmland and livestock feeding area raburu et al 2012 overall the basin is a complex matrix of human land use systems which all potentially impact the river chemistry and no3 loads in their own way however no3 data from the river basin is highly limited with an available study by triest et al 2012 reporting data only at a sub basin scale the lake victoria basin commission lvbc through its lake victoria environmental management project lvemp used to run a basin wide water quality monitoring program in the period between 2000 and 2005 and generated a comprehensive nutrient dataset in terms of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp lvemp 2005 however since that period there has been an information gap in terms of n data from the lvemp and its activities are currently focused on intervention strategies to control pollution but still the lack of recent n data and especially information on the key sources of riverine no3 pollution is a major impediment for the development of effective no3 pollution control measures indeed for a basin with a diverse land use and anthropogenic interferences like the nyando conventional hydrochemistry is insufficient neither for identifying the potential sources of river no3 contamination nor for estimating the source contributions consequently this hinders proper knowledge based management guidelines to be introduced therefore an effective apportionment of no3 pollution of the nyando basin requires a land use based understanding of the dominating no3 sources and their associated contributions to the catchment level no3 loads many studies have demonstrated the applicability of the dual isotopes of no3 Œ¥15n Œ¥18o and boron b Œ¥11b to identify and apportion no3 sources in water e g widory et al 2013 xue et al 2009 different no3 sources i e atmospheric n soil n mineral fertilizers manure and sewage have a wide range of n Œ¥15n and oxygen Œ¥18o isotope signatures however n transformation processes nitrification denitrification and mixing of several no3 sources alter this signature of isotopes in no3 consequently complicating apportionment of no3 sources however b is ubiquitous in nature and its isotope composition Œ¥11b is largely not affected by no3 transformation processes except perhaps during adsorption desorption interactions with clay minerals iron and aluminum oxide surfaces bassett et al 1995 vengosh et al 1994 in addition Œ¥11b discriminates between manure and sewage sources and therefore can be used to improve source identification where mixing and transformation processes are involved widory et al 2004 consequently the value of integrating Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 and Œ¥11b data in determining no3 sources and associated transformation processes has been recently demonstrated nyilitya et al 2020a widory et al 2013 xue et al 2013 in addition researchers have developed and applied an isotopic mixing model mixsiar which uses a bayesian framework to quantify proportional source contributions and determines the probability distribution for the proportional contribution of each source to the mixture matiatos 2016 parnell et al 2010 xue et al 2012 a few studies which applies isotopic techniques for nitrate source apportionment have been conducted in tropical river basins among them is work by minh et al 2020 which applied dual no3 isotopes Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 to study sources and conversion of no3 in the day river basin of vietnam work by anornu et al 2017 integrated hydro chemical and the dual no3 isotopes to trace sources of groundwater and surface contamination in the white volta river basin in ghana however this study integrates a multi isotope Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥11b hydro chemical and mixsiar approach to identify and apportion potential sources of no3 input into the river nyando the state of the art approach is the first of its kind in the region for a river basin and should significantly contribute to the development of effective no3 pollution control measures in the basin 2 material and methods 1 1 study area the nyando river basin lies between longitudes 34 47 e and 35 44 e and latitudes 0 07 n and 0 20 s fig 1 b it is 153 km long originates from the mau and the nandi escarpments and drains an area of about 3600 km2 before its discharge into the winam gulf of lake victoria the altitude in the basin varies from 1134 m a s l at the lake victoria to about 3000 m a s l in the mau and nandi escarpments the escarpment areas have a steep sloping topography with a slope ranging between 19 and 43 while the lowlands in the kano plains have a subdued topography and a slope of 0 4 the kano plain is a gently undulating alluvial plain ranging 1135 1170 m a s l at the base of the escarpments and occupies two thirds of the lower half of the nyando river basin raburu et al 2012 the nyando wetland is situated at the river mouth and along the shores of lake victoria covering an area of about 14 4 km2 raburu et al 2012 the basin has a tropical moist climate ranging from humid in the highlands to sub humid in the low lying kano plains near the lake it experiences a bi modal rainfall pattern with a long rain season occurring between march july while a short rain season occurs between september november the mean annual rainfall ranges from 1100 to 1600 mm with the upper reaches of the basin receiving higher amounts as compared to the middle and lower reaches mean annual minimum and maximum temperature are 16 and 29 c respectively the spatial variation in climate is attributed to altitude proximity to the highlands and nearness to the lakeshore soils in the highland areas consist of high silt and clay containing soils ferrasols nitisols cambisols while the lowlands have mainly alluvial soils which are highly vulnerable to soil erosion during the wet seasons olang and f√ºrst 2011 the river consists of two main tributaries the ainapngetuny which originates from the nandi hills and the kipchorian which originates from the mau forests upstream of londiani fig 1b the long term annual average discharge of the nyando river based on river discharge data from the year 1950 to 2000 has been reported to be 18 m3 s 1 with peak discharges normally witnessed in april or early may cowi 2002 the basin has a diverse land use ranging from pristine and planted forests commercial tea and sugarcane mixed agriculture food crops cash crops free range animal keeping human settlements industries and urban centers 2 1 sampling and analysis for an effective basin wide study in the nyando river spatially distributed sampling stations were identified along the main river and its tributaries and covering the key land use zones of the basin in consultation with the kisumu based water resources authority wra a total of 23 sampling stations were set up covering pristine kipkoil forest commercial tea and sugarcane estates horticulture mixed agricultural areas crops and livestock keeping industrial and urban centres wetland and river mouth fig 1b to study seasonal variability in isotopic and hydro chemical parameters sampling was conducted during four main seasons per hydrological year 1 the transition period between dry and wet season in march marked as start wet season sw 2 the agriculturally productive wet period between may july marked as peak wet pw 3 during the end of the wet season ew in september and 4 in the dry season d in december as described in nyilitya et al 2020b field sampling was conducted for nine seasons consisting of 2 sw 3 pw 2 ew and 2 d seasons from july 2016 to may 2018 the sampling stations could be grouped into four clusters corresponding to the main land use classes in the basin therefore the sample point labelling fig 1b is based on the four land use classes which are 1 mixed agriculture ma consisting of five stations ma1 ma5 in the upper reaches of the kipchorian tributary 2 residential industrial ri consisting of seven stations ri1 ri7 located in the midstream kipchorian tributary and the downstream reaches of the main nyando river 3 sugarcane s including eight stations s1 s8 seven of them located in the sugarcane belt in the mid downstream reaches of the ainapngetuny tributary and one in the koru tributary and 4 tea and forests tf consisting of three stations tf1 tf3 located in the kipkoil forest and tinderet commercial tea estates the clustering was performed by analyzing water physico chemical data from these stations using hierarchical cluster analysis hca as described in earlier work by nyilitya et al 2020b in the field water was taken as a grab sample in

sugarcane factories muhoroni chemelil and from agrochemical and lime factories manure was sampled for cow goat and sheep collected from animal droppings in the basin inorganic fertilizer samples of the commonly used types can dap npk urea were purchased from farmers and suppliers in the basin precipitation samples were collected from rainfall stations in ahero kakamega and kericho towns while soil n samples were collected by filtering suspended soil sediments in river water using 11 ¬µm filters whatmann ge healthcare life sciences chicago il usa in the laboratory all samples for Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o no3 analysis were filtered again through 0 45 ¬µm membrane filters and stored frozen 17 c awaiting analysis laboratory determination of na k ca2 mg2 no3 no2 cl and so4 2 concentrations was carried out using an ion chromatograph 930 compact ic flex metrohm switzerland it should be noted that nitrate concentrations in this study were analyzed and expressed as no3 the Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o no3

would be the geogenic sources most likely carbonates 3 1 spatial temporal no3 concentrations fig 2 presents seasonal no3 concentration data in each of the land use classes of the nyando basin no3 concentrations ranged from 0 1 mg l 1 recorded in ri4 during the dry season of 2016 to 56 3 mg l 1 obtained in ma3 during the start of the wet season in 2018 the highest concentrations in the basin were obtained for ma land use in all seasons with 90 of all ma samples recording no3 concentration above 4 0 mg l 1 the mean no3 concentrations in ma samples were significantly higher than the concentrations in the other land uses ri p 0 001 s p 0 001 and tf p 0 004 in particular the ma3 samples recorded peak values ranging between 23 and 56 3 mg l 1 in the different sampling seasons fig 2 the ma3 station is located in a stream which drains a commercial horticultural flower farm finlay lemotit fig 1b under irrigated greenhouse farming conditions where no3 and nh4 based fertilizers can dap are perennially applied nyilitya et al 2020b however no seasonal differences in mean no3 concentrations were observed in the ma land use most likely due to the perennial anthropogenic activities in the area the ma land use is mainly situated in the upstream part of the kipchorian tributary fig 1b at an altitude ranging between 1900 and 2300 m a s l it is a highly populated zone and most residents practice mixed farming of food crops maize beans and potatoes and livestock in small holder farms 5 ha where the use of both animal manure and inorganic fertilizers to maximize yields is common in addition sanitation is a major challenge in the area since residences and urban centers in the vicinity e g londiani kipkelion fig 1b lack a formal sanitary system nyilitya et al 2020b for ri land use no3 ranged from a minimum of 0 1 mg l 1 to a maximum value of 7 5 mg l 1 here significantly lower no3 concentrations were obtained during the dry season recording an average value of 1 4 mg l 1 compared to 4 0 3 9 and 4 3 for the sw pw and ew respectively fig 2 located in the downstream part of the nyando basin which is characterised by residential industrial and urban areas the no3 concentration in ri was expected to be high during the study period however the dry season no3 values were even lower than the background values for instance the average no3 concentration in ri in the december 2016 dry season was 0 4 mg l 1 which was lower than the natural forest sample tf1 value of 1 9 mg l 1 in the same season see supplementary table 1 this may suggest no3 removal to be taking place for the s land use no3 ranged from 0 4 to 7 4 mg l 1 similar to the ri significantly lower no3 concentrations in the s land use were recorded during the dry season compared to the other seasons no3 in the tf land use ranged from 1 5 to 5 2 mg l 1 there were no seasonal differences in no3 concentrations observed in the tf land use a trend which can be attributed to the relatively low human activities implying fewer sources of no3 contamination generally the three land uses ri s and tf had similar no3 concentrations although not significantly different rather higher no3 concentrations were recorded in ma s and tf during the wet seasons pw ew than in the dry seasons sw d normally inorganic and organic fertilizers can dap urea npk manure are applied in the basin during the april july pw and september november ew seasons this suggests that fertilizer use influences river no3 directly during the wet seasons similar studies by maghanga et al 2013 in a neighboring basin in the nandi hills monitored the effect of fertilizer application on no3 concentration in streams draining tea farms they observed that fertilizer application contributed to stream water no3 increase and reported higher values ranging between 22 and 36 mg l 1 no3 studies done in the nyando basin are limited to work done by triest et al 2012 at sub basin level located in the ri land use the study reported no3 concentrations ranging between 1 2 mg l 1 in ahero ri3 and 2 4 mg l 1 measured downstream of muhoroni ri4 their findings were lower than the current mean values obtained in ri for all seasons except the dry season fig 2 in comparison to previous studies in other river basins of lake victoria kenya work done in the chemosit sub basin of the sondu miriu river basin reported mean no3 concentrations ranging from 1 3 0 4 mg l 1 in natural forest to 7 1 2 6 mg l 1 in tea and forest plantations jacobs et al 2017 the tea and forest plantation values obtained by jacobs et al 2017 were higher than the tf values obtained in this study this can be attributed to the significantly large area occupied by commercial tea farms in the chemosit sub basin as compared to the smaller area of tea plantations tinderet tea estates in the tf land use of the nyando the mara river basin in kenya which has its origin at the western side of the mau forest reported no3 concentrations between 3 5 and 8 5 mg l 1

applied in order to improve no3 source apportionment in the different land use classes of the nyando river basin no3 isotope values in the basin varied spatially as shown in fig 3 Œ¥15n no3 ranged from 3 8 to 15 1 in the basin with values obtained in tf being significantly lower compared to values of the other land uses the highest Œ¥15n no3 were observed in ma and ri recording mean values of 10 0 and 9 6 respectively mean values ranging 8 7 10 obtained in s and ma respectively being dominated by agricultural activities were lower than reported literature ranges for agricultural areas 11 17 kellman and hillaire marcel 2003 however the Œ¥15n no3 values in this study were in the range of similar river basin studies 4 14 zeng and wu 2015 and 3 15 yevenes et al 2016 Œ¥18o no3 on the other hand ranged from 4 5 to 19 7 and gave similar values in most of the land use areas except in tf which recorded significantly lower values compared to the ma land use Œ¥18o no3 values in the basin were in the nitrified no3 range of 10 to 15 mayer et al 2001 xue et al 2009 except for samples from a stream ma3 draining a commercial flower farm which recorded a mean value of 16 2 supplementary table 3 fig 3 reveals a gradual increase in no3 isotopic values from low levels in tf to higher levels in ri and ma a pattern which indicates an increase in recycled no3 apparently driven by human activities this spatial variation also enables the identification of the potential no3 sources controlling these isotopic signatures Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 values for local no3 sources were also determined these sources were nitrate fertilizers nf ammonium in fertilizer rain nfr nitrate in precipitation np soil nitrogen sn manure and sewage m s as shown in fig 4a the Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o no3 values of the local sources were found to be within the literature range reported in kendall et al 2007 mayer et al 2001 and xue et al 2009 on the other hand composite samples from each land use different seasons were analyzed for b and Œ¥11b values in addition these values were also determined for the potential local no3 sources manure sewage and inorganic solid fertilizers the b concentrations of the local no3 sources ranged for the fertilizers npk dap can from 15 to 2500 ¬µg l 1 for manure from 127 to 581 ¬µg l 1 and for sewage from 25 to 46 ¬µg l 1 boron concentrations in the surface water samples ranged from 2 to 14 ¬µg l 1 and were generally low as also indicated by tirez et al 2010 the Œ¥11b value of fertilizers ranged from 4 3 to 7 8 of sewage from 16 to 22 and of manure from 31 to 37 the Œ¥11b values obtained in this study fall within the range of values reported in previous studies for inorganic fertilizers 9 to 15 and for animal manure 6 9 to 42 1 komor 1997 widory et al 2013 2005 2004 however sewage Œ¥11b values obtained in this study were higher than values reported in previous studies by widory et al 2013 in fig 4a a Œ¥15n no3 versus Œ¥18o no3 bi plot of seasonal mean values per land use was plotted against source ranges of the potential local sources samples from ma ri and s plotted predominantly in the manure sewage source range but showed clear seasonal trends however for tf land use samples plotted mainly in the soil n source range the tf land use consisted of the kipkoil forest a pristine part of the mau forest complex and commercial tea farms in tinderet which also operate planted forests to supply wood for use in tea processing therefore it seems that leaching of mineralized soil organic n was the main process controlling river no3 input in tf however seasonal variation in tf is observed in fig 4a whereby during the wet pw ew seasons samples plotted dominantly in the soil n source on the other hand during dry seasons sw d tf samples plotted in the mixed range of soil n and manure sewage sources the decrease in soil n in the dry seasons can be attributed to reduced water discharge from the natural forest in addition domestic and animal wastes from small scale farmers who border the forest and practice mixed farming of tea food crops and open grazing of dairy cows may also contribute to the manure and sewage source observed during the dry seasons based on b data fig 5 the tf station f and t samples had the lowest b concentrations ranging between 2 and 4 ¬µg l 1 being similar to b values 3 3 4 4 ¬µg l 1 reported by widory et al 2013 for a natural case study in addition mean Œ¥11b values of the t 35 and f 45 stations fall in the wider range of Œ¥11b values reported for natural environments and rainfall ranging from 10 to 48 mather and porteous 2001 millot et al 2010 widory et al 2013 therefore the tf values can be taken to represent the natural b and Œ¥11b value ranges of the nyando basin supporting the no3 isotope data indications that soil n natural is the main no3 source in this land use the ma land use which reported the highest no3 concentrations fig 2 showed relatively enriched Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o values especially in the pw season and data plotted predominantly in the manure and sewage source range during all seasons fig 4a in particular ma3 samples which drain a commercial flower farm gave significantly high isotopic signatures Œ¥15n 9 0 to 14 0 Œ¥18o 11 1 to 19 6 compared to the other samples of the entire basin given that the Œ¥18o values of the station mean 16 2 2 5 were within the no3 fertilizer source range it implies that leaching of no3 from inorganic fertilizers applied on farms significantly contributes to river no3 input in addition the flower farm has a water pond see supplementary fig 2 located upstream of ma3 therefore the isotopic enrichment may also be caused by in situ denitrification taking place in the pond before water discharge into the river no3 versus cl correlation is an effective tool applied to determine mixing or denitrification processes and also useful in indicating anthropogenic sources of water solutes mengis et al 1999 widory et al 2005 in the current study both anions recorded significantly higher values in ma compared to the other land use classes table 1 however they did not show any correlation implying that the no3 cl ratio would not be a good indicator of mixing or denitrification processes in this area however the variation of no3 cl molar ratios with cl concentrations provides more insight to differentiate between inorganic fertilizers sewage and manure sources of no3 li et al 2010 liu et al 2006 meghdadi and javar 2018 in the current study a plot of no3 cl molar ratios versus cl concentrations was generated fig 4b for the ma samples together with samples from sewage contaminated streams in kisumu city fig 1a based on fig 4b ma3 samples plot together showing a significantly higher no3 cl ratio but low cl concentrations which is characteristic of the dominance of inorganic fertilizers as sources of river water solute input liu et al 2006 on the other hand the sewage contaminated streams showed a low no3 cl ratio but a relatively high cl concentration sewage and animal wastes have been found to be high in cl concentrations and low in no3 cl ratio chen et al 2009 liu et al 2006 zeng and wu 2015 the low no3 cl ratio in sewage and animal wastes is partly because their nitrogen is more in the nh4 form as opposed to the no3 form chen et al 2009 the other ma stations ma1 ma2 ma4 ma5 plot in between the ma3 and the sewage contaminated streams implying that they may be influenced by either inorganic fertilizers or by municipal wastes the ma2 and ma4 stations are located downstream of the londiani and kipkelion towns respectively fig 1b while ma1 and ma5 locations are characterized by populated residences and mixed farming of food crops and free range livestock keeping this may point out to animal manure and or sewage being the probable sources of river solutes in these four ma stations in order to overcome the limitations of Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 and hydrochemistry data in discriminating between manure and sewage sources the Œ¥11b analysis was integrated from fig 5 b and Œ¥11b values in ma3 samples were in the natural no3 source range for the nyando basin however both Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 and hydrochemical data strongly indicate the inorganic fertilizer source in ma3 in addition the significantly higher no3 concentrations recorded in the ma3 station than anywhere else in the land use or basin is consistent with an inorganic fertilizer source widory et al 2013 this implies that both inorganic fertilizers and mineralized organic soil n natural are the main no3 sources in ma3 but in situ denitrification taking place in the water pond located upstream of ma3 supplementary fig 2 causes isotopic enrichment Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 consequently blurring the natural source signal in fig 4a on the other hand an increase in b concentration was observed in the other four ma stations which are geographically located downstream of ma3 this means that apart from background concentrations b increase in the ma land use is controlled by either manure or sewage sources as opposed to inorganic fertilizer sources however the Œ¥11b values for the ma samples rule out the sewage source implying that no3 is mainly sourced from manure and or natural soil n sources therefore animal manure use in small scale mixed farming and animal feces from free range livestock keeping and leaching of mineralized soil organic n are the main sources of river no3 input in these four ma stations no3 sources in the sugarcane land use varied seasonally fig 4a during the sw and d seasons s samples indicated a predominantly manure sewage source while in the pw and ew seasons they moved in the direction of nh4 in the fertilizer and rainfall source range typically urea is the most commonly used inorganic fertilizer in the sugarcane plantations nyilitya et al 2020b and is applied during the wet seasons and therefore could be the probable cause of the alignment towards the nh4 in fertilizer and rainfall source during pw and ew seasons however the dominance of manure sewage no3 source in this land use is due to domestic and industrial effluents from village residences and the chemelil sugar industry complex fig 1b which houses a sugarcane factory farm residences and schools in addition the practice of free range livestock feeding and watering in rivers is common in the area which leaves animal feces littering around the water points and eventually leaches no3 into the river water Œ¥11b data for the s samples fig 5 shows that sewage sources dominated the sw season while during the pw and d seasons manure and soil n natural were the dominant sources for the ri land use fig 4a shows that manure sewage sources dominated the river no3 in all seasons except the ew season when samples move in the direction of nh4 in fertilizer and rainfall source range the ri is a relatively densely populated and urbanized area of the nyando basin which extends from the midstream of the kipchorian tributary up to the nyando wetland and river mouth the area has industrializing towns including muhoroni awasi and ahero fig 1b with several industries including sugar agrochemical rice lime and cement factories mainly mixed farming of sugarcane food crops and free range livestock keeping are the common agricultural activities in this zone small scale farmers commonly use animal manure or sugarcane bagasse compost manure made from sugarcane wastes for soil fertility improvement the urban centers lack formal sewage treatment facilities while effluent treatment facilities of the sugarcane and allied industries are insufficient and ends up in discharging untreated sewage into the nyando river lvemp 2005 Œ¥11b data fig 5 on the other hand shows manure as the main anthropogenic no3 source of river no3 for the ri land use however seasonal patterns are evident during wet seasons a mixture of manure and natural sources soil n dominates while in dry seasons manure is the main source but with some level of contribution from sewage sources this is expected because as river water discharge declines during the dry season natural no3 sources from the upstream tf catchments decline while anthropogenic sources animal manure and sewage remain constant and act as main sources of river solute inputs similarly lin et al 2019 observed the dominance of urban wastewater no3 sources in the upper illinois river during the dry and low river flow season while agricultural no3 sources dominated during the wet season the ew season in all land uses of the nyando basin showed significantly lower Œ¥15n values p 0 02 compared to the other seasons sw pw d and water samples plotted in the soil n source range fig 4a in the nyando basin most food crops take 3 4 months to mature therefore during the ew season they are already harvested this consequently leaves farm land bare and prone to erosion during this short rain season in addition most farmers do not cultivate in this season which means less agricultural inputs therefore it implies that leaching of nitrified soil organic n which may be enhanced by soil erosion is the main pathway of river no3 input during the ew season therefore through the integration of Œ¥11b data into the Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 and hydrochemical data it appears that manure and soil n natural are the dominant sources of river no3 input in the nyando river basin however sewage was the major source in the sugarcane land use during the sw season and also contributed to river no3 in the residential industrial land use during the d season the findings in this study to a much extend agrees with similar work in tropical river basins anornu et al 2017 minh et al 2020 the study by minh et al 2020 in the day river basin of vietnam reported the dominance of natural no3 sources soil groundwater in upstream catchments dominance of sewage manure in the midstream sections discharging hanoi city especially in the dry season while mineral fertilizers urea were the main no3 source in the basin during the wet season this is similar to the current spatiotemporal variations in no3 sources observed in the nyando basin the study by anornu et al 2017 in the white volta river basin in ghana identified animal manure and domestic sewage as the primary sources of no3 contamination into surface water which is similar to the current study observations this trend in the sub saharan african region reflects to the rapid population growth being experienced there but which has not been matched with the corresponding investment in domestic urban sewage management infrastructure leading to high discharge of untreated sewage into surface water resources white et al 2017 in addition animal manure is the most commonly used agricultural input in sub saharan africa due to its local availability and affordability to most households 3 3 estimating proportional contribution of potential no3 sources to the river nitrate multiple sources are involved as potential no3 sources in the different land use areas of the nyando basin although the multi isotope Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥11b approach has so far been successful in identifying the dominant sources of river no3 for each land use it is of greater benefit to estimate the quantities associated with the river no3 sources for the targeted implementation of no3 pollution control measures in the basin therefore it was necessary to use a quantitative method based on the bayesian isotopic mixing model siar to estimate the proportional contributions of these sources spatio temporal Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 data of the nyando river were analyzed using mixsiar to estimate the contribution of five potential no3 sources np nf nf r sn and m s seasonal variations in source contribution in each land use area are presented in fig 6 a d each season represents at least two sampling campaigns 2sw 3pw 2ew 2d which had no significant differences p 0 05 in their Œ¥15n or Œ¥18o values i e sw1 and sw2 p 0 4 pw1 pw3 p 0 4 0 5 ew1 and ew2 p 0 8 0 08 and d1 and d2 p 0 4 0 5 the spatial no3 source contributions in the whole basin are shown in fig 6e fig 6a c clearly shows that manure or sewage m s was the dominant no3 source in ma ri and s land uses in all seasons however based on Œ¥11b findings it should be noted that manure was the dominant no3 source over sewage therefore in this case manure has the highest contribution in the m s source in addition the mixsiar output to some extend supports Œ¥11b findings regarding seasonal patterns of source contribution for instance for the ri and s land uses fig 6b and c there is a higher soil n source contribution during the wet seasons pw ew relative to the dry seasons sw d similarly Œ¥11b data fig 5 indicates that the natural source was likely the dominant source in ri and s during the pw and ew seasons while sewage had more influence during the sw and d seasons the proportional no3 source contribution in the three land use classes followed the order m s sn nf r nf np however for tf land use fig 6d the other potential sources sn nf r nf np increased in proportional source contribution but the m s source decreased consequently soil n became a co dominating no3 source in tf especially during the pw and ew seasons fig 6d this is also indicated in fig 5 because the b concentration and Œ¥11b values of tf samples are in the natural source range widory et al 2013 mixsiar estimation of spatial no3 source contributions to the whole basin fig 6e shows that manure dominant m s is the leading source of the river no3 input for each land use contributing for 70 ma 65 ri s 60 and tf 46 soil n ranked second with its highest proportional contribution of 41 recorded for the tf land use followed by 29 s 24 ri and 18 ma nf r was third contributing for about 10 no3 for all land uses this reflects the use of ammonium based fertilizers in the basin as opposed to nf which showed 1 2 contribution to the basin np was the least contributing 1 in the whole basin the contribution of inorganic fertilizers nf r or nf in the nyando basin is generally low compared to river basin studies in other regions which reports inorganic fertilizers as a major source or river no3 input chen et al 2009 lin et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a 2018b for instance the studies by zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2018b reported inorganic fertilizer contributions of 38 82 and 29 2 17 7 respectively this can be attributed to the relatively low inorganic fertilizer use rate in the larger part of the nyando basin 50 kg n ha 1 which when coupled with the inadequate sanitation systems and relatively higher manure use in the region makes inorganic fertilizer contribution less significant a clear spatial trend in the proportional contribution of the five potential sources to the nyando basin is evident in fig 6e the m s source which was highest for ma land use characterized by a combination of commercial mixed agriculture and urban effluents decreased steadily moving to the tf land use forests and commercial tea the trend corresponds to a soil n source increase from the lowest proportional contribution in ma to the leading no3 source for tf land use fig 6e this clearly indicates the impact that land use has on no3 sources with land uses under intense human activities i e ma ri being dominated by anthropogenic sources m s while those under low human pressure tf were dominated by natural soil n sources 4 conclusions no3 discharge in the nyando basin varies spatially and is driven by intensive land use patterns the combined application of multi isotope Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥11b data and mixsiar reveals that animal manure either from free range livestock keeping or manure application in mixed farming dominates no3 inputs in the basin soil n is the second most important source of river no3 especially in the tea and forest land use and in the whole basin during the agriculturally dormant short rainy season however sewage sources influence river no3 during the dry seasons and especially for the sugarcane residential industrial land use classes where industries are located on the other hand inorganic fertilizers are the major sources of river no3 in an area under commercial flower farming therefore in order to control excess no3 discharges and ensure sustainable water quality management in the basin good manure use guidelines and better animal husbandry methods like paddocking or zero grazing which controls the spread of animal wastes should be adopted in the basin in addition technological advancement and expansion of the existing waste water treatment infrastructure is key for the control of the sewage sourced no3 contamination of river water also the restoration of previously degraded water sources wetlands and forests and improvement of land management practices is necessary for the control of soil erosion driven no3 losses declaration of competing interest
