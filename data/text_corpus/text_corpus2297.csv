11485,the semi arid region of the loess plateau is typical of rain fed agricultural production in northwestern china in this area the ridge mulched system rm is a widely used measure to increase crop yield the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of rm on soil water and inorganic nitrogen n distribution and grain yield of maize zea mays l the study was conducted over three consecutive years and consisted of four treatments each replicated three times i rm with n application rate of 260 kg n ha 1 rm n260 ii rm with 180 kg n ha 1 rm n180 iii a traditional flat cultivation system without mulching f with 260 kg n ha 1 f n260 iv f with 180 kg n ha 1 f n180 mean soil water content during the maize growing season was increased by rm in 2013 only however rm increased the soil water storage significantly at the 3 leaf v3 and 6 leaf stage v6 and decreased evapotranspiration et during pre silking stage in all years compared to f rm significantly improved maize grain yield by 79 123 in 2013 23 25 in 2014 and 11 12 in 2015 following three years of maize cultivation soil inorganic n content increased substantially two to three fold in the rm system and 60 of the total inorganic n was accumulated in the top soil layers 0 60 cm under the mulched ridge relative changes were much smaller in f and most of inorganic n was stored in 0 20 cm and 100 160 cm soil layers generally rm resulted in higher soil water storage during the pre silking stage which was the main reason for the improved maize grain yield the nitrate leaching risk was reduced in rm n180 compared with f but nitrate leaching from the furrows between ridges was observed in rm n260 however the large increase in soil inorganic n content in rm n180 after three years cultivation indicates an oversupply of n and a potential risk of n losses to the environment over the longer term our study indicates therefore that rm is a suitable system for maize cropping in the semi arid region of the loess plateau with benefits in water and n use efficiency but recommendations for appropriate n application rates are required to ensure long term agricultural sustainability accounting for grain yields and environmental impacts the mechanisms for inorganic n accumulation under the rm system are not fully understood and warrant further investigation keywords soil water inorganic n plastic film mulch ridge mulched system maize loess plateau 1 introduction plastic film mulching has developed rapidly following it s introduction to china in 1978 and is now widely applied in crop production in arid and semiarid regions dong et al 2009 li et al 2004 several mulching systems have been used in recent years including 1 fully mulched ridge and furrow system two ridges and furrow fully mulched with plastic film zhou et al 2009 2 ridge mulched system alternating ridge and furrow with plastic film mulched ridge liu et al 1989 3 flat half mulched system alternating mulched row and bare row in flat cultivation liu et al 1989 and 4 flat fully mulched system flat plot all mulched with plastic film liu et al 1989 of these the ridge mulched system has been most widely adopted leading significant increases in crop yield rain fed agricultural areas of chinese loess plateau especially in areas with 400 600 mm annual precipitation jiang et al 2016 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 the yield increases under plastic film mulching have been attributed to factors including 1 reduction in soil evaporation and increase in crop transpiration 2 increase in water harvesting 3 increase in soil temperature and 4 increase in activation of soil nutrients zhou et al 2009 zhao et al 2002 zhou 1996 these factors change the soil environment improving conditions for crop growth resulting in higher water use efficiency and nutrient availability water is the most limiting factor for crop production under rain fed agriculture in arid and semiarid areas however studies have shown that the temporally irregular rainfall distribution and inefficient management of rainwater rather than total rainfall amount are the primary limits for crop production barron et al 2003 zhu et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 indicated that plastic film mulching improved rainwater management to overcome water limitations during dry spells which promoted crop growth and increased yields significantly drought and mild chilling stress often occur in the loess plateau of china especially during the early stage of the maize growing season plastic film mulching can improve the soil water content and temperature during this stage resulting in increased yield jiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 the main crops i e spring maize and winter wheat on the loess plateau are conventionally cultivated as a single crop per year followed by several months of bare fallow it is generally assumed that water stored in the soil during fallow period is utilized by the subsequent crop the antecedent soil moisture content prior to sowing may also cause or mitigate water stress during the early stages of crop growth however few studies have considered the interactions between plastic film mulching and antecedent soil moisture content on crop yield fertilization can increase crop yield and enhance drought resistance of crops in arid and semiarid regions liu et al 2013 however excessive application of n fertilizer results in low n use efficiency and high n losses with environmental impacts including greenhouse gas emission water contamination soil quality degradation and soil nitrate accumulation in deep soil layers davidson 2009 morell et al 2011 reay et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 plastic film mulching not only results in improved soil physical properties soil water and temperature but also directly changes soil biological characteristics and soil fertility liu et al 2013 soil inorganic nitrogen n is an important indicator for soil fertility and productivity since the plastic film mulching changes the soil microenvironment with associated changes to the n cycle processes the soil inorganic n distribution under plastic film mulching systems may differ to that under traditional cultivation plastic film mulching may increase soil microbial activity due to the improved soil water and temperature conditions and thereby enhance mineralization wang et al 2006 high inorganic n contents have been observed in soil profiles under plastic film mulching especially in topsoils and enhanced soil mineralization could be one reason wang et al 2006 another reason may be related to reduced n leaching under plastic film mulching ruidisch et al 2013 liu et al 2017a b however liu et al 2014a b found that the nitrate accumulation was more related to n fertilizer application rates high n input resulted in higher nitrate accumulation in the soil profile which may also increase n leaching and greenhouse gas emissions kettering et al 2013 he et al 2018 anikwe et al 2007 several studies have investigated the fate of n under plastic film mulching however few have considered the potential differences that may occur between the ridge and furrow under a ridge mulched system in arid and semiarid areas liu et al 2015 wang et al 2016 kettering et al 2013 ridge mulched systems have a mulched ridge and furrows without mulch thus the n transformations and transport processes could be different a study conducted under a monsoon climate showed that n leaching mainly occurred from the furrow in a ridge mulched system kettering et al 2013 however the vertical distribution and temporal patterns of soil inorganic n under ridge mulched systems are not well understood in rain fed drylands many studies have investigated the relationship between soil water content and crop yield to clarify the yield increase mechanism under plastic film mulching however very few have considered the impacts of the effects on water content and soil inorganic n distribution on both food security and sustainable agriculture this study focused on a ridge mulched system in a maize crop on the loess plateau of china taking crop production and environmental sustainability into consideration the objectives were to 1 evaluate the effect of the ridge mulched system on soil water content soil water storage and water use efficiency and 2 investigate soil inorganic n pools and distribution considering the ridge and furrow as different units 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the field experiments were conducted from 2013 to 2015 at the changwu agricultural and ecological experimental station located on the loess plateau of china 35 28 n 107 88 e ca 1200 m above sea level the annual mean air temperature is 9 2 c and average annual rainfall is 582 mm 73 of which occurs during the maize growing season the groundwater table is approximately 80 m below the surface the cropping system in this area is one crop of maize or wheat per year according to chinese soil taxonomy the soils are heilutu belonging to cumuli ustic isohumosols light silt loam gong et al 2007 the soil properties in the top 20 cm are as follows bulk density 1 3 g cm 3 ph 8 4 soil organic carbon

experiments this study included a ridge mulched system rm and a traditional cultivation system i e flat cultivation without mulching f over three maize growing seasons fig 1 there were two fertilizer application treatments 180 kg n ha 1 as recommended for traditional cultivation 260 kg n ha 1 as per local farmer practice giving a total of four treatments rm n180 f n180 rm n260 and f n260 plots were established a 5 10 m in a randomized block design with three replicate plots per treatment urea n 46 was used as n fertilizer in all fertilized treatments in 2014 and 2015 all n fertilizer was applied manually to the soil surface prior to sowing and plowed in as a basal dressing in 2013 70 of the n fertilizer was applied as basal dressing and the remaining 30 was applied during the silking stage using a hole sowing machine following precipitation a total of 60 kg p ha 1 as calcium superphosphate p2o5 12 and 75 kg k ha 1 as potassium sulfate k2o 45 were applied simultaneously with the basal n fertilizer for each plot ridges and furrows were made following fertilizer application the rm system consisted of alternating ridges 70 cm and furrows 30 cm with only the ridges being mulched with plastic film fig 2 two rows of maize were planted with a 40 cm spacing centered on the 70 cm wide ridges thus the rm system contained alternating wide 60 cm and narrow 40 cm plant row spacings the f system also had the identical wide and narrow row spacings within row plant spacing was 30 cm and the plant density was approximately 67 000 plants ha 1 typical of local practice the plastic film in all treatments was 0 008 mm thick transparent polyethylene a high yielding maize hybrid pioneer 335 was selected for this study the maize was planted at the end of april and harvested at the end of september there was no irrigation during the maize growing season 2 3 monitoring and sampling the monitoring and sampling was conducted during the maize growing seasons from april 2013 to september 2015 the soil water monitoring was conducted separately for ridges and furrows in the rm rm r and rm f and f treatments fig 2 the soil water content volumetric water content was measured using soil moisture monitoring instruments ech2o system decagon usa at 1 h intervals during 2013 with 1 h interval six ech2o systems were installed and each consisted of five ech2o te sensors which were installed at soil depths of 10 30 60 100 and 160 cm to derive soil water contents at the 0 20 20 40 40 80 80 120 and 120 200 cm layers sensors were calibrated before installation and the soil moisture at each depth in the four soil profiles was assumed as homogenous before the experiment details given in jiang et al 2016 soil moisture content was determined gravimetrically at the same measured depths for another two replicates for each treatment at 15 day intervals using a soil auger in 2014 and 2015 soil water content n 3 was measured using a neutron moisture meter cnc503dr every 15 days at the same measured depths as in 2013 at the same time soil water content at depths of 10 and 30 cm was determined gravimetrically using a soil auger the ech2o te sensor and neutron probe were thus calibrated against gravimetrically measured soil water contents soil samples rm r 10 0 0 10 10 30 30 60 60 100 100 160 cm rm f and f 0 10 10 30 30 60 60 100 100 160 cm 3 replicates per plot were collected at 15 day interval during maize growing season with a soil corer diameter 5 cm soil samples were refrigerated at 4 c prior to subsequent analysis the soil nitrate n no3 n and ammonium n nh4 n concentrations were measured using a continuous flow analyzer aa3 seal analytical germany after kcl extraction the nitrite n no2 n was ignored in this study because most samples were lower than detection limits we used the no3 n and nh4 n concentrations in dry weight equivalent soil and bulk density to calculate the inorganic n pools in kg ha 1 for the different depths for rm the soil water storage sws and inorganic n pools were calculated by using the respective data for rm r and rm f and multiplying by the ridge to furrow ratios ridge ratio 7 10 furrow ratio 3 10 2 4 statistical analysis the mean and standard deviation were calculated for the data collected for each treatment and depth the differences between treatments and depths were analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova and the least significant difference lsd was used for multiple comparisons differences were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water content soil water storage and water use efficiency during maize growing season compared with the long term average 1957 2009 the annual precipitation was 68 6 170 0 and 63 8 mm lower in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively table 1 the precipitation during the maize growing season for the three years accounted for 85 67 and 67 of the annual precipitation which was 17 mm higher 142 4 mm and 73 6 mm lower the than long term average for 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively the e601 pan evaporation was lower in all years than the long term average for both annual and during the maize growing season the precipitation during one month and three months before sowing were lowest in 2013 approximately 20 and 43 mm lower than long term average however the evaporation for those periods was higher than usual the drought situation started before maize sowing and lasted to the end of june pre silking stage in 2013 table 1 in 2014 there was higher precipitation and lower evaporation during one month and three months before sowing significant differences between treatments in mean soil water content across all soil layers were only observed in 2013 although some soil layers were also shown the differences in 2015 table 2 in 2013 the soil water content was 10 lower in rm r than that in f at 10 cm depth while 20 higher in rm f the rm significantly increased the soil water content at depths of 30 and 60 cm by 40 and 22 at 30 cm and 43 and 47 at 60 cm for rm r and rm f respectively in addition the mean soil water contents were the lowest in 2013 across the three years for each soil layer and each treatment the extreme drought situation before sowing lasted to end of june and is the most likely reason for the observed lower soil water content in 2013 table 1 this was supported by the significantly lower maize yields in 2013 for f treatments table 3 which showed that the drought limited maize growth in 2013 but the soil water content was sufficient for maize growth in 2014 and 2015 however the use of different measurement methods for monitoring soil water contents between 2013 and 2014 2015 may also have contributed to these observed differences although both methods were calibrated against gravimetrically measured soil water contents the rm treatments increased sws during the early stage of the maize growing season compared with the f treatments the average sws in the rm treatments was 13 78 and 23 mm higher at the 3 leaf stage v3 and 23 42 and 26 mm higher at the 6 leaf stage v6 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 3 from the silking stage vt the difference between rm and f decreased and sws was higher in f following large rainfall events i e vt stage in 2013 and r3 stage in 2015 the sws at v3 and v6 stage were 277 and 160 mm lower in 2013 than that in 2014 and 150 and 187 mm lower than that in 2015 allowing for the lower precipitation during the early stage of the maize growing season in 2013 this might also be a result of the much lower sws before sowing only 215 mm on average across all treatments compared with the 464 and 387 mm of sws before sowing in 2014 and 2015 the sws in 2013 increased 117 146 mm at harvest for all treatments however in 2014 and 2015 with the higher values before sowing sws decreased by 27 and 45 mm respectively on average across all treatments fig 4 table 3 the changes in sws across the 0 200 cm soil depth between harvest and sowing sws was significantly higher in rm than that in f in 2013 while the evapotranspiration et was lower in rm table 3 no significant difference in et across the entire growing season was observed between rm and f in 2014 and 2015 however during the pre silking stage et was significantly lower in rm than in f for all three years and higher in rm during the post silking stage table 3 the effect of plastic film mulching on et was mainly to change the ratio between soil evaporation and maize transpiration li et al 2013 a higher aboveground biomass after the 6 leaf stage has been observed under plastic film mulching jiang et al 2016 and we observed higher soil water contents in rm before the silking stage fig 3 this suggests that the lower et during the pre silking stage was due to lower soil evaporation and the higher et during the post silking stage was due to higher plant transpiration in rm compared with the f treatments rm significantly increased maize grain yield table 3 with a much greater effect observed in 2013 the yield increases for rm n260 and rm n180 compared with f n260 and f n180 were 79 and 123 in 2013 23 and 25 in 2014 and 12 and 11 in 2015 respectively several studies have shown that et or the contribution of transpiration to et and water use during pre silking stage has a positive relationship with grain yield zhang et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 as observed in our study the highest yields occurred in 2014 both in rm and f associated with much higher precipitation and lower evaporation before sowing and a much higher sws before sowing fig 4 even though precipitation during growing stage was lower table 1 implying that the soil water content before sowing plays an important role in maize grain yields zhang et al 2014 also found a significant correlation between crop yield and soil water content at sowing on the loess plateau zhu et al 2015 found sws at sowing had a significant positive relationship with et during the pre silking stage we also observed higher et during the pre silking stage associated with higher sws at sowing table 3 thus the sws at sowing might increase plant transpiration during the pre silking stage and affect grain yield rm significantly increased wue which increased by 89 and 134 for rm n260 and rm n180 in 2013 12 and 36 in 2014 and 16 and 6 in 2015 respectively table 3 these finding suggest that maize grain yield was not limited by the amount of rainfall during the maize growing season or the cumulative annual rainfall but by the irregular distribution of rainfall over time and the inefficient management of rainwater in semiarid areas zhu et al 2015 many studies have indicated that increasing rainwater harvest improving soil water storage and increasing plant water uptake capacity by using different cultivation systems could optimize crop productivity in rain fed areas kahinda et al 2007 zhu et al 2015 in our study the maize grain yields were significantly higher in rm than that in f treatments table 3 previous studies have found that maize production on the loess plateau was constrained by water stress at the early stage of the maize growing season liu et al 2009 song et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 as seen in our study i e low yields in f in 2013 the drought during pre silking particularly the jointing stage postponed silking and shortened the grain filling period and thus affected final grain yield moser et al 2006 our results suggested that increases in maize yields with rm were primarily through the improved soil moisture especially during drought periods significantly higher soil water storage was observed during the v3 and v6 stages across all three years which could be explained a reduction in soil evaporation with mulching enhancing the harvesting of the small rainfall amount li et al 2001 and improving the soil water use efficiency table 3 zhu et al 2015 found that the higher soil water storage in the early growing season in mulching systems clearly promoted maize growth and development because the higher soil water storage was sufficient to provide a buffer during drought periods which usually occurred in the early growing season this could also explain the large increase in maize yield for rm in 2013 in our study although the difference in et for the entire growing season between rm and f was not consistent across all three years rm actually reduced nonproductive soil evaporation but increased productive plant transpiration during the pre silking stage as discussed above thereby improving the water use efficiency and yield table 3 in addition we found that the sws before sowing could be a key factor for maize production which could mitigate the water stress during the maize growing season i e high yields in f in 2014 with low annual rainfall this result indicated that rainfall in the fallow season may play an important role in water use in the next year thus if precipitation during fallow seasons could be effectively harvested and stored in the soil through management intervention such as using plastic film or leaving straw residue after harvest the water requirements for maize would be satisfied which is particularly important for dry years 3 2 dynamics of inorganic n content in the soil profile during the maize growing season the dynamics of soil inorganic n content in the 0 160 cm soil layer during the maize growing season for 2013 2015 in rm and f treatments are shown in figs 5 7 there were large fluctuations in soil inorganic n in the top layers 0 30 cm and the mean contents in these layers were much larger than that in deeper layers nitrate n was the main form of inorganic n accounting for 63 98 in this study table 4 the observed higher nitrate n contents in the top soil layers is consistent with other studies wang et al 2015 thorup kristensen 2001 on average the inorganic n contents in the 0 10 cm soil layer for rm r were 1 3 23 4 times and 1 5 13 1 times higher than that in other soil layers for rm n180 and rm n260 respectively across the three years high levels of inorganic n were mainly distributed in the 0 10 cm layer in the ridge with mulching as observed in other studies wang et al 2015 kettering et al 2013 wang et al 2006 there are several possible explanations for this result one is that the basal fertilizer was mainly in the surface layer and the plastic film prevented any n leaching by rainfall wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 locascio et al 1985 ruidisch et al 2013 secondly the rate at which nitrate n is transported with soil water to the soil surface layer will increase with a higher soil temperature under the plastic film mulching jiang et al 2016 and lastly that the plastic film mulching improved the soil water and temperature increasing soil microbial activity and enhancing the soil mineralization rate wang et al 2006 generally two peaks of inorganic n in rm r were observed in the 0 10 cm soil layer during the maize growing season one occurred after fertilizer application and the other during crop maturity and harvest stages the high soil inorganic n during the later stage of the maize growing season was probably explained by the low nutrient requirement for crop growth at that stage and by enhanced soil mineralization caused by the higher temperature zhang et al 2012 standford et al 1973 wang et al 2006 there was a large decrease in inorganic n content in the 0 30 cm soil layer after june in rm r because of the high maize growth and uptake of soil n during this period there were also two peaks in inorganic n in the top soil layers 0 30 cm for rm f the first was caused by fertilizer application but the peaks in june were probably caused by the lateral movement of n from the ridge due to lateral water movement however in 2013 it might also have be caused by the application of the remaining 30 of the n fertilizer a large decrease from approximately 100 mg kg 1 to less than 20 mg kg 1 occurred in the inorganic n content of the top soil layers following several rainfall events in rm f and peaks occured in the deeper soil layers 60 100 cm after storms e g following a rainfall event of 120 8 mm in 22 july 2013 especially in the treatment with the higher n application rate this is most likely because the plastic film intercepted rainfall which then flowed from the ridges into the furrows enhanced the leaching of inorganic n especially nitrate from the top to deeper soil layers wang et al 2015 kettering et al 2013 used 15n to trace the fate of soil n and found that nitrate leaching in rm mainly occurred in the furrows especially at high n application rates consistent with the observations in our study thus consideration of appropriate n application rate is needed in rm systems to avoid nitrate leaching from the furrows in f treatments the inorganic n increased following fertilizer application then decreased during maize growth for top soil layers 0 30 cm however an increase was observed during the later stage of the maize growing season in deep soil layers 60 100 cm at the higher n application rate due to n leaching during rainfall 3 3 inorganic nitrogen pool inorganic n pools in the 0 10 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers were significantly higher than in other soil layers for rm after one year of maize cultivation the two layers accounted for 26 and 41 of the total inorganic n pool 0 160 cm for rm n180 and rm n260 respectively about 40 of the total inorganic n was stored in the 60 100 cm soil layers in f treatments fig 8 however the large pool changed to the 0 60 cm soil layer in rm and to 0 20 cm and 100 160 cm soil layers in f after two and three years of maize cultivation figs 9 and 10 about 60 of the total inorganic n was present in the top soil layers 0 60 cm after three years in rm treatments the results indicate that soil inorganic n is likely to accumulate in top soil layers in rm but in deeper soil layers in f implying that rm would reduce nitrate leaching during the maize growing season ruidisch et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 locascio et al 1985 however as we stated above nitrate leaching from the furrows in rm at the high n application rate is of concern which may cause nitrate accumulation in deep soil layers in loess soil zhou et al 2016 in addition the higher nitrate n accumulated in the top soils may lead to higher n2o emission in rm he et al 2018 inorganic soil n pools were initially small 200 kg n ha 1 but under rm increased significantly by two and three times for rm n180 and rm n260 respectively after three years of maize cultivation fig 11 thus rm can enhance inorganic n accumulation in the soil profile especially at high n application rates liu et al 2014a kettering et al 2013 the high inorganic n accumulation in our study was probably caused by higher soil mineralization in rm zhang et al 2012 hai et al 2015 however several studies have highlighted the many differences which may occur between the mulching system compared with the traditional system such as soil temperature water content plant uptake microbial activity mineralization rate and soil organic carbon content zhang et al 2012 liu et al 2014a liu et al 2014c jiang et al 2016 these differences may interact to stimulate the release and accumulation of inorganic n in soil under rm however the mechanism is not clear so far the total inorganic n pools in f were a slight decrease for f n180 and a slight increase for f n260 after the three years of maize cultivation the soil water in f was not limiting in 2014 and 2015 which was good for plant growth and thus increased plant n uptake or caused n leaching and may have reduced the soil n accumulation the n application rate of 180 kg n ha 1 was as recommended for traditional maize cultivation in the study area which was proven to be appropriate by our study with a larger partial factor productivity pfp for rm n180 ranging from 75 to 91 the treatments at the higher n application rate of 260 kg n ha 1 had lower pfp values even under rm across the three years with the increase in the inorganic n pool the pfp values in rm increased in 2014 but decreased in 2015 cui et al 2008 showed that residual soil nitrate in the top 100 cm of the soil profile should be maintained within the range of 87 180 kg n ha 1 for high yield maize production this indicated that although maize grain yield has a positive relationship with n input high n input or high residual soil n could reduce n use efficiency and limit the grain yield liu et al 2017a b probably also being related to soil organic carbon depletion except for in the f n180 treatment the ratio of inorganic n to tn increased sharply after three years of maize cultivation with the largest increase occurring in the rm n260 treatment 1 7 7 8 table 4 in the rm n180 treatment although inorganic n increased the proportion as nitrate n decreased after two and three years cultivation these results suggest a higher nitrate leaching risk in rm n260 however although rm n 180 resulted in higher pfp value and lower nitrate leaching risk the high inorganic n accumulation in the soil profile after two three years cultivation may lead to subsequent reductions in grain yield it may also pose threats to the environment increasing n leaching and greenhouse gas emissions or cause the depletion of soil organic carbon liu et al 2013 thus negatively affecting agriculture sustainability consequently our results showed that n application rate of 260 kg n ha 1 was excessive in rm and the recommended n application rate of 180 kg n ha 1 for maize under traditional cultivation in this rain fed area may not be suitable for rm liu et al 2014b found that an n application rate of 110 kg n ha 1 could sustain high grain yields in a fully mulched ridge and furrow system therefore further studies to trace the fate of applied fertilizer n investigate the soil mineralization and derive recommendations for n application rates under rm systems are warranted 4 conclusion implementing an rm mulched system compared with traditional flat cultivation significantly changed the soil water and inorganic n distribution over the 3 year study period compared with f rm improved the soil water storage significantly during the pre silking stage by decreasing the soil evaporation and increasing the plant transpiration which improved the water use efficiency and contributed to enhanced grain yield higher sws at sowing played an important role in maize production in rain fed agriculture on the loess plateau thus treatments such as plastic film mulching or straw residue left after harvest may be helpful in harvesting and storing rainfall in fallow season for subsequent use by the following crop the soil inorganic n in rm accumulated in the top soil layer 0 10 cm under the mulched ridge probably because of reduced n leaching increased soil mineralization and lateral n movement from the furrow to the ridge this was associated with a decrease in nitrate leaching to deeper soil layers however the nitrate leaching from the furrow was observed in the rm system at the higher n application rate inorganic n accumulation under the rm system increased by two to three times after three years of maize cultivation which may be explained by enhanced soil mineralization however the mechanism for soil inorganic n accumulation under plastic film mulching systems is not clear with potential interactions between a number of factors and soil processes and further study is required overall our result showed that rm n180 could obtain high grain yield with low risk of nitrate leaching after one year of cultivation but after three years of cultivation was associated with increased inorganic n accumulation in the soil profile thus the recommended n application rate for traditional maize cultivation in this region may not be suitable under rm development of new recommendations for n fertilizer application rates under rm are needed to ensure the sustainability of rain fed agriculture on the chinese loess plateau acknowledgments this study was funded by the national key r d program

yield by 79 123 in 2013 23 25 in 2014 and 11 12 in 2015 following three years of maize cultivation soil inorganic n content increased substantially two to three fold in the rm system and 60 of the total inorganic n was accumulated in the top soil layers 0 60 cm under the mulched ridge relative changes were much smaller in f and most of inorganic n was stored in 0 20 cm and 100 160 cm soil layers generally rm resulted in higher soil water storage during the pre silking stage which was the main reason for the improved maize grain yield the nitrate leaching risk was reduced in rm n180 compared with f but nitrate leaching from the furrows between ridges was observed in rm n260 however the large increase in soil inorganic n content in rm n180 after three years cultivation indicates an oversupply of n and a potential risk of n losses to the environment over the longer term our study indicates therefore that rm is a suitable system for maize cropping in the semi arid region of the loess plateau with benefits in water and n use efficiency but recommendations for appropriate n application rates are required to ensure long term agricultural sustainability accounting for grain yields and environmental impacts the mechanisms for inorganic n accumulation under the rm system are not fully understood and warrant further investigation keywords soil water inorganic n plastic film mulch ridge mulched system maize loess plateau 1 introduction plastic film mulching has developed rapidly following it s introduction to china in 1978 and is now widely applied in crop production in arid and semiarid regions dong et al 2009 li et al 2004 several mulching systems have been used in recent years including 1 fully mulched ridge and furrow system two ridges and furrow fully mulched with plastic film zhou et al 2009 2 ridge mulched system alternating ridge and furrow with plastic film mulched ridge liu et al 1989 3 flat half mulched system alternating mulched row and bare row in flat cultivation liu et al 1989 and 4 flat fully mulched system flat plot all mulched with plastic film liu et al 1989 of these the ridge mulched system has been most widely adopted leading significant increases in crop yield rain fed agricultural areas of chinese loess plateau especially in areas with 400 600 mm annual precipitation jiang et al 2016 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 the yield increases under plastic film mulching have been attributed to factors including 1 reduction in soil evaporation and increase in crop transpiration 2 increase in water harvesting 3 increase in soil temperature and 4 increase in activation of soil nutrients zhou et al 2009 zhao et al 2002 zhou 1996 these factors change the soil environment improving conditions for crop growth resulting in higher water use efficiency and nutrient availability water is the most limiting factor for crop production under rain fed agriculture in arid and semiarid areas however studies have shown that the temporally irregular rainfall distribution and inefficient management of rainwater rather than total rainfall amount are the primary limits for crop production barron et al 2003 zhu et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 indicated that plastic film mulching improved rainwater management to overcome water limitations during dry spells which promoted crop growth and increased yields significantly drought and mild chilling stress often occur in the loess plateau of china especially during the early stage of the maize growing season plastic film mulching can improve the soil water content and temperature during this stage resulting in increased yield jiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 the main crops i e spring maize and winter wheat on the loess plateau are conventionally cultivated as a single crop per year followed by several months of bare fallow it is generally assumed that water stored in the soil during fallow period is utilized by the subsequent crop the antecedent soil moisture content prior to sowing may also cause or mitigate water stress during the early stages of crop growth however few studies have considered the interactions between plastic film mulching and antecedent soil moisture content on crop yield fertilization can increase crop yield and enhance drought resistance of crops in arid and semiarid regions liu et al 2013 however excessive application of n fertilizer results in low n use efficiency and high n losses with environmental impacts including greenhouse gas emission water contamination soil quality degradation and soil nitrate accumulation in deep soil layers davidson 2009 morell et al 2011 reay et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 plastic film mulching not only results in improved soil physical properties soil water and temperature but also directly changes soil biological characteristics and soil fertility liu et al 2013 soil inorganic nitrogen n is an important indicator for soil fertility and productivity since the plastic film mulching changes the soil microenvironment with associated changes to the n cycle processes the soil inorganic n distribution under plastic film mulching systems may differ to that under traditional cultivation plastic film mulching may increase soil microbial activity due to the improved soil water and temperature conditions and thereby enhance mineralization wang et al 2006 high inorganic n contents have been observed in soil profiles under plastic film mulching especially in topsoils and enhanced soil mineralization could be one reason wang et al 2006 another reason may be related to reduced n leaching under plastic film mulching ruidisch et al 2013 liu et al 2017a b however liu et al 2014a b found that the nitrate accumulation was more related to n fertilizer application rates high n input resulted in higher nitrate accumulation in the soil profile which may also increase n leaching and greenhouse gas emissions kettering et al 2013 he et al 2018 anikwe et al 2007 several studies have investigated the fate of n under plastic film mulching however few have considered the potential differences that may occur between the ridge and furrow under a ridge mulched system in arid and semiarid areas liu et al 2015 wang et al 2016 kettering et al 2013 ridge mulched systems have a mulched ridge and furrows without mulch thus the n transformations and transport processes could be different a study conducted under a monsoon climate showed that n leaching mainly occurred from the furrow in a ridge mulched system kettering et al 2013 however the vertical distribution and temporal patterns of soil inorganic n under ridge mulched systems are not well understood in rain fed drylands many studies have investigated the relationship between soil water content and crop yield to clarify the yield increase mechanism under plastic film mulching however very few have considered the impacts of the effects on water content and soil inorganic n distribution on both food security and sustainable agriculture this study focused on a ridge mulched system in a maize crop on the loess plateau of china taking crop production and environmental sustainability into consideration the objectives were to 1 evaluate the effect of the ridge mulched system on soil water content soil water storage and water use efficiency and 2 investigate soil inorganic n pools and distribution considering the ridge and furrow as different units 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the field experiments were conducted from 2013 to 2015 at the changwu agricultural and ecological

experiments this study included a ridge mulched system rm and a traditional cultivation system i e flat cultivation without mulching f over three maize growing seasons fig 1 there were two fertilizer application treatments 180 kg n ha 1 as recommended for traditional cultivation 260 kg n ha 1 as per local farmer practice giving a total of four treatments rm n180 f n180 rm n260 and f n260 plots were established a 5 10 m in a randomized block design with three replicate plots per treatment urea n 46 was used as n fertilizer in all fertilized treatments in 2014 and 2015 all n fertilizer was applied manually to the soil surface prior to sowing and plowed in as a basal dressing in 2013 70 of the n fertilizer was applied as basal dressing and the remaining 30 was applied during the silking stage using a hole sowing machine following precipitation a total of 60 kg p ha 1 as calcium superphosphate p2o5 12 and 75 kg k ha 1 as potassium sulfate k2o 45 were applied simultaneously with the basal n fertilizer for each plot ridges and furrows were made following fertilizer application the rm system consisted of alternating ridges 70 cm and furrows 30 cm with only the ridges being mulched with plastic film fig 2 two rows of maize were planted with a 40 cm spacing centered on the 70 cm wide ridges thus the rm system contained alternating wide 60 cm and narrow 40 cm plant row spacings the f system also had the identical wide and narrow row spacings within row plant spacing was 30 cm and the plant density was approximately 67 000 plants ha 1 typical of local practice the plastic film in all treatments was 0 008 mm thick transparent polyethylene a high yielding maize hybrid pioneer 335 was selected for this study the maize was planted at the end of april and harvested at the end of september there was no irrigation during the maize growing season 2 3 monitoring and sampling the monitoring and sampling was conducted during the maize growing seasons from april 2013 to september 2015 the soil water monitoring was conducted separately for ridges and furrows in the rm rm r and rm f and f treatments fig 2 the soil water content volumetric water content was measured using soil moisture monitoring instruments ech2o system decagon usa at 1 h intervals during 2013 with 1 h interval six ech2o systems were installed and each consisted of five ech2o te sensors which were installed at soil depths of 10 30 60 100 and 160 cm to derive soil water contents at the 0 20 20 40 40 80 80 120 and 120 200 cm layers sensors were calibrated before installation and the soil moisture at each depth in the four soil profiles was assumed as homogenous before the experiment details given in jiang et al 2016 soil moisture content was determined gravimetrically at the same measured depths for another two replicates for each treatment at 15 day intervals using a soil auger in 2014 and 2015 soil water content n 3 was measured using a neutron moisture meter cnc503dr every 15 days at the same measured depths as in 2013 at the same time soil water content at depths of 10 and 30 cm was determined gravimetrically using a soil auger the ech2o te sensor and neutron probe were thus calibrated against gravimetrically measured soil water contents soil samples rm r 10 0 0 10 10 30 30 60 60 100 100 160 cm rm f and f 0 10 10 30 30 60 60 100 100 160 cm 3 replicates per plot were collected at 15 day interval during maize growing season with a soil corer diameter 5 cm soil samples were refrigerated at 4 c prior to subsequent analysis the soil nitrate n no3 n and ammonium n nh4 n concentrations were measured using a continuous flow analyzer aa3 seal analytical germany after kcl extraction the nitrite n no2 n was ignored in this study because most samples were lower than detection limits we used the no3 n and nh4 n concentrations in dry weight equivalent soil and bulk density to calculate the inorganic n pools in kg ha 1 for the different depths for rm the soil water storage sws and inorganic n pools were calculated by using the respective data for rm r and rm f and multiplying by the ridge to furrow ratios ridge ratio 7 10 furrow ratio 3 10 2 4 statistical analysis the mean and standard deviation were calculated for the data collected for each treatment and depth the differences between treatments and depths were analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova and the least significant difference lsd was used for multiple comparisons differences were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water content soil water storage and water use efficiency during maize growing season compared with the long term average 1957 2009 the annual precipitation was 68 6 170 0 and 63 8 mm lower in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively table 1 the precipitation during the maize growing season for the three years accounted for 85 67 and 67 of the annual precipitation which was 17 mm higher 142 4 mm and 73 6 mm lower the than long term average for 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively the e601 pan evaporation was lower in all years than the long term average for both annual and during the maize growing season the precipitation during one month and three months before sowing were lowest in 2013 approximately 20 and 43 mm lower than long term average however the evaporation for those periods was higher than usual the drought situation started before maize sowing and lasted to the end of june pre silking stage in 2013 table 1 in 2014 there was higher precipitation and lower evaporation during one month and three months before sowing significant differences between treatments in mean soil water content across all soil layers were only observed in 2013 although some soil layers were also shown the differences in 2015 table 2 in 2013 the soil water content was 10 lower in rm r than that in f at 10 cm depth while 20 higher in rm f the rm significantly increased the soil water content at depths of 30 and 60 cm by 40 and 22 at 30 cm and 43 and 47 at 60 cm for rm r and rm f respectively in addition the mean soil water contents were the lowest in 2013 across the three years for each soil layer and each treatment the extreme drought situation before sowing lasted to end of june and is the most likely reason for the observed lower soil water content in 2013 table 1 this was supported by the significantly lower maize yields in 2013 for f treatments table 3 which showed that the drought limited maize growth in 2013 but the soil water content was sufficient for maize growth in 2014 and 2015 however the use of different measurement methods for monitoring soil water contents between 2013 and 2014 2015 may also have contributed to these observed differences although both methods were calibrated against gravimetrically measured soil water contents the rm treatments increased sws during the early stage of the maize growing season compared with the f treatments the average sws in the rm treatments was 13 78 and 23 mm higher at the 3 leaf stage v3 and 23 42 and 26 mm higher at the 6 leaf stage v6 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 3 from the silking stage vt the difference between rm and f decreased and sws was higher in f following large rainfall events i e vt stage in 2013 and r3 stage in 2015 the sws at v3 and v6 stage were 277 and 160 mm lower in 2013 than that in 2014 and 150 and 187 mm lower than that in 2015 allowing for the lower precipitation during the early stage of the maize growing season in 2013 this might also be a result of the much lower sws before sowing only 215 mm on average across all treatments compared with the 464 and 387 mm of sws before sowing in 2014 and 2015 the sws in 2013 increased 117 146 mm at harvest for all treatments however in 2014 and 2015 with the higher values before sowing sws decreased by 27 and 45 mm respectively on average across all treatments fig 4 table 3 the changes in sws across the 0 200 cm soil depth between harvest and sowing sws was significantly higher in rm than that in f in 2013 while the evapotranspiration et was lower in rm table 3 no significant difference in et across the entire growing season was observed between rm and f in 2014 and 2015 however during the pre silking stage et was significantly lower in rm than in f for all three years and higher in rm during the post silking stage table 3 the effect of plastic film mulching on et was mainly to change the ratio between soil evaporation and maize transpiration li et al 2013 a higher aboveground biomass after the 6 leaf stage has been observed under plastic film mulching jiang et al 2016 and we observed higher soil water contents in rm before the silking stage fig 3 this suggests that the lower et during the pre silking stage was due to lower soil evaporation and the higher et during the post silking stage was due to higher plant transpiration in rm compared with the f treatments rm significantly increased maize grain yield table 3 with a much greater effect observed in 2013 the yield increases for rm n260 and rm n180 compared with f n260 and f n180 were 79 and 123 in 2013 23 and 25 in 2014 and 12 and 11 in 2015 respectively several studies have shown that et or the contribution of transpiration to et and water use during pre silking stage has a positive relationship with grain yield zhang et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 as observed in our study the highest yields occurred in 2014 both in rm and f associated with much higher precipitation and lower evaporation before sowing and a much higher sws before sowing fig 4 even though precipitation during growing stage was lower table 1 implying that the soil water content before sowing plays an important role in maize grain yields zhang et al 2014 also found a significant correlation between crop yield and soil water content at sowing on the loess plateau zhu et al 2015 found sws at sowing had a significant positive relationship with et during the pre silking stage we also observed higher et during the pre silking stage associated with higher sws at sowing table 3 thus the sws at sowing might increase plant transpiration during the pre silking stage and affect grain yield rm significantly increased wue which increased by 89 and 134 for rm n260 and rm n180 in 2013 12 and 36 in 2014 and 16 and 6 in 2015 respectively table 3 these finding suggest that maize grain yield was not limited by the amount of rainfall during the maize growing season or the cumulative annual rainfall but by the irregular distribution of rainfall over time and the inefficient management of rainwater in semiarid areas zhu et al 2015 many studies have indicated that increasing rainwater harvest improving soil water storage and increasing plant water uptake capacity by using different cultivation systems could optimize crop productivity in rain fed areas kahinda et al 2007 zhu et al 2015 in our study the maize grain yields were significantly higher in rm than that in f treatments table 3 previous studies have found that maize production on the loess plateau was constrained by water stress at the early stage of the maize growing season liu et al 2009 song et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 as seen in our study i e low yields in f in 2013 the drought during pre silking particularly the jointing stage postponed silking and shortened the grain filling period and thus affected final grain yield moser et al 2006 our results suggested that increases in maize yields with rm were primarily through the improved soil moisture especially during drought periods significantly higher soil water storage was observed during the v3 and v6 stages across all three years which could be explained a reduction in soil evaporation with mulching enhancing the harvesting of the small rainfall amount li et al 2001 and improving the soil water use efficiency table 3 zhu et al 2015 found that the higher soil water storage in the early growing season in mulching systems clearly promoted maize growth and development because the higher soil water storage was sufficient to provide a buffer during drought periods which usually occurred in the early growing season this could also explain the large increase in maize yield for rm in 2013 in our study although the difference in et for the entire growing season between rm and f was not consistent across all three years rm actually reduced nonproductive soil evaporation but increased productive plant transpiration during the pre silking stage as discussed above thereby improving the water use efficiency and yield table 3 in addition we found that the sws before sowing could be a key factor for maize production which could mitigate the water stress during the maize growing season i e high yields in f in 2014 with low annual rainfall this result indicated that rainfall in the fallow season may play an important role in water use in the next year thus if precipitation during fallow seasons could be effectively harvested and stored in the soil through management intervention such as using plastic film or leaving straw residue after harvest the water requirements for maize would be satisfied which is particularly important for dry years 3 2 dynamics of inorganic n content in the soil profile during the maize growing season the dynamics of soil inorganic n content in the 0 160 cm soil layer during the maize growing season for 2013 2015 in rm and f treatments are shown in figs 5 7 there were large fluctuations in soil inorganic n in the top layers 0 30 cm and the mean contents in these layers were much larger than that in deeper layers nitrate n was the main form of inorganic n accounting for 63 98 in this study table 4 the observed higher nitrate n contents in the top soil layers is consistent with other studies wang et al 2015 thorup kristensen 2001 on average the inorganic n contents in the 0 10 cm soil layer for rm r were 1 3 23 4 times and 1 5 13 1 times higher than that in other soil layers for rm n180 and rm n260 respectively across the three years high levels of inorganic n were mainly distributed in the 0 10 cm layer in the ridge with mulching as observed in other studies wang et al 2015 kettering et al 2013 wang et al 2006 there are several possible explanations for this result one is that the basal fertilizer was mainly in the surface layer and the plastic film prevented any n leaching by rainfall wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 locascio et al 1985 ruidisch et al 2013 secondly the rate at which nitrate n is transported with soil water to the soil surface layer will increase with a higher soil temperature under the plastic film mulching jiang et al 2016 and lastly that the plastic film mulching improved the soil water and temperature increasing soil microbial activity and enhancing the soil mineralization rate wang et al 2006 generally two peaks of inorganic n in rm r were observed in the 0 10 cm soil layer during the maize growing season one occurred after fertilizer application and the other during crop maturity and harvest stages the high soil inorganic n during the later stage of the maize growing season was probably explained by the low nutrient requirement for crop growth at that stage and by enhanced soil mineralization caused by the higher temperature zhang et al 2012 standford et al 1973 wang et al 2006 there was a large decrease in inorganic n content in the 0 30 cm soil layer after june in rm r because of the high maize growth and uptake of soil n during this period there were also two peaks in inorganic n in the top soil layers 0 30 cm for rm f the first was caused by fertilizer application but the peaks in june were probably caused by the lateral movement of n from the ridge due to lateral water movement however in 2013 it might also have be caused by the application of the remaining 30 of the n fertilizer a large decrease from approximately 100 mg kg 1 to less than 20 mg kg 1 occurred in the inorganic n content of the top soil layers following several rainfall events in rm f and peaks occured in the deeper soil layers 60 100 cm after storms e g following a rainfall event of 120 8 mm in 22 july 2013 especially in the treatment with the higher n application rate this is most likely because the plastic film intercepted rainfall which then flowed from the ridges into the furrows enhanced the leaching of inorganic n especially nitrate from the top to deeper soil layers wang et al 2015 kettering et al 2013 used 15n to trace the fate of soil n and found that nitrate leaching in rm mainly occurred in the furrows especially at high n application rates consistent with the observations in our study thus consideration of appropriate n application rate is needed in rm systems to avoid nitrate leaching from the furrows in f treatments the inorganic n increased following fertilizer application then decreased during maize growth for top soil layers 0 30 cm however an increase was observed during the later stage of the maize growing season in deep soil layers 60 100 cm at the higher n application rate due to n leaching during rainfall 3 3 inorganic nitrogen pool inorganic n pools in the 0 10 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers were significantly higher than in other soil layers for rm after one year of maize cultivation the two layers accounted for 26 and 41 of the total inorganic n pool 0 160 cm for rm n180 and rm n260 respectively about 40 of the total inorganic n was stored in the 60 100 cm soil layers in f treatments fig 8 however the large pool changed to the 0 60 cm soil layer in rm and to 0 20 cm and 100 160 cm soil layers in f after two and three years of maize cultivation figs 9 and 10 about 60 of the total inorganic n was present in the top soil layers 0 60 cm after three years in rm treatments the results indicate that soil inorganic n is likely to accumulate in top soil layers in rm but in deeper soil layers in f implying that rm would reduce nitrate leaching during the maize growing season ruidisch et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 locascio et al 1985 however as we stated above nitrate leaching from the furrows in rm at the high n application rate is of concern which may cause nitrate accumulation in deep soil layers in loess soil zhou et al 2016 in addition the higher nitrate n accumulated in the top soils may lead to higher n2o emission in rm he et al 2018 inorganic soil n pools were initially small 200 kg n ha 1 but under rm increased significantly by two and three times for rm n180 and rm n260 respectively after three years of maize cultivation fig 11 thus rm can enhance inorganic n accumulation in the soil profile especially at high n application rates liu et al 2014a kettering et al 2013 the high inorganic n accumulation in our study was probably caused by higher soil mineralization in rm zhang et al 2012 hai et al 2015 however several studies have highlighted the many differences which may occur between the mulching system compared with the traditional system such as soil temperature water content plant uptake microbial activity mineralization rate and soil organic carbon content zhang et al 2012 liu et al 2014a liu et al 2014c jiang et al 2016 these differences may interact to stimulate the release and accumulation of inorganic n in soil under rm however the mechanism is not clear so far the total inorganic n pools in f were a slight decrease for f n180 and a slight increase for f n260 after the three years of maize cultivation the soil water in f was not limiting in 2014 and 2015 which was good for plant growth and thus increased plant n uptake or caused n leaching and may have reduced the soil n accumulation the n application rate of 180 kg n ha 1 was as recommended for traditional maize cultivation in the study area which was proven to be appropriate by our study with a larger partial factor productivity pfp for rm n180 ranging from 75 to 91 the treatments at the higher n application rate of 260 kg n ha 1 had lower pfp values even under rm across the three years with the increase in the inorganic n pool the pfp values in rm increased in 2014 but decreased in 2015 cui et al 2008 showed that residual soil nitrate in the top 100 cm of the soil profile should be maintained within the range of 87 180 kg n ha 1 for high yield maize production this indicated that although maize grain yield has a positive relationship with n input high n input or high residual soil n could reduce n use efficiency and limit the grain yield liu et al 2017a b probably also being related to soil organic carbon depletion except for in the f n180 treatment the ratio of inorganic n to tn increased sharply after three years of maize cultivation with the largest increase occurring in the rm n260 treatment 1 7 7 8 table 4 in the rm n180 treatment although inorganic n increased the proportion as nitrate n decreased after two and three years cultivation these results suggest a higher nitrate leaching risk in rm n260 however although rm n 180 resulted in higher pfp value and lower nitrate leaching risk the high inorganic n accumulation in the soil profile after two three years cultivation may lead to subsequent reductions in grain yield it may also pose threats to the environment increasing n leaching and greenhouse gas emissions or cause the depletion of soil organic carbon liu et al 2013 thus negatively affecting agriculture sustainability consequently our results showed that n application rate of 260 kg n ha 1 was excessive in rm and the recommended n application rate of 180 kg n ha 1 for maize under traditional cultivation in this rain fed area may not be suitable for rm liu et al 2014b found that an n application rate of 110 kg n ha 1 could sustain high grain yields in a fully mulched ridge and furrow system therefore further studies to trace the fate of applied fertilizer n investigate the soil mineralization and derive recommendations for n application rates under rm systems are warranted 4 conclusion implementing an rm mulched system compared with traditional flat cultivation significantly changed the soil water and inorganic n distribution over the 3 year study period compared with f rm improved the soil water storage significantly during the pre silking stage by decreasing the soil evaporation and increasing the plant transpiration which improved the water use efficiency and contributed to enhanced grain yield higher sws at sowing played an important role in maize production in rain fed agriculture on the loess plateau thus treatments such as plastic film mulching or straw residue left after harvest may be helpful in harvesting and storing rainfall in fallow season for subsequent use by the following crop the soil inorganic n in rm accumulated in the top soil layer 0 10 cm under the mulched ridge probably because of reduced n leaching increased soil mineralization and lateral n movement from the furrow to the ridge this was associated with a decrease in nitrate leaching to deeper soil layers however the nitrate leaching from the furrow was observed in the rm system at the higher n application rate inorganic n accumulation under the rm system increased by two to three times after three years of maize cultivation which may be explained by enhanced soil mineralization however the mechanism for soil inorganic n accumulation under plastic film mulching systems is not clear with potential interactions between a number of factors and soil processes and further study is required overall our result showed that rm n180 could obtain high grain yield with low risk of nitrate leaching after one year of cultivation but after three years of cultivation was associated with increased inorganic n accumulation in the soil profile thus the recommended n application rate for traditional maize cultivation in this region may not be suitable under rm development of new recommendations for n fertilizer application rates under rm are needed to ensure the sustainability of rain fed agriculture on the chinese loess plateau acknowledgments this study was funded by the national key r d program

scheduling 1 introduction grain sorghum is a drought tolerant crop that is suitable for rain fed and deficit irrigation due to its physiological adaptability to short term water stress assefa et al 2010 garrity et al 1982a garrity et al 1982b peacock 1982 although grain sorghum can withstand prolonged periods of water stress such tolerance comes at the expense of reduced yield assefa et al 2010 peacock 1982 delineating crop reproductive responses under water stressed field conditions is critical to the adoption of management strategies that optimize yield under deficit irrigation historically irrigation practices on the texas high plains have been related to irrigation well capacities during peak demand periods but due to declining well capacities and water district restrictions historical irrigation practices are no longer viable because irrigation helps mitigate production risks associated with often un predicable in season precipitation in semi arid zones while improving crop quality and value wagner 2012 research to understand crop responses to the amount and timing of irrigation is essential in a review of previous research on the high plains staggenborg et al 2008 reported that july precipitation is most beneficial for sorghum grain yield which coincides with the reproductive period of sorghum in this region the authors specified that in a rain fed cropping system grain sorghum yields increased 0 1 0 2 mg ha 1 for each cm precipitation received in july regardless of precipitation timing water availability at critical growth stages is often of greater importance than annual precipitation larfarge et al 2002 in anticipation of widespread shortages of water for irrigation garrity et al 1982a b predicted that irrigated agriculture was entering the age of management whereby water deficits could not be avoided but should be anticipated and managed as producers adopt conservation measures driven by limited water supplies and social pressures irrigation management strategies that concentrate water during critical growth stages or employ supplemental irrigation rather than traditional fully irrigated practices could potentially stabilize crop production and an agriculturally driven economy for an extended period bordovsky et al 2011 a promising management strategy for improving water use efficiencies is deficit irrigation which attempts to optimize the use of irrigation water and precipitation english 1990 traditionally deficit irrigation entailed irrigation at a fraction of what the crop would use if water were not limited howell et al 2007 however a more intensified management approach considers the dynamics of crop water use throughout the growing season vadez et al 2013 an optimally managed deficit irrigation strategy may also depend on the amount and depth distribution of water stored in the soil profile at the time of planting accordingly two important components of managed deficit irrigation are i the attempt to minimize evaporative losses of water directly from the soil which occurs during the early part of the cropping season when the fraction of soil covered by the crop is small and ii to concentrate irrigation at stages of crop growth critical to determining potential yield these two components must be considered together not independently as increases in yield may not always be achieved through maximization of water extraction by the plants while water stress at any stage can reduce sorghum yield water stress during the reproductive stage of sorghum is the most detrimental

et al 2001 maman et al 2004 understanding the effects of the magnitude of water use during these crop developmental phases on grain production is essential to evaluate and incorporate water

results and discussion 3 1 growing season conditions environmental conditions varied considerably among the three study years with near normal conditions in 2010 above average temperatures and abnormally low seasonal precipitation in both 2011 and 2012 in 2010 annual precipitation was 483 mm slightly above the 73 year 1939 2012 mean precipitation of 463 mm at bushland tx annual precipitation was substantially lower than the 73 year mean in 2011 and 2012 which totaled 170 and 213 mm respectively fig 1 of significance in season precipitation received during the growing season of all experimental years was below the 73 year seasonal mean of 249 mm fig 1 of the long term mean seasonal precipitation received at bushland tx 26 64 mm is received during july of the 180 5 mm of precipitation received during the growing season in 2010 51 occurred in the month of july coinciding with the critical growth period precipitation received after july of 2010 was nominal resulting in below average seasonal precipitation growing season precipitation in 2011 and 2012 totaled 61 2 and 34 5 mm respectively in addition to minimal growing season precipitation in 2010 and 2011 winter and spring precipitation was inadequate to refill soil profiles in all study years the maximum daily temperatures from may 15 through september 15 exceeded the 73 year mean maximum daily temperature 31 6 c for more than 50 of the growing days 64 in 2010 83 in 2011 and 77 in 2012 fig 2 in 2011 there were 46 days during the growing season that had daily maximum temperatures exceeding 38 c 22 of those days occurred between growing point differentiation and half bloom seasonal daily maximum air temperatures were milder in 2010 although from emergence through vegetative development there were 13 days with temperatures that exceeded 35 c after growing point differentiation in 2010 maximum daily temperatures approached the 73 year mean maximum temperature 35 c fig 2 maiti 1996 defined optimum growing temperatures for sorghum as 21 35 c for germination 26 34 for vegetative growth and development and 25 28 c for reproductive growth in 2011 the duration between growth stages was longer than in 2010 and 2012 likely due to elevated temperature on growth and development fig 2 while seasonal temperatures in 2012 were also greater than the long term mean the mean daily maximum temperature between growing point differentiation and half bloom was 36 c and as a result the duration between these stages was eleven days shorter than 2011 table 1 as a result of extreme environmental conditions in 2011 cumulative et0 during the growing season was greatest that year 854 mm fig 3 whereas it did not greatly differ between 2010 and 2012 which totaled 624 and 638 mm respectively in 2010 and 2012 greater accumulation of gddc was achieved during the vegetative stage compared with 2011 because the duration between planting and five leaf stage was an average of six days longer than the same period in 2011 table 1 elevated temperatures during the vegetative stage in 2011 resulted in a more rapid progression of the vegetative period and thus fewer gddc however crop development under both di and mdi treatments in 2011 was delayed due to elevated temperatures between growing point differentiation through half bloom compared with sorghum under fi which reached half bloom stage nine days earlier as a result fewer gddc were accumulated under fi than either deficit irrigated treatments machado and paulsen 2001 reported that elevated temperatures do not significantly affect yield when the crop has sufficient water but the combination of high temperatures and limited water negatively influence crop development crauford and peacock 1993 donatelli et al 1992 blum 2005 prasad et al 2008 developmental delay in sorghum often occurs under water stress resulting in increased cumulative gddc donatelli et al 1992 as was observed in 2011 under di and mdi table 1 the earlier planting date in 2012 resulted in the half bloom to soft dough period occurring two weeks earlier than in 2011 consequently the crop had to tolerate a longer period of elevated temperatures during grain fill in 2012 while optimum planting dates appear to be regional and year specific a planting date targeted to avoid heat stress during anthesis has usually been a successful strategy peacock 1982 pauli et al 1964 3 2 et and water use plant available water was evaluated within the root zone to 1 6 m because mean change in water contents from 1 6 to 2 2 m was not significantly different from zero p 0 210 for all irrigation strategies and because drainage below 2 2 m was negligible bell 2014 the effect of irrigation treatment on stored soil water depended on the cropping year p 0 001 in 2010 reduced irrigation under both deficit irrigation treatments resulted in additional soil water extracted to 1 6 m however a reduction in irrigation under both deficit irrigation treatments did not result in significantly less plant available water in the profile at harvest compared with fi as surmised by the change in stored soil water from emergence to harvest table 2 reduced seasonal irrigation under di also coincided with additional soil water extraction under di in 2011 resulting in less plant available water in the profile compared with fi in 2012 however seasonal change in stored soil water was comparatively large 105 117 mm with no significant differences among irrigation treatments 15 mm among all years and irrigation treatments seasonal change in stored soil water contributed 38 0 of et as such maintaining 50 managed allowable depletion within the soil profile resulted in precipitation and irrigation still being the primary components of et plant available water to 1 6 m depth at emergence was significantly different among years p 0 009 with 2011 exhibiting the lowest initial soil water contents table 2 while there were no differences in plant available water among treatments in 2010 and 2011 p 0 558 in 2012 the average fi plots had marginally greater 41 mm p 0 051 initial soil water contents compared with di and mdi table 2 while the change in stored soil water did not differ between mdi and fi the cumulative et was more than 100 mm less under mdi and di as a function of reduced irrigation table 3 seasonal irrigation depths were greatest in 2011 for all irrigation strategies compared with 2010 and 2012 as a combined result of low paw at emergence and high cumulative et 0 885 7 mm fig 3 during the growing season table 3 inspection of the actual et et 0 and fao 56 predicted kc etc et 0 ratios of crop water use to et 0 for fi prior to growing point differentiation fig 4 demonstrates that predicted water use kc et 0 with kc 0 3 allen et al 1998 underestimated actual water use et in all years of the study differences in et and etc prior to canopy closure likely arise from an underestimation of evaporation by fao 56 especially following irrigation and precipitation events tolk et al 2015 which was reflective in etc greater than kc fig 4 following growing point differentiation di had a lower etc compared with mdi which is characterized in fig 4 as the intersection of the water use curves of mdi and di in 2012 paw for all irrigation strategies declined at a steady rate and never recovered to pre emergence levels 3 3 grain yield response to irrigation treatments mean grain yields of fi plots exceeded yields of mdi and di in all three years p 0 001 fig 5 table 4 the influence of deficit irrigation strategy on yield was year dependent p 0 001 mean grain yields of mdi were greater than yields of di in all years although only significantly greater in 2010 and 2012 p 0 009 and p 0 001 respectively while yields of mdi were 1 0 1 3 mg ha 1 greater than di in 2010 and 2011 respectively the mdi yield 4 1 mg ha 1 was 237 greater than that of di 1 7 mg ha 1 in 2012 fig 5 there were no significant differences between yields of the same irrigation treatment in 2010 and 2011 p 0 283 in 2012 yields of all irrigation treatments were significantly lower than yields of previous years p 0 001 the 2012 fi yield was comparable to the 2010 and 2011 deficit treatment irrigated yields yield reductions associated with water deficits at different growth stages can be related to the deviations in the magnitude of yield components specifically plant density tiller production areal density of panicles panicle mass number of seeds per panicle spp and average seed mass table 5 variability in plant density among years 10 0 14 0 m 2 was likely due to reduced paw at emergence in 2011 as a result of extreme conditions in 2011 and seedling mortality and greater seeding rates in 2012 however there were no consistent trends among irrigation treatments while plant density was lower under di in 2010 and 2011 compared with other treatments p 0 001 irrigation treatment effect did not significantly influence plant density in 2012 p 0 895 in 2011 there was significantly greater plant density under fi compared with mdi p 0 043 although there were no differences between mdi and di p 0 473 and fi and di p 0 362 while increased plant density can potentially increase yield potential there were no consistent relationships between plant density and the aerial density of panicles the areal density of panicles ranged from 13 0 to 19 0 m 2 during the three study years each year the greatest panicle density was achieved under fi p 0 001 with the greatest panicle density for all treatments occurring in 2011 table 5 in sorghum tillering enables plants to increase panicle production and thereby regulate yield under varying levels of available water environmental stress or plant population densities areal density of tillers ranged from 2 9 to 7 2 m 2 during the three study years table 5 while the greatest numbers of tillers were observed in 2011 6 0 7 2 m 2 there were not any significant differences between fertile tillers in 2010 and 2011 for fi and mdi treatments p 0 339 in all years di produced the fewest fertile tillers however in comparison to all seasons the areal density of tillers was significantly lowest in 2012 for all treatments p 0 001 in 2012 there were not any fertile tillers produced under mdi and di and those produced under fi were the lowest compared with the other years for this irrigation treatment 0 409 m 2 while results suggest suppressed tillering under greater plant populations in agreement with the results of jones and johnson 1991 it is likely that fewer tillers were produced under elevated water stress in 2012 because the available water was used by the crop to maintain the primary plant seeds per panicle spp were significantly greater p 0 001 under fi for all years although the effect of deficit irrigation strategies di and mdi on spp was year dependent mirroring grain yield spp under all irrigation treatments were greatest in 2010 compared with 2011 and 2012 p 0 001 additional precipitation and near normal temperatures in 2010 during the critical growth period likely facilitated improved growing conditions which resulted in greater spp compared with 2011 and 2012 for all irrigation treatments while exposure to extreme high temperatures for periods longer than ten days between vegetative development and growing point differentiation can result in decreased seed set prasad et al 2008 chowdhury and wardlaw 1978 water stress between half bloom and soft dough can inhibit pollen development pollination of the ovule and abortion of fertilized ovules assefa et al 2010 gerik et al 2003 mcwilliams 2003 elevated temperatures at growing point differentiation of 2011 and 2012 are likely responsible for the lower spp in these years as implied by the reduction in spp under fi compared with 2010 fig 5 table 5 water stress between half bloom and soft dough was likely responsible for reduced spp under mdi and di compared with fi most notably in 2012 spp under mdi and di was 30 and 74 respectively of spp under fi fig 5 table 5 in 2011 and 2012 grain yield was correlated to spp r2 0 874 p 0 002 and yield increased with increasing spp fig 5 however in 2010 the spp and yield relationships were inconsistent fig 5 with weak correlations for fi and mdi r2 0 423 p 0 257 under mdi and fi it is likely that the crop was approaching maximum yield potential for the respective irrigation level because of sink source limitations irrigation significantly influenced seed mass in each year of the study however there were no consistent trends with respect to irrigation treatment effect on seed mass table 5 seed mass and yield for all irrigation treatments and years were not found to be correlated r2 0 641 p 0 063 bell 2014 inconsistent differences in seed mass in conjunction with poor correlations in seed mass and yield relationships suggest that water use between growing point differentiation and half bloom had more impact on total spp and thus grain yield compared with water use during the vegetative or ripening stages as also identified by numerous sources assefa et al 2010 maman et al 2004 ockerby et al 2001 crauford and peacock 1993 seed mass of di sorghum was significantly lower p 0 001 than seed mass of fi sorghum in 2010 and 2012 reduction in seed mass under di is reflective of decreased soil moisture available for grain fill during soft dough compared with mdi and fi while it has been observed that spp is the governing component in sorghum grain yield tolk et al 2013 van oosterom and hammer 2008 crauford and peacock 1993 seed mass has the potential to stabilize yield by compensating for reductions in spp tolk et al 2013 tolk and schwartz 2017 however in this study we did not have conclusive evidence of this trend bell 2014 total aboveground biomass ranged from 5 8 to 18 8 mg ha 1 oven dry basis during the three study years table 4 greatest aboveground biomass production occurred under fi which was significantly greater compared with di and mdi in all years p 0 001 aboveground biomass under di and mdi were not significantly different in 2010 and 2011 p 0 947 measured aboveground biomass in 2012 was significantly lower under all treatments compared with the two prior years in addition to significant differences between all irrigation treatments p 0 001 there were no significant differences in hi among irrigation strategies in 2010 and 2011 p 0 297 however hi was significantly lower 0 26 under di compared with mdi hi 0 41 and fi hi 0 46 in 2012 p 0 006 table 4 blum 2009 noted that increased hi in grain sorghum is directly related to increased wue due to optimal distribution of available water as evident under mdi and fi decreased hi and seed mass under di in 2012 were a factor of water stress and aborted seeds during anthesis in this study as also found by crauford and peacock 1993 water use efficiencies can be lower under water stress as a result of reduced grain yields in semi arid environments however in a review of irrigated agriculture howell 2001 discussed irrigation as an effective strategy for increasing grain yields in water limited environments but he further noted discussed that irrigation must be carefully managed to achieve greater wue consequently it is not surprising that wue of di sorghum was significantly lower than the wue of fi sorghum in 2010 and 2012 p 0 001 however the wue of mdi was only significantly lower than that of fi in 2012 p 0 001 demonstrating that limiting water did not reduce wue in two of the three years figs 2 6 as observed by hsiao and acevedo 1974 reductions in wue can occur when water resources are not optimized under deficit irrigation in 2011 there were not any differences in wue among all irrigation strategies p 0 647 although yield variability among the replications was large during this year the three year mean water use of mdi was only 29 mm greater than that of di increased water use under mdi was accompanied by a 1 6 mg ha 1 greater mean yield compared with di for the incremental water use and yield under mdi compared with di this translates into a mean wue of 3 06 9 84 kg m 3 for these three years throughout the three year period the incremental yield increase per unit of additional water used under fi compared with mdi resulted in a smaller mean wue 1 9 kg m 3 fig 6 as shown by howell et al 2007 when precipitation is below average di poses the greatest reduction in wue and greatest risk of yield reductions due to the collective effect of reduced irrigation and precipitation in this study the 29 mm increase in water use under mdi between growing point differentiation and half bloom compared with di lessened the effect of negligible precipitation in 2012 on yield consequently concentrating water during the critical growth periods between growing point differentiation and half bloom can improve wue which is especially important under conditions of limited water due to reduced well capacity and or reduced precipitation 4 conclusions in all years yield under fi was significantly greater than yield under di and mdi but elimination of an early season irrigation event under mdi during the vegetative stage provided the opportunity to increase irrigation during the reproductive stages from growing point differentiation to half bloom conversely di applied at a fraction of fi reduced the irrigation applied between growing point differentiation and maturity resulting in aborted ovules and or decreased pollination increased irrigation during this period resulted in significantly greater spp under mdi compared to di in 2011 and 2012 of significance water use predicted with the fao 56 model underestimated fi water use et in all years of the study prior to growing point differentiation possibly resulting in large soil water evaporation losses under sparse canopy cover consequently increased evaporative losses during vegetative development where at the expense of crop water use and yield potential during later reproductive stages while fi provides the greatest opportunity to reduce production risks through increased yield if irrigation water is limiting mdi provides less risk than di due to its ability to maintain yield and wue as was evident in 2012 as such concentrating irrigation water during the critical growth stage resulted in a greater yield compared with irrigation scheduling based on a fraction of full irrigation acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge mr grant johnson usda ars

restrictions historical irrigation practices are no longer viable because irrigation helps mitigate production risks associated with often un predicable in season precipitation in semi arid zones while improving crop quality and value wagner 2012 research to understand crop responses to the amount and timing of irrigation is essential in a review of previous research on the high plains staggenborg et al 2008 reported that july precipitation is most beneficial for sorghum grain yield which coincides with the reproductive period of sorghum in this region the authors specified that in a rain fed cropping system grain sorghum yields increased 0 1 0 2 mg ha 1 for each cm precipitation received in july regardless of precipitation timing water availability at critical growth stages is often of greater importance than annual precipitation larfarge et al 2002 in anticipation of widespread shortages of water for irrigation garrity et al 1982a b predicted that irrigated agriculture was entering the age of management whereby water deficits could not be avoided but should be anticipated and managed as producers adopt conservation measures driven by limited water supplies and social pressures irrigation management strategies that concentrate water during critical growth stages or employ supplemental irrigation rather than traditional fully irrigated practices could potentially stabilize crop production and an agriculturally driven economy for an extended period bordovsky et al 2011 a promising management strategy for improving water use efficiencies is deficit irrigation which attempts to optimize the use of irrigation water and precipitation english 1990 traditionally deficit irrigation entailed irrigation at a fraction of what the crop would use if water were not limited howell et al 2007 however a more intensified management approach considers the dynamics of crop water use throughout the growing season vadez et al 2013 an optimally managed deficit irrigation strategy may also depend on the amount and depth distribution of water stored in the soil profile at the time of planting accordingly two important components of managed deficit irrigation are i the attempt to minimize evaporative losses of water directly from the soil which occurs during the early part of the cropping season when the fraction of soil covered by the crop is small and ii to concentrate irrigation at stages of crop growth critical to determining potential yield these two components must be considered together not independently as increases in yield may not always be achieved through maximization of water extraction by the plants while water stress at any stage can reduce sorghum yield water stress during the reproductive stage of sorghum is the most detrimental

et al 2001 maman et al 2004 understanding the effects of the magnitude of water use during these crop developmental phases on grain production is essential to evaluate and incorporate water

results and discussion 3 1 growing season conditions environmental conditions varied considerably among the three study years with near normal conditions in 2010 above average temperatures and abnormally low seasonal precipitation in both 2011 and 2012 in 2010 annual precipitation was 483 mm slightly above the 73 year 1939 2012 mean precipitation of 463 mm at bushland tx annual precipitation was substantially lower than the 73 year mean in 2011 and 2012 which totaled 170 and 213 mm respectively fig 1 of significance in season precipitation received during the growing season of all experimental years was below the 73 year seasonal mean of 249 mm fig 1 of the long term mean seasonal precipitation received at bushland tx 26 64 mm is received during july of the 180 5 mm of precipitation received during the growing season in 2010 51 occurred in the month of july coinciding with the critical growth period precipitation received after july of 2010 was nominal resulting in below average seasonal precipitation growing season precipitation in 2011 and 2012 totaled 61 2 and 34 5 mm respectively in addition to minimal growing season precipitation in 2010 and 2011 winter and spring precipitation was inadequate to refill soil profiles in all study years the maximum daily temperatures from may 15 through september 15 exceeded the 73 year mean maximum daily temperature 31 6 c for more than 50 of the growing days 64 in 2010 83 in 2011 and 77 in 2012 fig 2 in 2011 there were 46 days during the growing season that had daily maximum temperatures exceeding 38 c 22 of those days occurred between growing point differentiation and half bloom seasonal daily maximum air temperatures were milder in 2010 although from emergence through vegetative development there were 13 days with temperatures that exceeded 35 c after growing point differentiation in 2010 maximum daily temperatures approached the 73 year mean maximum temperature 35 c fig 2 maiti 1996 defined optimum growing temperatures for sorghum as 21 35 c for germination 26 34 for vegetative growth and development and 25 28 c for reproductive growth in 2011 the duration between growth stages was longer than in 2010 and 2012 likely due to elevated temperature on growth and development fig 2 while seasonal temperatures in 2012 were also greater than the long term mean the mean daily maximum temperature between growing point differentiation and half bloom was 36 c and as a result the duration between these stages was eleven days shorter than 2011 table 1 as a result of extreme environmental conditions in 2011 cumulative et0 during the growing season was greatest that year 854 mm fig 3 whereas it did not greatly differ between 2010 and 2012 which totaled 624 and 638 mm respectively in 2010 and 2012 greater accumulation of gddc was achieved during the vegetative stage compared with 2011 because the duration between planting and five leaf stage was an average of six days longer than the same period in 2011 table 1 elevated temperatures during the vegetative stage in 2011 resulted in a more rapid progression of the vegetative period and thus fewer gddc however crop development under both di and mdi treatments in 2011 was delayed due to elevated temperatures between growing point differentiation through half bloom compared with sorghum under fi which reached half bloom stage nine days earlier as a result fewer gddc were accumulated under fi than either deficit irrigated treatments machado and paulsen 2001 reported that elevated temperatures do not significantly affect yield when the crop has sufficient water but the combination of high temperatures and limited water negatively influence crop development crauford and peacock 1993 donatelli et al 1992 blum 2005 prasad et al 2008 developmental delay in sorghum often occurs under water stress resulting in increased cumulative gddc donatelli et al 1992 as was observed in 2011 under di and mdi table 1 the earlier planting date in 2012 resulted in the half bloom to soft dough period occurring two weeks earlier than in 2011 consequently the crop had to tolerate a longer period of elevated temperatures during grain fill in 2012 while optimum planting dates appear to be regional and year specific a planting date targeted to avoid heat stress during anthesis has usually been a successful strategy peacock 1982 pauli et al 1964 3 2 et and water use plant available water was evaluated within the root zone to 1 6 m because mean change in water contents from 1 6 to 2 2 m was not significantly different from zero p 0 210 for all irrigation strategies and because drainage below 2 2 m was negligible bell 2014 the effect of irrigation treatment on stored soil water depended on the cropping year p 0 001 in 2010 reduced irrigation under both deficit irrigation treatments resulted in additional soil water extracted to 1 6 m however a reduction in irrigation under both deficit irrigation treatments did not result in significantly less plant available water in the profile at harvest compared with fi as surmised by the change in stored soil water from emergence to harvest table 2 reduced seasonal irrigation under di also coincided with additional soil water extraction under di in 2011 resulting in less plant available water in the profile compared with fi in 2012 however seasonal change in stored soil water was comparatively large 105 117 mm with no significant differences among irrigation treatments 15 mm among all years and irrigation treatments seasonal change in stored soil water contributed 38 0 of et as such maintaining 50 managed allowable depletion within the soil profile resulted in precipitation and irrigation still being the primary components of et plant available water to 1 6 m depth at emergence was significantly different among years p 0 009 with 2011 exhibiting the lowest initial soil water contents table 2 while there were no differences in plant available water among treatments in 2010 and 2011 p 0 558 in 2012 the average fi plots had marginally greater 41 mm p 0 051 initial soil water contents compared with di and mdi table 2 while the change in stored soil water did not differ between mdi and fi the cumulative et was more than 100 mm less under mdi and di as a function of reduced irrigation table 3 seasonal irrigation depths were greatest in 2011 for all irrigation strategies compared with 2010 and 2012 as a combined result of low paw at emergence and high cumulative et 0 885 7 mm fig 3 during the growing season table 3 inspection of the actual et et 0 and fao 56 predicted kc etc et 0 ratios of crop water use to et 0 for fi prior to growing point differentiation fig 4 demonstrates that predicted water use kc et 0 with kc 0 3 allen et al 1998 underestimated actual water use et in all years of the study differences in et and etc prior to canopy closure likely arise from an underestimation of evaporation by fao 56 especially following irrigation and precipitation events tolk et al 2015 which was reflective in etc greater than kc fig 4 following growing point differentiation di had a lower etc compared with mdi which is characterized in fig 4 as the intersection of the water use curves of mdi and di in 2012 paw for all irrigation strategies declined at a steady rate and never recovered to pre emergence levels 3 3 grain yield response to irrigation treatments mean grain yields of fi plots exceeded yields of mdi and di in all three years p 0 001 fig 5 table 4 the influence of deficit irrigation strategy on yield was year dependent p 0 001 mean grain yields of mdi were greater than yields of di in all years although only significantly greater in 2010 and 2012 p 0 009 and p 0 001 respectively while yields of mdi were 1 0 1 3 mg ha 1 greater than di in 2010 and 2011 respectively the mdi yield 4 1 mg ha 1 was 237 greater than that of di 1 7 mg ha 1 in 2012 fig 5 there were no significant differences between yields of the same irrigation treatment in 2010 and 2011 p 0 283 in 2012 yields of all irrigation treatments were significantly lower than yields of previous years p 0 001 the 2012 fi yield was comparable to the 2010 and 2011 deficit treatment irrigated yields yield reductions associated with water deficits at different growth stages can be related to the deviations in the magnitude of yield components specifically plant density tiller production areal density of panicles panicle mass number of seeds per panicle spp and average seed mass table 5 variability in plant density among years 10 0 14 0 m 2 was likely due to reduced paw at emergence in 2011 as a result of extreme conditions in 2011 and seedling mortality and greater seeding rates in 2012 however there were no consistent trends among irrigation treatments while plant density was lower under di in 2010 and 2011 compared with other treatments p 0 001 irrigation treatment effect did not significantly influence plant density in 2012 p 0 895 in 2011 there was significantly greater plant density under fi compared with mdi p 0 043 although there were no differences between mdi and di p 0 473 and fi and di p 0 362 while increased plant density can potentially increase yield potential there were no consistent relationships between plant density and the aerial density of panicles the areal density of panicles ranged from 13 0 to 19 0 m 2 during the three study years each year the greatest panicle density was achieved under fi p 0 001 with the greatest panicle density for all treatments occurring in 2011 table 5 in sorghum tillering enables plants to increase panicle production and thereby regulate yield under varying levels of available water environmental stress or plant population densities areal density of tillers ranged from 2 9 to 7 2 m 2 during the three study years table 5 while the greatest numbers of tillers were observed in 2011 6 0 7 2 m 2 there were not any significant differences between fertile tillers in 2010 and 2011 for fi and mdi treatments p 0 339 in all years di produced the fewest fertile tillers however in comparison to all seasons the areal density of tillers was significantly lowest in 2012 for all treatments p 0 001 in 2012 there were not any fertile tillers produced under mdi and di and those produced under fi were the lowest compared with the other years for this irrigation treatment 0 409 m 2 while results suggest suppressed tillering under greater plant populations in agreement with the results of jones and johnson 1991 it is likely that fewer tillers were produced under elevated water stress in 2012 because the available water was used by the crop to maintain the primary plant seeds per panicle spp were significantly greater p 0 001 under fi for all years although the effect of deficit irrigation strategies di and mdi on spp was year dependent mirroring grain yield spp under all irrigation treatments were greatest in 2010 compared with 2011 and 2012 p 0 001 additional precipitation and near normal temperatures in 2010 during the critical growth period likely facilitated improved growing conditions which resulted in greater spp compared with 2011 and 2012 for all irrigation treatments while exposure to extreme high temperatures for periods longer than ten days between vegetative development and growing point differentiation can result in decreased seed set prasad et al 2008 chowdhury and wardlaw 1978 water stress between half bloom and soft dough can inhibit pollen development pollination of the ovule and abortion of fertilized ovules assefa et al 2010 gerik et al 2003 mcwilliams 2003 elevated temperatures at growing point differentiation of 2011 and 2012 are likely responsible for the lower spp in these years as implied by the reduction in spp under fi compared with 2010 fig 5 table 5 water stress between half bloom and soft dough was likely responsible for reduced spp under mdi and di compared with fi most notably in 2012 spp under mdi and di was 30 and 74 respectively of spp under fi fig 5 table 5 in 2011 and 2012 grain yield was correlated to spp r2 0 874 p 0 002 and yield increased with increasing spp fig 5 however in 2010 the spp and yield relationships were inconsistent fig 5 with weak correlations for fi and mdi r2 0 423 p 0 257 under mdi and fi it is likely that the crop was approaching maximum yield potential for the respective irrigation level because of sink source limitations irrigation significantly influenced seed mass in each year of the study however there were no consistent trends with respect to irrigation treatment effect on seed mass table 5 seed mass and yield for all irrigation treatments and years were not found to be correlated r2 0 641 p 0 063 bell 2014 inconsistent differences in seed mass in conjunction with poor correlations in seed mass and yield relationships suggest that water use between growing point differentiation and half bloom had more impact on total spp and thus grain yield compared with water use during the vegetative or ripening stages as also identified by numerous sources assefa et al 2010 maman et al 2004 ockerby et al 2001 crauford and peacock 1993 seed mass of di sorghum was significantly lower p 0 001 than seed mass of fi sorghum in 2010 and 2012 reduction in seed mass under di is reflective of decreased soil moisture available for grain fill during soft dough compared with mdi and fi while it has been observed that spp is the governing component in sorghum grain yield tolk et al 2013 van oosterom and hammer 2008 crauford and peacock 1993 seed mass has the potential to stabilize yield by compensating for reductions in spp tolk et al 2013 tolk and schwartz 2017 however in this study we did not have conclusive evidence of this trend bell 2014 total aboveground biomass ranged from 5 8 to 18 8 mg ha 1 oven dry basis during the three study years table 4 greatest aboveground biomass production occurred under fi which was significantly greater compared with di and mdi in all years p 0 001 aboveground biomass under di and mdi were not significantly different in 2010 and 2011 p 0 947 measured aboveground biomass in 2012 was significantly lower under all treatments compared with the two prior years in addition to significant differences between all irrigation treatments p 0 001 there were no significant differences in hi among irrigation strategies in 2010 and 2011 p 0 297 however hi was significantly lower 0 26 under di compared with mdi hi 0 41 and fi hi 0 46 in 2012 p 0 006 table 4 blum 2009 noted that increased hi in grain sorghum is directly related to increased wue due to optimal distribution of available water as evident under mdi and fi decreased hi and seed mass under di in 2012 were a factor of water stress and aborted seeds during anthesis in this study as also found by crauford and peacock 1993 water use efficiencies can be lower under water stress as a result of reduced grain yields in semi arid environments however in a review of irrigated agriculture howell 2001 discussed irrigation as an effective strategy for increasing grain yields in water limited environments but he further noted discussed that irrigation must be carefully managed to achieve greater wue consequently it is not surprising that wue of di sorghum was significantly lower than the wue of fi sorghum in 2010 and 2012 p 0 001 however the wue of mdi was only significantly lower than that of fi in 2012 p 0 001 demonstrating that limiting water did not reduce wue in two of the three years figs 2 6 as observed by hsiao and acevedo 1974 reductions in wue can occur when water resources are not optimized under deficit irrigation in 2011 there were not any differences in wue among all irrigation strategies p 0 647 although yield variability among the replications was large during this year the three year mean water use of mdi was only 29 mm greater than that of di increased water use under mdi was accompanied by a 1 6 mg ha 1 greater mean yield compared with di for the incremental water use and yield under mdi compared with di this translates into a mean wue of 3 06 9 84 kg m 3 for these three years throughout the three year period the incremental yield increase per unit of additional water used under fi compared with mdi resulted in a smaller mean wue 1 9 kg m 3 fig 6 as shown by howell et al 2007 when precipitation is below average di poses the greatest reduction in wue and greatest risk of yield reductions due to the collective effect of reduced irrigation and precipitation in this study the 29 mm increase in water use under mdi between growing point differentiation and half bloom compared with di lessened the effect of negligible precipitation in 2012 on yield consequently concentrating water during the critical growth periods between growing point differentiation and half bloom can improve wue which is especially important under conditions of limited water due to reduced well capacity and or reduced precipitation 4 conclusions in all years yield under fi was significantly greater than yield under di and mdi but elimination of an early season irrigation event under mdi during the vegetative stage provided the opportunity to increase irrigation during the reproductive stages from growing point differentiation to half bloom conversely di applied at a fraction of fi reduced the irrigation applied between growing point differentiation and maturity resulting in aborted ovules and or decreased pollination increased irrigation during this period resulted in significantly greater spp under mdi compared to di in 2011 and 2012 of significance water use predicted with the fao 56 model underestimated fi water use et in all years of the study prior to growing point differentiation possibly resulting in large soil water evaporation losses under sparse canopy cover consequently increased evaporative losses during vegetative development where at the expense of crop water use and yield potential during later reproductive stages while fi provides the greatest opportunity to reduce production risks through increased yield if irrigation water is limiting mdi provides less risk than di due to its ability to maintain yield and wue as was evident in 2012 as such concentrating irrigation water during the critical growth stage resulted in a greater yield compared with irrigation scheduling based on a fraction of full irrigation acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge mr grant johnson usda ars

bocchi 2005 so it is easier to calibrate with a reduced set of crop parameters the cropping systems model cropsyst has been developed as a management oriented tool which has been evolving to give responses to new demands on agro ecosystem simulation capabilities such as combined cycling of carbon and nitrogen carbon footprint of agricultural systems improvements in the use of the water use efficiency as well as assessment of climate change impact on agriculture stöckle et al 2014 although this model has been used with different purposes to simulate many crops including potato peralta and stöckle 2001 alva et al 2010 there has been a lack of research focused on the experimental calibration and validation of this model specifically for potato in addition the technical adequacy of cropsyst for potato simulations under semiarid conditions has not yet been analysed the study area located in albacete a province of castilla la mancha spain requires rational and responsible water management to ensure the sustainability of irrigated agriculture ortega et al 2004 authors as english et al 1990 and domínguez et al 2012 propose deficit irrigation as a way to increase the water productivity and the profitability of crops nevertheless the use of this methodology in potato may cause a drop in the quantity and quality of tubers shock et al 1998 fabeiro et al 2001 onder et al 2005 vos and haverkort 2007 as a result the calibration of a model such as cropsyst may be useful for determining if deficit irrigation strategies will be able to reduce the use of irrigation water while maintaining the quality of the product and a profitable tuber yield the aim of this paper is the calibration and validation of the parameters required by the cropsyst model for simulating the growth of a potato crop in a semiarid mediterranean environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design experimental data were collected in cifp aguas nuevas albacete spain 38 56 n 1 53 w altitude 695 m a s l during two irrigation seasons in 2011 and 2012 camargo et al 2015 according to papadakis 1966 the climate of this area is warm mediterranean the agroclimatic station placed in the experimental farm registered the total rainfall during the crop cycle 160 mm and 130 mm in 2011 and 2012 respectively and the parameters required for calculating daily fao penman monteith eto allen et al 1998 temperatures were typical for this climate in 2011 but the maximum temperatures reached in the summer of 2012 were greater than normal between 35 c and 41 c over 19 days moreover 50 of the rainfall occurred between sowing and flowering stages the soil of the study area was classified as xeric torriorthent with a loam texture composition 4 coarse sand 28 fine sand 44 silt and 24 clay usda nrcss 2006 while the average soil depth was 500 mm the experimental area which was 4 9 ha of an 18 4 ha circular plot was equipped with a center pivot irrigation system the center pivot was 238 m in length with a system capacity of 1 3 l s 1 ha 1 and it was equipped with rotating spray plate type sprinklers rotator manufactured by nelson irrigation co the sprinklers had pressure regulators output pressure 140 kpa their spray pattern width was 9 m and they were installed at 1 4 m above the soil and spaced 1 5 m apart the irrigation system supplied four percentages 120 100 80 and 60 of the crop water requirements cwr determined by the methodology proposed by fao allen et al 1998 in three replicates fig 1 three replicates per treatment 10 m long and 6 m wide 60 m2 fig 1 were distributed at random in spans 3 and 4 spans were equipped with electric valves controlled by the irrigation programmer the frequency of irrigation was based on six center pivot paths applying the same dose in a given period of time table 1 the crop used for the field experiments was the potato solanum sp which is the fifth most important crop grown in the world and its primary use is as human food and for manufacturing faostat 2016 in spain the area of potato cultivation is approximately 71600 ha of which approximately 2100 ha are located in the castilla la mancha region the province of albacete represents 52 of the total area of this region mapama 2017 the potato tubers used at sowing in both seasons were agria cultivar whichwere directly sown in the second week of march and harvested at 152 2011 and 173 2012 days after planting the population was 5 9 and 5 7 plants m 2 in 2011 and 2012 respectively 2 2 crop data sampling once per week and following the bbch scale hack et al 1993 the potato crop development was monitored in all replicates of each treatment the thermal time required to achieve each phenological stage was computed using 2 c as the base temperature tb and 26 c as the upper temperature tu montoya et al 2016 steduto et al 2012 table 2 the bbch scale indicates that flowering and tuber formation stages occur simultaneously nevertheless these two stages were not concurrent in 2012 because crop leaf senescence took place after the end of flowering camargo et al 2015 table 2 according with alva et al 2010 potato crop growth was monitored every 15 days by measuring dry matter weight canopy cover cc leaf area index lai and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation parab for each replicate of the four treatments between crop establishment and harvest the crop was sampled on 8 and 9 occasions in the 2011 and 2012 irrigation seasons respectively after being oven dried at 60 c for 48 h until constant weight the dry matter content of each potato vegetative structure was obtained for two plants selected on each sampling occasion these plants were also used to measure the leaf area using a li cor 3100c li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa and to compute the lai throughout the plant density cc was obtained using laic software córcoles et al 2013 ballesteros et al 2014 which inputs data were obtained by a digital camera pentax golden co usa

cambridge uk device at harvest the central 18 m2 of each subplot were manually processed to determine crop yield the dry matter content of the potato tubers mst the total dry matter content mst and the harvest index hi mst and mst were recorded through oven dried of a representative crop sample of each subplot at 60 c during 48 h or until constant weight hi was computed as mst and mst ratio 2 3

cwr the crop coefficients kc used in this study were those proposed by fao 56 allen et al 1998 all of the irrigation treatments received the same amount of water between sowing and crop establishment 9 unfolded leaves on the main stem 4 cm to guarantee consistent crop conditions causing the differences in the rest of stages table 3 in both irrigation seasons around half of the irrigation events were evaluated following the methodology proposed by merriam and keller 1978 thus the average accumulated uniformity coefficient for both irrigation seasons was 91 4 soil water potential and water content were measured using watermark tensiometers irrometer corp riverside ca usa sensors and enviroscan probes sentekpty ltd south australia watermark sensors were placed at depths of 0 2 m 0 3 m and 0 4 m allowing to locate the zero flux plane zfp which occurred at 0 3 m depth the enviroscan probes were previously calibrated at depths from 0 1 m to 0 4 m 0 1 m intervals camargo et al 2012 according to the readings from both sensors it was not registered capillary rise moreover the slope less than 0 5 management and design of the plots avoided surface run off 2 4 daily actual evapotranspiration the calculation of the actual evapotranspiration et was determined following two methodologies in order to corroborate the daily values of estimated et a daily et was estimated by the volumetric soil moisture readings of the enviroscan wbset sensors jimenez et al 2010 where the soil moisture content variation δs from wbset allowed to compute et between two consecutive

2011 the station was placed during four key potato crop stages after planting flowering maximum crop growth and senescence montoya et al 2016 both methodologies determined that the maximum root water extraction was close to 10 0 mm day 1 which occurred when the crop reached the maximum canopy cover 2 5 cropsyst model calibration and validation cropsyst stöckle and nelson 1999 stöckle et al 2003 is a process based multi year multi crop daily time step cropping system simulation model with a link to gis the model simulates the soil water budget the soil plant nitrogen budget crop growth and development residue production and decomposition and soil erosion its main routines and algorithms are described in detail in the cropsyst manual http www bsyse wsu edu cropsyst and in many papers such as stöckle et al 1994 2003 confalonieri and bocchi 2005 and bechini et al 2006 version 4 15 24 of cropsyst was used in this study the main model inputs are daily weather data the hydraulic characteristics of the soil profile whose values were described in montoya et al 2016 crop parameters the initial conditions of the soil profile and sowing date as well as the amount of products applied for each fertilization and irrigation event the most important model outputs are aboveground biomass lai cc root depth soil water and nitrogen balance fig 2 similar to other models such as aquacrop steduto et al 2009 or dssat csm jones et al 2003 cropsyst classifies the parameters into two groups conservative and non conservative stöckle and nelson 2017 calibration was carried out using the 2011 experimental data values were iteratively assigned to some cropsyst variables with the aim of successfully simulating the main growth parameters of the crop lai and cc evolution cc total dry matter evolution tdm crop evapotranspiration et total dry biomass and yield at harvest and soil water content ws several sources of information were used to obtain the values required by cropsyst such as data from field experiments data used in other studies peralta and stöckle 2001 alva et al 2010 and data from the cropsyst manual stöckle and nelson 2017 validation was carried out using data from the 2012 irrigation season conservative data were kept constant according to the calibration data and non conservative data were changed depending on the field data the conservative variables calibrated for the reference treatment 100 were the stem leaf partition coefficient p m2 kg 1 specific leaf area sla m2 kg 1 radiation use efficiency ruepar kg mj 1 and the biomass transpiration coefficient kbt pa sla was set as the average of the measurements carried out during the early growth stages because it is constant for the whole growing season confalonieri et al 2009 using constant sla together with the crop biomass accumulated aboveground biomass agb and lai values obtained in the field 100 cwr treatment p was computed with eq 2 using the minimum value corresponding to all pairs lai agb 2 lai sla agb 1 p agb where lai green leaf area index m2 m 2 agb accumulated aboveground biomass kg m 2 sla specific leaf area measured at early growth stages m2 kg 1 and p leaf stem

fractcover 1 e k lai factor where fractcover green canopy cover fraction of unity k extinction coefficient dimensionless lai leaf area index m2 m 2 and factor calculated factor stöckle and nelson 2017 radiation balance was used to calculate ruepar and the extinction coefficient k varlet grancher et al 1989a 1989b ruepar was obtained from the relationship between agb and cumulative photosynthetic active radiation parac the period with the maximum canopy cover nearly 96 was used to calculate kbt because all of the water consumed in this stage was only due to the process of transpiration this period lasted 52 days from 75 to 126 days after planting and the daytime atmospheric vapour pressure deficit vpd was considered to be at its maximum jefferies and heilbronn 1991 water stress coefficients were calibrated according to cropsyst default values stöckle and nelson 1999 stöckle and nelson 2017 or derived from the literature vos and haverkort 2007 cropsyst considers the reference harvest index hi0 to be a conservative parameter and depending on the cultivar hi0 may vary between 0 70 0 85 stöckle and nelson 1999 struik 2007 raes et al 2012 the hi0 during the experimental trial in 2011 ranged from 0 80 to 0 87 with lower hi values in the deficit treatments 2 6 evaluation of the model and statistical analysis for the evaluation of goodness of fit between the measured and simulated lai cc tdm ws and et values the root mean square error rmse the coefficient of determination r2 the coefficients of the regression curve and willmott s index of agreement d willmott 1982 were used montoya et al 2016 the coefficients of the regression curve were used to relate observed and simulated values where the respective regression and determination coefficients were used as indicators a slope close to 1 0 indicates that the simulated values are statistically close to the observed ones a determination coefficient r2 close to 1 0 indicates that most of the variance of the observed values is explained by the model paredes et al 2014 rmse indicator expresses the variance of errors ranging from 0 to positive infinity jacovides and kontoyiannis 1995 while d index measures the degree to which the observed data are approached to the simulated data ranging between 0 and 1 0 indicates no agreement and 1 points out a perfect agreement between observed and simulated data willmott 1982 the threshold values for considering whether the model was calibrated and validated were as follows d values 0 9 an rmse near 0 and an r2 close to 1 montoya et al 2016 where r2 values greater than 0 5 are considered acceptable moriasi et al 2007 in addition the simulations of total biomass and yield at harvest were considered suitable when at least 70 of the simulations were 10 of the observed data according to the criteria proposed by several authors dominguez et al 2012 farahani et al 2009 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 where rmse normalized root mean square error si simulated

harvest the significance levels used were as follows p 0 05 not significant 0 01 p 0 05 significant and p 0 01 very significant the duncan test was used to estimate whether the differences between the mean treatments were significant 3 results 3 1 leaf area index the progression of the green leaf area index is conditioned by the sla p and agb parameters eq 1 according to the agb and lai field data measured in the 100 treatment during 2011 the sla and p values were calibrated as 17 19 m2 kg 1 and 2 27 m2 kg 1 respectively table 4 for the calibration year the lai values simulated by cropsyst along the growth cycle highly agreed with the field data fig 3 the results of the model were similar for all of the treatments up to the 100th day after plantation close to the beginning of basal leaf senescence table 5 later the simulated lai progression was similar in the 120 100 and 80 treatments while the 60 treatment was affected by the restricted irrigation however according to the observed data the 80 treatment was also affected by deficit irrigation the peak lai was overestimated by the model fig 3 for the validation year fig 3 the greater differences between the observed and simulated data appeared from the crop development stage up to the maximum lai overestimations of between 0 5 and 2 0 m2 m 2 during the stage of decreasing lai the agreement between observed and simulated data was suitable except for the 80 treatment whose simulated values were overestimated fig 3c as occurred with the calibration year the simulated lai progression in the 80 treatment was similar to the 120 and 100 treatments but different from the 60 treatment from the 89th day after plantation the initiation of the flowering and tuber formation stages to the end of the growth cycle similarly the simulated lai peak was overestimated for the 80 treatment the rmse and d index values for lai were excellent for most of the treatments in 2011 table 5 showing a high linear correlation and moderate determination coefficients for the 2012 simulations the errors in the maximum lai were between 12 and 20 the slopes of the regressions were high for the 80 and 60 treatments the intercept coefficients were close to 0 and the coefficients of determination were moderate except for the 60 treatment which was considered low 3 2 canopy cover the simulated progression of cc in 2011 and 2012 exhibited suitable agreement with the field data fig 4 the maximum cc and the drop in cc fit better than the cc increase during the development stage differences of between 12 and 25 depending on the treatment the simulated lai peak coincided with the maximum cc in 2011 the simulated ccx 96 was reached by all of the treatments fig 4 nevertheless during the second experimental year the simulated cc was overestimated in the deficit treatments but the progression of this parameter was within the standard deviation sd of the field values fig 4c d the evolution of cc was similar among the 120 100 and 80 treatments in 2011 and 2012 fig 4 however the cc progression in the 60 treatment differed slightly with respect to the other irrigation treatments as did the evolution of lai for the same treatment in both experimental years table 6 the statistical analysis determined that the goodness of fit for the calibration year was moderate for the most of the treatments with errors between 13 6 and 18 0 and slightly low coefficients of determination the statistical analysis produced better results for the validation year which showed high indexes of agreement and r2 values slopes near 1 and errors and intercept coefficients close to 0 table 5 3 3 total dry matter progression in 2011 the mean field measured crop transpiration coefficient kbt for the 100 treatment was 9 40 pa sd 1 40 pa while the average measured radiation use efficiency rue was 1 90 g mj 1 sd 0 30 g mj 1 both parameters were calibrated as 10 8 pa and 2 00 g mj 1 respectively table 4 the model properly fitted the progression of tdm from the beginning of the development stage to the end of the maturity stage fig 5 nevertheless the tdm values during the tuber formation stage table 2 by the model were 10 15 lower than those obtained in the field tests fig 5 generally the errors in the estimation of tdm for the whole growing cycle varied between 1 04 and 2 73 103 kg ha 1 for the four treatments in both years table 7 which implies a deviation of between 4 and 17 compared to the field data for all the irrigation strategies the willmott s index of agreement was greater than 0 94 table 7 likewise the slope of the regression lines and their r2 were near 1 while the intercept coefficient approached 0 in both years cropsyst tended to underestimate the observed data by between 0 35 and 2 30 103 kg ha 1 3 4 total biomass and yield and harvest index when comparing the observed total biomass and yield at harvest values with those simulated by cropsyst for the first experimental year they were within 10 for all of the treatments except for 60 cwr table 8 in the second year the simulated biomass values of the 100 and 60 treatments were slightly outside of the 10 interval while the simulated yield was within this range with the exception of the 80 treatment table 8 the simulated hi was 0 82 for all of the treatments in both years and this value was used in the calibration of the model and corresponds to the observed value obtained in the 100 treatment in 2011 the rest of the 2011 treatments reached similar hi values with standard deviations within the 10 interval table 8 on the contrary the simulated hi in 2012 was overestimated in all of the treatments with deviations slightly higher than 10 in the 100 and 60 treatments the most efficient simulated treatment in terms of use of water wue was the 80 in 2011 2 55 kg tdm m 3 while in 2012 were the 100 and 80 treatments 1 84 and 1 82 kg tdm m 3 respectively table 8 although the wue observed during 2012 did not show significant differences the wue simulated attained similar values to those observed ones the analysis of variance of the simulated data similarly grouped the biomass and yield results observed in the 2011 treatments table 8 nevertheless the analysis of variance was different for the simulated and observed biomass and yield data in 2012 the observed data were grouped into two categories while the simulated data were grouped into three table 8 regarding hi only the observed data for the calibration year showed significant differences table 8 however wue simulated was grouped in three levels in both experimental years highlighting the 100 and 80 treatments as the most efficient table 8 the criterion of accepting a 10 deviation in at least 70 of the matching values was met for yield in both of the experimental years and for biomass in the calibration year table 8 the deviation of the simulated biomass in the 100 validation treatment was slightly higher 11 88 than the determined threshold and the observed yield of this treatment was higher than the yield obtained in the 120 treatment however no significant differences were found the 60 treatment did not meet this criterion because the simulated biomass was underestimated in both experimental years the statistical analysis of biomass and yield resulted in low rmse values moderate d values in the calibration year and high d values in 2012 table 9 the coefficients of determination and the coefficients of the linear regression model showed suitable correspondence between the simulated and observed data 3 5 soil water content the daily soil water content simulated by cropsyst was alike to the readings from the enviroscan sensors placed at depths of up to 0 3 m pfc fig 6 in the 120 and 100 treatments the soil moisture content was higher fig 6a d than that of the deficit irrigation treatments fig 6e h a representative plot for each treatment is represented in fig 6 the soil moisture content of the deficit treatments 80 and 60 was between the permanent wilting point pwp and field capacity fc in both years showing that the soil water content decrease with time fig 6e h in the 120 and 100 treatments soil moisture content was kept around fc 100 fig 6c d or even greater 120 fig 6a b the statistical parameters showed an error of estimation of 15 0 mm for the 120 and 100 treatments table 10 while 80 and 60 treatments reached similar or lower errors 9 9 and 8 3 mm for 60 table 10 broadly speaking the goodness of fit was moderate 0 70 d 0 85 or acceptable d 0 85 for all the analysed treatments excepting the 120 and 100 treatments in the calibration year which were considered as slightly deficient table 10 slopes and interception coefficients attained between simulated and observed soil water content showed that cropsyst tend to overestimate the soil moisture observed in both calibration and validation years for all the treatments excepting the 80 and 60 treatments in 2012 that were underestimated fig 6 table 10 the coefficient of determination ranged from moderate to low significance 3 6 crop evapotranspiration a moderate correlation r2 between 0 60 and 0 96 was found between the actual crop evapotranspiration et measured by the bowen ratio device bret the simulated values and the water balance calculated from the readings of the enviroscan sensors wbset fig 7 the model underestimated the et measured by the wbset methodology by between 9 and 26 and compared with the observed data calculated by the bret method cropsyst overestimated et by between 2 and 29 the development and senescence stages showed greater differences between 20 and 29 but the differences were lower between 2 and 6 during the maximum demand stage tuber bulking in general the et simulation achieved a suitable goodness of fit with both et estimation methods on certain days the aggregation indexes were moderate 0 70 d 0 85 and acceptable d 0 85 respectively table 11 and in both experimental years and for all treatments the estimation errors were approximately 1 00 mm day 1 table 11 4 discussion 4 1 leaf area index the progression of the simulated lai was similar to the observed data suitably representing the key stages of the growing cycle beginning of lai development maximum lai and lai decline up to harvest fig 3 although most of the treatments reached suitable goodness of fit table 5 the model overestimated the lai values during the growth stage close to the maximum lai in the 80 and 60 treatments in 2012 fig 3 the overestimation was caused by high temperatures that occurred in the summer of 2012 which lengthened the crop growth cycle struik 2007 camargo et al 2015 table 2 and increased the amount of irrigation water supplied to the crop table 3 this effect caused greater simulated lai development than observed in the treatments and it explains the steep slope obtained for both treatments table 5 the high degree of agreement between the observed and simulated lai values during the beginning and end of the lai growth stages resulted in intercept coefficients close to 0 in all treatments several authors that have used cropsyst to simulate cotton sommer et al 2008 sunflower todorovic et al 2009 and wheat pala et al 1996 have determined that the progression of lai is overestimated during the stage of crop development errors between 15 and 40 while during senescence there is a high correlation between the observed and simulated values in a simulation of rice confalonieri et al 2009 observed good agreement between the observed and simulated lai values with a standard deviation of 39 despite the number of papers that have used cropsyst for the simulation of crops only a few have analysed the progression of lai in depth jara et al 1998 sommer et al 2008 todorovic et al 2009 however this is a key parameter as the accurate simulation of biomass accumulation soil water balance and daily evapotranspiration depend on it the results of the lai simulation achieved a reasonable goodness of fit taking into account that the main parameters of the model specific leaf area partition stem leaf coefficient extinction coefficient radiation use efficiency and transpiration coefficient were calibrated using data from the field tests the graphic representation and the errors 35 may be considered sufficient regarding this table 4 shows the values assigned to the parameters conservative and non conservative of the cropsyst model to simulate a potato crop cv agria under mediterranean conditions 4 2 canopy cover the standard deviation of the measured cc did not differ significantly among treatments in either experimental year fig 4 but the simulation of the four irrigation strategies resulted in significant differences from the end of the flowering stage to harvest the same result was observed in the simulation of lai fig 3 cropsyst estimates cc through the progression of lai eq 2 and as a consequence the maximum cc and the peak lai value were reached on the same date figs 3 and 4 so the model properly simulated cc progression during the period between cc 80 and the maximum as well as during the canopy development and senescence stages in the simulation of a sunflower crop todorovic et al 2009 also determined that the maximum cc coincided with the lai peak although the model allows crop simulation by cc progression stöckle and nelson 2017 none of the published papers have used this parameter to simulate crop growth this is due to the fact that the lai index is one of the key factors in cropsyst and biomass production is based on this factor the large errors and small coefficients of determination obtained during the calibration of the model table 5 were mainly due to the underestimation of the cc during the development stage as a consequence fitting regression lines was not suitable for all of the treatments 0 50 r2 0 82 as the coordinates were 0 at the origin for the 80 and 60 treatments in the validation a better fit was achieved thanks to a suitable simulation of the entire growing cycle for the four treatments table 5 therefore the statistical results for cc in the calibration and validation processes were considered to be sufficient 4 3 total dry matter progression the underestimation of the tdm during tuber formation was conditioned by the methodology used in the model simulation of biomass accumulation cropsyst uses a linear algorithm while several authors proposed a sigmoidal function in the case of a potato crop with days from emergence as the independent variable barker et al 2010 camargo et al 2015 empirical models are highly dependent on the climatic conditions of the areas for which they were calibrated so the models are unsuitable for other areas however the use of the kbt tanner and sinclair 1983 and rue sinclair and muchow 1999 parameters increases the robustness of the model because they adapt the water deficit response to different climatic conditions stöckle et al 2003 the underestimation of tdm throughout the crop growth period was common in the calibration and validation of other crops such as rice confalonieri and bocchi 2005 confalonieri et al 2009 alfalfa confalonieri and bechini 2004 winter wheat pala et al 1996 bechini et al 2006 cotton sommer et al 2008 sunflower todorovic et al 2009 and potato alva et al 2010 the statistical results table 7 agree with previous works and allow for the conclusion that the calibrated parameters table 4 are suitable for the environmental characteristics of the experimental area 4 4 biomass yield and harvest index the simulated biomass during the growth cycle and at harvest fig 5 was underestimated in all of the treatments except 80 2012 table 8 in a maize simulation stöckle et al 2003 also underestimated the biomass at harvest with errors of approximately 2 9 103 kg ha 1 the general underestimation of the total biomass in all of the treatments reduced the simulated wue which showed similar deviations to those obtained for the biomass value this result was more pronounced for the 60 treatment in both experimental years table 8 in spite of that the wue data simulated by the model reveal that the 100 and 80 cwr treatments are the best irrigation strategies to be followed by the farmers area the hi achieved by the model in all of the treatments indicates that cropsyst version 4 15 24 did not apply the water stress and temperature stress reduction coefficients of the reference hi calibrated as 0 82 and this was confirmed by the model developers nelson r washington state university personal communication as a consequence the final hi and yield results were not reliable although the yield deviations were suitable based on the 10 criterion these data must be used with caution until the model is improved the errors in the estimation of biomass as well as the aggregation index table 9 were similar to those obtained by stöckle et al 2003 and bechini et al 2006 for maize wheat sorghum and soybean however the coefficients of the regression line for biomass at harvest deviated from the objective due to the underestimation of the 60 treatment in both years table 8 the statistical parameters for yield achieved an appropriate goodness of fit table 9 that should be confirmed by a suitable simulation of hi when possible 4 5 soil water content the high soil moisture content detected by the enviroscan sensors as well as the balance of the soil water content simulated by cropsyst in the 120 and 100 treatments caused deeper moisture percolation into the soil this fact was confirmed by the sensors placed at a depth of 0 40 m which detected a high constant soil moisture content in contrast sensors placed in the 80 and 60 treatments registered soil water contents below the theoretical pwp for 10 days in 2011 fig 6g this major depletion of soil water content was also simulated by the model although 120 and 100 treatments in 2011 achieved a slightly low willmott s index rmse values were similar to those of the rest of treatments table 10 this fact was due to the overestimation in both treatments of the soil moisture content during the first 30 days of the tuberization stage 70 100 days after planting which did not occur during the validation year fig 6a d the underestimation of lai and cc evolution during this period for both treatments may partially explain the lowest r2 and d index values a similar result was identified by paredes et al 2014 and montoya et al 2016 using aquacrop model they observed that the suitable simulation of the soil moisture progression depended on the suitable parameterization of the cc factor the coefficients of determination computed at table 10 are similar to the values obtained by confalonieri and bechini 2004 who determined in an experiment simulating an alfalfa crop that the model tends to underestimate soil moisture content with coefficients of determination between 0 20 and 0 81 on the other hand the rmse values and the index of agreement reported by stöckle et al 2003 for the simulation of wheat sorghum soybean and maize were similar or higher between 13 and 54 mm and between 0 786 and 0 997 respectively than those attained in this study table 10 based on the soil moisture content progression in the 100 treatment fig 6c d it may be concluded that the crop coefficients allen et al 1998 used for the irrigation scheduling were suitable as the amount of irrigation required to reach maximum yield in the 100 treatment was satisfied in addition the suitable goodness of fit and low errors of estimation attained for the water deficit treatments 80 and 60 in calibration and validation years table 10 allow to confirm that cropsyst model is suitable for simulating crops under deficit irrigation conditions 4 6 crop evapotranspiration the dispersion of the data was related to water deficit fig 7 water requires some time for complete infiltration and redistribution in the soil which is variable and depends on several soil factors e g initial water content structure degree of compression etc therefore the soil moisture sensor readings are progressively affected by the supply of water while cropsyst computes the distribution of the supplied water in one day this fact may cause the differences noted above the d and rmse values confirmed that the simulation of the et by cropsyst was suitable therefore an error equal to 1 00 mm day 1 implies a 12 difference from the et simulated by the model while d was close to 1 in the most of the treatments similar results were achieved in the parameterization of wheat maize soybean and sorghum pala et al 1996 stockle et al 1997 pannkuk et al 1998 stöckle et al 2003 benli et al 2007 with d and rmse values between 0 80 and 0 96 and 5 and 20 respectively in these works the results were based on accumulated et for the whole growth cycle instead of on the daily et used in the present work but the use of accumulated et decreases the ability to detect errors heng et al 2009 achieved rmse values between 1 58 and 2 85 mm day 1 in the simulation of a maize crop using aquacrop and considered the results to be valid aquacrop and cropsyst are similar dynamic models and these results may be extrapolated as a consequence it may be stated that the et results obtained in this work were suitable for the parameterization of the cropsyst model table 4 5 conclusions the simulated progression of leaf area index canopy cover biomass yield and evapotranspiration of a potato crop cultivated in a semiarid area achieved a high goodness of fit following the calibration and validation of the cropsyst version 4 15 24 model the accurate simulation of a potato crop depends on the proper calibration and validation of the main conservative parameters the steam leaf partition coefficient p the specific leaf area coefficient sla the biomass transpiration coefficient kbt the radiation use efficiency rue and the harvest index hi although the biomass at harvest was well simulated by cropsyst the simulation of the harvest index was not suitable because the model did not fit the reference harvest index to the temperature and water deficit stress coefficients the calculation of the harvest index and consequently the final yield should be improved to increase the interest of the agriculture sector in this model the model was capable of simulating the response of potato under two significantly different climatic years which increases the confidence in the conservative parameters the 100 and 80 cwr treatments are the recommended irrigation strategies for the study area being those that reached a high yield and a high efficiency in the use of water greater irrigation depths did not significantly increase the potato crop biomass and yield while those of the 60 treatment were too low the cropsyst parameters suggested in the useŕs manual to simulate a potato crop are improved thanks to the results of this research especially for the simulation of deficit irrigation strategies acknowledgements this work was carried out within the project sprinkler irrigation water application agronomy and return flows agl2010 21681 c03 02 which

taking into account the effect of both water and temperature stress on the reference harvest index yields at harvest were not properly simulated by the model according to the results the calibrated

currently widely applied in agriculture as tools in decision support systems bechini et al 2006 boote et al 2010 jones et al 2017 process based crop models give estimates of yield and harvest time based on soil characteristics and weather dynamics under different management scenarios pereira et al 2002 confalonieri et al 2009 leading to improved decision making in fertilizer and water management benli et al 2007 however crop models need to be calibrated and validated through specific field experiments to be used in certain areas cabelguenne et al 1990 donatelli et al 1997 van ittersum and donatelli 2003 many crop simulation models based on plant physiology have been developed during the last decades williams et al 1989 brisson et al 2003 jones et al 2003 keating et al 2003 stöckle et al 2003 van ittersum et al 2003 cropsyst stöckle et al 2003 is a process based simulation model that has been increasingly used in recent years with several crops and cropping systems stöckle et al 1994 pala et al 1996 donatelli et al 1997 stöckle and debaeke 1997 pannkuk et al 1998 ferrer et al 2000 peralta and stöckle 2001 confalonieri and bechini 2004 confalonieri and bocchi 2005 bechini et al 2006 benli et al 2007 marsal and stöckle 2012 marsal et al 2013 cropsyst is different from other models because it simplifies the description of some processes confalonieri and bocchi 2005 so it is easier to calibrate with a reduced set of crop parameters the cropping systems model cropsyst has been developed as a management oriented tool which has been evolving to give responses to new demands on agro ecosystem simulation capabilities such as combined cycling of carbon and nitrogen carbon footprint of agricultural systems improvements in the use of the water use efficiency as well as assessment of climate change impact on agriculture stöckle et al 2014 although this model has been used with different purposes to simulate many crops including potato peralta and stöckle 2001 alva et al 2010 there has been a lack of research focused on the experimental calibration and validation of this model specifically for potato in addition the technical adequacy of cropsyst for potato simulations under semiarid conditions has not yet been analysed the study area located in albacete a province of castilla la mancha spain requires rational and responsible water management to ensure the sustainability of irrigated agriculture ortega et al 2004 authors as english et al 1990 and domínguez et al 2012 propose deficit irrigation as a way to increase the water productivity and the profitability of crops nevertheless the use of this methodology in potato may cause a drop in the quantity and quality of tubers shock et al 1998 fabeiro et al 2001 onder et al 2005 vos and haverkort 2007 as a result the calibration of a model such as cropsyst may be useful for determining if deficit irrigation strategies will be able to reduce the use of irrigation water while maintaining the quality of the product and a profitable tuber yield the aim of this paper is the calibration and validation of the parameters required by the cropsyst model for simulating the growth of a potato crop in a semiarid mediterranean environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design experimental data were collected in cifp aguas nuevas albacete spain 38 56 n 1 53 w altitude 695 m a s l during two irrigation seasons in 2011 and 2012 camargo et al 2015 according to papadakis 1966 the climate of this area is warm mediterranean the agroclimatic station placed in the experimental farm registered the total rainfall during the crop cycle 160 mm and 130 mm in 2011 and 2012 respectively and the parameters required for calculating daily fao penman monteith eto allen et al 1998 temperatures were typical for this climate in 2011 but the maximum temperatures reached in the summer of 2012 were greater than normal between 35 c and 41 c over 19 days moreover 50 of the rainfall occurred between sowing and flowering stages the soil of the study area was classified as xeric torriorthent with a loam texture composition 4 coarse sand 28 fine sand 44 silt and 24 clay usda nrcss 2006 while the average soil depth was 500 mm the experimental area which was 4 9 ha of an 18 4 ha circular plot was equipped with a center pivot irrigation system the center pivot was 238 m in length with a system capacity of 1 3 l s 1 ha 1 and it was equipped with rotating spray plate type sprinklers rotator manufactured by nelson irrigation co the sprinklers had pressure regulators output pressure 140 kpa their spray pattern width was 9 m and they were installed at 1 4 m above the soil and spaced 1 5 m apart the irrigation system supplied four percentages 120 100 80 and 60 of

distributed at random in spans 3 and 4 spans were equipped with electric valves controlled by the irrigation programmer the frequency of irrigation was based on six center pivot paths applying the same dose in a given period of time table 1 the crop used for the field experiments was the potato solanum sp which is the fifth most important crop grown in the world and its primary use is as human food and for manufacturing faostat 2016 in spain the area of potato cultivation is approximately 71600 ha of which approximately 2100 ha are located in the castilla la mancha region the province of albacete represents 52 of the total area of this region mapama 2017 the potato tubers used at sowing in both seasons were agria cultivar whichwere directly sown in the second week of march and harvested at 152 2011 and 173 2012 days after planting the population was 5 9 and 5 7 plants m 2 in 2011 and 2012 respectively 2 2 crop data sampling once per week and following the bbch scale hack et

26 c as the upper temperature tu montoya et al 2016 steduto et al 2012 table 2 the bbch scale indicates that flowering and tuber formation stages occur simultaneously nevertheless these two stages were not concurrent in 2012 because crop leaf senescence took place after the end of flowering camargo et al 2015 table 2 according with alva et al 2010 potato crop growth was monitored every 15 days by measuring dry matter weight canopy cover cc leaf area index lai and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation parab for each replicate of the four treatments between crop establishment and harvest the crop was sampled on 8 and 9 occasions in the 2011 and 2012 irrigation seasons respectively after being oven dried at 60 c for 48 h until constant weight the dry matter content of each potato vegetative structure was obtained for two plants selected on each sampling occasion these plants were also used to measure the leaf area using a li cor 3100c li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa and

a process based multi year multi crop daily time step cropping system simulation model with a link to gis the model simulates the soil water budget the soil plant nitrogen budget crop growth and development residue production and decomposition and soil erosion its main routines and algorithms are described in detail in the cropsyst manual http www bsyse wsu edu cropsyst and in many papers such as stöckle et al 1994 2003 confalonieri and bocchi 2005 and bechini et al 2006 version 4 15 24 of cropsyst was used in this study the main model inputs are daily weather data the hydraulic characteristics of the soil profile whose values were described in montoya et al 2016 crop parameters the initial conditions of the soil profile and sowing date as well as the amount of products applied for each fertilization and irrigation event the most important model outputs are aboveground biomass lai cc root depth soil water and nitrogen balance fig 2 similar to other models such as aquacrop steduto et al 2009 or dssat csm jones et al 2003 cropsyst classifies the parameters into two groups conservative and non conservative stöckle and nelson 2017 calibration was carried out using the 2011 experimental data values were iteratively assigned to some cropsyst variables with the aim of successfully simulating the main growth parameters of the crop lai and cc evolution cc total dry matter evolution tdm crop evapotranspiration et total dry biomass and yield at harvest and soil water content ws several sources of information were used to obtain the values required by cropsyst such as data from field experiments data used in other studies peralta and stöckle 2001 alva et al 2010 and data from the cropsyst manual stöckle and nelson 2017 validation was carried out using data from the 2012 irrigation season conservative data were kept constant according to the calibration data and non conservative data were changed depending on the field data the conservative variables calibrated for the reference treatment 100 were the stem leaf partition coefficient p m2 kg 1 specific leaf area sla m2 kg 1 radiation use efficiency ruepar kg mj 1 and the biomass transpiration coefficient kbt pa sla was set as the average of the measurements carried out during the early growth stages because it is constant for the whole growing season confalonieri et al 2009 using constant sla together with the crop biomass accumulated aboveground biomass agb and lai values obtained in the field 100 cwr treatment p was computed with eq 2 using the minimum value corresponding to all

radiation balance was used to calculate ruepar and the extinction coefficient k varlet grancher et al 1989a 1989b ruepar was obtained from the relationship between agb and cumulative photosynthetic active radiation parac the period with the maximum canopy cover nearly 96 was used to calculate kbt because all of the water consumed in this stage was only due to the process of transpiration this period lasted 52 days from 75 to 126 days after planting and the daytime atmospheric vapour pressure deficit vpd was considered to be at its maximum jefferies and heilbronn 1991 water stress coefficients were calibrated according to cropsyst default values stöckle and nelson 1999 stöckle and nelson 2017 or derived from the literature vos and haverkort 2007 cropsyst considers the reference harvest index hi0 to be a conservative parameter and depending on the cultivar hi0 may vary between 0 70 0 85 stöckle and nelson 1999 struik 2007 raes et al 2012 the hi0 during the experimental trial in 2011 ranged from 0 80 to 0 87 with lower hi values in the deficit treatments 2 6 evaluation of the model and statistical analysis for the evaluation of goodness of fit between the measured and simulated lai cc tdm ws and et values the root mean square error rmse the coefficient of determination r2 the coefficients of the regression curve and willmott s index of agreement d willmott 1982 were used montoya et al 2016 the coefficients of the regression curve were used to relate observed and simulated values where the respective regression and determination coefficients were used as indicators a slope close to 1 0 indicates that the simulated values are statistically close to the observed ones a determination coefficient r2 close to 1 0 indicates that most of the variance of the observed values is explained by the model paredes et al 2014 rmse indicator expresses the variance of errors ranging from 0 to positive infinity jacovides and kontoyiannis 1995 while d index measures the degree to which the observed data are approached to the simulated data ranging between 0 and 1 0 indicates no agreement and 1 points out a perfect agreement between observed and simulated data willmott 1982 the threshold values for considering whether the model was calibrated and validated were as follows d values 0 9 an rmse near 0 and an r2 close to 1 montoya et al 2016 where r2 values greater than 0 5 are considered acceptable moriasi et al 2007 in addition the simulations of total biomass and yield at harvest were considered suitable when at least 70 of the simulations were 10 of the observed data according to the criteria proposed by several authors dominguez et al 2012 farahani et al 2009 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 where rmse normalized root mean square error si simulated

harvest the significance levels used were as follows p 0 05 not significant 0 01 p 0 05 significant and p 0 01 very significant the duncan test was used to estimate whether the differences between the mean treatments were significant 3 results 3 1 leaf area index the progression of the green leaf area index is conditioned by the sla p and agb parameters eq 1 according to the agb and lai field data measured in the 100 treatment during 2011 the sla and p values were calibrated as 17 19 m2 kg 1 and 2 27 m2 kg 1 respectively table 4 for the calibration year the lai values simulated by cropsyst along the growth cycle highly agreed with the field data fig 3 the results of the model were similar for all of the treatments up to the 100th day after plantation close to the beginning of basal leaf senescence table 5 later the simulated lai progression was similar in the 120 100 and 80 treatments while the 60 treatment was affected by the restricted irrigation however according to the observed data the 80 treatment was also affected by deficit irrigation the peak lai was overestimated by the model fig 3 for the validation year fig 3 the greater differences between the observed and simulated data appeared from the crop development stage up to the maximum lai overestimations of between 0 5 and 2 0 m2 m 2 during the stage of decreasing lai the agreement between observed and simulated data was suitable except for the 80 treatment whose simulated values were overestimated fig 3c as occurred with the calibration year the simulated lai progression in the 80 treatment was similar to the 120 and 100 treatments but different from the 60 treatment from the 89th day after plantation the initiation of the flowering and tuber formation stages to the end of the growth cycle similarly the simulated lai peak was overestimated for the 80 treatment the rmse and d index values for lai were excellent for most of the treatments in 2011 table 5 showing a high linear correlation and moderate determination coefficients for the 2012 simulations the errors in the maximum lai were between 12 and 20 the slopes of the regressions were high for the 80 and 60 treatments the intercept coefficients were close to 0 and the coefficients of determination were moderate except for the 60 treatment which was considered low 3 2 canopy cover the simulated progression of cc in 2011 and 2012 exhibited suitable agreement with the field data fig 4 the maximum cc and the drop in cc fit better than the cc increase during the development stage differences of between 12 and 25 depending on the treatment the simulated lai peak coincided with the maximum cc in 2011 the simulated ccx 96 was reached by all of the treatments fig 4 nevertheless during the second experimental year the simulated cc was overestimated in the deficit treatments but the progression of this parameter was within the standard deviation sd of the field values fig 4c d the evolution of cc was similar among the 120 100 and 80 treatments in 2011 and 2012 fig 4 however the cc progression in the 60 treatment differed slightly with respect to the other irrigation treatments as did the evolution of lai for the same treatment in both experimental years table 6 the statistical analysis determined that the goodness of fit for the calibration year was moderate for the most of the treatments with errors between 13 6 and 18 0 and slightly low coefficients of determination the statistical analysis produced better results for the validation year which showed high indexes of agreement and r2 values slopes near 1 and errors and intercept coefficients close to 0 table 5 3 3 total dry matter progression in 2011 the mean field measured crop transpiration coefficient kbt for the 100 treatment was 9 40 pa sd 1 40 pa while the average measured radiation use efficiency rue was 1 90 g mj 1 sd 0 30 g mj 1 both parameters were calibrated as 10 8 pa and 2 00 g mj 1 respectively table 4 the model properly fitted the progression of tdm from the beginning of the development stage to the end of the maturity stage fig 5 nevertheless the tdm values during the tuber formation stage table 2 by the model were 10 15 lower than those obtained in the field tests fig 5 generally the errors in the estimation of tdm for the whole growing cycle varied between 1 04 and 2 73 103 kg ha 1 for the four treatments in both years table 7 which implies a deviation of between 4 and 17 compared to the field data for all the irrigation strategies the willmott s index of agreement was greater than 0 94 table 7 likewise the slope of the regression lines and their r2 were near 1 while the intercept coefficient approached 0 in both years cropsyst tended to underestimate the observed data by between 0 35 and 2 30 103 kg ha 1 3 4 total biomass and yield and harvest index when comparing the observed total biomass and yield at harvest values with those simulated by cropsyst for the first experimental year they were within 10 for all of the treatments except for 60 cwr table 8 in the second year the simulated biomass values of the 100 and 60 treatments were slightly outside of the 10 interval while the simulated yield was within this range with the exception of the 80 treatment table 8 the simulated hi was 0 82 for all of the treatments in both years and this value was used in the calibration of the model and corresponds to the observed value obtained in the 100 treatment in 2011 the rest of the 2011 treatments reached similar hi values with standard deviations within the 10 interval table 8 on the contrary the simulated hi in 2012 was overestimated in all of the treatments with deviations slightly higher than 10 in the 100 and 60 treatments the most efficient simulated treatment in terms of use of water wue was the 80 in 2011 2 55 kg tdm m 3 while in 2012 were the 100 and 80 treatments 1 84 and 1 82 kg tdm m 3 respectively table 8 although the wue observed during 2012 did not show significant differences the wue simulated attained similar values to those observed ones the analysis of variance of the simulated data similarly grouped the biomass and yield results observed in the 2011 treatments table 8 nevertheless the analysis of variance was different for the simulated and observed biomass and yield data in 2012 the observed data were grouped into two categories while the simulated data were grouped into three table 8 regarding hi only the observed data for the calibration year showed significant differences table 8 however wue simulated was grouped in three levels in both experimental years highlighting the 100 and 80 treatments as the most efficient table 8 the criterion of accepting a 10 deviation in at least 70 of the matching values was met for yield in both of the experimental years and for biomass in the calibration year table 8 the deviation of the simulated biomass in the 100 validation treatment was slightly higher 11 88 than the determined threshold and the observed yield of this treatment was higher than the yield obtained in the 120 treatment however no significant differences were found the 60 treatment did not meet this criterion because the simulated biomass was underestimated in both experimental years the statistical analysis of biomass and yield resulted in low rmse values moderate d values in the calibration year and high d values in 2012 table 9 the coefficients of determination and the coefficients of the linear regression model showed suitable correspondence between the simulated and observed data 3 5 soil water content the daily soil water content simulated by cropsyst was alike to the readings from the enviroscan sensors placed at depths of up to 0 3 m pfc fig 6 in the 120 and 100 treatments the soil moisture content was higher fig 6a d than that of the deficit irrigation treatments fig 6e h a representative plot for each treatment is represented in fig 6 the soil moisture content of the deficit treatments 80 and 60 was between the permanent wilting point pwp and field capacity fc in both years showing that the soil water content decrease with time fig 6e h in the 120 and 100 treatments soil moisture content was kept around fc 100 fig 6c d or even greater 120 fig 6a b the statistical parameters showed an error of estimation of 15 0 mm for the 120 and 100 treatments table 10 while 80 and 60 treatments reached similar or lower errors 9 9 and 8 3 mm for 60 table 10 broadly speaking the goodness of fit was moderate 0 70 d 0 85 or acceptable d 0 85 for all the analysed treatments excepting the 120 and 100 treatments in the calibration year which were considered as slightly deficient table 10 slopes and interception coefficients attained between simulated and observed soil water content showed that cropsyst tend to overestimate the soil moisture observed in both calibration and validation years for all the treatments excepting the 80 and 60 treatments in 2012 that were underestimated fig 6 table 10 the coefficient of determination ranged from moderate to low significance 3 6 crop evapotranspiration a moderate correlation r2 between 0 60 and 0 96 was found between the actual crop evapotranspiration et measured by the bowen ratio device bret the simulated values and the water balance calculated from the readings of the enviroscan sensors wbset fig 7 the model underestimated the et measured by the wbset methodology by between 9 and 26 and compared with the observed data calculated by the bret method cropsyst overestimated et by between 2 and 29 the development and senescence stages showed greater differences between 20 and 29 but the differences were lower between 2 and 6 during the maximum demand stage tuber bulking in general the et simulation achieved a suitable goodness of fit with both et estimation methods on certain days the aggregation indexes were moderate 0 70 d 0 85 and acceptable d 0 85 respectively table 11 and in both experimental years and for all treatments the estimation errors were approximately 1 00 mm day 1 table 11 4 discussion 4 1 leaf area index the progression of the simulated lai was similar to the observed data suitably representing the key stages of the growing cycle beginning of lai development maximum lai and lai decline up to harvest fig 3 although most of the treatments reached suitable goodness of fit table 5 the model overestimated the lai values during the growth stage close to the maximum lai in the 80 and 60 treatments in 2012 fig 3 the overestimation was caused by high temperatures that occurred in the summer of 2012 which lengthened the crop growth cycle struik 2007 camargo et al 2015 table 2 and increased the amount of irrigation water supplied to the crop table 3 this effect caused greater simulated lai development than observed in the treatments and it explains the steep slope obtained for both treatments table 5 the high degree of agreement between the observed and simulated lai values during the beginning and end of the lai growth stages resulted in intercept coefficients close to 0 in all treatments several authors that have used cropsyst to simulate cotton sommer et al 2008 sunflower todorovic et al 2009 and wheat pala et al 1996 have determined that the progression of lai is overestimated during the stage of crop development errors between 15 and 40 while during senescence there is a high correlation between the observed and simulated values in a simulation of rice confalonieri et al 2009 observed good agreement between the observed and simulated lai values with a standard deviation of 39 despite the number of papers that have used cropsyst for the simulation of crops only a few have analysed the progression of lai in depth jara et al 1998 sommer et al 2008 todorovic et al 2009 however this is a key parameter as the accurate simulation of biomass accumulation soil water balance and daily evapotranspiration depend on it the results of the lai simulation achieved a reasonable goodness of fit taking into account that the main parameters of the model specific leaf area partition stem leaf coefficient extinction coefficient radiation use efficiency and transpiration coefficient were calibrated using data from the field tests the graphic representation and the errors 35 may be considered sufficient regarding this table 4 shows the values assigned to the parameters conservative and non conservative of the cropsyst model to simulate a potato crop cv agria under mediterranean conditions 4 2 canopy cover the standard deviation of the measured cc did not differ significantly among treatments in either experimental year fig 4 but the simulation of the four irrigation strategies resulted in significant differences from the end of the flowering stage to harvest the same result was observed in the simulation of lai fig 3 cropsyst estimates cc through the progression of lai eq 2 and as a consequence the maximum cc and the peak lai value were reached on the same date figs 3 and 4 so the model properly simulated cc progression during the period between cc 80 and the maximum as well as during the canopy development and senescence stages in the simulation of a sunflower crop todorovic et al 2009 also determined that the maximum cc coincided with the lai peak although the model allows crop simulation by cc progression stöckle and nelson 2017 none of the published papers have used this parameter to simulate crop growth this is due to the fact that the lai index is one of the key factors in cropsyst and biomass production is based on this factor the large errors and small coefficients of determination obtained during the calibration of the model table 5 were mainly due to the underestimation of the cc during the development stage as a consequence fitting regression lines was not suitable for all of the treatments 0 50 r2 0 82 as the coordinates were 0 at the origin for the 80 and 60 treatments in the validation a better fit was achieved thanks to a suitable simulation of the entire growing cycle for the four treatments table 5 therefore the statistical results for cc in the calibration and validation processes were considered to be sufficient 4 3 total dry matter progression the underestimation of the tdm during tuber formation was conditioned by the methodology used in the model simulation of biomass accumulation cropsyst uses a linear algorithm while several authors proposed a sigmoidal function in the case of a potato crop with days from emergence as the independent variable barker et al 2010 camargo et al 2015 empirical models are highly dependent on the climatic conditions of the areas for which they were calibrated so the models are unsuitable for other areas however the use of the kbt tanner and sinclair 1983 and rue sinclair and muchow 1999 parameters increases the robustness of the model because they adapt the water deficit response to different climatic conditions stöckle et al 2003 the underestimation of tdm throughout the crop growth period was common in the calibration and validation of other crops such as rice confalonieri and bocchi 2005 confalonieri et al 2009 alfalfa confalonieri and bechini 2004 winter wheat pala et al 1996 bechini et al 2006 cotton sommer et al 2008 sunflower todorovic et al 2009 and potato alva et al 2010 the statistical results table 7 agree with previous works and allow for the conclusion that the calibrated parameters table 4 are suitable for the environmental characteristics of the experimental area 4 4 biomass yield and harvest index the simulated biomass during the growth cycle and at harvest fig 5 was underestimated in all of the treatments except 80 2012 table 8 in a maize simulation stöckle et al 2003 also underestimated the biomass at harvest with errors of approximately 2 9 103 kg ha 1 the general underestimation of the total biomass in all of the treatments reduced the simulated wue which showed similar deviations to those obtained for the biomass value this result was more pronounced for the 60 treatment in both experimental years table 8 in spite of that the wue data simulated by the model reveal that the 100 and 80 cwr treatments are the best irrigation strategies to be followed by the farmers area the hi achieved by the model in all of the treatments indicates that cropsyst version 4 15 24 did not apply the water stress and temperature stress reduction coefficients of the reference hi calibrated as 0 82 and this was confirmed by the model developers nelson r washington state university personal communication as a consequence the final hi and yield results were not reliable although the yield deviations were suitable based on the 10 criterion these data must be used with caution until the model is improved the errors in the estimation of biomass as well as the aggregation index table 9 were similar to those obtained by stöckle et al 2003 and bechini et al 2006 for maize wheat sorghum and soybean however the coefficients of the regression line for biomass at harvest deviated from the objective due to the underestimation of the 60 treatment in both years table 8 the statistical parameters for yield achieved an appropriate goodness of fit table 9 that should be confirmed by a suitable simulation of hi when possible 4 5 soil water content the high soil moisture content detected by the enviroscan sensors as well as the balance of the soil water content simulated by cropsyst in the 120 and 100 treatments caused deeper moisture percolation into the soil this fact was confirmed by the sensors placed at a depth of 0 40 m which detected a high constant soil moisture content in contrast sensors placed in the 80 and 60 treatments registered soil water contents below the theoretical pwp for 10 days in 2011 fig 6g this major depletion of soil water content was also simulated by the model although 120 and 100 treatments in 2011 achieved a slightly low willmott s index rmse values were similar to those of the rest of treatments table 10 this fact was due to the overestimation in both treatments of the soil moisture content during the first 30 days of the tuberization stage 70 100 days after planting which did not occur during the validation year fig 6a d the underestimation of lai and cc evolution during this period for both treatments may partially explain the lowest r2 and d index values a similar result was identified by paredes et al 2014 and montoya et al 2016 using aquacrop model they observed that the suitable simulation of the soil moisture progression depended on the suitable parameterization of the cc factor the coefficients of determination computed at table 10 are similar to the values obtained by confalonieri and bechini 2004 who determined in an experiment simulating an alfalfa crop that the model tends to underestimate soil moisture content with coefficients of determination between 0 20 and 0 81 on the other hand the rmse values and the index of agreement reported by stöckle et al 2003 for the simulation of wheat sorghum soybean and maize were similar or higher between 13 and 54 mm and between 0 786 and 0 997 respectively than those attained in this study table 10 based on the soil moisture content progression in the 100 treatment fig 6c d it may be concluded that the crop coefficients allen et al 1998 used for the irrigation scheduling were suitable as the amount of irrigation required to reach maximum yield in the 100 treatment was satisfied in addition the suitable goodness of fit and low errors of estimation attained for the water deficit treatments 80 and 60 in calibration and validation years table 10 allow to confirm that cropsyst model is suitable for simulating crops under deficit irrigation conditions 4 6 crop evapotranspiration the dispersion of the data was related to water deficit fig 7 water requires some time for complete infiltration and redistribution in the soil which is variable and depends on several soil factors e g initial water content structure degree of compression etc therefore the soil moisture sensor readings are progressively affected by the supply of water while cropsyst computes the distribution of the supplied water in one day this fact may cause the differences noted above the d and rmse values confirmed that the simulation of the et by cropsyst was suitable therefore an error equal to 1 00 mm day 1 implies a 12 difference from the et simulated by the model while d was close to 1 in the most of the treatments similar results were achieved in the parameterization of wheat maize soybean and sorghum pala et al 1996 stockle et al 1997 pannkuk et al 1998 stöckle et al 2003 benli et al 2007 with d and rmse values between 0 80 and 0 96 and 5 and 20 respectively in these works the results were based on accumulated et for the whole growth cycle instead of on the daily et used in the present work but the use of accumulated et decreases the ability to detect errors heng et al 2009 achieved rmse values between 1 58 and 2 85 mm day 1 in the simulation of a maize crop using aquacrop and considered the results to be valid aquacrop and cropsyst are similar dynamic models and these results may be extrapolated as a consequence it may be stated that the et results obtained in this work were suitable for the parameterization of the cropsyst model table 4 5 conclusions the simulated progression of leaf area index canopy cover biomass yield and evapotranspiration of a potato crop cultivated in a semiarid area achieved a high goodness of fit following the calibration and validation of the cropsyst version 4 15 24 model the accurate simulation of a potato crop depends on the proper calibration and validation of the main conservative parameters the steam leaf partition coefficient p the specific leaf area coefficient sla the biomass transpiration coefficient kbt the radiation use efficiency rue and the harvest index hi although the biomass at harvest was well simulated by cropsyst the simulation of the harvest index was not suitable because the model did not fit the reference harvest index to the temperature and water deficit stress coefficients the calculation of the harvest index and consequently the final yield should be improved to increase the interest of the agriculture sector in this model the model was capable of simulating the response of potato under two significantly different climatic years which increases the confidence in the conservative parameters the 100 and 80 cwr treatments are the recommended irrigation strategies for the study area being those that reached a high yield and a high efficiency in the use of water greater irrigation depths did not significantly increase the potato crop biomass and yield while those of the 60 treatment were too low the cropsyst parameters suggested in the useŕs manual to simulate a potato crop are improved thanks to the results of this research especially for the simulation of deficit irrigation strategies acknowledgements this work was carried out within the project sprinkler irrigation water application agronomy and return flows agl2010 21681 c03 02 which

11488,this study was carried out in estahban iran during 2013 and 2014 to identify the optimal time and amount of supplemental irrigation at different distances from tree trunks on a rainfed fig orchard this region is distinguished as the largest producer of dried figs in iran and the world and its production is highly dependent on precipitation a split split plot statistical design with four replicates was used to conduct the experiment irrigation treatments based on the position of application around trees were in a micro catchment close to tree trunks in three holes inside of tree canopies with a mean canopy of 3 2 m diameter placed 1 1 1 m from tree trunks and in four holes outside of tree canopies placed 2 1 2 2 m from tree trunks were used in this experiment irrigation time treatments consisted of a in early spring b in mid summer and the three different volumes of irrigation water were used no supplemental irrigation control and either 1000 or 2000 l of irrigation water per tree results showed a high evaporation rate in the area which used nearly half of the rainfall during autumn and winter there was a significant positive correlation between soil water content swc and temporal rainfall distribution as r 0 63 p 0 001 over two years under drought conditions irrigated trees showed higher eta that was close to the eta in years with normal rainfall compared to irrigation in summer irrigation in early spring kept higher swc for a longer time period in the soil profile and irrigation far from trees increased soil surface evaporation especially in summer this study suggests that using supplemental irrigation with 2000 l per tree of water in early spring near tree trunk could provide higher swc and lower surface evaporation for rainfed fig orchards during drought conditions keywords precipitation soil water content evaporation irrigation position drought conditions 1 introduction iran is the top fourth producer and exporter of figs with an average of 75 833 t production in last two decades 1993 2013 fao 2016 most of the fig trees in iran are cultivated in rainfed orchards of estahban region fars province i r of iran providing 90 of dried fig production in iran jafari et al 2012 fig production under rainfed conditions is highly dependent on precipitation and fluctuation in annual precipitation is a major challenge for rainfed fig production bagheri and sepaskhah 2014 the last decade marked the most critical drought that iran has experienced over the past 30 years spanning from 2003 to 2013 etemadi and karami 2016 there was a high frequency of mild drought in recent years in rainfed fig orchards of estahban however the persistence of drought severe drought during the last decade and also an increasing trend in temperature of some months during last 32 years 1980 2012 led to destructive effects on fig trees hoseini et al 2016 in 2010 due to extensive drought events in the region more than 10 of the trees were lost and fruit production was reduced by more than 80 jafari et al 2012 fig orchards in the area are mainly located on foothill slopes which provide farmers to apply micro catchments built perpendicular around trees for collecting rain water similar to other arid and semi arid regions the tendency to use supplemental irrigation in estahban fig orchards has increased during last decade kamyab 2015 sharifzadeh et al 2012 supplemental irrigation is an effective response to alleviating the adverse effects of soil water stress on the yield of rainfed crops during dry spells oweis 1997 supplemental irrigation is defined as the application of limited amount of water to rainfed crops when natural precipitation fails in providing essential soil water for normal plant growth improvement and sustainability of crop yield sharifzadeh et al 2012 showed that inaccessibility to credit water availability and irrigation equipment expenses have limited the application of supplemental irrigation in the area the farmers supplemental irrigation methods are varying from classic irrigation methods such as basin irrigation by using tankers and pressurized hose to modern ones such as drip irrigation while the basin irrigation is the most common irrigation system in the region some farmers irrigate their orchards by flowing water in the ditches dug between tree rows the important features of irrigation method such as the optimum amount time and position of applied irrigation water could be determined by soil water absorption and water requirement of rainfed fig trees during a year also it must be recognized that fig trees are very sensitive to root rot therefore the excess amount of irrigation water must be avoided dominguez 1990 there is lack of information about the water needs and absorption of fig trees flaishman et al 2007 as supplemental irrigation is practiced at the end of rainfall season with drought spells in the region for rainfed fig trees a better understanding of water needs of rainfed fig trees is necessary in order to find an appropriate irrigation schedule and predict appropriate timing and amount of supplemental water application previous researches confirmed the positive role of supplemental irrigation in improving the morphological characteristics and yield of fig trees under drought conditions al desouki et al 2009 found that supplemental irrigation increased vegetative growth yield and fruit quality of sultani fig ficus carica grown in egypt kamgar haghighi and sepaskhah 2015 showed supplemental irrigation treatments including one irrigation at the last month of winter and two irrigation events at the last month of winter and middle of spring improved the morphological characteristics and yield of rainfed fig trees in estahban region moreover honar and sepaskhah 2015 found that the interaction of potassium and supplemental irrigation treatments can improve the yield of rainfed fig trees under drought conditions however lack of information about water requirement of rainfed fig trees in previous studies was problematic knowing the water requirement of rainfed fig trees will help clarify amount timing and application position of supplemental irrigation to achieve higher efficient use of water in the area thus the main objectives of the present study are 1 quantification of changes in soil water content of soil profile around rainfed fig trees 2 estimation of effective rainfall evaporation transpiration and evapotranspiration for each tree the above objectives are evaluated in relation to irrigation timing the quantity of water applied and application distances from the tree trunks 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in a farmer s orchard located in estahban county fars province iran 29 07 n 54 04 e elevation 1749 m above mean sea level and lasted for two years 2013 and 2014 the temperature values of 7 to 41 c respectively represent minimum and maximum conditions in the region the average of annual rainfall is about 354 mm in the area the extreme annual rainfall depths are 92 and 739 mm bagheri and sepaskhah 2014 the average relative humidity which is decreased during the fruit maturing and harvest period is 45 most of the rainfall occurs during late autumn and winter meteorological information was obtained from a meteorological station located in the region fig 1 the gravelly loam texture soil of orchard consisted of 30 sand 48 silt 22 clay and also 30 gravel on the volumetric basis the soil sample showed a ph of 7 54 electric conductivity ec of 1 34 ds m field capacity fc of about 32 volume basis and permanent wilting point pwp of 13 volume basis different growth stages of fig tree were considered in this investigation environmental parameters such as temperature photoperiod and humidity affect the development phases of the fig trees flaishman et al 2007 in estahban orchards shoot growth occurs in spring from mid april to mid may based on environmental conditions leaves usually become fully expanded in may from april to july the flowering and fruiting stages occur and fruit maturation starts in august and will continue till october when the leaves fall and tree dormancy period is started 2 2 experimental methods among many rainfed fig varieties grown at estahban region the izmir cultivar of ficus carica sabz is the dominant one bagheri and sepaskhah 2014 which occupy more than 98 of fig trees faghih and sabet sarvestani 2001 this locally appropriate variety has round canopy vertical growth dense foliage with usually 3 4 trunks this study was carried out on 18 uniform 45 year old cv sabz edible fig in the area studied trees had been planted 10 m apart with the canopy diameter of about 3 2 m as in other rainfed orchards of the region different supplemental irrigation treatments were applied in an experimental setup the experiment was set up as a split split plot in a randomized complete block design rcbd with four replication and 18 fig trees in each block supplemental irrigation treatments included three different application positions around the trunk three different volumes of irrigation water per tree and two different supplemental irrigation times the volume of irrigation water per tree was measured by a flow meter at the inlet of the irrigation pipe three irrigation treatments based on the position of application around trees were 1 irrigation in a micro catchment close to tree trunks nt 2 irrigation in three holes inside of tree canopies with a mean canopy of 3 2 m diameter placed 1 1 1 m from tree trunks ut and 3 irrigation in four holes outside of tree canopies placed 2 1 2 2 m from tree trunks ot two irrigation times were a in early spring b in mid summer and the three different volumes of irrigation water were no supplemental irrigation control and either 1000 or 2000 l of irrigation water per tree soil water content was measured at 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 0 6 0 9 0 9 1 2 and 1 2 1 5 m depths of soil in the monthly interval over the two year experimental period 2013 2014 2014 2015 using the neutron scattering method cpn 503 elite hydroprobe access tubes were installed at three different distances from the tree trunks with the closest possible places to the irrigated area based on the previous works on fig orchards in the area it is necessary to measure soil water content below the 90 cm depth honar and sepaskhah 2015 kamgar haghighi and sepaskhah 2015 however due to gravelly texture of soils in the area installing of access tubes up to 150 cm of soil depth for all trees was extremely difficult and inaccessible so the soil water content measurement was made in only one block 18 trees the pearson s correlation coefficient between swc and rainfall distribution was calculated in each soil layer the statistical analysis was performed using the spss software version 15 0 2 3 evaporation from soil surface microlysimeter can determine the evaporation from the surface of the bare soil under canopy and out of the canopy in this research 18 microlysimeters were installed in the soil 0 1 m away from the access tubes and weighted every two weeks to determine the amount of soil evaporation e mm the bottom perforated microlysimeters were pvc pipes of 100 mm internal diameter and 350 mm height fig 2 since these pipes are completely filled with the field soil and their edge above the soil surface are very small they are accurate enough for the measurements at the field scale the similar microlysimeters have been used in previous research by sepaskhah and ilampour 1995 1996 yarami et al 2011 and azizian and sepaskhah 2014 2 4 actual evapotranspiration the soil water balance method as proposed by jensen 1973 was applied to calculate eta eq 1 actual evapotranspiration eta was estimated for each tree in the volumetric unit m3 under the tree canopy and transformed to depth unit mm based on 100 m2 area for each tree 1 e t a i p δ s d p where i is the applied irrigation water mm p is the precipitation mm δs is the difference in the two consecutive soil water content measurements mm if the soil water content decreased compared to its previous value the sign of δs was considered as positive otherwise it is negative and dp is the deep percolation below root zone for the given period deep percolation was considered to be zero due to the depth of fig root in the area 7 m faghih and sabet sarvestani 2001 and the amount of applied water was not high also runoff was considered to be zero because the irrigation method was basin irrigation based on the difference between actual crop evapotranspiration and evaporation plant transpiration t mm was found for different periods of time and for different treatments the time intervals between irrigation events and soil water content measurements are shown in fig 3 in order to improve the water balance calculations in the second year the swc was measured one day before and one and six days after irrigation event in summer 2 5 effective rainfall effective rainfall reff in this study is defined as a portion of the precipitation that is stored in the plant root zone during a specific time period to meet the potential evapotranspiration requirements tsai et al 2005 in the study area more than 80 of rainfall occurs in autumn and winter faghih 2015 and reff is important during late winter because it provides soil water for the whole growing season the rainfall at the end of spring and also in summer cannot be considered as an effective rainfall due to its low quantity and also the negative effect on yield bagheri and sepaskhah 2014 found that while rainfall in winter is the vital parameter for fig yield rainfall in spring adversely affects the life cycle of caprifig wasp blastophaga psenes l that is used for caprification and consequently decreases the yield the effective rainfall was estimated considering two assumptions first the fig root is deep enough to absorb water percolated below the depth of 150 cm and would be regarded as part of effective rainfall the amount of runoff was also considered to be zero considering the basin irrigation method and also the existence of vast micro catchments around trees therefore the effective rainfall reff mm during tree s dormancy period was determined using the following equation 2 reff r i e where r is the depth of rainfall mm i is the interception by tree canopy mm which is considered zero for winter and autumn due to lack of leaves and e is the soil surface evaporation obtained using microlysimeters mm during dormancy period 3 results 3 1 soil water content the weighted mean of volumetric soil water content swc of three neutron probes installed near each tree in depth of 0 150 cm for different treatments is shown in fig 3 there was a significant positive correlation between swc and rainfall distribution as r 0 63 p 0 001 over two years fig 4 and this correlation coefficient increased for trees under rainfed treatment r 0 65 the positive correlation coefficient for all swc measurements and rainfall distributions for layers 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 0 6 0 9 0 9 1 2 and 1 2 1 5 m depths were 0 62 0 64 0 61 0 60 and 0 58 respectively over two years during the two year period the minimum swc was observed in autumn after harvest till the end of leaf senescence period and the maximum swc occurred at the vegetative phase which is the beginning of spring fig 3 the trend of soil water content for different treatments was increasing during the tree dormancy period in winter and decreasing through the following growth stages the swc in different irrigation application positions from the tree trunk in the 0 150 cm soil depth are compared in fig 3a and b in both years ut and nt showed the lowest and highest swc values respectively however there was not a large difference between swc values of ut and ot in the first year fig 3c and d indicates that the higher irrigation water depth could increase swc in both years whereas in both years higher swc in irrigated treatments continued till the next irrigation event irrigation at the beginning of spring resulted in higher swc in comparison with irrigation in the middle of summer the difference between swc for irrigation timing treatments was more obvious in dry months and the effectiveness of irrigation during summer was more considerable for 2000 l per tree compared to other irrigation depth treatments fig 3e and f 3 2 soil water distribution in the soil profile soil water content in different depths for different treatments is shown in table 1 higher soil water content was observed for depths of more than 0 9 m the percentage increase of swc value in 1 2 1 5 m layer in comparison with that in each layer was obtained using following equation 3 y x 2 x 1 x 1 100 where x2 and x1 are the mean values of swc for 1 2 1 5 m layer and the given layer respectively in the first year the mean soil water content in 1 2 1 5 m depth was almost 11 8 13 13 2 and 6 higher than that for 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 0 6 0 9 and 0 9 1 2 m depths in the second year the difference was about 17 3 14 8 10 9 and 5 4 for 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 0 6 0 9 and 0 9 1 2 m depths indicating a negligible difference in variation of swc in deeper soil the results of overall two year data imply that the average of swc of all treatments in 1 2 1 5 m was nearly 14 6 13 9 12 and 5 7 higher than that in 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 0 6 0 9 and 0 9 1 2 m depths fig 5 shows a 3 dimensional illustration of swc for different treatments during the two years for those trees irrigated with the higher volume of water despite the higher soil water content in all depths during two years the swc measured on 9 44 and 67 days after spring irrigation in the second year decreased by 21 6 and 6 in the following measurements compared with the previous soil water measurements the swc decreased about 8 and 14 at 22 and 47 days after the summer irrigation in the first year and 7 and 5 at 7 and 35 days after the summer irrigation in the second year the results showed that swc in the first 3 top layers of the soil profile 0 0 9 m depth reached back to swc before irrigation in a shorter time for irrigation with 2000 l per tree in summer of second year comparing the mean value of swc for all irrigation position treatments showed that swc of 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 and 0 6 0 9 m of soil profile took around 14 19 and 21 days to reach back to swc value before irrigation event for points of soil water measurement near tree trunks this average time was 10 17 and 22 days for swc in 1 1 1 m far from tree trunks and 5 10 and 18 days for the points out of the canopy the number of days for irrigation with 1000 l per tree in three different mentioned layers were about 9 10 and 15 days for points near the tree trunk 8 11 and 13 days for points in 1 1 1 m distance from tree trunks and 5 8 and 12 days for points out of the canopy while autumn and winter showed the least difference between soil water content in different depths of soil 2 and 1 8 in volumetric percent the maximum difference occurred in summer and spring 2 9 and 2 7 in volumetric percent irrigation near tree trunk showed the least difference in soil water content between depth and soil surface measurements in comparison to other treatments however there was not a significant difference in the average of total swc in soil surface between irrigation position treatments around 0 6 in volumetric percent 3 3 evapotranspiration the eta values were obtained for different growth stages of the fig tree for two years and are shown in tables 2 and 3 the mean rate of eta for the two year study showed that the maximum eta rate occurred during the vegetative stage mean value of 1 77 mm day in spring after that it decreased to 1 46 1 1 0 78 0 57 0 5 and 0 7 mm day during flowering pollination development harvest leaf senescence and dormancy stages respectively at the middle of dormancy period the eta rate started to increase slowly tables 2 and 3 the value of eta was about 19 7 lower in the second year compared to the first year in comparison with the control treatment irrigated trees with 2000 l per tree showed higher eta values 33 8 and 35 9 respectively for the first and the second year for 1000 l per tree treatment this increasing in eta were 8 8 and 14 in the first and second experimental years respectively the difference was higher during spring compared to other seasons for the study period regarding the time of irrigation results showed that irrigation in early spring resulted in higher eta during the vegetative and flowering stages over the two years during the harvest and leaf senescence periods trees under summer irrigation had higher eta compared to trees under spring irrigation over the two year study period 3 4 evaporation in general soil water evaporation from soil surface was higher during winter and spring for both years the amount of evaporation was about 26 3 lower in the second year compared to the first year regarding the irrigation position treatments during the applied irrigation seasons spring and summer the highest evaporation was observed in ot treatment 83 9 mm followed by ut and nt treatments 77 7 and 72 8 mm the overall lowest evaporation for two years was obtained for rainfed treatment 154 3 mm whereas the highest evaporation was obtained for 2000 l per tree irrigation volume with about 15 1 higher than that in rainfed trees by excluding autumn and winter as seasons without irrigation events this difference reached 39 9 fig 6 shows the rate of evaporation and eta for different growing stages of fig trees results showed that the rate of evaporation and eta is very close in the autumn and winter and the maximum difference occurred in spring during the vegetative and flowering stages the rate of evaporation in the first growing stage in early spring was higher than other stages fig 6 however at the development and harvest stages the minimum values of evaporation rate obtained as 0 16 and 0 15 mm day 3 5 transpiration leaf transpiration was determined by subtracting evaporation from eta the mean transpiration amounts per tree in the first and second years were 166 8 and 146 5 mm respectively tables 4 and 5 compared to rainfed treatment irrigation with 2000 and 1000 l per tree enhanced the total transpiration amount for growth stages of trees with green canopy by 19 and 59 1 respectively during these stages ut and ot treatments had 8 5 and 11 5 lower transpiration amounts than nt treatment respectively also irrigation in spring led to 4 1 higher transpiration amount compared to summer irrigation the maximum transpiration rate occurred during the flowering stage in the first year and during the pollination stage in the second year and the minimum transpiration rate occurred during the dormancy stage in both years fig 6 3 6 effective rainfall the mean reff of autumn and winter for different treatments over the two years are shown in table 6 compared to the first year 14 1 higher stored rainfall was obtained in the second year for the first and second years the average amount of reff r ratio for all treatments during autumn were 57 and 59 2 and during winter were 34 8 and 60 7 respectively table 6 considerable differences were not observed among irrigation treatments for this ratio 4 discussion 4 1 soil water content the swc variation changed with temporal rainfall distribution during two years in the rainfed fig orchard this resulted in a similar swc trend for different treatments the agreement between swc and rainfall was more obvious during leaf senescence and dormancy period due to no supplemental irrigation in autumn and winter higher correlation between swc and rainfall for trees under rainfed treatment compared with that in irrigated trees was due to irrigation influence on swc in irrigation treatments fig 4 also the higher correlation coefficient for top layers showed that in top layers swc changes with rainfall amount more quickly compared to that in deeper layers the mean swc value in the dormancy period of the second year increased from 15 to 23 higher rainfall and less water consumption by trees at this time of year are the reasons for this occurrence the swc reached 13 equal to pwp or a little lower for several days in autumn which indicated the water content of fig trees at the end of harvest stage and beginning of the leaf senescence stage higher swc for the irrigated trees during both years showed that supplemental irrigation can play an important role in providing water during the critical periods in rainfed conditions however irrigation in the middle of summer showed less swc increase compared to irrigation at the beginning of spring for two years this occurred due to higher air temperature and evaporation during the summer season the lower difference between soil water content in different depths of soil in autumn and winter compared to spring and summer is due to negligible water absorption by tree roots higher rainfall lower temperature and also dew formation in soil surface layer during the cold seasons the significance and role of dew as a water source cannot be ignored it has been recognized as an important meteorological factor under arid and semi arid conditions fischer et al 2012 ninari and berliner 2002 veste and littmann 2006 the moist deeper soil is the major cause of moisture for dew formation on the soil surface littmann and veste 2008 also the huge amount of gravels on soil surface like a mulch layer decreased the evaporation of soil surface yuan et al 2009 and contributed to high swc variation in top 0 3 m depth of soil profile in two years of study low swc in 0 3 0 9 m depth might be due to high water absorption in this depth the field observations showed the highest root density of fig trees in the area occurred in 0 6 0 9 m depth zare et al 2009 it may be due to the root structure of fig trees the upward water movement resulting from evaporation and capillary porosity and also leakage to deeper depths after heavy rainfall or irrigation can be mentioned as other reasons for water depleting from this layer 0 3 0 9 m depth it was difficult to find a relationship between the soil water content in different depths and distance from the trees the swc for depths lower than 0 9 m was higher and also more consistent compared with top layers of soil during a year this trend occurred for both irrigated and non irrigated treatments lower evaporation from deep layers and also downward water flow could be two reasons for this phenomenon the first days after heavy rainfall or supplemental irrigation the maximum swc value was observed in all depths and in the following days the swc decreased in soil surface layers due to redistribution of water in the soil profile and surface evaporation this reduction was higher after irrigation of spring in the first year compared with the second year due to its higher swc and consequently higher water loss through evaporation analysis of swc after summer irrigation in the second year showed that it took a shorter time for top soil layer to reach back swc values before irrigation also for irrigation position far from tree trunks this time was shorter possibly due to the higher rate of evaporation for position out of canopy area during leaf expansion period the results demonstrated that this time was shorter in irrigation with less volume of water due to high evaporation rate from the water surface during irrigation the difference in swc reduction in different volumes of applied water was less noticeable for soil surface layer in out of canopy position it can be attributed to the higher rate of evaporation and also gravelly textured soil which has low soil water holding capacity these factors also cause the higher difference between swc of depth and soil surface measurements of trees under irrigation far from the tree trunk in comparison to other position treatments however there was not a large difference in swc in soil surface between different irrigation position treatments irrigation in different positions covers only a part of under trees area and feeds the roots partially then it can be helpful for trees through the action of partial root zone drying irrigation prd effects in prd whereas one part of the root system is wetted the rest of the root zone is kept dry and the dry and wet sides alternate based on the scheduled soil water depletion and crop water needs the key positive effect of prd is that the non irrigated side of the crop root system generally sends a soil drying signal from roots to shoot where shoot physiology response such as stomatal opening and leaf expansion can be limited ahmadi et al 2010 hutton and loveys 2011 this mechanism has achieved positive results in fruit orchards such as pear peach olive and pomegranate abrisqueta et al 2008 ghrab et al 2013 kang and zhang 2004 parvizi et al 2014 4 2 evapotranspiration considering the values of eta we can schedule supplemental irrigation during the critical period of growing season the lower value of eta in the second year 286 2 mm compared with that in the first year 356 5 mm may be a result of lower annual rainfall in spring of this year the results are close to tapia et al 2003 which showed the adequacy of 220 mm year 2200 m3 ha year equivalent to 50 of estimated standard crop evapotranspiration etc or 17 of class a pan evaporation epan for irrigating 3 year old fig trees in the semi arid north central zone of chile however the water requirement was higher as reported by goldhamer and salinas 1999 that found an application of 914 4 mm of water provided the highest fruit yield and profit for fig fruits in the variety of misión negra the amount of applied water was estimated 1787 mm equivalent to 75 of class a pan evaporation by hernandez et al 1994 the rate of eta was lower in leaf senescence stage particularly in the first year possibly due to no green coverage and low swc fig 6 other important factors include values of climate parameters such as lower radiation low temperature and higher air pressure which result in decrease of evaporation from soil surface and also green canopy at the beginning of leaf senescence stage later during the dormancy stage the eta increased mainly because of high rainfall which increased swc in soil surface and consequently resulted in high evaporation however trees experienced the highest eta during the flowering stage when there was high soil water absorption by fig tree roots while figs are normally considered as tolerant plants to water stress dominguez 1990 stover et al 2007 however the rainfed condition has been instrumental in the rigorous development of fig trees which are well adopted to water stress resulting in lower eta with higher efficiency irrigation could increase the average value of eta in both years it is due to higher evaporation from soil and also the higher rate of transpiration under less water deficit the highest value of eta obtained for 2000 l per tree treatment in both years due to higher applied water and the lowest value of eta was obtained for rainfed treatment as it was only depended on rainfall further there was not a significant difference among irrigation treatments in different distances from the tree trunk kamgar haghighi and sepaskhah 2015 showed that green pruning and severe thinning out of one year old lateral branches can decrease the eta in fig orchards 4 3 evaporation the evaporation was higher in spring and winter because of higher soil water content resulting from higher rainfall in these seasons the depth of annual rainfall was similar in two study years 266 and 258 5 mm however higher evaporation in spring of the first year possibly was due to higher rainfall in spring of the first year 54 compared with the spring of the second year due to exposing the soil surface to higher sunshine ot irrigation treatment showed the highest evaporation in summer and spring followed by ut and nt treatments however during autumn and winter evaporation did not have a unique trend for different treatments because of lack of leaves and also no irrigation events during these seasons with no leaves on tree canopy the most important factors affecting evaporation are sunshine and wind speed hillel 2004 which were in similar condition for trees under different treatments higher irrigation water volume provided higher available water for evaporation in the spring and summer during both years however the close volume of observed evaporation in different treatments might be due to spatial soil variation high water loss due to high air temperature and also low vapor pressure as two important factors for soil evaporation hillel 2004 are two negative points for applying summer irrigation during spring and summer higher soil evaporation outside of the canopy area was expected however the reason for pretty low evaporation might be due to the fact that in spring the gravels and small stones are removed from canopy area to outside of canopy by farmers these stones like a mulch prevented soil surface from direct sun radiation and kept the surface soil cooler and consequently decreased soil evaporation 4 4 transpiration compared to evaporation rate higher transpiration rate was obtained at the end of spring and beginning of summer when leaves were fully expanded with the rainy season starting after the harvest stage the increasing rate of evaporation showed higher values than the transpiration rate fig 6 application of supplemental irrigation increased transpiration rate during spring and summer seasons lower transpiration under rainfed conditions indicated that transpiration as a physiological process was reduced under water stress conditions gömöryová et al 2006 hanson et al 2001 zhang et al 1998 reported a higher range of transpiration for wheat crop under supplemental irrigated conditions 215 310 mm compared to rainfed conditions 153 193 mm amounts of transpirated water differ according to surface characteristics meteorological conditions and soil water regime střelcová et al 2006 by closing their stomata during drought trees reduce leaf transpiration and therefore water use leaf stomatal conductance is driven by atmospheric water pressure deficit and soil water supply grossiord et al 2015 in comparison to the second year higher transpiration in the first year 12 can be attributed to higher rainfall in spring of this year 54 and also higher swc 7 in spring of this year compared to those in spring of the second year also higher transpiration in nt treatment can be attributed to higher swc in this treatment compared to ut and ot treatments 4 5 and 4 respectively application of shade netting which is currently used by fig growers in the study area to protect trees from sunburn and birds can be another suitable method for decreasing transpiration rate in drought conditions as reported by anandacoomaraswamy et al 2000 and nicolás et al 2008 4 5 effective rainfall similar to other areas with mediterranean climate in estahban region the rainfall events rarely occur during the warm season summer in addition the rainfall during summer damages fig fruit quality kamgar haghighi and sepaskhah 2015 and rainfall during late spring has a negative effect on fig yield due to interference with the life cycle of blastophaga bees for pollination bagheri and sepaskhah 2014 thus the effective rainfall was considered only for autumn and winter when there was rainfed conditions for all treatments because of no supplemental irrigation during this period the average amount of reff r ratio for all treatments during autumn and winter indicated the high evaporation rate in the study area which was about half of the annual rainfall depth table 6 it shows the importance of the application of evaporation reduction methods in rainfed areas organic mulches of straw tree leaves and paper and manure mulches have been effective in decreasing soil surface water loss by evaporation jafari et al 2012 molinar et al 2001 hatfield et al 2001 reported a 34 50 reduction in soil water evaporation as a result of crop residue mulching jafari et al 2012 recommended almond shell and wheat straw mulches for mulching in estahban fig orchards due to their availability and positive impacts on vegetative growth and yield while there are very low simple correlation coefficients between rainfed crop yield and annual rainfall nix and fitzpatrick 1969 the rainfall occurrence during the different crop growth stages is more relevant mishra et al 2008 sepaskhah et al 2003 bagheri and sepaskhah 2014 stated that the monthly seasonal and annual precipitation indices are able to show the effects of rainfall on the rainfed fig yield and fig yield with rainfall frequent occurrence of 80 is 374 kg ha although the annual precipitation in the area is not high its average depth has satisfied the fig production because of occurrence of high rainfall portion in low temperature seasons the stored effective rainfall can be consumed during the growing season 5 conclusions in this study the average value of reff r ratio for all treatments during autumn and winter indicated the high evaporation rate in the area which was about half of the rainfall therefore surface evaporation reduction measures should be used in the study region there was a high correlation between the swc variation with temporal rainfall distribution especially during autumn and winter however results showed supplemental irrigation can increase swc in critical growth stages leading the reduction in negative impacts of water stress on plants growth investigation on yield morphological characteristics and physiological responses of rainfed fig trees to supplemental irrigation can help determine the sensitive growth stages there was not a uniform swc distribution around trees in different treatments however higher swc with lower temporal change was identified in soil depths deeper than 0 9 m the values of swc were lower in 0 3 0 9 m soil depth possibly due to high root distribution trees with higher swc showed higher eta that were close to the eta in years with normal rainfall compared to irrigation in summer irrigation in early spring kept higher swc for a longer time period in the soil profile irrigation far from trees increased soil surface evaporation especially in summer using operational methods like deep ploughing adding organic matter and using mulch which can increase infiltration in the orchards can increase the effective proportion of the total rainfall and decrease surface evaporation application of supplemental irrigation with 2000 l per tree of water in early spring near tree trunk could be recommended to provide higher swc and lower surface evaporation for rainfed fig in the study area more research on root distribution of rainfed fig trees is needed to find the effect of soil water absorption by roots on swc around trees

11488,this study was carried out in estahban iran during 2013 and 2014 to identify the optimal time and amount of supplemental irrigation at different distances from tree trunks on a rainfed fig orchard this region is distinguished as the largest producer of dried figs in iran and the world and its production is highly dependent on precipitation a split split plot statistical design with four replicates was used to conduct the experiment irrigation treatments based on the position of application around trees were in a micro catchment close to tree trunks in three holes inside of tree canopies with a mean canopy of 3 2 m diameter placed 1 1 1 m from tree trunks and in four holes outside of tree canopies placed 2 1 2 2 m from tree trunks were used in this experiment irrigation time treatments consisted of a in early spring b in mid summer and the three different volumes of irrigation water were used no supplemental irrigation control and either 1000 or 2000 l of irrigation water per tree results showed a high evaporation rate in the area which used nearly half of the rainfall during autumn and winter there was a significant positive correlation between soil water content swc and temporal rainfall distribution as r 0 63 p 0 001 over two years under drought conditions irrigated trees showed higher eta that was close to the eta in years with normal rainfall compared to irrigation in summer irrigation in early spring kept higher swc for a longer time period in the soil profile and irrigation far from trees increased soil surface evaporation especially in summer this study suggests that using supplemental irrigation with 2000 l per tree of water in early spring near tree trunk could provide higher swc and lower surface evaporation for rainfed fig orchards during drought conditions keywords precipitation soil water content evaporation irrigation position drought conditions 1 introduction iran is the top fourth producer and exporter of figs with an average of 75 833 t production in last two decades 1993 2013 fao 2016 most of the fig trees in iran are cultivated in rainfed orchards of estahban region fars province i r of iran providing 90 of dried fig production in iran jafari et al 2012 fig production under rainfed conditions is highly dependent on precipitation and fluctuation in annual precipitation is a major challenge for rainfed fig production bagheri and sepaskhah 2014 the last decade marked the most critical drought that iran has experienced over the past 30 years spanning from 2003 to 2013 etemadi and karami 2016 there was a high frequency of mild drought in recent years in rainfed fig orchards of estahban however the persistence of drought severe drought during the last decade and also an increasing trend in temperature of some months during last 32 years 1980 2012 led to destructive effects on fig trees hoseini et al 2016 in 2010 due to extensive drought events in the region more than 10 of the trees were lost and fruit production was reduced by more than 80 jafari et al 2012 fig orchards in the area are mainly located on foothill slopes which provide farmers to apply micro catchments built perpendicular around trees for collecting rain water similar to other arid and semi arid regions the tendency to use supplemental irrigation in estahban fig orchards has increased during last decade kamyab 2015 sharifzadeh et al 2012 supplemental irrigation is an effective response to alleviating the adverse effects of soil water stress on the yield of rainfed crops during dry spells oweis 1997 supplemental irrigation is defined as the application of limited amount of water to rainfed crops when natural precipitation fails in providing essential soil water for normal plant growth improvement and sustainability of crop yield sharifzadeh et al 2012 showed that inaccessibility to credit water availability and irrigation equipment expenses have limited the application of supplemental irrigation in the area the farmers supplemental irrigation methods are varying from classic irrigation methods such as basin irrigation by using tankers and pressurized hose to modern ones such as drip irrigation while the basin irrigation is the most common irrigation system in the region some farmers irrigate their orchards by flowing water in the ditches dug between tree rows the important features of irrigation method such as the optimum amount time and position of applied irrigation water could be determined by soil water absorption and water requirement of rainfed fig trees during a year also it must be recognized that fig trees are very sensitive to root rot therefore the excess amount of irrigation water must be avoided dominguez 1990 there is lack of information about the water needs and absorption of fig trees flaishman et al 2007 as supplemental irrigation is practiced at the end of rainfall season with drought spells in the region for rainfed fig trees a better understanding of water needs of rainfed fig trees is necessary in order to find an appropriate irrigation schedule and predict appropriate timing and amount of supplemental water application previous researches confirmed the positive role of supplemental irrigation in improving the morphological characteristics and yield of fig trees under drought conditions al desouki et al 2009 found that supplemental irrigation increased vegetative growth yield and fruit quality of sultani fig ficus carica grown in egypt kamgar haghighi and sepaskhah 2015 showed supplemental irrigation treatments including one irrigation at the last month of winter and two irrigation events at the last month of winter and middle of spring improved the morphological characteristics and yield of rainfed fig trees in estahban region moreover honar and sepaskhah 2015 found that the interaction of potassium and supplemental irrigation treatments can improve the yield of rainfed fig trees under drought conditions however lack of information about water requirement of rainfed fig trees in previous studies was problematic knowing the water requirement of rainfed fig trees will help clarify amount timing and application position of supplemental irrigation to achieve higher efficient use of water in the area thus the main objectives of the present study are 1 quantification of changes in soil water content of soil profile around rainfed fig trees 2 estimation of effective rainfall evaporation transpiration and evapotranspiration for each tree the above objectives are evaluated in relation to irrigation timing the quantity of water applied and application distances from the tree trunks 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in a farmer s orchard located in estahban county fars province iran 29 07 n 54 04 e elevation 1749 m above mean sea level and lasted for two years 2013 and 2014 the temperature values of 7 to 41 c respectively represent minimum and maximum conditions in the region the average of annual rainfall is about 354 mm in the area the extreme annual rainfall depths are 92 and 739 mm bagheri and sepaskhah 2014 the average relative humidity which is decreased during the fruit maturing and harvest period is 45 most of the rainfall occurs during late autumn and winter meteorological information was obtained from a meteorological station located in the region fig 1 the gravelly loam texture soil of orchard consisted of 30 sand 48 silt 22 clay and also 30 gravel on the volumetric basis the soil sample showed a ph of 7 54 electric conductivity ec of 1 34 ds m field capacity fc of about 32 volume basis and permanent wilting point pwp of 13 volume basis different growth stages of fig tree were considered in this investigation environmental parameters such as temperature photoperiod and humidity affect the development phases of the fig trees flaishman et al 2007 in estahban orchards shoot growth occurs in spring from mid april to mid may based on environmental conditions leaves usually become fully expanded in may from april to july the flowering and fruiting stages occur and fruit maturation starts in august and will continue till october when the leaves fall and tree dormancy period is started 2 2 experimental methods among many rainfed fig varieties grown at estahban region the izmir cultivar of ficus carica sabz is the dominant one bagheri and sepaskhah 2014 which occupy more than 98 of fig trees faghih and sabet sarvestani 2001 this locally appropriate variety has round canopy vertical growth dense foliage with usually 3 4 trunks this study was carried out on 18 uniform 45 year old cv sabz edible fig in the area studied trees had been planted 10 m apart with the canopy diameter of about 3 2 m as in other rainfed orchards of the region different supplemental irrigation treatments were applied in an experimental setup the experiment was set up as a split split plot in a randomized complete block design rcbd with four replication and 18 fig trees in each block supplemental irrigation treatments included three different application positions around the trunk three different volumes of irrigation water per tree and two different supplemental irrigation times the volume of irrigation water per tree was measured by a flow meter at the inlet of the irrigation pipe three irrigation treatments based on the position of application around trees were 1 irrigation in a micro catchment close to tree trunks nt 2 irrigation in three holes inside of tree canopies with a mean canopy of 3 2 m diameter placed 1 1 1 m from tree trunks ut and 3 irrigation in four holes outside of tree canopies placed 2 1 2 2 m from tree trunks ot two irrigation times were a in early spring b in mid summer and the three different volumes of irrigation water were no supplemental irrigation control and either 1000 or 2000 l of irrigation water per tree soil water content was measured at 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 0 6 0 9 0 9 1 2 and 1 2 1 5 m depths of soil in the monthly interval over the two year experimental period 2013 2014 2014 2015 using the neutron scattering method cpn 503 elite hydroprobe access tubes were installed at three different distances from the tree trunks with the closest possible places to the irrigated area based on the previous works on fig orchards in the area it is necessary to measure soil water content below the 90 cm depth honar and sepaskhah 2015 kamgar haghighi and sepaskhah 2015 however due to gravelly texture of soils in the area installing of access tubes up to 150 cm of soil depth for all trees was extremely difficult and inaccessible so the soil water content measurement was made in only one block 18 trees the pearson s correlation coefficient between swc and rainfall distribution was calculated in each soil layer the statistical analysis was performed using the spss software version 15 0 2 3 evaporation from soil surface microlysimeter can determine the evaporation from the surface of the bare soil under canopy and out of the canopy in this research 18 microlysimeters were installed in the soil 0 1 m away from the access tubes and weighted every two weeks to determine the amount of soil evaporation e mm the bottom perforated microlysimeters were pvc pipes of 100 mm internal diameter and 350 mm height fig 2 since these pipes are completely filled with the field soil and their edge above the soil surface are very small they are accurate enough for the measurements at the field scale the similar microlysimeters have been used in previous research by sepaskhah and ilampour 1995 1996 yarami et al 2011 and azizian and sepaskhah 2014 2 4 actual evapotranspiration the soil water balance method as proposed by jensen 1973 was applied to calculate eta eq 1 actual evapotranspiration eta was estimated for each tree in the volumetric unit m3 under the tree canopy and transformed to depth unit mm based on 100 m2 area for each tree 1 e t a i p δ s d p where i is the applied irrigation water mm p is the precipitation mm δs is the difference in the two consecutive soil water content measurements mm if the soil water content decreased compared to its previous value the sign of δs was considered as positive otherwise it is negative and dp is the deep percolation below root zone for the given period deep percolation was considered to be zero due to the depth of fig root in the area 7 m faghih and sabet sarvestani 2001 and the amount of applied water was not high also runoff was considered to be zero because the irrigation method was basin irrigation based on the difference between actual crop evapotranspiration and evaporation plant transpiration t mm was found for different periods of time and for different treatments the time intervals between irrigation events and soil water content measurements are shown in fig 3 in order to improve the water balance calculations in the second year the swc was measured one day before and one and six days after irrigation event in summer 2 5 effective rainfall effective rainfall reff in this study is defined as a portion of the precipitation that is stored in the plant root zone during a specific time period to meet the potential evapotranspiration requirements tsai et al 2005 in the study area more than 80 of rainfall occurs in autumn and winter faghih 2015 and reff is important during late winter because it provides soil water for the whole growing season the rainfall at the end of spring and also in summer cannot be considered as an effective rainfall due to its low quantity and also the negative effect on yield bagheri and sepaskhah 2014 found that while rainfall in winter is the vital parameter for fig yield rainfall in spring adversely affects the life cycle of caprifig wasp blastophaga psenes l that is used for caprification and consequently decreases the yield the effective rainfall was estimated considering two assumptions first the fig root is deep enough to absorb water percolated below the depth of 150 cm and would be regarded as part of effective rainfall the amount of runoff was also considered to be zero considering the basin irrigation method and also the existence of vast micro catchments around trees therefore the effective rainfall reff mm during tree s dormancy period was determined using the following equation 2 reff r i e where r is the depth of rainfall mm i is the interception by tree canopy mm which is considered zero for winter and autumn due to lack of leaves and e is the soil surface evaporation obtained using microlysimeters mm during dormancy period 3 results 3 1 soil water content the weighted mean of volumetric soil water content swc of three neutron probes installed near each tree in depth of 0 150 cm for different treatments is shown in fig 3 there was a significant positive correlation between swc and rainfall distribution as r 0 63 p 0 001 over two years fig 4 and this correlation coefficient increased for trees under rainfed treatment r 0 65 the positive correlation coefficient for all swc measurements and rainfall distributions for layers 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 0 6 0 9 0 9 1 2 and 1 2 1 5 m depths were 0 62 0 64 0 61 0 60 and 0 58 respectively over two years during the two year period the minimum swc was observed in autumn after harvest till the end of leaf senescence period and the maximum swc occurred at the vegetative phase which is the beginning of spring fig 3 the trend of soil water content for different treatments was increasing during the tree dormancy period in winter and decreasing through the following growth stages the swc in different irrigation application positions from the tree trunk in the 0 150 cm soil depth are compared in fig 3a and b in both years ut and nt showed the lowest and highest swc values respectively however there was not a large difference between swc values of ut and ot in the first year fig 3c and d indicates that the higher irrigation water depth could increase swc in both years whereas in both years higher swc in irrigated treatments continued till the next irrigation event irrigation at the beginning of spring resulted in higher swc in comparison with irrigation in the middle of summer the difference between swc for irrigation timing treatments was more obvious in dry months and the effectiveness of irrigation during summer was more considerable for 2000 l per tree compared to other irrigation depth treatments fig 3e and f 3 2 soil water distribution in the soil profile soil water content in different depths for different treatments is shown in table 1 higher soil water content was observed for depths of more than 0 9 m the percentage increase of swc value in 1 2 1 5 m layer in comparison with that in each layer was obtained using following equation 3 y x 2 x 1 x 1 100 where x2 and x1 are the mean values of swc for 1 2 1 5 m layer and the given layer respectively in the first year the mean soil water content in 1 2 1 5 m depth was almost 11 8 13 13 2 and 6 higher than that for 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 0 6 0 9 and 0 9 1 2 m depths in the second year the difference was about 17 3 14 8 10 9 and 5 4 for 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 0 6 0 9 and 0 9 1 2 m depths indicating a negligible difference in variation of swc in deeper soil the results of overall two year data imply that the average of swc of all treatments in 1 2 1 5 m was nearly 14 6 13 9 12 and 5 7 higher than that in 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 0 6 0 9 and 0 9 1 2 m depths fig 5 shows a 3 dimensional illustration of swc for different treatments during the two years for those trees irrigated with the higher volume of water despite the higher soil water content in all depths during two years the swc measured on 9 44 and 67 days after spring irrigation in the second year decreased by 21 6 and 6 in the following measurements compared with the previous soil water measurements the swc decreased about 8 and 14 at 22 and 47 days after the summer irrigation in the first year and 7 and 5 at 7 and 35 days after the summer irrigation in the second year the results showed that swc in the first 3 top layers of the soil profile 0 0 9 m depth reached back to swc before irrigation in a shorter time for irrigation with 2000 l per tree in summer of second year comparing the mean value of swc for all irrigation position treatments showed that swc of 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 and 0 6 0 9 m of soil profile took around 14 19 and 21 days to reach back to swc value before irrigation event for points of soil water measurement near tree trunks this average time was 10 17 and 22 days for swc in 1 1 1 m far from tree trunks and 5 10 and 18 days for the points out of the canopy the number of days for irrigation with 1000 l per tree in three different mentioned layers were about 9 10 and 15 days for points near the tree trunk 8 11 and 13 days for points in 1 1 1 m distance from tree trunks and 5 8 and 12 days for points out of the canopy while autumn and winter showed the least difference between soil water content in different depths of soil 2 and 1 8 in volumetric percent the maximum difference occurred in summer and spring 2 9 and 2 7 in volumetric percent irrigation near tree trunk showed the least difference in soil water content between depth and soil surface measurements in comparison to other treatments however there was not a significant difference in the average of total swc in soil surface between irrigation position treatments around 0 6 in volumetric percent 3 3 evapotranspiration the eta values were obtained for different growth stages of the fig tree for two years and are shown in tables 2 and 3 the mean rate of eta for the two year study showed that the maximum eta rate occurred during the vegetative stage mean value of 1 77 mm day in spring after that it decreased to 1 46 1 1 0 78 0 57 0 5 and 0 7 mm day during flowering pollination development harvest leaf senescence and dormancy stages respectively at the middle of dormancy period the eta rate started to increase slowly tables 2 and 3 the value of eta was about 19 7 lower in the second year compared to the first year in comparison with the control treatment irrigated trees with 2000 l per tree showed higher eta values 33 8 and 35 9 respectively for the first and the second year for 1000 l per tree treatment this increasing in eta were 8 8 and 14 in the first and second experimental years respectively the difference was higher during spring compared to other seasons for the study period regarding the time of irrigation results showed that irrigation in early spring resulted in higher eta during the vegetative and flowering stages over the two years during the harvest and leaf senescence periods trees under summer irrigation had higher eta compared to trees under spring irrigation over the two year study period 3 4 evaporation in general soil water evaporation from soil surface was higher during winter and spring for both years the amount of evaporation was about 26 3 lower in the second year compared to the first year regarding the irrigation position treatments during the applied irrigation seasons spring and summer the highest evaporation was observed in ot treatment 83 9 mm followed by ut and nt treatments 77 7 and 72 8 mm the overall lowest evaporation for two years was obtained for rainfed treatment 154 3 mm whereas the highest evaporation was obtained for 2000 l per tree irrigation volume with about 15 1 higher than that in rainfed trees by excluding autumn and winter as seasons without irrigation events this difference reached 39 9 fig 6 shows the rate of evaporation and eta for different growing stages of fig trees results showed that the rate of evaporation and eta is very close in the autumn and winter and the maximum difference occurred in spring during the vegetative and flowering stages the rate of evaporation in the first growing stage in early spring was higher than other stages fig 6 however at the development and harvest stages the minimum values of evaporation rate obtained as 0 16 and 0 15 mm day 3 5 transpiration leaf transpiration was determined by subtracting evaporation from eta the mean transpiration amounts per tree in the first and second years were 166 8 and 146 5 mm respectively tables 4 and 5 compared to rainfed treatment irrigation with 2000 and 1000 l per tree enhanced the total transpiration amount for growth stages of trees with green canopy by 19 and 59 1 respectively during these stages ut and ot treatments had 8 5 and 11 5 lower transpiration amounts than nt treatment respectively also irrigation in spring led to 4 1 higher transpiration amount compared to summer irrigation the maximum transpiration rate occurred during the flowering stage in the first year and during the pollination stage in the second year and the minimum transpiration rate occurred during the dormancy stage in both years fig 6 3 6 effective rainfall the mean reff of autumn and winter for different treatments over the two years are shown in table 6 compared to the first year 14 1 higher stored rainfall was obtained in the second year for the first and second years the average amount of reff r ratio for all treatments during autumn were 57 and 59 2 and during winter were 34 8 and 60 7 respectively table 6 considerable differences were not observed among irrigation treatments for this ratio 4 discussion 4 1 soil water content the swc variation changed with temporal rainfall distribution during two years in the rainfed fig orchard this resulted in a similar swc trend for different treatments the agreement between swc and rainfall was more obvious during leaf senescence and dormancy period due to no supplemental irrigation in autumn and winter higher correlation between swc and rainfall for trees under rainfed treatment compared with that in irrigated trees was due to irrigation influence on swc in irrigation treatments fig 4 also the higher correlation coefficient for top layers showed that in top layers swc changes with rainfall amount more quickly compared to that in deeper layers the mean swc value in the dormancy period of the second year increased from 15 to 23 higher rainfall and less water consumption by trees at this time of year are the reasons for this occurrence the swc reached 13 equal to pwp or a little lower for several days in autumn which indicated the water content of fig trees at the end of harvest stage and beginning of the leaf senescence stage higher swc for the irrigated trees during both years showed that supplemental irrigation can play an important role in providing water during the critical periods in rainfed conditions however irrigation in the middle of summer showed less swc increase compared to irrigation at the beginning of spring for two years this occurred due to higher air temperature and evaporation during the summer season the lower difference between soil water content in different depths of soil in autumn and winter compared to spring and summer is due to negligible water absorption by tree roots higher rainfall lower temperature and also dew formation in soil surface layer during the cold seasons the significance and role of dew as a water source cannot be ignored it has been recognized as an important meteorological factor under arid and semi arid conditions fischer et al 2012 ninari and berliner 2002 veste and littmann 2006 the moist deeper soil is the major cause of moisture for dew formation on the soil surface littmann and veste 2008 also the huge amount of gravels on soil surface like a mulch layer decreased the evaporation of soil surface yuan et al 2009 and contributed to high swc variation in top 0 3 m depth of soil profile in two years of study low swc in 0 3 0 9 m depth might be due to high water absorption in this depth the field observations showed the highest root density of fig trees in the area occurred in 0 6 0 9 m depth zare et al 2009 it may be due to the root structure of fig trees the upward water movement resulting from evaporation and capillary porosity and also leakage to deeper depths after heavy rainfall or irrigation can be mentioned as other reasons for water depleting from this layer 0 3 0 9 m depth it was difficult to find a relationship between the soil water content in different depths and distance from the trees the swc for depths lower than 0 9 m was higher and also more consistent compared with top layers of soil during a year this trend occurred for both irrigated and non irrigated treatments lower evaporation from deep layers and also downward water flow could be two reasons for this phenomenon the first days after heavy rainfall or supplemental irrigation the maximum swc value was observed in all depths and in the following days the swc decreased in soil surface layers due to redistribution of water in the soil profile and surface evaporation this reduction was higher after irrigation of spring in the first year compared with the second year due to its higher swc and consequently higher water loss through evaporation analysis of swc after summer irrigation in the second year showed that it took a shorter time for top soil layer to reach back swc values before irrigation also for irrigation position far from tree trunks this time was shorter possibly due to the higher rate of evaporation for position out of canopy area during leaf expansion period the results demonstrated that this time was shorter in irrigation with less volume of water due to high evaporation rate from the water surface during irrigation the difference in swc reduction in different volumes of applied water was less noticeable for soil surface layer in out of canopy position it can be attributed to the higher rate of evaporation and also gravelly textured soil which has low soil water holding capacity these factors also cause the higher difference between swc of depth and soil surface measurements of trees under irrigation far from the tree trunk in comparison to other position treatments however there was not a large difference in swc in soil surface between different irrigation position treatments irrigation in different positions covers only a part of under trees area and feeds the roots partially then it can be helpful for trees through the action of partial root zone drying irrigation prd effects in prd whereas one part of the root system is wetted the rest of the root zone is kept dry and the dry and wet sides alternate based on the scheduled soil water depletion and crop water needs the key positive effect of prd is that the non irrigated side of the crop root system generally sends a soil drying signal from roots to shoot where shoot physiology response such as stomatal opening and leaf expansion can be limited ahmadi et al 2010 hutton and loveys 2011 this mechanism has achieved positive results in fruit orchards such as pear peach olive and pomegranate abrisqueta et al 2008 ghrab et al 2013 kang and zhang 2004 parvizi et al 2014 4 2 evapotranspiration considering the values of eta we can schedule supplemental irrigation during the critical period of growing season the lower value of eta in the second year 286 2 mm compared with that in the first year 356 5 mm may be a result of lower annual rainfall in spring of this year the results are close to tapia et al 2003 which showed the adequacy of 220 mm year 2200 m3 ha year equivalent to 50 of estimated standard crop evapotranspiration etc or 17 of class a pan evaporation epan for irrigating 3 year old fig trees in the semi arid north central zone of chile however the water requirement was higher as reported by goldhamer and salinas 1999 that found an application of 914 4 mm of water provided the highest fruit yield and profit for fig fruits in the variety of misión negra the amount of applied water was estimated 1787 mm equivalent to 75 of class a pan evaporation by hernandez et al 1994 the rate of eta was lower in leaf senescence stage particularly in the first year possibly due to no green coverage and low swc fig 6 other important factors include values of climate parameters such as lower radiation low temperature and higher air pressure which result in decrease of evaporation from soil surface and also green canopy at the beginning of leaf senescence stage later during the dormancy stage the eta increased mainly because of high rainfall which increased swc in soil surface and consequently resulted in high evaporation however trees experienced the highest eta during the flowering stage when there was high soil water absorption by fig tree roots while figs are normally considered as tolerant plants to water stress dominguez 1990 stover et al 2007 however the rainfed condition has been instrumental in the rigorous development of fig trees which are well adopted to water stress resulting in lower eta with higher efficiency irrigation could increase the average value of eta in both years it is due to higher evaporation from soil and also the higher rate of transpiration under less water deficit the highest value of eta obtained for 2000 l per tree treatment in both years due to higher applied water and the lowest value of eta was obtained for rainfed treatment as it was only depended on rainfall further there was not a significant difference among irrigation treatments in different distances from the tree trunk kamgar haghighi and sepaskhah 2015 showed that green pruning and severe thinning out of one year old lateral branches can decrease the eta in fig orchards 4 3 evaporation the evaporation was higher in spring and winter because of higher soil water content resulting from higher rainfall in these seasons the depth of annual rainfall was similar in two study years 266 and 258 5 mm however higher evaporation in spring of the first year possibly was due to higher rainfall in spring of the first year 54 compared with the spring of the second year due to exposing the soil surface to higher sunshine ot irrigation treatment showed the highest evaporation in summer and spring followed by ut and nt treatments however during autumn and winter evaporation did not have a unique trend for different treatments because of lack of leaves and also no irrigation events during these seasons with no leaves on tree canopy the most important factors affecting evaporation are sunshine and wind speed hillel 2004 which were in similar condition for trees under different treatments higher irrigation water volume provided higher available water for evaporation in the spring and summer during both years however the close volume of observed evaporation in different treatments might be due to spatial soil variation high water loss due to high air temperature and also low vapor pressure as two important factors for soil evaporation hillel 2004 are two negative points for applying summer irrigation during spring and summer higher soil evaporation outside of the canopy area was expected however the reason for pretty low evaporation might be due to the fact that in spring the gravels and small stones are removed from canopy area to outside of canopy by farmers these stones like a mulch prevented soil surface from direct sun radiation and kept the surface soil cooler and consequently decreased soil evaporation 4 4 transpiration compared to evaporation rate higher transpiration rate was obtained at the end of spring and beginning of summer when leaves were fully expanded with the rainy season starting after the harvest stage the increasing rate of evaporation showed higher values than the transpiration rate fig 6 application of supplemental irrigation increased transpiration rate during spring and summer seasons lower transpiration under rainfed conditions indicated that transpiration as a physiological process was reduced under water stress conditions gömöryová et al 2006 hanson et al 2001 zhang et al 1998 reported a higher range of transpiration for wheat crop under supplemental irrigated conditions 215 310 mm compared to rainfed conditions 153 193 mm amounts of transpirated water differ according to surface characteristics meteorological conditions and soil water regime střelcová et al 2006 by closing their stomata during drought trees reduce leaf transpiration and therefore water use leaf stomatal conductance is driven by atmospheric water pressure deficit and soil water supply grossiord et al 2015 in comparison to the second year higher transpiration in the first year 12 can be attributed to higher rainfall in spring of this year 54 and also higher swc 7 in spring of this year compared to those in spring of the second year also higher transpiration in nt treatment can be attributed to higher swc in this treatment compared to ut and ot treatments 4 5 and 4 respectively application of shade netting which is currently used by fig growers in the study area to protect trees from sunburn and birds can be another suitable method for decreasing transpiration rate in drought conditions as reported by anandacoomaraswamy et al 2000 and nicolás et al 2008 4 5 effective rainfall similar to other areas with mediterranean climate in estahban region the rainfall events rarely occur during the warm season summer in addition the rainfall during summer damages fig fruit quality kamgar haghighi and sepaskhah 2015 and rainfall during late spring has a negative effect on fig yield due to interference with the life cycle of blastophaga bees for pollination bagheri and sepaskhah 2014 thus the effective rainfall was considered only for autumn and winter when there was rainfed conditions for all treatments because of no supplemental irrigation during this period the average amount of reff r ratio for all treatments during autumn and winter indicated the high evaporation rate in the study area which was about half of the annual rainfall depth table 6 it shows the importance of the application of evaporation reduction methods in rainfed areas organic mulches of straw tree leaves and paper and manure mulches have been effective in decreasing soil surface water loss by evaporation jafari et al 2012 molinar et al 2001 hatfield et al 2001 reported a 34 50 reduction in soil water evaporation as a result of crop residue mulching jafari et al 2012 recommended almond shell and wheat straw mulches for mulching in estahban fig orchards due to their availability and positive impacts on vegetative growth and yield while there are very low simple correlation coefficients between rainfed crop yield and annual rainfall nix and fitzpatrick 1969 the rainfall occurrence during the different crop growth stages is more relevant mishra et al 2008 sepaskhah et al 2003 bagheri and sepaskhah 2014 stated that the monthly seasonal and annual precipitation indices are able to show the effects of rainfall on the rainfed fig yield and fig yield with rainfall frequent occurrence of 80 is 374 kg ha although the annual precipitation in the area is not high its average depth has satisfied the fig production because of occurrence of high rainfall portion in low temperature seasons the stored effective rainfall can be consumed during the growing season 5 conclusions in this study the average value of reff r ratio for all treatments during autumn and winter indicated the high evaporation rate in the area which was about half of the rainfall therefore surface evaporation reduction measures should be used in the study region there was a high correlation between the swc variation with temporal rainfall distribution especially during autumn and winter however results showed supplemental irrigation can increase swc in critical growth stages leading the reduction in negative impacts of water stress on plants growth investigation on yield morphological characteristics and physiological responses of rainfed fig trees to supplemental irrigation can help determine the sensitive growth stages there was not a uniform swc distribution around trees in different treatments however higher swc with lower temporal change was identified in soil depths deeper than 0 9 m the values of swc were lower in 0 3 0 9 m soil depth possibly due to high root distribution trees with higher swc showed higher eta that were close to the eta in years with normal rainfall compared to irrigation in summer irrigation in early spring kept higher swc for a longer time period in the soil profile irrigation far from trees increased soil surface evaporation especially in summer using operational methods like deep ploughing adding organic matter and using mulch which can increase infiltration in the orchards can increase the effective proportion of the total rainfall and decrease surface evaporation application of supplemental irrigation with 2000 l per tree of water in early spring near tree trunk could be recommended to provide higher swc and lower surface evaporation for rainfed fig in the study area more research on root distribution of rainfed fig trees is needed to find the effect of soil water absorption by roots on swc around trees

11489,this paper examines the economic feasibility of a subsurface irrigation system for a representative corn producer in norfolk county ontario canada we use stochastic capital budgeting to generate a distribution of net present values for this investment future corn yields and corn prices were treated as distributions under our base assumptions the subsurface drip irrigation system has a negative expected net present value meaning that it would not be a worthwhile investment for a corn farmer at the present time the system s ability to increase yields has the largest effect on its expected net present value attempts to improve the system s economic value should focus on increasing its effect on yields in years with typical agronomic conditions with reasonable assumptions for other system parameters the initial cost of a 40 5 ha system would have to be reduced to 165 000 to have a positive net present value 50 of the time or the system would have to increase corn yields by 33 in years with typical growing conditions to achieve the same net present value outcome keywords subsurface drip irrigation stochastic capital budget corn norfolk county ontario 1 introduction corn crops in the sand plains region of ontario canada are not usually irrigated but in 2012 after four months of drought conditions and facing significantly lower yields growers in the region were considering the merits of irrigating their corn crops government of canada 2012 by the next growing season at least one subsurface drip irrigation system had been installed and irrigation was still a topic of conversation at growers meetings in the area corn growers in the sand plains region have seen drought years in the past in 2007 2002 and 2001 seasonal precipitation was more than 15 below the 15 year average in the area government of canada 2017 colombo et al 2007 suggest that inadequate precipitation may be even more of a problem in the future as ontario s climate changes they projected that in the warm season from april to september the sand plains region will see between 0 and 10 less precipitation this forecast prompted morand et al 2017 to propose that the provincial government fund demonstration projects to showcase the benefits of subsurface drip irrigation but is installing a subsurface drip irrigation system a worthwhile investment for a corn grower in the sand plains region considering the merits of a subsurface drip irrigation system is an issue that extends beyond a region of sandy soil in ontario lobell et al 2014 showed that in iowa indiana and illinois in the united states over the period from 1995 to 2012 corn yields became more sensitive to drought stress they suspect that this occurred because water availability has become more of a limiting factor in yields as other hinderances to production have been mitigated in this paper we consider the economic value of a subsurface drip irrigation system from the perspective of a corn grower to do that we use stochastic capital budgeting of a representative installation in the sand plains region of ontario we also explore how the budget parameters affect the system s value and we compare the value of a subsurface irrigation system s technical efficiency to that of a centre pivot system other research has examined the economic feasibility of subsurface drip irrigation systems notably camp 1998 o brien et al 1998 and heard et al 2012 camp 1998 looked at the economics of using a subsurface drip irrigation system to grow corn in the great plains region of the united states o brien et al 1998 reviewed the literature on the use of subsurface drip irrigation systems and touched on their economic viability finally heard et al 2012 evaluated the economics of a subsurface drip irrigation system used to grow alfalfa pasture in australia s murray darling basin however the economic feasibility of this technology has not been studied for corn production in southern ontario an area with agronomic and climate conditions that differ from those of past studies furthermore and of importance to growers and agronomists beyond this particular region past studies have not taken into account uncertainty in corn prices and yields in their analysis of economic feasibility 2 material and methods our analysis is based on a representative subsurface drip irrigation system similar to one installed in a commercial trial corn field in norfolk county ontario canada we assumed that our representative system has the same components and layout as the system in norfolk county except that our analysis is scaled to a 40 5 ha or 100 acre field whereas the commercial trial system covers 32 37 ha we developed a stochastic capital budget for this representative situation including equipment and installation costs as well as annual changes in operating costs and revenues in our base results given that this is a new technology for this region we assumed a conservative useful life of 15 years for the installation we consider a longer useful life in sensitivity analysis we applied a real discount rate of 5 in calculating present values the capital budget subtracts the initial equipment and installation costs from the present value of the annual changes in net revenues changes in annual revenues minus changes in annual costs to generate a net present value a positive net present value indicates that the investment would be attractive to a farmer with a real rate of time preference of 5 future corn prices and yields are modelled as distributions in our capital budget we used stochastic simulation with these distributions to generate a distribution of net present values the mean of the net present values indicates the expected value of the system and the standard deviation gives a sense of how sure we can be that the system will have a particular net present value we can also calculate the probability that the system will have a positive net present value corn prices were modelled as a normal distribution based on historical real ontario corn prices the distribution of corn yields in the absence of irrigation was modelled as a mixture distribution based on previous work by tolhurst and ker 2013 1 1 although the work by tolhurst and ker 2013 is unpublished the algorithm they use to estimate the parameters of the haldimand norfolk corn yield distribution is presented in tolhurst and ker 2015 they found that past corn yields in the haldimand norfolk census subdivision 2 2 census subdivisions are geographical areas defined in statistics canada s standard geographical classification the area in which our representative field lies can be characterized by a mixture distribution that is made up of two normal distributions fig 1 illustrates corn yields without irrigation for year 1 in our simulation the mixture distribution consists of two normal sub distributions each with its own mean and standard deviation one of the sub distributions which we call the typical years sub distribution applies to the case of yields in years with run of the mill agronomic conditions i e those that usually occur in the haldimand norfolk census subdivision it is this sub distribution that created the taller and wider yellow portion of the histogram in fig 1 tolhurst and ker 2013 report that yields come from the typical years subdistribution 89 3 of the time the rest of the time yields come from what we call the exceptional years sub distribution which characterizes corn yields that occur in years with close to ideal agronomic conditions the exceptional years sub distribution produced the shorter orange portion of the histogram in fig 1 yields come from the exceptional years sub distribution 10 7 of the time in the stochastic simulation of net present values randomly drawing one year s corn yield from the mixture distribution is a two step process in the first step we draw from a continuous uniform distribution defined over the interval from 0 to 1 if the value drawn is less than 0 893 then in the second step we draw a random value from the typical years sub distribution on the other hand if in the first step a value greater than or equal to 0 893 is drawn from the uniform distribution then in the second step we draw a random value from the exceptional years sub distribution this process is repeated 100 000 times for each of the 15 years of the base scenario tolhurst and ker 2013 estimated that there has been an upward trend in corn yields in the haldimand norfolk census subdivision we incorporated their estimated trend into our mixture distribution by assuming that the mean of the normal years sub distribution increased 1 02 per year and that the mean of the exceptional years sub distribution increased 1 14 per year given these upward trends in the last period of our simulation in year 15 the mean yield in the typical years sub distribution is roughly 13 higher than it is at the beginning of the simulation and the mean yield in the exceptional years sub distribution is about 15 higher than it is at the beginning to account for the effect that subsurface drip irrigation has on corn yields in each year of the simulation we multiplied expected corn yields without irrigation by a fixed proportion we assumed the system would increase corn yields by 30 in typical years and by 10 in exceptional years our assumption that the system would increase yields by 30 in typical years is based in part on the work of powell and wright 1993 in table 4 of their paper one can see that over the four year study period the irrigated treatment plots averaged 28 8 higher yields than the unirrigated controls given this finding and the fact that in our yield distribution 89 3 of the corn yields are coming from the typical years sub distribution it seems reasonable to assume at least as a starting point for our analysis that the average yield in the typical years sub distribution would be increased by 30 as for the effect the system has in exceptional years we assumed that yields drawn from the exceptional years sub distribution would be 10 higher the argument for increasing the mean of the exceptional years sub distribution by 10 is that even with ideal weather and crop management on average corn grown with a subsurface drip irrigation system will have a higher yield than corn grown without a subsurface drip irrigation system this is because a subsurface drip irrigation system affords a level of control over soil nutrients that is not possible on an unirrigated field a subsurface drip irrigation system that has a liquid fertilizer pump which is the case with our representative system can be used to supplement macro nutrients in the soil the relative simplicity of doing so means that even small deficiencies in macro nutrients can be corrected this would not be the case on an unirrigated field therefore a 10 increase in yields in exceptional years is reasonable as a baseline assumption in addition to generating results for our base scenario we used sensitivity analysis to explore how the distribution of net present values would be affected by changes to critical parameters and assumptions we also calculated sensitivity elasticities to provide perspective on the relative importance of these critical parameters on the system s mean net present value lastly we undertook breakeven analyses 2 1 a representative subsurface drip irrigation system and corn field our representative subsurface drip irrigation system covers 40 5 ha of coarse textured sandy loam soil it is laid out in 6 zones each zone has a pair of manifolds and flush lines with drip lines running between them the drip lines are buried 36 cm underground and spaced 112 cm apart the emitters in the drip lines are spaced 61 cm apart the drip lines have an inside diameter of 22 mm and a wall thickness of 0 33 mm the system is capable of delivering water to two zones at a time and can apply 6 4 mm of water in a 6 h period the system is powered by a three phase electric motor liquid fertilizer tanks and an injector pump can be used to add fertilizer and macronutrients to the irrigation water before it is delivered to the root zone of the crop the pumping equipment is kept in a used 6 m 2 35 m 2 3 m shipping container that has been modified to serve as the pump shed 2 2 stochastic net present value of a subsurface drip irrigation system we calculated the system s net present value over t years as 1 npv c 0 t 1 t y t wi y t ni p t c a δ ce t δ γ t tsic t 1 s t 1 d t where npv is the net present value in real 2013 cad c 0 is the capital cost of the subsurface drip irrigation system in real 2013 cad t is the one year time period t is the last period in years that the system affects the producer s taxes revenue and expenses y t wi is the expected corn yield in metric tons per hectare in period t when the subsurface drip irrigation system is being used y t ni is

the salvage value in real 2013 cad of the subsurface drip irrigation system in the last year t that it is used d is the real discount rate it should be noted that all prices are reported in terms of their real 2013 canadian dollar values we chose to use real values because doing so eliminates the need to forecast the rate of inflation the discount rate d is also reported in terms of its real value using a real discount rate means that it takes into account the producer s time preference and their perception of the financial risk involved in purchasing and operating a subsurface drip irrigation system in the following subsections we will walkthrough eq 1 and explain what we chose as baseline values for its parameters 2 2 1 capital cost of the subsurface drip irrigation system table 1 presents the elements included in the system s capital cost the cost of components are based on price quotes from a local irrigation equipment supplier and installation costs follow those of bakker 2013 we assumed that the cost of labor to install the system is 10 50 h and that the pump shed and cement slab cost 2134 the total estimated capital cost of the representative subsurface drip irrigation system is 187 360 we assumed that an irrigation pond was already established near the irrigated field and we did not include the cost of this pond in our capital budget this was the case on the field in norfolk county that inspired our representative system a producer who does not have a source of irrigation water already available would have to account for the cost of establishing a source of irrigation water this would include the price of permits and the cost of building a pond a well or a pipe to a river or lake we also did not include the cost of running three phase electricity from a utility line to the pump shed this is a cost that could be minimized by placing the system s electric pump close to a utility line or by placing it close to a nearby building that already has three phase electricity running to it if it is not possible to tap into a source of three phase electricity then the producer would have to consider using a diesel motor to run the system s pumps 2 2 2 system longevity as we stated earlier subsurface drip irrigation systems are not currently widely used on field crops in ontario so we have no local data on the life expectancy of this equipment under ontario weather conditions medina et al 2011 identified systems that had been in operation between 6 and 20 years in texas more recently lamm and rogers 2017 reported on a system used for 27 growing seasons at a research centre in kansas united states we chose a useful life of 15 years as our baseline assumption this is the middle of the range reported by medina et al 2011 and seems appropriate as a baseline assumption however we undertook a sensitivity and breakeven analysis on the system s useful life to see how its net present value changes when it can be used for 10 years and for 20 years 2 2 3 characterizing expected corn yields without a subsurface drip irrigation we defined unirrigated corn yields using the following distribution 2 y t ni λ n α n β n t σ n 2 1 λ n α e β e t σ e 2 where y t ni is the yield in metric tons per hectare without the subsurface drip irrigation system in year t λ is the probability of a yield coming from the typical years sub distribution rather than the exceptional years sub distribution α n is the mean yield in metric tons per hectare in the typical years normal sub distribution β n is the annual change in the mean of the typical years sub distribution in metric tons per hectare σ n 2 is the variance of yields in the typical years normal sub distribution in metric tons per hectare squared α e is the mean yield in metric tons per hectare in the exceptional years normal sub distribution β e is the annual change in the mean of the exceptional years sub distribution in metric tons per hectare σ e 2 is the variance of yields in the exceptional years normal sub distribution in metric tons per hectare squared the parameters for the distribution are taken from tolhurst and ker 2013 we set λ to 0 893 we mentioned earlier that we assumed an upward trend in yields to do that we set β n to 0 0842 metric tons hectare and β e to 0 1225 metric tons hectare the mean yield in the typical years sub distribution α n was set to 8 2582 metric tons hectare 3 3 tolhurst and ker 2013 report their results in bushels per acre these values were converted to metric ton hectare using the following conversion factor 1 bushel acre 0 0628 metric tons hectare as per johanns 2013 and the mean yield in the exceptional years sub distribution α e was set to 10 748 metric tons hectare we got these values by accounting for the fact that tolhurst and ker 2013 report their parameters assuming that t 0 is the year 1949 whereas in our simulation we assume t 0 is 2013 a difference of 64 years thus to get the parameters for our simulation we took the mean yield in typical years reported by tolhurst and ker 2013 and added β n 64 to it which gave us our value for α n and we took the mean yield in exceptional years reported by tolhurst and ker 2013 and added β e 64 to get our value for α e lastly we assumed again based on tolhurst and ker 2013 that the variance of both the typical and exceptional years sub distributions do not change from year to year in our simulation the variance in typical years σ n 2 was set to 0 4266 metric tons2 hectare2 the variance of yields in the exceptional years sub distribution σ e 2 is 0 02667 metric tons2 hectare2 2 2 4 characterizing how the subsurface drip irrigation system affects expected corn yields in eq 1 corn yields when there is a subsurface drip irrigation system in place are represented by the y t wi parameter which accounts for the system s effect on corn yields by adding a fixed proportion to the without irrigation yield distribution we explained earlier the two step process used to simulate one year s corn yield without irrigation to get a value for y t wi we took the without irrigation yield and multiplied it by 1 30 if it came from the typical years sub distribution and by 1 10 if it came from exceptional years sub distribution the proportional increases in yields were kept the same throughout the system s useful life 2 2 5 the price of grain corn we used a normal distribution to model grain corn prices the distribution had a mean of 191 23 metric ton and a variance of 1572 1 2 metric ton2 these are the mean and variance of real grain corn prices in ontario from 1985 to 2013 as reported by statistics canada 2014a b c 2 2 6 how using the subsurface drip irrigation system affects expenses operating a subsurface drip irrigation system requires labor input both to activate the system and to carry out maintenance there is also the cost of materials used for repairs and the cost of electricity to operate the water pump and the fertilizer injection pump these are recurring annual expenses that are captured by the δce t parameter in eq 1 for irrigation labor maintenance and repairs we used lamm et al s 2012 estimate of 35 4 hectare year 4 4 lamm et al 2012 report their costs in usd acre their values were converted to 2013 cad hectare using the following conversion factors 1 acre 0 4047 ha as per johanns 2013 1cad 1usd because this was the average exchange rate in 2012 and 1 2012 cad 1 006 2013 cad as per statistics canada 2014a b c we used the institute of agriculture and natural resources at the university of nebraska lincoln irrigation cost calculator and the parameters for our system to get an estimated electricity cost of 12 8 hectare year added together the annual expenses to operate the system are 48 2 hectare year or 1 952 year for a 40 5 ha field 2 2 7 taxes subsidies discount rate and the salvage value of the subsurface drip irrigation system part of calculating the change in taxes involves determining the change in expenses which we explained earlier and determining the change in revenue the change in revenue is the difference in yields between an unirrigated field and one that is irrigated which is explained above multiplied by the price of corn and the area being irrigated the other part of determining the change in taxes is calculating the capital cost allowance in each year we did this by using the canada revenue agency s 2013 form t2042 statement of farming activities mathematically the change in taxes in each year from using the subsurface drip irrigation system can be represented as 3 δ γ t y t wi y t ni p t c a δ ce t d t tr t where δγ t is the change in income taxes in year t in real 2013 cad y t wi is the expected corn yield in metric tons per hectare in period t when a subsurface drip irrigation system is being used y t ni is the expected corn yield in metric tons per hectare in period t when there is no subsurface drip irrigation system p t c is the real 2013 cad per metric ton price of grain corn in period t a is the area of the field being irrigated in hectares δce t is the change in expenses in period t in real 2013 cad d t is the capital cost allowance for the subsurface drip irrigation system in period t in real 2013 cad tr t is the proportional tax rate in period t the tax rate tr t was set to 30 in each period t as a baseline assumption we set the tsic t 1 parameter in eq 1 to zero because we could not identify a source of funding that would be available to a corn grower in ontario the growing forward 2 program does offer funding to someone who chooses to install an irrigation system with relatively high technical water use efficiency however as the ontario soil and crop improvement association 2013 s guide for producers explains producers installing an irrigation system on previously unirrigated land are ineligible for funding which means that our representative system does not qualify however in our sensitivity analysis we did consider a scenario where the system is eligible to receive a subsidy the second to last parameter in eq 1 to discuss is the system s salvage value s t we assumed that the system would be sold for parts at the end of its useful life the parts that could be sold would be the electric motors the variable speed drive and the sand filters we assumed a salvage value of 30 or 6 755 for the baseline capital cost the drip lines pipes and other system components in the field are assumed to have no value once they have been installed finally we assumed a real discount rate d of 5 as baseline assumption all of the baseline parameters used in the stochastic net present value calculation are presented in table 2 2 3 the relative value of a subsurface drip irrigation system s technical efficiency we compared the technical efficiency of a subsurface drip irrigation system to that of a centre pivot system in our baseline assumptions the grower does not pay other than the cost of electricity for each cubic meter of water they pump into the irrigation system however this may not always be the case what if a grower did have to pay for water because a subsurface drip irrigation system is more technically efficient than a centre pivot introduction of a cost for water would make a subsurface drip system more economically attractive to a producer o brien et al 1998 estimate that a centre pivot system irrigating approximately the same area as a subsurface drip irrigation system will have a 33 lower capital cost they also estimate that energy and maintenance cost are 12 5 higher per hectare for a centre pivot system than for a subsurface drip system thus we re ran the stochastic simulation and changed the capital cost and yearly expenses to reflect those of a centre pivot system and calculated the mean net present value next we assumed that a centre pivot s irrigation efficiency is 80 and that a subsurface drip system s is 95 additionally we assumed that growing a premium corn crop in ontario s sand plains region requires 100 mm of water to be applied to the crop under these assumptions using a centre pivot system would require 125 mm of water to be pumped and the subsurface drip system would need 105 mm this means that in one growing season irrigating a 40 5 ha field with a centre pivot system would use roughly 7993 m3 more water than a subsurface drip irrigation system finally we calculated the value of the subsurface drip irrigation system s efficiency by dividing the difference in net present value between the two systems by the difference in water use between the two 2 4 sensitivity analysis in the sensitivity analysis we changed key parameters in the stochastic net present value calculation to see how the distribution of net present values would be affected table 3 presents the scenarios that we considered in each scenario only one parameter is changed for example in scenario 1 with the lower capital cost only the c 0 parameter in eq 1 is changed reduced to 168 624 everything else stays the same 2 5 mean net present value elasticity the mean net present value elasticity measures the percentage change in the mean net present value for a 1 change in a parameter a mean net present value elasticity is dimensionless and allows comparisons across parameters or factors with different units of measurement among other things this measure provides guidance for researchers in that it indicates where the greatest gains can be made with respect to economic feasibility to calculate the mean net present value elasticity of a single parameter we increased it by 1 and re ran the stochastic simulation this gave us a new distribution of net present values we then compared this new distribution to what we got under our initial assumptions the one exception is the mean elasticity of the years parameter in that case we increased the years parameter by one year from 15 years to 16 years we calculated the mean net present value elasticity using the following equation 4 ε npv x δ npv δ x npv m npv b npv m npv b 2 x m x b x m x b 2 where ε npv x is the mean net present value elasticity of parameter x x is the parameter whose elasticity is being calculated δ npv is the percent change in the mean net present value δx is the percent change in parameter x npv m is the mean of net present values in real 2013 cad in the stochastic simulation where the parameter in question x has been increased 1 npv b is the mean of net present values in real 2013 cad in the stochastic simulation where the parameter in question x is at its baseline value x m is the modified value of parameter x x b is the baseline value of parameter x when calculating the change in the mean net present value if it was negative we used its absolute value consequently if the mean net present value of the system was negative we calculated the elasticity of losses if the mean net present value was positive we calculated the elasticity of gains from using the system 2 6 breakeven analysis we used a breakeven analysis to determine how much one of the irrigation system s parameters would have to change in order for the system to be a worthwhile investment the system breaks even when 50 of the net present values calculated in the simulation are positive and the other 50 are negative when this occurs the system has equal probability of having a positive net present value as it does a negative net present value put an other way the value of the system parameter that returns a distribution of results with a median of zero is the breakeven value for that parameter we found a parameter s breakeven value by repeating the stochastic simulation several times and each time we gradually increased the value of the parameter in question we started with a parameter value that produced a median net present value well below zero and gradually increased it until the simulation s median was well over zero graphing the series of parameter values and their resulting median net present values allowed us to infer the breakeven value for that parameter 3 results and discussion 3 1 results under baseline assumptions fig 2 presents the results of the stochastic simulation that calculates the net present value of using a 40 5 ha subsurface drip irrigation system to grow corn in norfolk county ontario for 15 years the histogram is made up of 100 000 net present values and has the following properties the average net present value is 16 282 402 hectare the median net present value is 16 171 399 hectare and the standard deviation is 10 606 262 hectare 90 of the net present values fall between 33 969 839 hectare and 885 22 hectare and 6 of them are greater than or equal to 0 this means that if the baseline assumptions about the representative subsurface drip irrigation system are correct then the producer would be better off not purchasing the system another way of looking at the results from our simulation is in terms of the system s costs and benefits the benefits of using the system are the yearly capital cost allowance the salvage value in the last year and the yearly gain in yields with their associated increase in revenue in our simulation the system increases revenue by 18 024 year on average the system s yearly costs are its operating and maintenance costs which we assumed to be 1952 year in the simulation the system s value benefits minus costs in each year is positive in all 15 years in each year the system has a value of approximately 22 000 year 5 5 it is not the same in each year because of year to year changes in capital cost allowance and the one time benefit of the system s salvage value at the end of its useful life because the value in each year is being discounted at 5 the system s discounted value is not the same in each year for example in the simulation on average the discounted value in the second year the system is used 2014 is 19 514 whereas on average the system s discounted value in the thirteenth year of use 2026 is 7251 although in the simulation the system has a positive value in each year discounting causes its value in the future to be lower than its value closer to when it is first installed when the discounted values of the system in each year are added together the result is the system s present value in the stochastic simulation on average the system s present value is 171 101 comparing this to its capital cost 187 360 we see that the system earns back approximately 91 of its initial cost 3 2 the relative value of a subsurface drip irrigation system s technical efficiency if we run the net present value simulation to reflect the lower capital cost and higher operating cost of a centre pivot system while keeping other parameters the same as for the subsurface drip irrigation system we find that a centre pivot system has an average net present value of 30 069 that is 46 351 more than our hypothetical subsurface drip irrigation system we can calculate the value of the subsurface drip irrigation system s efficiency relative to the centre pivot system by dividing the difference in net present value between the two systems 46 351 by the difference in water use between the two systems 7993 m3 which gives 5 8 m3 or 0 58 cents l this implies that if a corn grower has to pay more than 5 8 m3 for water then they would be better off purchasing a subsurface drip system than a centre pivot system 3 3 results of sensitivity analysis 3 3 1 capital cost sensitivity analysis scenario 1 in the baseline scenario we assumed the subsurface drip irrigation system has a capital cost of 187 360 this baseline value is for a system with all new components it is possible for a grower to lower the system s capital cost for example by using second hand sand filters rather than buying new ones scenario 1 in the sensitivity analysis considers the effects on the distribution of net present values if the capital cost is changed in the first case the capital cost is set 10 lower than our baseline assumption the blue histogram in fig 3 shows that when the system costs 168 624 its average net present value is closer to being positive the mean net present value of the blue histogram is 1863 compared to 16 282 for the grey baseline histogram furthermore with this lower capital cost there is a higher chance that the system will have a positive net present value in the blue histogram 44 of net present values are greater than or equal to zero whereas only 6 are positive in the grey baseline histogram scenario 1 also considers the possibility that our baseline capital cost was an under estimate a 10 increase in the capital cost produces the red histogram in fig 3 the red histogram is further to the left than the result under baseline assumptions when the system has a capital cost of 206 096 it has a mean net present value of 30 758 and almost none of the net present values in the stochastic simulation are positive 3 3 2 annual expenses sensitivity analysis scenario 2 in the baseline scenario we assumed that expenses δce t in eq 1 would be 1952 year in scenario 2 we consider the possibility that this was an over estimate or conversely that it was an under estimate the results are illustrated in fig 4 it shows that increasing or decreasing the change in expenses has a relatively small impact on the system s net present value the blue histogram in fig 4 shows that lowering yearly expenses to 1755 year leads to a distribution of net present values that is slightly further to the right on the x axis than the baseline results the blue histogram s mean net present value is 14 851 which is 1431 higher than the baseline scenario conversely when expenses are higher 2146 year the histogram shifts to the left on the x axis the red histogram s mean net present value is 17 688 which is 1406 lower than the baseline scenario s 3 3 3 system s effect on corn yields sensitivity analysis scenarios 3 and 4 the first case in scenario 3 considers what would happen if the subsurface drip irrigation system has no effect on corn yields in exceptional years the result is illustrated by the red histogram in fig 5 it shows that the distribution of net present values moves further into the negative and the distribution has more variance the mean net present value of the red histogram is 23 240 which is 6958 lower than the grey baseline histogram additionally the red histogram with a standard deviation of 14 454 is wider than the grey histogram which has a standard deviation of 10 606 this implies that there is more uncertainty in the net present value of the system when it has no effect on yields in years where agronomic conditions are almost ideal scenario 3 also considers what happens to the distribution of net present values if the system has more of an effect on corn yields in exceptional years to do this we ran the simulation again assuming that in a year with close to perfect agronomic condition the system increases yields by 20 the result is illustrated by the blue histogram in fig 5 in this case the average net present value is higher than it is in the baseline scenario the blue histogram has a mean of 9367 which is 6915 higher than baseline result what is more the blue histogram has a narrower range of net present values this can be seen in the blue histogram s width which is narrower than the histogram from the baseline scenario specifically the blue histogram s standard deviation of net present values is 8546 which implies that if the system has more of an effect on yields in exceptional years there is more certainty in its value to a producer now turning to scenario 4 where the first case considers the possibility that the 30 increase in typical year yields is an overestimate the red histogram in fig 6 shows that when the system increases yields by only 20 in years with typical agronomic conditions then the mean net present value falls to 60 372 the distribution of net present values is also narrower than it was in the baseline scenario the standard deviation of the red histogram is 6177 this implies that if the system has less of an effect on yields in normal years there is more certainty in its value to the corn grower the second case in scenario 4 considers what happens to the distribution of net present values if the system increases yields more than it did in our baseline assumption the blue histogram in fig 6 shows that when the subsurface drip irrigation system increases yields in typical years by 40 the distribution of net present values has a mean of 27 817 moreover 96 of the net present values are equal to or greater than zero this is a significant jump from the baseline results where 6 had values equal to or above zero although the mean net present value is higher when the system has a greater effect on yields in typical years there is less certainty on how close the actual net present value will be to the mean this can be seen by comparing the width of the grey and blue histograms in fig 6 the grey histogram showing baseline results is narrower it has a standard deviation of 10 606 whereas the blue histogram has a standard deviation of 15 290 the effect the system has in typical years is more important than its effect in exceptional years since 89 of yields are drawn from the typical years sub distribution 3 3 4 useful life of the subsurface drip irrigation system sensitivity analysis scenario 5 in our baseline scenario we assumed that the system could be used for 15 years to account for our uncertainty in how long the system could be used in scenario 5 we decreased the system s useful life in the first case to 10 years and in the second case increased it to 20 years in the stochastic simulation if the system is used for 10 years the mean net present value is 51 936 on the other hand if the system can be used for 20 years its mean net present value is 11 685 in fact 85 of the net present values in the blue histogram are equal to or greater than zero this is a significant increase in the system s value with an additional 5 years of use a result that is consistent with those of lamm et al 2015 although being able to use the system longer does increase its value a longer life span also reduces the certainty that it will ultimately be a worthwhile investment this can be clearly seen in fig 7 the longer the system is used the wider its distribution of net present values the red histogram has a relatively narrow distribution of net present values with a standard deviation of 9423 in contrast the blue histogram has a standard deviation of 11 278 and thus a wider distribution of net present values 3 4 mean net present value elasticity to compare how each parameter in the stochastic simulation affects the mean net present value we calculated the mean net present value elasticity of key parameters the mean net present value elasticities are presented in table 4 the table shows that the system s effect on yields in typical years has the largest influence on its mean net present value the second most influential parameter is capital cost 3 5 breakeven analysis given that the system s capital cost and its effect on yields in a typical year have the largest effects on the mean net present value we further analyzed them to determine their breakeven values fig 8 presents the breakeven analysis for the effect the system has on yields in a typical growing year it shows that when the system can increase corn yields in typical years by 33 then the median net present value of the system will be zero this indicates that over its useful life the system would have to increase yields 3 more than our baseline assumption in order to breakeven and be a worthwhile investment fig 9 presents the breakeven analysis for the capital cost it shows that the system would have to cost just under 165 000 in order for it to have a zero median net present value this implies that the system would have to cost roughly 22 360 552 hectare about 12 less than our baseline assumption in order for it to breakeven the results of the breakeven analysis on the system s useful life are illustrated in fig 10 it shows that if all the other parameters are kept at their baseline values the system has to be useful for 17 years before it will breakeven the figure also shows that each additional year that the system can be used has less and less of an effect on its median net present value this can be seen by observing that the vertical distance between points decreases as the useful life gets longer we also considered how much of a yearly subsidy payment it would take for the system to breakeven if our representative system s capital cost effect on yields and its other parameters are kept at their baseline values and the producer receives an additional 1575 year 39 year hectare then the system would breakeven this type of subsidy could be justified on the grounds that a producer s decision to purchase a subsurface drip irrigation system over an other type of system would put less of a strain on water supplies in the area 4 conclusions currently most farmers growing corn in ontario canada do not irrigate their crop however with other aspects of production under their control soil water levels are one of the last factors of corn production for producers to manage the places in ontario where irrigation is most likely to be adopted in locations with sandy soils like ontario s sand plains region are also the places where irrigation systems could strain available water resources given the technical efficiency of a subsurface drip irrigation system in this research we assessed its economic value to see if it is a worthwhile investment for growers to explore the economic value of a subsurface drip irrigation system we used a stochastic capital budget of a representative system and assessed its net present value to a corn grower in norfolk county ontario we defined the price of corn and corn yields as statistical distributions under baseline assumptions our representative subsurface drip irrigation system falls short of being a worthwhile investment for a corn grower in ontario s sand plains region but these results are based on our most reasonable estimate of the system s parameters some of those estimates notably the system s useful life are less certain than others thus we explored a range of possible values using sensitivity analysis we found like other studies on the economics of subsurface drip irrigation systems that changes in the system s useful life can play an important role in ensuring that it is a worth while investment if our representative system would last 17 years it would breakeven we also found that the system would have to increase yields in typical years by 33 over the course of its useful life in order for it to have a positive economic value 50 of the time our method for assessing the economic value of a subsurface drip irrigation system could be reproduced for other regions in fact tolhurst and ker 2015 have estimated two component distributions for corn yields in several counties in illinois indiana and iowa united states the same states studied by lobell et al 2014 future research could build on and improve the methods presented here in a couple of ways first from an agronomic point of view one limitation of our method was how we came to our baseline assumption for the system s effect on yields we used past research that was done in an other region to get our estimated change but one could get a better estimate by running a calibrated and validated crop growth model second from an economic point of view the methods could be applied to other types of irrigation systems which would allow their economic value to be compared to one another acknowledgements we would like to thank the ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs for funding this research we would also like to thank bruce kelly judge farms and vanden bussche irrigation for sharing useful information on subsurface drip irrigation systems we are grateful to john o sullivan and dr rene van acker for sharing their thoughts and comments on this work finally we want to thank the anonymous reviewers who took the time to read through our manuscript and provided useful and constructive feedback 
11489,this paper examines the economic feasibility of a subsurface irrigation system for a representative corn producer in norfolk county ontario canada we use stochastic capital budgeting to generate a distribution of net present values for this investment future corn yields and corn prices were treated as distributions under our base assumptions the subsurface drip irrigation system has a negative expected net present value meaning that it would not be a worthwhile investment for a corn farmer at the present time the system s ability to increase yields has the largest effect on its expected net present value attempts to improve the system s economic value should focus on increasing its effect on yields in years with typical agronomic conditions with reasonable assumptions for other system parameters the initial cost of a 40 5 ha system would have to be reduced to 165 000 to have a positive net present value 50 of the time or the system would have to increase corn yields by 33 in years with typical growing conditions to achieve the same net present value outcome keywords subsurface drip irrigation stochastic capital budget corn norfolk county ontario 1 introduction corn crops in the sand plains region of ontario canada are not usually irrigated but in 2012 after four months of drought conditions and facing significantly lower yields growers in the region were considering the merits of irrigating their corn crops government of canada 2012 by the next growing season at least one subsurface drip irrigation system had been installed and irrigation was still a topic of conversation at growers meetings in the area corn growers in the sand plains region have seen drought years in the past in 2007 2002 and 2001 seasonal precipitation was more than 15 below the 15 year average in the area government of canada 2017 colombo et al 2007 suggest that inadequate precipitation may be even more of a problem in the future as ontario s climate changes they projected that in the warm season from april to september the sand plains region will see between 0 and 10 less precipitation this forecast prompted morand et al 2017 to propose that the provincial government fund demonstration projects to showcase the benefits of subsurface drip irrigation but is installing a subsurface drip irrigation system a worthwhile investment for a corn grower in the sand plains region considering the merits of a subsurface drip irrigation system is an issue that extends beyond a region of sandy soil in ontario lobell et al 2014 showed that in iowa indiana and illinois in the united states over the period from 1995 to 2012 corn yields became more sensitive to drought stress they suspect that this occurred because water availability has become more of a limiting factor in yields as other hinderances to production have been mitigated in this paper we consider the economic value of a subsurface drip irrigation system from the perspective of a corn grower to do that we use stochastic capital budgeting of a representative installation in the sand plains region of ontario we also explore how the budget parameters affect the system s value and we compare the value of a subsurface irrigation system s technical efficiency to that of a centre pivot system other research has examined the economic feasibility of subsurface drip irrigation systems notably camp 1998 o brien et al 1998 and heard et al 2012 camp 1998 looked at the economics of using a subsurface drip irrigation system to grow corn in the great plains region of the united states o brien et al 1998 reviewed the literature on the use of subsurface drip irrigation systems and touched on their economic viability finally heard et al 2012 evaluated the economics of a subsurface drip irrigation system used to grow alfalfa pasture in australia s murray darling basin however the economic feasibility of this technology has not been studied for corn production in southern ontario an area with agronomic and climate conditions that differ from those of past studies furthermore and of importance to growers and agronomists beyond this particular region past studies have not taken into account uncertainty in corn prices and yields in their analysis of economic feasibility 2 material and methods our analysis is based on a representative subsurface drip irrigation system similar to one installed in a commercial trial corn field in norfolk county ontario canada we assumed that our representative system has the same components and layout as the system in norfolk county except that our analysis is scaled to a 40 5 ha or 100 acre field whereas the commercial trial system covers 32 37 ha we developed a stochastic capital budget for this representative situation including equipment and installation costs as well as annual changes in operating costs and revenues in our base results given that this is a new technology for this region we assumed a conservative useful life of 15 years for the installation we consider a longer useful life in sensitivity analysis we applied a real discount rate of 5 in calculating present values the capital budget subtracts the initial equipment and installation costs from the present value of the annual changes in net revenues changes in annual revenues minus changes in annual costs to generate a net present value a positive net present value indicates that the investment would be attractive to a farmer with a real rate of time preference of 5 future corn prices and yields are modelled as distributions in our capital budget we used stochastic simulation with these distributions to generate a distribution of net present values the mean of the net present values indicates the expected value of the system and the standard deviation gives a sense of how sure we can be that the system will have a particular net present value we can also calculate the probability that the system will have a positive net present value corn prices were modelled as a normal distribution based on historical real ontario corn prices the distribution of corn yields in the absence of irrigation was modelled as a mixture distribution based on previous work by tolhurst and ker 2013 1 1 although the work by tolhurst and ker 2013 is unpublished the algorithm they use to estimate the parameters of the haldimand norfolk corn yield distribution is presented in tolhurst and ker 2015 they found that past corn yields in the haldimand norfolk census subdivision 2 2 census subdivisions are geographical areas defined in statistics canada s standard geographical classification the area in which our representative field lies can be characterized by a mixture distribution that is made up of two normal distributions fig 1 illustrates corn yields without irrigation for year 1 in our simulation the mixture distribution consists of two normal sub distributions each with its own mean and standard deviation one of the sub distributions which we call the typical years sub distribution applies to the case of yields in years with run of the mill agronomic conditions i e those that usually occur in the haldimand norfolk census subdivision it is this sub distribution that created the taller and wider yellow portion of the histogram in fig 1 tolhurst and ker 2013 report that yields come from the typical years subdistribution 89 3 of the time the rest of the time yields come from what we call the exceptional years sub distribution which characterizes corn yields that occur in years with close to ideal agronomic conditions the exceptional years sub distribution produced the shorter orange portion of the histogram in fig 1 yields come from the exceptional years sub distribution 10 7 of the time in the stochastic simulation of net present values randomly drawing one year s corn yield from the mixture distribution is a two step process in the first step we draw from a continuous uniform distribution defined over the interval from 0 to 1 if the value drawn is less than 0 893 then in the second step we draw a random value from the typical years sub distribution on the other hand if in the first step a value greater than or equal to 0 893 is drawn from the uniform distribution then in the second step we draw a random value from the exceptional years sub distribution this process is repeated 100 000 times for each of the 15 years of the base scenario tolhurst and ker 2013 estimated that there has been an upward trend in corn yields in the haldimand norfolk census subdivision we incorporated their estimated trend into our mixture distribution by assuming that the mean of the normal years sub distribution increased 1 02 per year and that the mean of the exceptional years sub distribution increased 1 14 per year given these upward trends in the last period of our simulation in year 15 the mean yield in the typical years sub distribution is roughly 13 higher than it is at the beginning of the simulation and the mean yield in the exceptional years sub distribution is about 15 higher than it is at the beginning to account for the effect that subsurface drip irrigation has on corn yields in each year of the simulation we multiplied expected corn yields without irrigation by a fixed proportion we assumed the system would increase corn yields by 30 in typical years and by 10 in exceptional years our assumption that the system would increase yields by 30 in typical years is based in part on the work of powell and wright 1993 in table 4 of their paper one can see that over the four year study period the irrigated treatment plots averaged 28 8 higher yields than the unirrigated controls given this finding and the fact that in our yield distribution 89 3 of the corn yields are coming from the typical years sub distribution it seems reasonable to assume at least as a starting point for our analysis that the average yield in the typical years sub distribution would be increased by 30 as for the effect the system has in exceptional years we assumed that yields drawn from the exceptional years sub distribution would be 10 higher the argument for increasing the mean of the exceptional years sub distribution by 10 is that even with ideal weather and crop management on average corn grown with a subsurface drip irrigation system will have a higher yield than corn grown without a subsurface drip irrigation system this is because a subsurface drip irrigation system affords a level of control over soil nutrients that is not possible on an unirrigated field a subsurface drip irrigation system that has a liquid fertilizer pump which is the case with our representative system can be used to supplement macro nutrients in the soil the relative simplicity of doing so means that even small deficiencies in macro nutrients can be corrected this would not be the case on an unirrigated field therefore a 10 increase in yields in exceptional years is reasonable as a baseline assumption in addition to generating results for our base scenario we used sensitivity analysis to explore how the distribution of net present values would be affected by changes to critical parameters and assumptions we also calculated sensitivity elasticities to provide perspective on the relative importance of these critical parameters on the system s mean net present value lastly we undertook breakeven analyses 2 1 a representative subsurface drip irrigation system and corn field our representative subsurface drip irrigation system covers 40 5 ha of coarse textured sandy loam soil it is laid out in 6 zones each zone has a pair of manifolds and flush lines with drip lines running between them the drip lines are buried 36 cm underground and spaced 112 cm apart the emitters in the drip lines are spaced 61 cm apart the drip lines have an inside diameter of 22 mm and a wall thickness of 0 33 mm the system is capable of delivering water to two zones at a time and can apply 6 4 mm of water in a 6 h period the system is powered by a three phase electric motor liquid fertilizer tanks and an injector pump can be used to add fertilizer and macronutrients to the irrigation water before it is delivered to the root zone of the crop the pumping equipment is kept in a used 6 m 2 35 m 2 3 m shipping container that has been modified to serve as the pump shed 2 2

their real 2013 canadian dollar values we chose to use real values because doing so eliminates the need to forecast the rate of inflation the discount rate d is also reported in terms of its real value using a real discount rate means that it takes into account the producer s time preference and their perception of the financial risk involved in purchasing and operating a subsurface drip irrigation system in the following subsections we will walkthrough eq 1 and explain what we chose as baseline values for its parameters 2 2 1 capital cost of the subsurface drip irrigation system table 1 presents the elements included in the system s capital cost the cost of components are based on price quotes from a local irrigation equipment supplier and installation costs follow those of bakker 2013 we assumed that the cost of labor to install the system is 10 50 h and that the pump shed and cement slab cost 2134 the total estimated capital cost of the representative subsurface drip irrigation system is 187 360 we assumed that an irrigation pond was already established near the irrigated field and we did not include the cost of this pond in our capital budget this was the case on the field in norfolk county that inspired our representative system a producer who does not have a source of irrigation water already available would have to account for the cost of establishing a source of irrigation water this would include the price of permits and the cost of building a pond a well or a pipe to a river or lake we also did not include the cost of running three phase electricity from a utility line to the pump shed this is a cost that could be minimized by placing the system s electric pump close to a utility line or by placing it close to a nearby building that already has three phase electricity running to it if it is not possible to tap into a source of three phase electricity then the producer would have to consider using a diesel motor to run the system s pumps 2 2 2 system longevity as we stated earlier subsurface drip irrigation systems are not currently widely used on field crops in ontario so we have no local data on the life expectancy of this equipment under ontario weather conditions medina et al 2011 identified systems that had been in operation between 6 and 20 years in texas more recently lamm and rogers 2017 reported on a system used for 27 growing seasons at a research centre in kansas united states we chose a useful life of 15 years as our baseline assumption this is the middle of the range reported by medina et al 2011 and seems appropriate as a baseline assumption however we undertook a sensitivity and breakeven analysis on the system s useful life to see how its net present value changes when it can be used for 10 years and for 20 years 2 2 3 characterizing expected corn yields without a subsurface drip irrigation we defined unirrigated corn yields using the following distribution 2 y t ni λ n α n β n t σ n 2 1 λ n α e β e t σ e 2 where y t ni is the yield in metric tons per hectare without the subsurface drip irrigation system in year t λ is the probability of a yield coming from the typical years sub distribution rather than the exceptional years sub distribution α n is the mean yield in metric tons per hectare in the typical years normal sub distribution β n is the annual change in the mean of the typical years sub distribution in metric tons per hectare σ n 2 is the variance of yields in the typical years normal sub distribution in metric tons per hectare squared α e is the mean yield in metric tons per hectare in the exceptional years normal sub distribution β e is the annual change in the mean of the exceptional years sub distribution in metric tons per hectare σ e 2 is the variance of yields in the exceptional years normal sub distribution in metric tons per hectare squared the parameters for the distribution are taken from tolhurst and ker 2013 we set λ to 0 893 we mentioned earlier that we assumed an upward trend in yields to do that we set β n to 0 0842 metric tons hectare and β e to 0 1225 metric tons hectare the mean yield in the typical years sub distribution α n was set to 8 2582 metric tons hectare 3 3 tolhurst and ker 2013 report their results in bushels per acre these values were converted to metric ton hectare using the following conversion factor 1 bushel acre 0 0628 metric tons hectare as per johanns 2013 and the mean yield in the exceptional years sub distribution α e was set to 10 748 metric tons hectare we got these values by accounting for the fact that tolhurst and ker 2013 report their parameters assuming that t 0 is the year 1949 whereas in our simulation we assume t 0 is 2013 a difference of 64 years thus to get the parameters for our simulation we took the mean yield in typical years reported by tolhurst and ker 2013 and added β n 64 to it which gave us our value for α n and we took the mean yield in exceptional years reported by tolhurst and ker 2013 and added β e 64 to get our value for α e lastly we assumed again based on tolhurst and ker 2013 that the variance of both the typical and exceptional years sub distributions do not change from year to year in our simulation the variance in typical years σ n 2 was set to 0 4266 metric tons2 hectare2 the variance of yields in the exceptional years sub distribution σ e 2 is 0 02667 metric tons2 hectare2 2 2 4 characterizing how the subsurface drip irrigation system affects expected corn yields in eq 1 corn yields when there is a subsurface drip irrigation system in place are represented by the y t wi parameter which accounts for the system s effect on corn yields by adding a fixed proportion to the without irrigation yield distribution we explained earlier the two step process used to simulate one year s corn yield without irrigation to get a value for y t wi we took the without irrigation yield and multiplied it by 1 30 if it came from the typical years sub distribution and by 1 10 if it came from exceptional years sub distribution the proportional increases in yields were kept the same throughout the system s useful life 2 2 5 the price of grain corn we used a normal distribution to model grain corn prices the distribution had a mean of 191 23 metric ton and a variance of 1572 1 2 metric ton2 these are the mean and variance of real grain corn prices in ontario from 1985 to 2013 as reported by statistics canada 2014a b c 2 2 6 how using the subsurface drip irrigation system affects expenses operating a subsurface drip irrigation system requires labor input both to activate the system and to carry out maintenance there is also the cost of materials used for repairs and the cost of electricity to operate the water pump and the fertilizer injection pump these are recurring annual expenses that are captured by the δce t parameter in eq 1 for irrigation labor maintenance and repairs we used lamm et al s 2012 estimate of 35 4 hectare year 4 4 lamm et al 2012 report their costs in usd acre their values were converted to 2013 cad hectare using the following conversion factors 1 acre 0 4047 ha as per johanns 2013 1cad 1usd because this was the average exchange rate in 2012 and 1 2012 cad 1 006 2013 cad as per statistics canada 2014a b c we used the institute of agriculture and natural resources at the university of nebraska lincoln irrigation cost calculator and the parameters for our system to get an estimated electricity cost of 12 8 hectare year added together the annual expenses to operate the system are 48 2 hectare year or 1 952 year for a 40 5 ha field 2 2 7 taxes subsidies discount rate and the salvage value of the subsurface drip irrigation system part of calculating the change in taxes involves determining the change in expenses which we explained earlier and determining the change in revenue the change in revenue is the difference in yields between an unirrigated field and one that is irrigated which is explained above multiplied by the price of corn and the area being irrigated the other part of determining the change in taxes is calculating the capital cost allowance in each year we did this by using the canada revenue agency s 2013 form t2042 statement of farming activities mathematically the change in taxes in each year from using the subsurface drip irrigation system can be represented as 3 δ γ t y t wi y t ni p t c a δ ce t d t tr t where δγ t is the change in income taxes in year t in real 2013 cad y t wi is the expected corn yield in metric tons per hectare in period t when a subsurface drip irrigation system is being used y t ni is the expected corn yield in metric tons per hectare in period t when there is no subsurface drip irrigation system p t c is the real 2013 cad per metric ton price of grain corn in period t a is the area of the field being irrigated in hectares δce t is the change in expenses in period t in real 2013 cad d t is the capital cost allowance for the subsurface drip irrigation system in period t in real 2013 cad tr t is the proportional tax rate in period t the tax rate tr t was set to 30 in each period t as a baseline assumption we set the tsic t 1 parameter in eq 1 to zero because we could not identify a source of funding that would be available to a corn grower in ontario the growing forward 2 program does offer funding to someone who chooses to install an irrigation system with relatively high technical water use efficiency however as the ontario soil and crop improvement association 2013 s guide for producers explains producers installing an irrigation system on previously unirrigated land are ineligible for funding which means that our representative system does not qualify however in our sensitivity analysis we did consider a scenario where the system is eligible to receive a subsidy the second to last parameter in eq 1 to discuss is the system s salvage value s t we assumed that the system would be sold for parts at the end of its useful life the parts that could be sold would be the electric motors the variable speed drive and the sand filters we assumed a salvage value of 30 or 6 755 for the baseline capital cost the drip lines pipes and other system components in the field are assumed to have no value once they have been installed finally we assumed a real discount rate d of 5 as baseline assumption all of the baseline parameters used in the stochastic net present value calculation are presented in table 2 2 3 the relative value of a subsurface drip irrigation system s technical efficiency we compared the technical efficiency of a subsurface drip irrigation system to that of a centre pivot system in our baseline assumptions the grower does not pay other than the cost of electricity for each cubic meter of water they pump into the irrigation system however this may not always be the case what if a grower did have to pay for water because a subsurface drip irrigation system is more technically efficient than a centre pivot introduction of a cost for water would make a subsurface drip system more economically attractive to a producer o brien et al 1998 estimate that a centre pivot system irrigating approximately the same area as a subsurface drip irrigation system will have a 33 lower capital cost they also estimate that energy and maintenance cost are 12 5 higher per hectare for a centre pivot system than for a subsurface drip system thus we re ran the stochastic simulation and changed the capital cost and yearly expenses to reflect those of a centre pivot system and calculated the mean net present value next we assumed that a centre pivot s irrigation efficiency is 80 and that a subsurface drip system s is 95 additionally we assumed that growing a premium corn crop in ontario s sand plains region requires 100 mm of water to be applied to the crop under these assumptions using a centre pivot system would require 125 mm of water to be pumped and the subsurface drip system would need 105 mm this means that in one growing season irrigating a 40 5 ha field with a centre pivot system would use roughly 7993 m3 more water than a subsurface drip irrigation system finally we calculated the value of the subsurface drip irrigation system s efficiency by dividing the difference in net present value between the two systems by the difference in water use between the two 2 4 sensitivity analysis in the sensitivity analysis we changed key parameters in the stochastic net present value calculation to see how the distribution of net present values would be affected table 3 presents the scenarios that we considered in each scenario only one parameter is changed for example in scenario 1 with the lower capital cost only the c 0 parameter in eq 1 is changed reduced to 168 624 everything else stays the same 2 5 mean net present value elasticity the mean net present value elasticity measures the percentage change in the mean net present value for a 1 change in a parameter a mean net present value elasticity is dimensionless and allows comparisons across parameters or factors with different units of measurement among other things this measure provides guidance for researchers in that it indicates where the greatest gains can be made with respect to economic feasibility to calculate the mean net present value elasticity of a single parameter we increased it by 1 and re ran the stochastic simulation this gave us a new distribution of net present values we then compared this new distribution to what we got under our initial assumptions the one exception is the mean elasticity of the years parameter in that case we increased the years parameter by one year from 15 years to 16 years we calculated the mean net present value elasticity using the following equation 4 ε npv x δ npv δ x npv m npv b npv m npv b 2 x m x b x m x b 2 where ε npv x is the mean net present value elasticity of parameter x x is the parameter whose elasticity is being calculated δ npv is the percent change in the mean net present value δx is the percent change in parameter x npv m is the mean of net present values in real 2013 cad in the stochastic simulation where the parameter in question x has been increased 1 npv b is the mean of net present values in real 2013 cad in the stochastic simulation where the parameter in question x is at its baseline value x m is the modified value of parameter x x b is the baseline value of parameter x when calculating the change in the mean net present value if it was negative we used its absolute value consequently if the mean net present value of the system was negative we calculated the elasticity of losses if the mean net present value was positive we calculated the elasticity of gains from using the system 2 6 breakeven analysis we used a breakeven analysis to determine how much one of the irrigation system s parameters would have to change in order for the system to be a worthwhile investment the system breaks even when 50 of the net present values calculated in the simulation are positive and the other 50 are negative when this occurs the system has equal probability of having a positive net present value as it does a negative net present value put an other way the value of the system parameter that returns a distribution of results with a median of zero is the breakeven value for that parameter we found a parameter s breakeven value by repeating the stochastic simulation several times and each time we gradually increased the value of the parameter in question we started with a parameter value that produced a median net present value well below zero and gradually increased it until the simulation s median was well over zero graphing the series of parameter values and their resulting median net present values allowed us to infer the breakeven value for that parameter 3 results and discussion 3 1 results under baseline assumptions fig 2 presents the results of the stochastic simulation that calculates the net present value of using a 40 5 ha subsurface drip irrigation system to grow corn in norfolk county ontario for 15 years the histogram is made up of 100 000 net present values and has the following properties the average net present value is 16 282 402 hectare the median net present value is 16 171 399 hectare and the standard deviation is 10 606 262 hectare 90 of the net present values fall between 33 969 839 hectare and 885 22 hectare and 6 of them are greater than or equal to 0 this means that if the baseline assumptions about the representative subsurface drip irrigation system are correct then the producer would be better off not purchasing the system another way of looking at the results from our simulation is in terms of the system s costs and benefits the benefits of using the system are the yearly capital cost allowance the salvage value in the last year and the yearly gain in yields with their associated increase in revenue in our simulation the system increases revenue by 18 024 year on average the system s yearly costs are its operating and maintenance costs which we assumed to be 1952 year in the simulation the system s value benefits minus costs in each year is positive in all 15 years in each year the system has a value of approximately 22 000 year 5 5 it is not the same in each year because of year to year changes in capital cost allowance and the one time benefit of the system s salvage value at the end of its useful life because the value in each year is being discounted at 5 the system s discounted value is not the same in each year for example in the simulation on average the discounted value in the second year the system is used 2014 is 19 514 whereas on average the system s discounted value in the thirteenth year of use 2026 is 7251 although in the simulation the system has a positive value in each year discounting causes its value in the future to be lower than its value closer to when it is first installed when the discounted values of the system in each year are added together the result is the system s present value in the stochastic simulation on average the system s present value is 171 101 comparing this to its capital cost 187 360 we see that the system earns back approximately 91 of its initial cost 3 2 the relative value of a subsurface drip irrigation system s technical efficiency if we run the net present value simulation to reflect the lower capital cost and higher operating cost of a centre pivot system while keeping other parameters the same as for the subsurface drip irrigation system we find that a centre pivot system has an average net present value of 30 069 that is 46 351 more than our hypothetical subsurface drip irrigation system we can calculate the value of the subsurface drip irrigation system s efficiency relative to the centre pivot system by dividing the difference in net present value between the two systems 46 351 by the difference in water use between the two systems 7993 m3 which gives 5 8 m3 or 0 58 cents l this implies that if a corn grower has to pay more than 5 8 m3 for water then they would be better off purchasing a subsurface drip system than a centre pivot system 3 3 results of sensitivity analysis 3 3 1 capital cost sensitivity analysis scenario 1 in the baseline scenario we assumed the subsurface drip irrigation system has a capital cost of 187 360 this baseline value is for a system with all new components it is possible for a grower to lower the system s capital cost for example by using second hand sand filters rather than buying new ones scenario 1 in the sensitivity analysis considers the effects on the distribution of net present values if the capital cost is changed in the first case the capital cost is set 10 lower than our baseline assumption the blue histogram in fig 3 shows that when the system costs 168 624 its average net present value is closer to being positive the mean net present value of the blue histogram is 1863 compared to 16 282 for the grey baseline histogram furthermore with this lower capital cost there is a higher chance that the system will have a positive net present value in the blue histogram 44 of net present values are greater than or equal to zero whereas only 6 are positive in the grey baseline histogram scenario 1 also considers the possibility that our baseline capital cost was an under estimate a 10 increase in the capital cost produces the red histogram in fig 3 the red histogram is further to the left than the result under baseline assumptions when the system has a capital cost of 206 096 it has a mean net present value of 30 758 and almost none of the net present values in the stochastic simulation are positive 3 3 2 annual expenses sensitivity analysis scenario 2 in the baseline scenario we assumed that expenses δce t in eq 1 would be 1952 year in scenario 2 we consider the possibility that this was an over estimate or conversely that it was an under estimate the results are illustrated in fig 4 it shows that increasing or decreasing the change in expenses has a relatively small impact on the system s net present value the blue histogram in fig 4 shows that lowering yearly expenses to 1755 year leads to a distribution of net present values that is slightly further to the right on the x axis than the baseline results the blue histogram s mean net present value is 14 851 which is 1431 higher than the baseline scenario conversely when expenses are higher 2146 year the histogram shifts to the left on the x axis the red histogram s mean net present value is 17 688 which is 1406 lower than the baseline scenario s 3 3 3 system s effect on corn yields sensitivity analysis scenarios 3 and 4 the first case in scenario 3 considers what would happen if the subsurface drip irrigation system has no effect on corn yields in exceptional years the result is illustrated by the red histogram in fig 5 it shows that the distribution of net present values moves further into the negative and the distribution has more variance the mean net present value of the red histogram is 23 240 which is 6958 lower than the grey baseline histogram additionally the red histogram with a standard deviation of 14 454 is wider than the grey histogram which has a standard deviation of 10 606 this implies that there is more uncertainty in the net present value of the system when it has no effect on yields in years where agronomic conditions are almost ideal scenario 3 also considers what happens to the distribution of net present values if the system has more of an effect on corn yields in exceptional years to do this we ran the simulation again assuming that in a year with close to perfect agronomic condition the system increases yields by 20 the result is illustrated by the blue histogram in fig 5 in this case the average net present value is higher than it is in the baseline scenario the blue histogram has a mean of 9367 which is 6915 higher than baseline result what is more the blue histogram has a narrower range of net present values this can be seen in the blue histogram s width which is narrower than the histogram from the baseline scenario specifically the blue histogram s standard deviation of net present values is 8546 which implies that if the system has more of an effect on yields in exceptional years there is more certainty in its value to a producer now turning to scenario 4 where the first case considers the possibility that the 30 increase in typical year yields is an overestimate the red histogram in fig 6 shows that when the system increases yields by only 20 in years with typical agronomic conditions then the mean net present value falls to 60 372 the distribution of net present values is also narrower than it was in the baseline scenario the standard deviation of the red histogram is 6177 this implies that if the system has less of an effect on yields in normal years there is more certainty in its value to the corn grower the second case in scenario 4 considers what happens to the distribution of net present values if the system increases yields more than it did in our baseline assumption the blue histogram in fig 6 shows that when the subsurface drip irrigation system increases yields in typical years by 40 the distribution of net present values has a mean of 27 817 moreover 96 of the net present values are equal to or greater than zero this is a significant jump from the baseline results where 6 had values equal to or above zero although the mean net present value is higher when the system has a greater effect on yields in typical years there is less certainty on how close the actual net present value will be to the mean this can be seen by comparing the width of the grey and blue histograms in fig 6 the grey histogram showing baseline results is narrower it has a standard deviation of 10 606 whereas the blue histogram has a standard deviation of 15 290 the effect the system has in typical years is more important than its effect in exceptional years since 89 of yields are drawn from the typical years sub distribution 3 3 4 useful life of the subsurface drip irrigation system sensitivity analysis scenario 5 in our baseline scenario we assumed that the system could be used for 15 years to account for our uncertainty in how long the system could be used in scenario 5 we decreased the system s useful life in the first case to 10 years and in the second case increased it to 20 years in the stochastic simulation if the system is used for 10 years the mean net present value is 51 936 on the other hand if the system can be used for 20 years its mean net present value is 11 685 in fact 85 of the net present values in the blue histogram are equal to or greater than zero this is a significant increase in the system s value with an additional 5 years of use a result that is consistent with those of lamm et al 2015 although being able to use the system longer does increase its value a longer life span also reduces the certainty that it will ultimately be a worthwhile investment this can be clearly seen in fig 7 the longer the system is used the wider its distribution of net present values the red histogram has a relatively narrow distribution of net present values with a standard deviation of 9423 in contrast the blue histogram has a standard deviation of 11 278 and thus a wider distribution of net present values 3 4 mean net present value elasticity to compare how each parameter in the stochastic simulation affects the mean net present value we calculated the mean net present value elasticity of key parameters the mean net present value elasticities are presented in table 4 the table shows that the system s effect on yields in typical years has the largest influence on its mean net present value the second most influential parameter is capital cost 3 5 breakeven analysis given that the system s capital cost and its effect on yields in a typical year have the largest effects on the mean net present value we further analyzed them to determine their breakeven values fig 8 presents the breakeven analysis for the effect the system has on yields in a typical growing year it shows that when the system can increase corn yields in typical years by 33 then the median net present value of the system will be zero this indicates that over its useful life the system would have to increase yields 3 more than our baseline assumption in order to breakeven and be a worthwhile investment fig 9 presents the breakeven analysis for the capital cost it shows that the system would have to cost just under 165 000 in order for it to have a zero median net present value this implies that the system would have to cost roughly 22 360 552 hectare about 12 less than our baseline assumption in order for it to breakeven the results of the breakeven analysis on the system s useful life are illustrated in fig 10 it shows that if all the other parameters are kept at their baseline values the system has to be useful for 17 years before it will breakeven the figure also shows that each additional year that the system can be used has less and less of an effect on its median net present value this can be seen by observing that the vertical distance between points decreases as the useful life gets longer we also considered how much of a yearly subsidy payment it would take for the system to breakeven if our representative system s capital cost effect on yields and its other parameters are kept at their baseline values and the producer receives an additional 1575 year 39 year hectare then the system would breakeven this type of subsidy could be justified on the grounds that a producer s decision to purchase a subsurface drip irrigation system over an other type of system would put less of a strain on water supplies in the area 4 conclusions currently most farmers growing corn in ontario canada do not irrigate their crop however with other aspects of production under their control soil water levels are one of the last factors of corn production for producers to manage the places in ontario where irrigation is most likely to be adopted in locations with sandy soils like ontario s sand plains region are also the places where irrigation systems could strain available water resources given the technical efficiency of a subsurface drip irrigation system in this research we assessed its economic value to see if it is a worthwhile investment for growers to explore the economic value of a subsurface drip irrigation system we used a stochastic capital budget of a representative system and assessed its net present value to a corn grower in norfolk county ontario we defined the price of corn and corn yields as statistical distributions under baseline assumptions our representative subsurface drip irrigation system falls short of being a worthwhile investment for a corn grower in ontario s sand plains region but these results are based on our most reasonable estimate of the system s parameters some of those estimates notably the system s useful life are less certain than others thus we explored a range of possible values using sensitivity analysis we found like other studies on the economics of subsurface drip irrigation systems that changes in the system s useful life can play an important role in ensuring that it is a worth while investment if our representative system would last 17 years it would breakeven we also found that the system would have to increase yields in typical years by 33 over the course of its useful life in order for it to have a positive economic value 50 of the time our method for assessing the economic value of a subsurface drip irrigation system could be reproduced for other regions in fact tolhurst and ker 2015 have estimated two component distributions for corn yields in several counties in illinois indiana and iowa united states the same states studied by lobell et al 2014 future research could build on and improve the methods presented here in a couple of ways first from an agronomic point of view one limitation of our method was how we came to our baseline assumption for the system s effect on yields we used past research that was done in an other region to get our estimated change but one could get a better estimate by running a calibrated and validated crop growth model second from an economic point of view the methods could be applied to other types of irrigation systems which would allow their economic value to be compared to one another acknowledgements we would like to thank the ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs for funding
