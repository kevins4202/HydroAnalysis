4685,reservoir operation relies on two sets of flow data to conduct error analysis inflow data and release data previous studies applied only the inflow data to reduce errors and improve the reservoir s operational effectiveness little attention has been paid to the accuracy of the release data however release data provides more accurate information than inflow data for the protection of downstream river ecosystems in this paper we aim to illustrate the necessity of fully using the release data to improve a reservoir s operational performance in a real time reservoir operation system firstly we designed a hypothetical reservoir system performed five numerical experiments with different ranges of model parameters and found that the error variances of reservoir releases were always larger than those of inflows this indicates that the post processing of reservoir releases is required to improve the accuracy of release data and support real time reservoir operation then we used a bayesian joint probability bjp model for post processing release data to reduce errors and quantify the uncertainty we also applied the ecodeficit and ecosurplus based on flow duration curves to evaluate downstream hydrological alterations and further demonstrate the necessity of post processing of release data results showed that the bjp model led to considerable improvement in the root mean square error and the continuous ranked probability score this demonstrates that the bjp model was effective in reducing errors our results highlight the importance of applying release data and improving their accuracy to support reservoir operation if the release data is neglected operational performance will degrade keywords release data real time reservoir operation bayesian joint probability model ecodeficit ecosurplus uncertainty 1 introduction reservoir operational performance is greatly affected by the accuracy of flow data mujumdar and nirmala 2007 fu et al 2013 shokri et al 2013 motevalli et al 2015 tegegne and kim 2020 especially in real time reservoir operation the inflow information required to support real time reservoir operation is obtained from real time hydrological forecasts yang et al 2019 these inflow forecasts are often inaccurate leading to large inconsistencies between the observed inflow and the forecasted inflow in reservoir operation inflows are used to determine the reservoir operating rules and reservoir releases are determined by the magnitudes and variation of the inflows karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 this means inaccurate reservoir inflows generally lead to inaccurate reservoir releases the forecast error in inflows is a major factor that influences the accuracy of flow data and the ability to achieve the goals defined in reservoir operating policies to efficiently operate a reservoir it s necessary to accurately estimate the true flows that govern reservoir operation deng et al 2015 scholars have exerted considerable effort to reduce the influences of inflow forecast on the model s performance in reservoir operation over the past few decades karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 wood and schaake 2008 xu et al 2014 these studies quantified the uncertainty of inflow forecasts using bayesian stochastic optimization during the process of reservoir operation and concluded that they did not perform well in reducing forecast errors to overcome this problem the statistical post processing methods have gained popularity li et al 2017 these methods directly post process the model outputs e g forecasted inflows or reservoir releases by relating them with the observations studies have shown that post processing methods are adequate in correcting forecast errors peng et al 2020 a typical post processing method is the bayesian joint probability bjp model it has been proved that the bjp model outperforms other post processing methods such as regression based models at improving forecast accuracy pokhrel et al 2013 wang et al 2019 the advantage of the bjp model is that it conducts data transformation such as log sinh transformation before parameter fitting to normalize data as well as it applies the bayesian inference technique such as markov chain monte carlo for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification zhao et al 2015 although there has been considerable progress in this research previous researchers only attempted to process forecasted inflows to reduce their errors wang et al 2009 li et al 2010 zhao et al 2019 this is because the forecasted inflows directly support real time reservoir operation and allow managers to estimate the optimal releases unfortunately the inevitable forecast errors of inflows make the estimated optimal releases diverge from the true optima the accuracy of reservoir releases and error correction methods have been rarely studied only zhang et al 2018 used three ai models including a back propagation neural network a support vector regression technique and a long short term memory model to simulate reservoir releases using 30 years of historical reservoir operation records despite this research the effect of the reservoir operation process on reservoir releases has been largely ignored and researchers have not compared the flow errors before and after reservoir operation to demonstrate the importance of error correction in reservoir releases if the priority is accurate forecasting of releases then it s also necessary to improve reservoir releases reservoir operation will in practice change the uncertainty which may even increase improving the accuracy of the reservoir releases could fundamentally improve reservoir operation studying only the inflow data fails to meet the requirements for improving reservoir operation performance the release data is particularly important because downstream riverine ecosystems need to receive adequate environmental flows which are adjusted in accordance with reservoir releases to meet varying demands cardwell et al 1996 petts 2009 yin et al 2011 more accurate flow data leads to a more accurate calculation of environmental flows which could improve the maintenance of the ecological integrity and biodiversity of downstream riverine ecosystems with more and more attention being paid to downstream ecosystem health it s clearly important to study the accuracy of reservoir releases and reduce their errors to improve the performance of reservoir operation the aims of this paper are 1 to investigate the variation in flow errors before and after reservoir operation 2 to apply the bjp model to reduce the errors of reservoir releases in real time reservoir operation 3 to evaluate the effects of correcting release errors on ecological conditions in rivers from the perspective of the degree of hydrological alteration to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that achieves the aim 1 and 2 2 methodology 2 1 problem formulation in this study we modeled a single water supply reservoir in this section we compare the inflow forecast errors and the corresponding release errors before and after real time reservoir operation and then confirm the necessity of correcting the reservoir releases for a given real time reservoir operation optimization model we can use a series of reservoir inflows to obtain a series of corresponding reservoir releases however in real world real time reservoir operation the inflow information is obtained from real time hydrological forecasts and always involves some degree of uncertainty ajami et al 2008 q t q t e t where qt is the observed inflow at time t qt is the forecasted inflow at time t et is the forecast error which represents the uncertainty of the forecasted inflow at time t t 1 2 n accordingly there are two types of reservoir operation fig 1 operation 1 is an ideal case in which we input the observed inflows qt into the reservoir operation optimization model and obtain the ideal releases rt operation 2 is a real world case in which we input the forecasted inflows qt into the same reservoir operation optimization model and obtain the optimal releases rt we then calculate the error as the difference between the optimal releases and the ideal releases ert and calculate the error between the forecasted inflows and the observed inflows eqt as follows e r t r t r t e q t q t q t δ v a r e t v a r e r t v a r e q t where rt is the ideal release at time t which is based on the observed inflow at time t rt is the optimal release at time t which is based on the forecasted inflow at time t var ert and var eqt are the error variances of the reservoir releases and reservoir inflows respectively which quantity the amount of uncertainty δvar et is the difference between the variance of ert and eqt and indicates the change of the uncertainty level according to the water balance equation release decisions are affected by the inflow conditions and the expected ending storage zhao et al 2019 in real time reservoir operation we sometimes make the reservoir water level back to the initial level after one round of operation zhao et al 2012 thus we can assume for the sake of simplicity that the reservoir storages at the initial and end of the operation horizon are the same under this assumption release decisions are only affected by inflow conditions on this basis the cumulative errors of the inflows and releases are equal 5 t 1 n er t t 1 n eq t eq 5 demonstrates that the mean values of ert and eqt are equal in this case the variances of ert and eqt only have three conditions 1 var ert var eqt 2 var ert var eqt 3 var ert var eqt in practice we always obtain var ert var eqt we will demonstrate this in section 3 1 to study how the variances of the flow errors change before and after real time reservoir operation we performed the numerical experiments with a hypothetical reservoir system in section 2 2 2 2 numerical experiments to detect variation in flow errors before and after reservoir operation 2 2 1 reservoir inflow generation we applied the thomas fiering model to generate the reservoir inflow sequences which we treated as the observed inflows zhao et al 2012 6 q t 1 μ ρ flow q t μ 1 ρ flow 2 μ c v δ where qt 1 is the generated reservoir inflow at time t μ is the mean generated inflow ρflow is the correlation coefficient of the inflow cv is the coefficient of variation and δ is a random number drawn from a normal distribution with a mean value of 0 and a variance of 1 the reservoir inflows are constrained to be no less than 0 thus the observed inflows are determined by μ ρflow and cv 2 2 2 synthetic forecasted inflow generation the forecasted inflow is generated by adding an error term to the generated reservoir inflow datta and burges 1984 the uncertainty of the forecasted inflow increases with forecast horizon maurer and lettenmaier 2003 the forecasting error et is assumed to follow a gaussian distribution and its variance increases linearly with forecast lead time t zhao et al 2012 e t n u t ζ t 2 ζ t 2 m i n t σ 2 μ 2 c v 2 where ut and ζt 2 are the mean and variance of the forecast uncertainty at period t respectively ζ2 increases with t at a rate of σ2 and is no more than the reservoir inflow variance of μ2cv2 which means that the forecast error is heteroscedastic σ determines the uncertainty in the forecast in the first period thus the forecasted inflows are determined by u σ 2 2 3 real time reservoir operation system here we establish a hypothetical reservoir system that is characterized by the storage capacity s for a water supply reservoir the utility function can be written as ft rt or ft rt and the utility provided by the reservoir is determined only by the amount of water released by the reservoir booker and o neill 2006 you and cai 2008 the main objective function for reservoir operation optimization model in an ideal case is as below 9 max t 1 h f t r t 10 s t 1 l s t 1 q t r t s t t 1 h s min s t s max r min r t r max s h s t where st is the reservoir storage at time t st is the ending storage at the end of reservoir operation l is the loss ratio for reservoir storage which is ignored in this paper for a conventional reservoir operation the utility function is convex and utility in each period increases with increasing water use at a decreasing rate according to booker and o neill 2006 the utility function is ft rt ln rt in this paper we assumed a reservoir operation that aims to allocate water to the environment to maintain healthy downstream ecosystems the total utility in each period increases with increasing water supplied for the environment and decreases with increasing water after reaching the maximum value as shown in fig 2 aither 2018 thus the utility function is convex and is defined as ft rt rt 1 ln rt for the real world reservoir operation model the rt and qt in the main objective function eqs 9 and 10 are replaced by rt and qt respectively we used dynamic programming in reservoir operation to forecast the simulated releases the decision variable is the reservoir storage at the end of time step t the forecast horizon h h 10 is less than the operation horizon n h n n 100 and we implemented a rolling horizon approach only the current release decision dh 1 is employed to reduce the effect of the initial and ending storage on reservoir operation s0 the initial reservoir storage and st are set as s 2 half of the storage capacity in both the ideal case and the real world case zhao et al 2012 in this paper we conducted five experiments with different parameters characteristic parameters for reservoir inflow cv ρflow μ characteristic parameters for forecast uncertainty σ u to detect their effects on flow errors in reservoir operation the parameter value combinations are summarized in table 1 the ranges of the five parameters cover all situations that would be expected in normal reservoir operations each experiment was conducted with 200 numerical simulations 2 3 using a bayesian joint probability bjp model to correct reservoir releases in this section we employ a bjp model to reduce the errors of reservoir releases and quantify their uncertainty the bjp model formulates the relationship between ideal releases observed values r and optimal releases raw releases r using a bivariate normal joint distribution after transformation in mathematical terms we call r a predictor and r a predictand first we used a log sinh transformation to transform r and r to g and g respectively using eq 11 we then used a bayesian maximum a posteriori method schepen et al 2016 to estimate each set of transformation parameter values a and b 11 g 1 b log sinh a b r next we used a bivariate normal joint distribution to characterize the relationship between the transformed predictor and predictand 12 z g g n μ σ where z represents a vector composed of the transformed variables μ μ g μ g and σ σ g ρ σ g σ g ρ σ g σ g σ g are the mean vector and variance covariance matrix we defined the parameters as the set θ using eq 13 13 θ μ σ given a data series d z t t 1 2 n model parameter set θ is estimated by means of bayesian inference which allows for parameter uncertainty to obtain their posterior distribution 14 p θ d p θ p d θ where p θ is the prior distribution of the parameter set θ and p d θ is the likelihood in this paper the gibbs sampling of the markov chain monte carlo algorithm engeland et al 2005 was implemented for the parameter uncertainty analysis we set the number of burn in iterations to 5000 and the length of the markov chain to 25000 the above process is fitted using training data rm rm and then the predictive uncertainty of the post processed releases rn is derived using the testing data rn rn given a new raw release rn the mean value and variance of gn conditional on gn after transformation are defined as followed e g n μ g ρ σ g σ g g n μ g and v a r g n 1 ρ 2 σ g 2 then the random sample of gn is derived from the conditional distribution gn n e gn var gn in the last step of the analysis we determined each of the sample members of the post processed releases rn by means of inverse log sinh transformation the implementation of the bjp model are detailed in wang et al 2019 2 4 performance evaluation for the bjp model the root mean squared error rmse and the continuous ranked probability score crps are employedto evaluate the overall ability of the bjp method to reduce errors to do so we compared the post processed release ensemble release involving a range of release sequences with its corresponding ideal release and compares the raw release optimal release with the ideal release based on the rmse and crps values rmse measures the standard deviation between observed values and forecast values and it is calculated using the ensemble mean crps appendix a considers the reliability of the spread of ensemble releases and provides the overall accuracy of the evaluation it is widely applied to measure probabilistic forecasts of continuous variables hersbach 2000 laio and tamea 2007 and represents the distance between a forecast probability distribution and the observed value 2 5 evaluating flow alteration using ecodeficit and ecosurplus protection of river ecosystems has become an indispensable part of reservoir operation tharme 2003 vogel et al 2007 rheinheimer et al 2015 he et al 2018 here we wanted to evaluate the degree of flow alteration to further demonstrate the necessity of post processing release data and investigate the effectiveness of the bjp model reservoir operation causes great changes in the natural flow regime and this is expected to result in degradation of the river ecosystem wu et al 2017 to estimate the alterations from inflows to releases in a short period we applied ecodeficit and ecosurplus statistics which are based on the flow duration curve fdc the most common method to evaluate hydrological alterations is the range of variability approach which defines 32 indicators of hydrologic alteration ihas unfortunately the range of variability approach requires a dataset longer than 30 years gao et al 2009 analyzed the 32 iha indicators and found that the ecodeficit and the ecosurplus best explained the variability in the iha statistics and did not require long datasets fig 3 defines the meaning of these indicators the area that is both below the release s fdc and above the inflow s fdc is the ecosurplus the ecosurplus represents extra water that could be supplied to meet the needs of downstream ecosystems that were created by the flow alterations conversely the area that is both below the inflow s fdc and above the release s fdc is the ecodeficit the ecodeficit represents the amount of water that is now unavailable to meet downstream ecological requirements created by alterations of flows by water storage in the reservoir 3 results 3 1 variation in flow errors δvar before and after reservoir operation fig 4 shows the variation in flow errors δvar under different combinations of parameter values for cv ρflow μ σ and u in the five experiments these results show that all values of the δvar are almost greater than 0 for all combinations of parameters in all experiments the variance values for ert were always larger than those for eqt i e var er var eq this demonstrates that reservoir operation increases the uncertainty of the flows on this basis it s more effective to conduct error correction for the reservoir releases than for the reservoir inflows in real time reservoir operation this is because error correction for the inflow forecasts can only reduce errors and could not obtain a perfect forecast there always exists some error and the error will be greater after reservoir operation when the error correction analysis is conducted for reservoir releases the error won t increase fig 4a illustrates the effect of cv on δvar for values of cv ranging from 0 1 to 2 0 the δvar curve increases with increasing cv though with some volatility fig 4b shows that δvar almost the same with increasing ρflow with a range of 0 1 to 0 8 fig 4c shows that δvar increases with increasing μ with a range of 1 to 10 reaching a maximum at µ 4 fig 4d and e show that δvar increased with increasing σ with a range from 0 01 to 0 3 and with increasing u with a range from 0 to 0 5 these results demonstrate that the changes in the uncertainty level become larger with increasing σ and u 3 2 performance of the bjp model the performance of the bjp model is evaluated through leave one year out cross validation fig 5 the rmse and crps are used as measures of the ability of the bjp model to reduce errors and quantify uncertainty in the rest of this section we compare the post processed releases ensemble releases with the corresponding ideal releases and compare the optimal releases raw releases with the corresponding ideal releases 3 2 1 examination of rmse fig 5 a 1 to a 5 show how changes in the five parameters in table 1 affected rmse values for the raw releases the optimal releases and the post processed releases a low rmse value means a more accurate result and suggests that the bjp model was effective overall the rmse values for the post processed releases were lower than those for the raw releases except for μ where there was little difference that is the application of the bjp model notably decreased the rmse values fig 5 a 1 a 4 and a 5 show that the rmse values of the raw releases increased greatly with increasing values of the parameters cv σ and u through the post processing using the bjp model the rmse values of the post processed releases increased dramatically increasing cv however the distances between the raw releases and post processed releases in rmse values gradually decreased and approached zero as cv increased this demonstrates that the bjp model could reduce errors to some extent but that with high inflow variability the ability of the bjp model to reduce the errors weakened when cv was between 1 5 and 2 0 the rmse values of the post processed releases did not differ substantially from those of the raw releases thus the bjp model won t yield obvious improvements in rmse when the uncertainty of reservoir inflows is great fig 5 a 4 shows that the rmse values of the post processed releases increased with increasing σ but began to stabilize at higher values of σ fig 5 a 5 reveals that the rmse values of post processed releases remained relatively constant and low with increasing u the differences between the rmse values of the raw releases and the post processed releases increased with increasing σ and u this illustrates that the bjp model is very useful for reducing errors and that as σ and u increase the ability of the bjp model to reduce errors strengthens the bjp model could control these errors at a very low level fig 5 a 2 shows that the rmse values of the raw releases remain high and relatively constant with increasing ρflow whereas the rmse values of the post processed releases increased slightly with increasing ρflow but remained much lower than the rmse values for the raw releases the gap between the two sets of rmse values was large but decreased with increasing ρflow this indicates the bjp model contributed to reducing errors but that this contribution weakened with increasing ρflow fig 5 a 3 shows that the rmse values of both the raw releases and the post processed releases initially increased rapidly and then fall quickly there was little gap between the raw releases and the post processed releases it seems that the bjp model did not work with increasing μ 3 2 2 examination of crps fig 5 b 1 to b 5 show how changes in the five parameters in table 1 affected crps values for the raw releases and post processed releases the crps considers the spread among the post processed releases and provides an overall accuracy of evaluation based on this spread a low crps value means the result is accurate and has the right spread and that the bjp model is effective overall the crps values for the post processed releases were always lower than those for the raw releases although the differences were smaller for µ than for the other parameters these results confirm the results based on rmse in the previous section and demonstrate that the bjp model could produce significant improvements and reductions in crps the trends for cprs were similar to those for rmse for all of the five parameters through the process of the bjp model the crps values of the post processed releases increased slightly with increasing ρflow and σ and remained relatively constant with increasing u thus parameters ρflow σ and u had little effect on crps however at larger values of σ or u the gap in crps between the raw releases and the post processed releases increased this demonstrates that the bjp model benefits to reduce errors in general although the forecast uncertainty was high it is perfectly possible to process the results to a satisfactory level with the bjp model fig 5 b 2 shows decreasing distances between the raw releases and the post processed releases in crps values with increasing ρflow which is consistent with the results for rmse this indicates that the application of the bjp model helps to reduce errors but that this ability weakens as ρflow increases 3 3 the changing trends of ecodeficit and ecosurplus under different parameters fig 6 shows the changes in ecodeficit and ecosurplus as a function of changing parameter cv ρflow μ σ and u values in the five experiments we evaluated three kinds of flow alterations using the fdc based ecodeficit and ecosurplus statistics first there is the alteration from the observed inflows to the ideal releases a ideal the orange bars in fig 6 second there is the alteration from the observed inflows to the raw releases the optimal releases a raw the red bars in fig 6 third there is the alteration from the observed inflows to the post processed releases a post the green bars in fig 6 both the ecodeficit and the ecosurplus increased steadily and greatly with increasing cv and μ for all three kinds of alterations fig 6a and c this indicates that greater inflow variability or greater inflow leads to more extra water that can be supplied to meet downstream ecological requirements in the wet season whereas less water is available to meet downstream ecological requirements in the dry season due to the flow alterations thus the dry season would become drier and the wet season would become wetter for a river with high inflows or high inflow variability fig 6b illustrates that both ecodeficit and ecosurplus decrease slightly for all three kinds of alterations as ρflow increases and the reductions are not huge this implies that the correlation coefficient for the inflow also affects the ecodeficit and ecosurplus however the impact is less than that for the other two reservoir inflow characteristics inflow variability and inflow fig 6d and 6e show the effect of forecast uncertainty on ecodeficit and ecosurplus as σ increases from 0 01 to 0 30 and as u increases from 0 to 0 5 the ecodeficit and ecosurplus both remain relatively constant with increasing σ or u for a ideal because σ and u are parameters that characterize the forecast uncertainty fig 6d illustrates that as σ increases both ecodeficit and ecosurplus have a minor downward trend for a raw but have a slight upward trend for a post these results highlight that the post processed releases completely change the trend for ecodeficit and ecosurplus fig 6e illustrates that as u increases both the ecodeficit and ecosurplus have a not obvious and negligible upward trend for a post the ecodeficit and ecosurplus remain nearly the same but then the ecodeficit decreases gradually to near 0 and the ecosurplus increases rapidly as u increases this indicates that the raw releases will produce huge errors in ecodeficit and ecosurplus and that the errors become greater with a larger mean value of forecast uncertainty the post processed releases correct these errors to some extent 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of rmse with crps from the perspective of rmse the rmse of the raw releases were not substantially higher than those of the post processed releases under some conditions such as when cv was greater than 1 5 and μ was greater than or equal to 5 fig 5a thus it seems that the bjp model won t always achieve obvious improvements in rmse in contrast there were generally greater differences in crps values between the raw releases and the post processed releases under the range of conditions examined in the five experiments fig 5b thus crps reveals the effectiveness of the bjp model better than rmse because crps accounts for the ensemble s spread and its uncertainty the raw release is deterministic and the post processed release calculated using the bjp model involves a series of sample members that numerically represent uncertainty the rmse is calculated based only on the ensemble mean value of the post processed releases whereas the cprs also accounts for the spread variation in the post processed releases thus cprs provides a better assessment of the overall accuracy of the evaluation 4 2 comparison of post processed releases with raw releases using ecodeficit and ecosurplus to further compare the ecological consequences of the post processed releases and the raw releases with changes in parameter values for cv ρflow μ and σ we calculated the difference between a ideal and a raw δraw and between a ideal and a post δpost a difference value of less than 0 i e a negative value means that the magnitude of the ecodeficit or ecosurplus is underestimated and a difference value greater than 0 means the magnitude of the ecodeficit or ecosurplus is overestimated the results for the ecosurplus and ecodeficit calculations are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively figs 7 and 8 show that the post processed releases overestimate the ecosurplus and ecodeficit whereas the raw releases underestimate the ecosurplus and ecodeficit in most cases for decision makers overestimating the ecodeficit and underestimating the ecosurplus are acceptable in terms of the consequences for the real ecological conditions as these conditions contribute to improving ecological and environmental protection however overestimating the ecosurplus and underestimating the ecodeficit are problematic as this makes it impossible to protect the ecology fig 9 illustrates the flow duration curves of observed inflows ideal releases raw releases and post processed releases the inflow forecast uncertainty makes the fdc of the raw releases steeper and increases the range of the flow values the post processing using the bjp model makes the fdc of the post processed releases flatter and the distribution of flow values more concentrated the fdc of ideal releases is always between the fdcs of post processed releases and raw releases leading to larger ecosurplus and ecodeficit for the post processed releases than for the ideal releases and smaller ecosurplus and ecodeficit for the raw releases than for the ideal releases in most cases however the fdc of ideal releases is more similar to the fdc of post processed releases than to the fdc of the raw releases which is consistent with the results in fig 5 4 3 extension opportunities high quality simulation of reservoir releases is critical for downstream environmental protection however most researchers ignore the accuracy of the reservoir releases actually the reservoir operation process would increase the uncertainty of the flows in this study the bjp model is applied in a hypothetical reservoir system to correct errors in reservoir releases but the practical application of this study has not yet been assessed it s better to apply this study to a real world real time reservoir operation to confirm its effectiveness the reservoir release data including the ideal release and the optimal release in this paper is obtained from the reservoir operation optimization model thus the bjp model addresses only the uncertainty in inflow forecasts so do the statistical post processing methods the sources of uncertainty also include model initial and boundary conditions model structure and model parameters li et al 2017 further investigation is required to quantify and reduce these types of uncertainties for forecasted releases in the future 5 conclusion uncertainty is inherent in any real time reservoir operation to improve the accuracy of these operations most researchers have performed their analyses from the perspective of reducing errors in the inflow forecast however the reservoir release is more important from the perspective of environmental flows so we designed the present study to improve the accuracy from that perspective to compare the flow errors in inflow forecasts and reservoir releases we developed a hypothetical reservoir system and conducted five numerical experiments to determine the impacts of changes in the values of parameters cv ρflow μ σ and u the results show that the error variances of the reservoir releases were always larger than those of inflow forecasts under a range of changes in these parameters the reservoir operation increased the uncertainty of the flows thus it s of great importance to analyze reservoir releases and not just reservoir inflows to support real time reservoir operation we employed the bjp model to post process the raw releases by comparing the rmse and crps for the differences between the raw releases and the post processed releases we found that the rmse and crps values for the raw releases were almost always larger than those for the post processed releases our results therefore demonstrated that the bjp model is suitable to post process reservoir releases and could effectively improve the performance of reservoir operation we also adopted fdcs to identify ecosurplus and ecodeficit conditions and used them to evaluate the effects of correcting reservoir releases on downstream ecological conditions after real time reservoir operation by comparing alterations for three kinds of release a ideal a raw and a post we demonstrated that our approach can help water managers make better decisions from the perspective of ecological protection besides this paper is the first to consider ecological evaluations in real time reservoir operation for researchers and reservoir managers who focus on the protection of downstream ecosystems it is more important for them to study and process reservoir releases than reservoir inflows to support effective reservoir operation credit authorship

4685,reservoir operation relies on two sets of flow data to conduct error analysis inflow data and release data previous studies applied only the inflow data to reduce errors and improve the reservoir s operational effectiveness little attention has been paid to the accuracy of the release data however release data provides more accurate information than inflow data for the protection of downstream river ecosystems in this paper we aim to illustrate the necessity of fully using the release data to improve a reservoir s operational performance in a real time reservoir operation system firstly we designed a hypothetical reservoir system performed five numerical experiments with different ranges of model parameters and found that the error variances of reservoir releases were always larger than those of inflows this indicates that the post processing of reservoir releases is required to improve the accuracy of release data and support real time reservoir operation then we used a bayesian joint probability bjp model for post processing release data to reduce errors and quantify the uncertainty we also applied the ecodeficit and ecosurplus based on flow duration curves to evaluate downstream hydrological alterations and further demonstrate the necessity of post processing of release data results showed that the bjp model led to considerable improvement in the root mean square error and the continuous ranked probability score this demonstrates that the bjp model was effective in reducing errors our results highlight the importance of applying release data and improving their accuracy to support reservoir operation if the release data is neglected operational performance will degrade keywords release data real time reservoir operation bayesian joint probability model ecodeficit ecosurplus uncertainty 1 introduction reservoir operational performance is greatly affected by the accuracy of flow data mujumdar and nirmala 2007 fu et al 2013 shokri et al 2013 motevalli et al 2015 tegegne and kim 2020 especially in real time reservoir operation the inflow information required to support real time reservoir operation is obtained from real time hydrological forecasts yang et al 2019 these inflow forecasts are often inaccurate leading to large inconsistencies between the observed inflow and the forecasted inflow in reservoir operation inflows are used to determine the reservoir operating rules and reservoir releases are determined by the magnitudes and variation of the inflows karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 this means inaccurate reservoir inflows generally lead to inaccurate reservoir releases the forecast error in inflows is a major factor that influences the accuracy of flow data and the ability to achieve the goals defined in reservoir operating policies to efficiently operate a reservoir it s necessary to accurately estimate the true flows that govern reservoir operation deng et al 2015 scholars have exerted considerable effort to reduce the influences of inflow forecast on the model s performance in reservoir operation over the past few decades karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 wood and schaake 2008 xu et al 2014 these studies quantified the uncertainty of inflow forecasts using bayesian stochastic optimization during the process of reservoir operation and concluded that they did not perform well in reducing forecast errors to overcome this problem the statistical post processing methods have gained popularity li et al 2017 these methods directly post process the model outputs e g forecasted inflows or reservoir releases by relating them with the observations studies have shown that post processing methods are adequate in correcting forecast errors peng et al 2020 a typical post processing method is the bayesian joint probability bjp model it has been proved that the bjp model outperforms other post processing methods such as regression based models at improving forecast accuracy pokhrel et al 2013 wang et al 2019 the advantage of the bjp model is that it conducts data transformation such as log sinh transformation before parameter fitting to normalize data as well as it applies the bayesian inference technique such as markov chain monte carlo for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification zhao et al 2015 although there has been considerable progress in this research previous researchers only attempted to process forecasted inflows to reduce their errors wang et al 2009 li et al 2010 zhao et al 2019 this is because the forecasted inflows directly support real time reservoir operation and allow managers to estimate the optimal releases unfortunately the inevitable forecast errors of inflows make the estimated optimal releases diverge from the true optima the accuracy of reservoir releases and error correction methods have been rarely studied only zhang et al 2018 used three ai models including a back propagation neural network a support vector regression technique and a long short term memory model to simulate reservoir releases using 30 years of historical reservoir operation records despite this research the effect of the reservoir operation process on reservoir releases has been largely ignored and researchers have not compared the flow errors before and after reservoir operation to demonstrate the importance of error correction in reservoir releases if the priority is accurate forecasting of releases then it s also necessary to improve reservoir releases reservoir operation will in practice change the uncertainty which may even increase improving the accuracy of the reservoir releases could fundamentally improve reservoir operation studying only the inflow data fails to meet the requirements for improving reservoir operation performance the release data is particularly important because downstream riverine ecosystems need to receive adequate environmental flows which are adjusted in accordance with reservoir releases to meet varying demands cardwell et al 1996 petts 2009 yin et al 2011 more accurate flow data leads to a more accurate calculation of environmental flows which could improve the maintenance of the ecological integrity and biodiversity of downstream riverine ecosystems with more and more attention being paid to downstream ecosystem health it s clearly important to study the accuracy of reservoir releases and reduce their errors to improve the performance of reservoir operation the aims of this paper are 1 to investigate the variation in flow errors before and after reservoir operation 2 to apply the bjp model to reduce the errors of reservoir releases in real time reservoir operation 3 to evaluate the effects of correcting release errors on ecological conditions in rivers from the perspective of the degree of hydrological alteration to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that achieves the aim 1 and 2 2 methodology 2 1 problem formulation in this study we modeled a single water supply reservoir in this section we compare the inflow forecast errors and the corresponding release errors before and after real time reservoir operation and then confirm the necessity of correcting the reservoir releases for a given real time reservoir operation optimization model we can use a series of reservoir inflows to obtain a series of corresponding reservoir releases however in real world real time reservoir operation the inflow information is obtained from real time hydrological forecasts and always involves some degree of uncertainty ajami et al 2008 q t q t e t where qt is the observed inflow at time t qt is the forecasted inflow at time t et is the forecast error which represents the uncertainty of the forecasted inflow at time t t 1 2 n accordingly there are two types of reservoir operation fig 1 operation 1 is an ideal case in which we input the observed inflows qt into the reservoir operation optimization model and obtain the ideal releases rt operation 2 is a real world case in which we input the forecasted inflows qt into the same reservoir operation optimization model and obtain the optimal releases rt we then calculate the error as the difference between the optimal releases and the ideal releases ert and calculate the error between the forecasted inflows and the observed inflows eqt as follows e r t r t r t e q t q t q t δ v a r e t v a r e r t v a r e q t where rt is the ideal release at time t which is based on the observed inflow at time t rt is the optimal release at time t which is based on the forecasted inflow at time t var ert and var eqt are the error variances of the reservoir releases and reservoir inflows respectively which quantity the amount of uncertainty δvar et is the difference between the variance of ert and eqt and indicates the change of the uncertainty level according to the water balance equation release decisions are affected by the inflow conditions and the expected ending storage zhao et al 2019 in real time reservoir operation we sometimes make the reservoir water level back to the initial level after one round of operation zhao et al 2012 thus we can assume for the sake of simplicity that the reservoir storages at the initial and end of the operation horizon are the same under this assumption release decisions are only affected by inflow conditions on this basis the cumulative errors of the inflows and releases are equal 5 t 1 n er t t 1 n eq t eq 5 demonstrates that the mean values of ert and eqt are equal in this case the variances of ert and eqt only have three conditions 1 var ert var eqt 2 var ert var eqt 3 var ert var eqt in practice we always obtain var ert var eqt we will demonstrate this in section 3 1 to study how the variances of the flow errors change before and after real time reservoir operation we performed the numerical experiments with a hypothetical reservoir system in section 2 2 2 2 numerical experiments to detect variation in flow errors before and after reservoir operation 2 2 1 reservoir inflow generation we applied the thomas fiering model to generate the reservoir inflow sequences which we treated as the observed inflows zhao et al 2012 6 q t 1 μ ρ flow q t μ 1 ρ flow 2 μ c v δ where qt 1 is the generated reservoir inflow at time t μ is the mean generated inflow ρflow is the correlation coefficient of the inflow cv is the coefficient of variation and δ is a random number drawn from a normal distribution with a mean value of 0 and a variance of 1 the reservoir inflows are constrained to be no less than 0 thus the observed inflows are determined by μ ρflow and cv 2 2 2 synthetic forecasted inflow generation the forecasted inflow is generated by adding an error term to the generated reservoir inflow datta and burges 1984 the uncertainty of the forecasted inflow increases with forecast horizon maurer and lettenmaier 2003 the forecasting error et is assumed to follow a gaussian distribution and its variance increases linearly with forecast lead time t zhao et al 2012 e t n u t ζ t 2 ζ t 2 m i n t σ 2 μ 2 c v 2 where ut and ζt 2 are the mean and variance of the forecast uncertainty at period t respectively ζ2 increases with t at a rate of σ2 and is no more than the reservoir inflow variance of μ2cv2 which means that the forecast error is heteroscedastic σ determines the uncertainty in the forecast in the first period thus the forecasted inflows are determined by u σ 2 2 3 real time reservoir operation system here we establish a hypothetical reservoir system that is characterized by the storage capacity s for a water supply reservoir the utility function can be written as ft rt or ft rt and the utility provided by the reservoir is determined only by the amount of water released by the reservoir booker and o neill 2006 you and cai 2008 the main objective function for reservoir operation optimization model in an ideal case is as below 9 max t 1 h f t r t 10 s t 1 l s t 1 q t r t s t t 1 h s min s t s max r min r t r max s h s t where st is the reservoir storage at time t st is the ending storage at the end of reservoir operation l is the loss ratio for reservoir storage which is ignored in this paper for a conventional reservoir operation the utility function is convex and utility in each period increases with increasing water use at a decreasing rate according to booker and o neill 2006 the utility function is ft rt ln rt in this paper we assumed a reservoir operation that aims to allocate water to the environment to maintain healthy downstream ecosystems the total utility in each period increases with increasing water supplied for the environment and decreases with increasing water after reaching the maximum value as shown in fig 2 aither 2018 thus the utility function is convex and is defined as ft rt rt 1 ln rt for the real world reservoir operation model the rt and qt in the main objective function eqs 9 and 10 are replaced by rt and qt respectively we used dynamic programming in reservoir operation to forecast the simulated releases the decision variable is the reservoir storage at the end of time step t the forecast horizon h h 10 is less than the operation horizon n h n n 100 and we implemented a rolling horizon approach only the current release decision dh 1 is employed to reduce the effect of the initial and ending storage on reservoir operation s0 the initial reservoir storage and st are set as s 2 half of the storage capacity in both the ideal case and the real world case zhao et al 2012 in this paper we conducted five experiments with different parameters characteristic parameters for reservoir inflow cv ρflow μ characteristic parameters for forecast uncertainty σ u to detect their effects on flow errors in reservoir operation the parameter value combinations are summarized in table 1 the ranges of the five parameters cover all situations that would be expected in normal reservoir operations each experiment was conducted with 200 numerical simulations 2 3 using a bayesian joint probability bjp model to correct reservoir releases in this section we employ a bjp model to reduce the errors of reservoir releases and quantify their uncertainty the bjp model formulates the relationship between ideal releases observed values r and optimal releases raw releases r using a bivariate normal joint distribution after transformation in mathematical terms we call r a predictor and r a predictand first we used a log sinh transformation to transform r and r to g and g respectively using eq 11 we then used a bayesian maximum a posteriori method schepen et al 2016 to estimate each set of transformation parameter values a and b 11 g 1 b log sinh a b r next we used a bivariate normal joint distribution to characterize the relationship between the transformed predictor and predictand 12 z g g n μ σ where z represents a vector composed of the transformed variables μ μ g μ g and σ σ g ρ σ g σ g ρ σ g σ g σ g are the mean vector and variance covariance matrix we defined the parameters as the set θ using eq 13 13 θ μ σ given a data series d z t t 1 2 n model parameter set θ is estimated by means of bayesian inference which allows for parameter uncertainty to obtain their posterior distribution 14 p θ d p θ p d θ where p θ is the prior distribution of the parameter set θ and p d θ is the likelihood in this paper the gibbs sampling of the markov chain monte carlo algorithm engeland et al 2005 was implemented for the parameter uncertainty analysis we set the number of burn in iterations to 5000 and the length of the markov chain to 25000 the above process is fitted using training data rm rm and then the predictive uncertainty of the post processed releases rn is derived using the testing data rn rn given a new raw release rn the mean value and variance of gn conditional on gn after transformation are defined as followed e g n μ g ρ σ g σ g g n μ g and v a r g n 1 ρ 2 σ g 2 then the random sample of gn is derived from the conditional distribution gn n e gn var gn in the last step of the analysis we determined each of the sample members of the post processed releases rn by means of inverse log sinh transformation the implementation of the bjp model are detailed in wang et al 2019 2 4 performance evaluation for the bjp model the root mean squared error rmse and the continuous ranked probability score crps are employedto evaluate the overall ability of the bjp method to reduce errors to do so we compared the post processed release ensemble release involving a range of release sequences with its corresponding ideal release and compares the raw release optimal release with the ideal release based on the rmse and crps values rmse measures the standard deviation between observed values and forecast values and it is calculated using the ensemble mean crps appendix a considers the reliability of the spread of ensemble releases and provides the overall accuracy of the evaluation it is widely applied to measure probabilistic forecasts of continuous variables hersbach 2000 laio and tamea 2007 and represents the distance between a forecast probability distribution and the observed value 2 5 evaluating flow alteration using ecodeficit and ecosurplus protection of river ecosystems has become an indispensable part of reservoir operation tharme 2003 vogel et al 2007 rheinheimer et al 2015 he et al 2018 here we wanted to evaluate the degree of flow alteration to further demonstrate the necessity of post processing release data and investigate the effectiveness of the bjp model reservoir operation causes great changes in the natural flow regime and this is expected to result in degradation of the river ecosystem wu et al 2017 to estimate the alterations from inflows to releases in a short period we applied ecodeficit and ecosurplus statistics which are based on the flow duration curve fdc the most common method to evaluate hydrological alterations is the range of variability approach which defines 32 indicators of hydrologic alteration ihas unfortunately the range of variability approach requires a dataset longer than 30 years gao et al 2009 analyzed the 32 iha indicators and found that the ecodeficit and the ecosurplus best explained the variability in the iha statistics and did not require long datasets fig 3 defines the meaning of these indicators the area that is both below the release s fdc and above the inflow s fdc is the ecosurplus the ecosurplus represents extra water that could be supplied to meet the needs of downstream ecosystems that were created by the flow alterations conversely the area that is both below the inflow s fdc and above the release s fdc is the ecodeficit the ecodeficit represents the amount of water that is now unavailable to meet downstream ecological requirements created by alterations of flows by water storage in the reservoir 3 results 3 1 variation in flow errors δvar before and after reservoir operation fig 4 shows the variation in flow errors δvar under different combinations of parameter values for cv ρflow μ σ and u in the five experiments these results show that all values of the δvar are almost greater than 0 for all combinations of parameters in all experiments the variance values for ert were always larger than those for eqt i e var er var eq this demonstrates that reservoir operation increases the uncertainty of the flows on this basis it s more effective to conduct error correction for the reservoir releases than for the reservoir inflows in real time reservoir operation this is because error correction for the inflow forecasts can only reduce errors and could not obtain a perfect forecast there always exists some error and the error will be greater after reservoir operation when the error correction analysis is conducted for reservoir releases the error won t increase fig 4a illustrates the effect of cv on δvar for values of cv ranging from 0 1 to 2 0 the δvar curve increases with increasing cv though with some volatility fig 4b shows that δvar almost the same with increasing ρflow with a range of 0 1 to 0 8 fig 4c shows that δvar increases with increasing μ with a range of 1 to 10 reaching a maximum at µ 4 fig 4d and e show that δvar increased with increasing σ with a range from 0 01 to 0 3 and with increasing u with a range from 0 to 0 5 these results demonstrate that the changes in the uncertainty level become larger with increasing σ and u 3 2 performance of the bjp model the performance of the bjp model is evaluated through leave one year out cross validation fig 5 the rmse and crps are used as measures of the ability of the bjp model to reduce errors and quantify uncertainty in the rest of this section we compare the post processed releases ensemble releases with the corresponding ideal releases and compare the optimal releases raw releases with the corresponding ideal releases 3 2 1 examination of rmse fig 5 a 1 to a 5 show how changes in the five parameters in table 1 affected rmse values for the raw releases the optimal releases and the post processed releases a low rmse value means a more accurate result and suggests that the bjp model was effective overall the rmse values for the post processed releases were lower than those for the raw releases except for μ where there was little difference that is the application of the bjp model notably decreased the rmse values fig 5 a 1 a 4 and a 5 show that the rmse values of the raw releases increased greatly with increasing values of the parameters cv σ and u through the post processing using the bjp model the rmse values of the post processed releases increased dramatically increasing cv however the distances between the raw releases and post processed releases in rmse values gradually decreased and approached zero as cv increased this demonstrates that the bjp model could reduce errors to some extent but that with high inflow variability the ability of the bjp model to reduce the errors weakened when cv was between 1 5 and 2 0 the rmse values of the post processed releases did not differ substantially from those of the raw releases thus the bjp model won t yield obvious improvements in rmse when the uncertainty of reservoir inflows is great fig 5 a 4 shows that the rmse values of the post processed releases increased with increasing σ but began to stabilize at higher values of σ fig 5 a 5 reveals that the rmse values of post processed releases remained relatively constant and low with increasing u the differences between the rmse values of the raw releases and the post processed releases increased with increasing σ and u this illustrates that the bjp model is very useful for reducing errors and that as σ and u increase the ability of the bjp model to reduce errors strengthens the bjp model could control these errors at a very low level fig 5 a 2 shows that the rmse values of the raw releases remain high and relatively constant with increasing ρflow whereas the rmse values of the post processed releases increased slightly with increasing ρflow but remained much lower than the rmse values for the raw releases the gap between the two sets of rmse values was large but decreased with increasing ρflow this indicates the bjp model contributed to reducing errors but that this contribution weakened with increasing ρflow fig 5 a 3 shows that the rmse values of both the raw releases and the post processed releases initially increased rapidly and then fall quickly there was little gap between the raw releases and the post processed releases it seems that the bjp model did not work with increasing μ 3 2 2 examination of crps fig 5 b 1 to b 5 show how changes in the five parameters in table 1 affected crps values for the raw releases and post processed releases the crps considers the spread among the post processed releases and provides an overall accuracy of evaluation based on this spread a low crps value means the result is accurate and has the right spread and that the bjp model is effective overall the crps values for the post processed releases were always lower than those for the raw releases although the differences were smaller for µ than for the other parameters these results confirm the results based on rmse in the previous section and demonstrate that the bjp model could produce significant improvements and reductions in crps the trends for cprs were similar to those for rmse for all of the five parameters through the process of the bjp model the crps values of the post processed releases increased slightly with increasing ρflow and σ and remained relatively constant with increasing u thus parameters ρflow σ and u had little effect on crps however at larger values of σ or u the gap in crps between the raw releases and the post processed releases increased this demonstrates that the bjp model benefits to reduce errors in general although the forecast uncertainty was high it is perfectly possible to process the results to a satisfactory level with the bjp model fig 5 b 2 shows decreasing distances between the raw releases and the post processed releases in crps values with increasing ρflow which is consistent with the results for rmse this indicates that the application of the bjp model helps to reduce errors but that this ability weakens as ρflow increases 3 3 the changing trends of ecodeficit and ecosurplus under different parameters fig 6 shows the changes in ecodeficit and ecosurplus as a function of changing parameter cv ρflow μ σ and u values in the five experiments we evaluated three kinds of flow alterations using the fdc based ecodeficit and ecosurplus statistics first there is the alteration from the observed inflows to the ideal releases a ideal the orange bars in fig 6 second there is the alteration from the observed inflows to the raw releases the optimal releases a raw the red bars in fig 6 third there is the alteration from the observed inflows to the post processed releases a post the green bars in fig 6 both the ecodeficit and the ecosurplus increased steadily and greatly with increasing cv and μ for all three kinds of alterations fig 6a and c this indicates that greater inflow variability or greater inflow leads to more extra water that can be supplied to meet downstream ecological requirements in the wet season whereas less water is available to meet downstream ecological requirements in the dry season due to the flow alterations thus the dry season would become drier and the wet season would become wetter for a river with high inflows or high inflow variability fig 6b illustrates that both ecodeficit and ecosurplus decrease slightly for all three kinds of alterations as ρflow increases and the reductions are not huge this implies that the correlation coefficient for the inflow also affects the ecodeficit and ecosurplus however the impact is less than that for the other two reservoir inflow characteristics inflow variability and inflow fig 6d and 6e show the effect of forecast uncertainty on ecodeficit and ecosurplus as σ increases from 0 01 to 0 30 and as u increases from 0 to 0 5 the ecodeficit and ecosurplus both remain relatively constant with increasing σ or u for a ideal because σ and u are parameters that characterize the forecast uncertainty fig 6d illustrates that as σ increases both ecodeficit and ecosurplus have a minor downward trend for a raw but have a slight upward trend for a post these results highlight that the post processed releases completely change the trend for ecodeficit and ecosurplus fig 6e illustrates that as u increases both the ecodeficit and ecosurplus have a not obvious and negligible upward trend for a post the ecodeficit and ecosurplus remain nearly the same but then the ecodeficit decreases gradually to near 0 and the ecosurplus increases rapidly as u increases this indicates that the raw releases will produce huge errors in ecodeficit and ecosurplus and that the errors become greater with a larger mean value of forecast uncertainty the post processed releases correct these errors to some extent 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of rmse with crps from the perspective of rmse the rmse of the raw releases were not substantially higher than those of the post processed releases under some conditions such as when cv was greater than 1 5 and μ was greater than or equal to 5 fig 5a thus it seems that the bjp model won t always achieve obvious improvements in rmse in contrast there were generally greater differences in crps values between the raw releases and the post processed releases under the range of conditions examined in the five experiments fig 5b thus crps reveals the effectiveness of the bjp model better than rmse because crps accounts for the ensemble s spread and its uncertainty the raw release is deterministic and the post processed release calculated using the bjp model involves a series of sample members that numerically represent uncertainty the rmse is calculated based only on the ensemble mean value of the post processed releases whereas the cprs also accounts for the spread variation in the post processed releases thus cprs provides a better assessment of the overall accuracy of the evaluation 4 2 comparison of post processed releases with raw releases using ecodeficit and ecosurplus to further compare the ecological consequences of the post processed releases and the raw releases with changes in parameter values for cv ρflow μ and σ we calculated the difference between a ideal and a raw δraw and between a ideal and a post δpost a difference value of less than 0 i e a negative value means that the magnitude of the ecodeficit or ecosurplus is underestimated and a difference value greater than 0 means the magnitude of the ecodeficit or ecosurplus is overestimated the results for the ecosurplus and ecodeficit calculations are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively figs 7 and 8 show that the post processed releases overestimate the ecosurplus and ecodeficit whereas the raw releases underestimate the ecosurplus and ecodeficit in most cases for decision makers overestimating the ecodeficit and underestimating the ecosurplus are acceptable in terms of the consequences for the real ecological conditions as these conditions contribute to improving ecological and environmental protection however overestimating the ecosurplus and underestimating the ecodeficit are problematic as this makes it impossible to protect the ecology fig 9 illustrates the flow duration curves of observed inflows ideal releases raw releases and post processed releases the inflow forecast uncertainty makes the fdc of the raw releases steeper and increases the range of the flow values the post processing using the bjp model makes the fdc of the post processed releases flatter and the distribution of flow values more concentrated the fdc of ideal releases is always between the fdcs of post processed releases and raw releases leading to larger ecosurplus and ecodeficit for the post processed releases than for the ideal releases and smaller ecosurplus and ecodeficit for the raw releases than for the ideal releases in most cases however the fdc of ideal releases is more similar to the fdc of post processed releases than to the fdc of the raw releases which is consistent with the results in fig 5 4 3 extension opportunities high quality simulation of reservoir releases is critical for downstream environmental protection however most researchers ignore the accuracy of the reservoir releases actually the reservoir operation process would increase the uncertainty of the flows in this study the bjp model is applied in a hypothetical reservoir system to correct errors in reservoir releases but the practical application of this study has not yet been assessed it s better to apply this study to a real world real time reservoir operation to confirm its effectiveness the reservoir release data including the ideal release and the optimal release in this paper is obtained from the reservoir operation optimization model thus the bjp model addresses only the uncertainty in inflow forecasts so do the statistical post processing methods the sources of uncertainty also include model initial and boundary conditions model structure and model parameters li et al 2017 further investigation is required to quantify and reduce these types of uncertainties for forecasted releases in the future 5 conclusion uncertainty is inherent in any real time reservoir operation to improve the accuracy of these operations most researchers have performed their analyses from the perspective of reducing errors in the inflow forecast however the reservoir release is more important from the perspective of environmental flows so we designed the present study to improve the accuracy from that perspective to compare the flow errors in inflow forecasts and reservoir releases we developed a hypothetical reservoir system and conducted five numerical experiments to determine the impacts of changes in the values of parameters cv ρflow μ σ and u the results show that the error variances of the reservoir releases were always larger than those of inflow forecasts under a range of changes in these parameters the reservoir operation increased the uncertainty of the flows thus it s of great importance to analyze reservoir releases and not just reservoir inflows to support real time reservoir operation we employed the bjp model to post process the raw releases by comparing the rmse and crps for the differences between the raw releases and the post processed releases we found that the rmse and crps values for the raw releases were almost always larger than those for the post processed releases our results therefore demonstrated that the bjp model is suitable to post process reservoir releases and could effectively improve the performance of reservoir operation we also adopted fdcs to identify ecosurplus and ecodeficit conditions and used them to evaluate the effects of correcting reservoir releases on downstream ecological conditions after real time reservoir operation by comparing alterations for three kinds of release a ideal a raw and a post we demonstrated that our approach can help water managers make better decisions from the perspective of ecological protection besides this paper is the first to consider ecological evaluations in real time reservoir operation for researchers and reservoir managers who focus on the protection of downstream ecosystems it is more important for them to study and process reservoir releases than reservoir inflows to support effective reservoir operation credit authorship

4686,the assessment of natural background levels nbls in groundwater is considered as an efficient way to distinguish the geogenic compound from anthropogenic pollution of groundwater a basic issue in groundwater environmental management at present most studies only assess nbls of single parameters in groundwater such method however ignored the complex components and interaction in the groundwater which leads to the inaccuracy of the assessment in this study 51 groundwater samples were investigated in november 2018 in pinggu basin one of the most important emergency groundwater supply sources of beijing hierarchical cluster analysis hca was used firstly to divide the study area into four zones by combining single parameter nbls assessment and comprehensive nbls assessment the possible anthropogenic impact on groundwater quality in different zones could be determined with the use of land use map for single parameter nbls assessment iterative grubbs test was used to assess nbls of the data following gaussian distribution and the median plus minus twofold the median of the absolute deviations from the median median 2mad method was used to assess nbls of the data for the non gaussian distribution for comprehensive nbls assessment mahalanobis distances of scatters in scatter plots which express the hydrogeological evolution processes were involved in addition δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were used to analyze the sources of nitrate in groundwater the results showed that the groundwater was affected by industrial activities agricultural activities urban domestic sewage and landfills and the groundwater quality in the east of the study area was better than that in the west nitrate in the groundwater of study area mainly came from nitrification and denitrification occurred in the groundwater near the landfills this study provides a way to assess the nbls of groundwater quality and to determine sources and transformation of nitrate in the groundwater which contributes to the identification of anthropogenic pollution in groundwater keywords pinggu basin groundwater pollution natural background levels nbls gaussian distribution mahalanobis distance stable isotope 1 introduction groundwater is an important source of fresh water and the main source of drinking water in many large cities and rural areas borzi et al 2015 koh et al 2009 in recent years with the economic development pollutants from industry agriculture and cities have entered groundwater causing the deterioration of groundwater quality sellerino et al 2019 mondal and singh 2011 threatening the safety of humans and nature both geogenic and anthropogenic origin could control the concentrations of inorganic compounds in groundwater rahman et al 2020 thus determining the natural background levels nbls of these inorganic parameters which is defined as a relative measure to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic concentrations matschullat et al 2000 is important nbl of a certain parameter is usually evaluated as an absolute value which is however not realistic in many cases rahman et al 2021 nakic et al 2007 generally nbls are affected by natural geogenic hydrological biological and atmospheric processes gao et al 2020 and both natural factors e g lithology and runoff and anthropogenic factors e g sewage and irrigation control the groundwater components so it is more reliable to regard groundwater nbls as a range rather than a unique value nakic et al 2007 data outside this range we regard it as the anomalous parts of the dataset which is the result of anthropogenic activities preziosi et al 2014 because of the complexity of groundwater monitoring dataset statistical methods are generally employed in the studies to remove these anomalous parts of the dataset de caro et al 2017 ducci et al 2016 gao et al 2020 guadagnini et al 2020 nonparametric methods are usually independent of the distribution of data such as pre selection rotiroti and fumagalli 2013 relative cumulative frequency analysis gao et al 2020 matschullat et al 2000 and the median plus minus twofold the median of the absolute deviations from the median of all the data median 2mad parrone et al 2019 preziosi et al 2014 on the contrary parameter methods such as grubbs test analytical methods committee 2015 grubbs 1950 li et al 2018 and dixon s test aslam 2020 dean and dixon 1951 efstathiou 2006 often show depends on the distribution of data previous study has shown that for numerous n 25 distributions close to normal grubbs test is more appropriate and more powerful than others parrone et al 2019 preziosi et al 2014 and for data do not follow a gaussian distribution the median 2mad method can provide more conservative and feasible results parrone et al 2019 reimann et al 2005 santos 2020 shrestha et al 2017 in addition the pre selection method that is based on selecting the uninfluenced groundwater samples corresponding to the natural population is usually used at first ducci et al 2016 rotiroti and fumagalli 2013 in this method water samples with high nitrate content no3 10 mg l or no3 50 mg l ducci et al 2016 ghergo et al 2017 preziosi et al 2014 or other human synthetic compounds hinsby et al 2008 are removed first at present most studies only assess the nbl of a single parameter in groundwater ducci et al 2016 gao et al 2020 guadagnini et al 2020 libera et al 2017 molinari et al 2018 the complex water rock interactions cation exchange carbonate weather etc in groundwater however are ignored and may cause error in the assessment for example na ca2 cation exchange in groundwater will shift the cl na k cl and the carbonate weather in groundwater will cause ca2 mg2 hco3 meq l close to 1 argamasilla et al 2017 huang et al 2016a wang et al 2013 yang et al 2016 on the other hand groundwater components and interactions will change under the effect of anthropogenic activities thus the source of groundwater pollution could be tracked abu alnaeem et al 2018 in addition single parameter nbls assessment can only find out the pollution of specific components not the whole pollution degree of groundwater he et al 2020 mondal 2021 thus comprehensive nbl that considers the water rock interactions of groundwater is needed wang et al 2019 used mahalanobis distance of two dimensional coordinate points on the groundwater chemistry scatter plots to assess comprehensive nbls of groundwater in shandong province china but the single parameter nbls is not considered which may lead to the missing of specific pollution sources in this study we combined both single parameter and comprehensive nbls to evaluate the groundwater chemical characteristic and we improved the assessment methods based on the statistical distribution of the data among groundwater pollutants nitrate is an important and ubiquitous pollutant there are many studies specifically on groundwater nitrate pollution kazakis et al 2020 torres martínez et al 2020 meghdadi and javar 2018 bu et al 2017 ji et al 2017 clague et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 mondal et al 2010 dual isotope no3 analysis δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 have been widely used to identify the sources of nitrate xue et al 2009 as we all know nitrate from different sources has different δ15n δ18o compositions for example in precipitation δ15n and δ18o range from 13 to 13 and 25 to 75 respectively in synthetic fertilizers δ15n and δ18o range from 6 to 6 and 17 to 25 respectively the value of δ18o in nitrate generated by nitrification is often lower than the above two sources which range from 10 to 15 in ammonium fertilizer and urea δ15n range from 6 to 6 in soil n δ15n range from 0 to 8 sewage and manure have been characterized by similar δ15n value specifically 4 to 25 xue et al 2009 kandal 1998 therefore the distinct dual isotopic composition of nitrate provides a powerful signature to trace the main sources of nitrate and biogeochemical transformation mechanisms meghdadi and javar 2018 in this study we combined stable isotope analysis δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 with nbls assessment to figure out possible groundwater pollution sources in the study area take pinggu basin from china as an example here we showed that the method proposed in this study was efficient in identify the influence of anthropogenic activities on groundwater and the possible sources of contamination 2 study area pinggu district is located in northeast of beijing china bordering tianjin and hebei fig 1 a the study area is the basin of pinggu 116 58 37 117 18 42 n 40 2 19 40 11 48 e fig 1b with an area of about 402 km2 accounting for 42 3 of the total area the basin is an individual intermontane basin hydrogeological unit with limestone aquifer as the major aquifer in the mountain area and quaternary sediment unconsolidated aquifer in the plain area the study area has a temperate continental monsoon climate with large temperature changes in winter and summer the multi year average temperature is 26 1 with multi year average rainfall of 521 1 mm pinggu district is composed of 16 towns of which pinggu town has a population of 80 000 being the most populous town and the most prosperous place in the study area according to the land use of the study area fig 2 the study area was covered by a large area of cropland pinggu town was the center of the study area and mafang town was in the southwest of the study area they are the most prosperous places of the pinggu basin and covered by large areas of artificial surface the northwestern part of the study area mainly develops industry and agriculture and the industrial park focuses on the development of electromechanical electronics clothing woolen and food brewing a landfill which consist of two sites is located in the southwest of the study area the south site was built earlier than 2000 covering an area of about 11 000 m2 and the waste was directly buried in low lying river channels without any treatment until abandonment the north site was built in 2003 covering an area of 30 000 m2 and is still in use li et al 2020 in addition there are two emergency groundwater sources in the study area which are important drinking water resources for beijing residents there are 32 rivers in pinggu district of which three are main rivers namely jv river cuo river and jinji river jv river is the longest river in the area with a length of 54 15 km and a catchment area of 1692 km2 the other rivers are tributaries of jv river the stratigraphic lithology in the study area is simple mainly consisting of dolomite and sandstone hydrogeological profile of a a and b b in fig 1 was shown in supplementary material fig s1 the bedrock of limestone is buried deep and the upper layer is covered with quaternary sediments the quaternary strata are dominated by the flooding of the jv river and cuo river and the thickness of the sediments changes from thin to thick from the piedmont area to the center of the basin with a maximum thickness of 550 m wang et al 2008 the overall flow direction of the groundwater in the study area is mainly from northeast to southwest fig 2 hydraulic conductivity was shown in supplementary material fig s2 groundwater mainly receives recharge from precipitation surface water infiltration and lateral recharge in the piedmont zone the precipitation is distributed from july to september and the groundwater level show lags correspond to the precipitation fig 1c groundwater level data from sample no 24 in the recharge area east of the area reservoir leakage and canal system return infiltration are also important sources of recharge yang et al 2011 the groundwater discharge in pinggu district mainly includes local emergency water source exploitation industrial agricultural and residential domestic water exploitation and lateral runoff of groundwater 3 data and methodology 3 1 data a total of 51 groundwater samples fig 1 were obtained from hydrogeochemical surveys in november 2018 from unconfined aquifer ph and tds were performed by portable multi parameter water quality meter groundwater samples were filtered with 0 45 μm filter membranes and collected in polyethylene bottles 2l after pumping for 20 min nitrate was added to the sample used to test cations for ph 2 all samples were stored in ice boxes at 4 c until laboratory analysis inductively coupled plasma spectrometer was used to analyze ion concentrations k na ca2 and mg2 ion chromatography was used to determine the concentrations of hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and nh4 laboratory quality assurance qa and quality control qc methods were used to ensure the quality of the analytical data including standard calibration the use of standard operating procedures and reagent blank analysis all analyses were performed in triplicate reagent blanks were monitored throughout analysis and used to correct analysis results charge balance error of all results 5 indicating results from all analyses were accurate and reliable for the stable isotope analysis of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 the bore water samples were filtered with 0 45 μm filter membranes and stored in sterile and dark brown polyethylene bottles 0 5l and kept at 4 c until laboratory analysis the stable isotopes were determined by denitrifying bacteria method with isotope radio mass spectrometry irms isoprime100 uk isoprime company which adapted from xu et al 2012 the stable isotope ratios are expressed in delta δ units and a per mil notation relative to an international standard 1 δ s a m p l e r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where r s a m p l e and r s t a n d a r d are the 15n 14n or 18o 16o ratio of the sample and the δ15n and δ18o standard respectively reported δ15n values are relative to n2 in atmospheric air and reported δ18o values are relative to vienna standard mean ocean water 3 2 hierarchical cluster analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca is an unsupervised multivariate statistical analysis technique which can divide variables r mode or cases q mode into different clusters according to the similarity among variables cases zeng and rasmussen 2005 mathes and rasmussen 2006 many concealed hydrogeochemical processes in groundwater can be identified through hca kazakis et al 2017 güler et al 2012 the clustering process begins with groundwater samples as the individual cluster the number of clusters are reduced by linking according to their similarity until only one left templ et al 2008 the results of hca can be observed as tree graph davis and sampson 1986 whose roots are all groundwater samples hca in this study was conducted in spss 25 0 the measured variables in this study were in different scales and units so the data was treated after data scaling by z transformation 3 3 methodology of nbls assessment in single parameter nbls assessment as the groundwater in the study area provides people with drinking water the stricter standards no3 10 mg l were chosen for pre selection muller et al 2006 parrone et al 2019 sellerino et al 2019 which was proposed by a guideline published in 2017 ghergo et al 2017 then the shapiro wilk test α 0 05 shapiro and wilk 1965 was used to determine if the remaining dataset follows gaussian distribution for parameters following gaussian distribution iterative grubbs test α 0 01 was used and for parameters not following gaussian distribution median 2mad method was used fig 3 then according to the distribution types of the remaining data determined by shapiro wilk test α 0 05 mean x were calculated using different statistical methods arithmetic mean method is applicable to normal cumulative distribution geometric mean method is applicable to the log normal distribution cumulative frequency analysis is applicable to the skewed distribution gao et al 2020 and the x s was the nbls range in comprehensive nbls assessment mahalanobis distances of the two dimensional coordinate points of groundwater chemistry scatter plots were calculated mahalanobis distance is an effective method for calculating the similarity of unknown datasets it is usually used to calculate the distance of points in a two dimensional space unlike the euclidean distance it considers the characteristics between variables so the results can better reflect the interrelated characteristics of the data hamill et al 2016 itagakia et al 2007 zhao et al 2015 the shapiro wilk test α 0 05 was used to determine whether the mahalanobis distances follow gaussian distribution or not for mahalanobis distances following gaussian distribution iterative grubbs test α 0 01 was used otherwise median 2mad method was used same as the single parameter nbls assessment fig 3 sampling points that never be removed in any groundwater chemistry scatter plots were regarded as background points in addition we graded the data to evaluate the comprehensive abnormal level cal the classification process conducted as follow the radio of the mahalanobis distance of the point and the threshold value of the method was regarded as the abnormal level of the point in each scatter plot and the average abnormal level of different plots was taken as the comprehensive abnormal level of the point eq 2 and the data were divided into three levels background points were regarded as class a and median 2mad of the comprehensive abnormal level of the points was taken as the second level limit value to obtain class b and class c reimann et al 2005 2 c a l j 1 n i 1 n m i j t i c a l j is the comprehensive abnormal level of the j t h point n is the number of scatter plots that identify the j t h point m i j is the mahalanobis distance of the j t h point in the i t h scatter plots t i is the threshold value in the i t h scatter plots 4 results 4 1 water sample groupings and hydrogeochemical characterization hca was performed on 51 sampling points using groundwater chemistry parameters as variables q mode the clustering results were shown in fig 4 the sampling points were divided into four clusters c1 c2 c3 and c4 the average values of parameters for each cluster were shown in table 1 and the characteristic of 15n no3 and 18o no3 were shown in table 2 there were ten sampling points in c1 with highest average concentrations of na and hco3 among the four clusters c2 only had seven sampling points but show highest average concentrations of ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and tds in the four clusters and with lowest ph among the four clusters c3 consist of 17 sampling points the average concentrations of all other parameters were the lowest value except for k na hco3 no3 and ph c4 had 17 sampling points with highest average concentration of no3 among the four clusters in addition the average concentrations of no3 in the c1 and c4 exceeded the standard value 20 mg l according to groundwater quality standards gb t 14848 2017 proposed by china national standardization management committee cnsmc 2017 as for stable isotopes the range of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 was 6 51 to 15 64 and 4 75 to 19 17 respectively refer to previous research δ18o no3 in the study area was lower than those of atmospheric 25 75 and the nitrate fertilizer 20 25 all of the δ18o no3 in the study area was within the range of nitrification 10 to 15 except for one point located between nitrification and nitrate fertilizer xue et al 2009 δ15n no3 in the study area was distributed in the three range shown in the previously studies nh4 and urea 6 to 6 soil n 0 8 and manure sewage 4 25 xue et al 2009 yue et al 2014 among them the average values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 of c2 were the largest and the δ15n no3 of c2 was only distributed in the range of manure sewage while the other clusters were distributed in at least two ranges from the spatial distribution map of sampling points fig 1 c1 was distributed in the northwest of the study area c2 was distributed in the southwest of the study area c3 was located in the east of the study area and c4 was located near pinggu town and mafang town 4 2 single parameter nbls assessment pre selection method removed 27 sampling points with no3 10 mg l and the removed samples were all collected from the groundwater in the area with strong influence of human activities industrial parks and farmland shapiro wilk test α 0 05 showed that only k and hco3 followed gaussian distribution so grubbs test was used to identify the outliers of k and hco3 and the outliers of na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 tds and the remaining no3 were identified by median 2mad method the results showed that there were no outliers in the data of k and hco3 and the outliers of the other parameters were shown in probability plots fig 5 and the nbls was shown in table 3 probability plots allow the display of the data and graphically observe the main trends they are clustered on the principle that different sources generate different populations of data that can be separated by statistical techniques preziosi et al 2014 point clusters of probability plots may indicate that the samples belong to a single population that originates from a unique process changes in the slope of the curve may correspond to transitions between different populations so they can be used in separating natural and anthropogenic components but local geochemical anomalies or natural changes in the geochemical phase may also be masked sellerino et al 2019 for groundwater monitoring data lognormal probability plots are commonly used sinclair 1974 the results in fig 5 showed that na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 no3 and tds had 13 10 9 12 10 4 and 9 abnormal points respectively the obvious slope changes or discontinuities between the abnormal points and the others in the probability plots proved the feasibility of the median 2mad method in nbls assessment to some extent however there were also slight slope changes in normal points indicating the heterogeneity of hydrogeochemistry under natural conditions sellerino et al 2019 4 3 comprehensive nbls assessment five classic groundwater chemistry scatter plots were used to assess comprehensive nbls fig 6 a chadha s plot which shows groundwater type chadha 1999 b scatter plot of cai versus cl meq l which shows ion exchange in which cai cl na k cl abu alnaeem et al 2018 c scatter plot of no3 cl versus cl meq l which shows anthropogenic inputs of the groundwater chemistry components murgulet and tick 2013 wang et al 2016 saxena et al 2003 d scatter plot of hco3 cl ratio versus cl meq l which shows the degree of salinity chaudhuri and srinivasulu 2014 october et al 2013 e scatter plot of ca2 mg2 versus hco3 meq l which shows carbonate weathering previous study have shown that carbonate weathering in the study area dominates li et al 2020 compared with the scatter plots selected by wang et al 2019 the piper diagram was replaced by chadha s plot fig 6a chadha 1999 which can avoid errors caused by coordinate conversion and the scatter plots of anthropogenic inputs fig 6c and salinity fig 6d of groundwater were added because the salinity can usually be greatly affected by anthropogenic activities abu alnaeem et al 2018 shapiro wilk test α 0 05 showed the mahalanobis distances of these five scatter plots all did not follow gaussian distribution thus median 2mad method was employed ten abnormal points were detected in fig 6a and all sampling points were hco3 ca type except one was cl ca type seven abnormal points were detected in fig 6b previous study reported that when cai is close to 0 it indicates that there is no ion exchange process in the groundwater when there is a softening process i e ca2 and mg2 of water are immobilized and na and k from the aquifer material are released cai 0 argamasilla et al 2017 elgettafi et al 2012 which is called base ion exchange process conversely when a hardening process occurs i e na and k of water are immobilized and ca2 and mg2 from the aquifer material are released cai 0 abu alnaeem et al 2018 taylor 2016 which is called reverse ion exchange process and if the cai is near to 1 the reverse ion exchange process is strong a lot of points in fig 6b had cai values between 5 to 0 indicating that the existence of base ion exchange process however four abnormal points had the cai values between 0 76 0 91 with higher concentration in cl which indicated the strong reverse ion exchange process fig 6c was usually used to show the concentrates of cl and no3 which usually be regarded as groundwater contamination indicators wang et al 2016 busico et al 2020 and nine abnormal points were detected in this diagram in fig 6d the ratios of hco3 cl were all above 2 which indicated the fresh water chaudhuri and srinivasulu 2014 october et al 2013 seven abnormal points with higher concentration in cl were detected in this diagram in fig 6e the samples were basically distributed along the 1 1 line but ten abnormal points could also be identified the comprehensive abnormal level was shown in fig 7 22 sampling points were grouped into class a which could be considered as nbls 20 sampling points were grouped into class b which could be considered as slight contaminated areas nine sampling points were grouped into class c which could be considered as heavily contaminated areas 5 discussion 5 1 anthropogenic sources of groundwater contamination as a common statistical method hca is often used with other methods to get better results zeng and rasmussen 2005 and mathes et al 2006 analyzed the water quality by combining hca with factor analysis fa and gis respectively and achieved good results this study combined hca with nbls assessment to identify groundwater pollution sources in order to identify groundwater pollution the distribution of the points outside the nbls range needs attention the land use type of the study area can help to identify the possible sources of groundwater pollution fig 2 the spatial distributions of these points were shown in fig 8 c1 was distributed in the northwest of the study area the concentrations of na were the highest in the cluster table 1 and the average concentration of no3 was 30 0 mg l exceeding the standard value 20 mg l cnmsc 2017 according to the field investigation and the land use map fig 2 industrial parks and agricultural land were located in this area so industry and agriculture were the main sources of groundwater contamination in this area na is commonly used in food processing and medicine production processes chalitangkoon et al 2020 ndanuko et al 2020 and the sewage generated during the clothing and food brewing processes might increase the concentrations of cl so4 2 and no3 in the groundwater mcarthur et al 2012 the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 could be increased by the wastewater discharged from electronic equipment factories nalivan et al 2019 pinggu district is an important agricultural product base of beijing no3 in synthetic fertilizer can enter groundwater through precipitation large areas of farmland and orchards covered in the northwest pesticides such as bordeaux mixture that widely used in orchards will lead to enrich of cuso4 in groundwater groundwater in this area flow from the front of the mountain to the south and hydraulic gradient become small in south which lead to the slow flow of groundwater which may facilitate the contaminants accumulation at the downstream of the factory huang et al 2019b which also caused that the south of this area was regarded as class c only seven sampling points were clustered in c2 and this cluster was also considered as class c except one point the average concentrations of ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and tds were the highest of the clusters these results indicated that c2 might have been seriously affected by anthropogenic activities according to the survey and the land use map fig 2 all seven samples were taken from the aquifer near a landfill landfill leachate changed the groundwater environment greatly resulting in an increase in the concentration of ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and tds in the groundwater however there were two points with low concentrations of no3 fig 8g this might caused by denitrification of nitrate because that in many complex landfill leachate environments there is usually organic carbon to drive denitrification christensen et al 2000 rivett et al 2008 and this can be proved by stable isotopic 15n no3 and 18o no3 analysis c3 was located in the east of the study area which can regard as the nbls of the study area and it was considered as class a this area is the recharge area of the basin with scarce population and less affected by the anthropogenic activities according to field surveys although the area is covered by cropland there are few agricultural activities and most cropland has ceased production c4 had 17 sampling points of which were distributed in two areas one is pinggu town located in the center of the study area which is densely populated and the most prosperous place in the study area the other is mafang town which is the only exit of the basin so the traffic here is busy and the population is growing rapidly in recent years therefore the discharge of domestic sewage was the main source of groundwater contaminant that generated class b and class c of this cluster table 1 showed that the average concentration of no3 63 1 mg l here was the highest among the four clusters which is three times of the standard value 20 mg l cnmsc 2017 the concentration of cl in this cluster was 27 2 mg l which was the second highest value after c2 high cl or no3 concentration is usually caused by domestic sewage wang et al 2016 furthermore four abnormal points in fig 5b which had high cl concentrations and strong reverse ion exchange located in this cluster and c2 normally the cai value in low salinity areas is negative indicating that the groundwater in these areas is subject to freshening processes accompanied by the release of na from the aquifer material and the fixation of ca2 in groundwater base ion exchange process on the contrary in the area of sewage invasion the value of cai would be close to 1 and the reverse ion exchange process will occur taylor 2016 therefore the strong reverse ion exchange was caused by the intrusion of sewage in addition the high no3 concentration points were distributed at the west and south edge of pinggu town instead of inside pinggu town this was due to the dense villages around pinggu town the limited sewage treatment facilities of these villages may be the main reason that caused the high no3 in this area 5 2 sources and transformation of nitrate as the pollution of nitrate in groundwater was complex and there were many points exceeding the nbl in fig 8g δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were used to analyze the sources and transformation of nitrate the different 15n 18o isotopic composition of nitrate is affected by the source of nitrate and biological processes in general δ18o no3 formed by nitrification is much lower than that of precipitation and nitrate fertilizers δ18o no3 range from 25 to 75 and 17 to 25 respectively in precipitation and synthetic fertilizers theoretically two oxygen atoms in the nitrate formed by nitrification come from water and one oxygen atom comes from oxygen eq 3 böttcher et al 1990 in fig 9 most of the sampling points were located near the theoretical value however some sampling points were higher than the theoretical value and some sampling points were lower most points of c1 were lower than the theoretical value and most of the points of c2 were higher than the theoretical value the following results could be interpreted as a consequence of the higher points i the ratio of oxygen incorporation from h2o and o2 was not 2 1 e g more o2 may be derived from atmospheric o2 when nh4 is limiting ii soil moisture evaporation and bacterial respiration leaded to an increase in 18o in water kendall et al 2007 iii isotope fractionation caused by respiration made the 18o in the soil higher than the 18o in the atmosphere xue et al 2009 iv denitrification leaded to accumulation of heavier isotopes otero et al 2009 as for the points lower than the theoretical value might be due to that nh4 was high and the nitrification rate was high which leaded to more use of o in water yue et al 2014 or the oxygen exchange between nitrate and water changed the soil oxygen isotope composition kool et al 2011 leading to low δ18o no3 values wexler et al 2012 3 δ 18 o no 3 2 3 δ 18 o h 2 o 1 3 δ 18 o o 2 dual isotopic approach was used to identify the sources of the nitrite fig 10 the points in c1 were widely distributed and were affected by urea and nitrogen fertilizer and sewage the nitrate in c2 and c4 came from waste water of landfill and domestic sewage respectively the nitrate in c3 was mainly from soil n generally the increase in the isotopic composition of nitrate with a ratio of 1 1 dale et al 2014 and 2 1 granger et al 2008 indicated the probability of denitrification the isotopic composition of c1 and c2 in fig 10 tracks well within the denitrification vectors except two points in c1 however the do of c1 and c2 were 1 8 6 4 mg l and 1 6 5 4 mg l respectively according to cey et al 1999 one requirement for denitrification is anaerobic conditions or restricted oxygen availability dissolved oxygen concentration less than around 2 mg l but many studies have found that denitrification occurs in water samples with do 2 mg l moncaster et al 2000 otero et al 2009 there might be two reasons i several species of bacteria from soils were capable of respiring oxygen and nitrate simultaneously under aerobic conditions at up to 80 air saturation and aerobic denitrifying fungi also occur carter et al 1995 cannavo et al 2004 ii micro organisms in sediments do not necessarily experience the same concentrations as those measured by a dissolved oxygen probe in a mixed sample thus denitrification occurs in micro anaerobic environments where dissolved oxygen has been completely removed koba et al 1997 rivett et al 2008 otero et al 2009 there are few instances of the former while the latter is widespread besides the average concentrations of hco3 of c1 and c2 were high in table 1 which may also be the result of denitrification as well known there are two types of denitrification heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic denitrification eq 4 eq 5 eq 7 heterotrophic denitrification produced hco3 in autotrophic denitrification if it is driven by pyrite oxidation the acidity generated in the reaction tends to dissolve carbonate thereby increasing the concentration of hco3 moncaster et al 2000 aravena and robertson 1998 heterotrophic denitrification 4 4 n o 3 5 c 2 h 2 o 2 n 2 4 h c o 3 c o 2 autotrophic denitrification 5 4 f e s 2 14 o 2 4 h 2 o 4

the pinggu basin beijing with multivariate statistical analysis nbls assessment and stable isotope analysis the groundwater in the east of the study area was less affected by human activities while the west and the center groundwater of the study area were affected by industrial activities agricultural activities urban domestic sewage and landfill the nitrate of the study area was mainly formed by nitrification of fertilizer manure and sewage and denitrification happened in the groundwater around the industrial park and the landfill which caused high concentration of hco3 the combination of single parameter and comprehensive nbls assessment with the help of nitrogen and oxygen isotopes is efficient in identifying the possible anthropogenic impact on groundwater quality the pollution

4686,the assessment of natural background levels nbls in groundwater is considered as an efficient way to distinguish the geogenic compound from anthropogenic pollution of groundwater a basic issue in groundwater environmental management at present most studies only assess nbls of single parameters in groundwater such method however ignored the complex components and interaction in the groundwater which leads to the inaccuracy of the assessment in this study 51 groundwater samples were investigated in november 2018 in pinggu basin one of the most important emergency groundwater supply sources of beijing hierarchical cluster analysis hca was used firstly to divide the study area into four zones by combining single parameter nbls assessment and comprehensive nbls assessment the possible anthropogenic impact on groundwater quality in different zones could be determined with the use of land use map for single parameter nbls assessment iterative grubbs test was used to assess nbls of the data following gaussian distribution and the median plus minus twofold the median of the absolute deviations from the median median 2mad method was used to assess nbls of the data for the non gaussian distribution for comprehensive nbls assessment mahalanobis distances of scatters in scatter plots which express the hydrogeological evolution processes were involved in addition δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were used to analyze the sources of nitrate in groundwater the results showed that the groundwater was affected by industrial activities agricultural activities urban domestic sewage and landfills and the groundwater quality in the east of the study area was better than that in the west nitrate in the groundwater of study area mainly came from nitrification and denitrification occurred in the groundwater near the landfills this study provides a way to assess the nbls of groundwater quality and to determine sources and transformation of nitrate in the groundwater which contributes to the identification of anthropogenic pollution in groundwater keywords pinggu basin groundwater pollution natural background levels nbls gaussian distribution mahalanobis distance stable isotope 1 introduction groundwater is an important source of fresh water and the main source of drinking water in many large cities and rural areas borzi et al 2015 koh et al 2009 in recent years with the economic development pollutants from industry agriculture and cities have entered groundwater causing the deterioration of groundwater quality sellerino et al 2019 mondal and singh 2011 threatening the safety of humans and nature both geogenic and anthropogenic origin could control the concentrations of inorganic compounds in groundwater rahman et al 2020 thus determining the natural background levels nbls of these inorganic parameters which is defined as a relative measure to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic concentrations matschullat et al 2000 is important nbl of a certain parameter is usually evaluated as an absolute value which is however not realistic in many cases rahman et al 2021 nakic et al 2007 generally nbls are affected by natural geogenic hydrological biological and atmospheric processes gao et al 2020 and both natural factors e g lithology and runoff and anthropogenic factors e g sewage and irrigation control the groundwater components so it is more reliable to regard groundwater nbls as a range rather than a unique value nakic et al 2007 data outside this range we regard it as the anomalous parts of the dataset which is the result of anthropogenic activities preziosi et al 2014 because of the complexity of groundwater monitoring dataset statistical methods are generally employed in the studies to remove these anomalous parts of the dataset de caro et al 2017 ducci et al 2016 gao et al 2020 guadagnini et al 2020 nonparametric methods are usually independent of the distribution of data such as pre selection rotiroti and fumagalli 2013 relative cumulative frequency analysis gao et al 2020 matschullat et al 2000 and the median plus minus twofold the median of the absolute deviations from the median of all the data median 2mad parrone et al 2019 preziosi et al 2014 on the contrary parameter methods such as grubbs test analytical methods committee 2015 grubbs 1950 li et al 2018 and dixon s test aslam 2020 dean and dixon 1951 efstathiou 2006 often show depends on the distribution of data previous study has shown that for numerous n 25 distributions close to normal grubbs test is more appropriate and more powerful than others parrone et al 2019 preziosi et al 2014 and for data do not follow a gaussian distribution the median 2mad method can provide more conservative and feasible results parrone et al 2019 reimann et al 2005 santos 2020 shrestha et al 2017 in addition the pre selection method that is based on selecting the uninfluenced groundwater samples corresponding to the natural population is usually used at first ducci et al 2016 rotiroti and fumagalli 2013 in this method water samples with high nitrate content no3 10 mg l or no3 50 mg l ducci et al 2016 ghergo et al 2017 preziosi et al 2014 or other human synthetic compounds hinsby et al 2008 are removed first at present most studies only assess the nbl of a single parameter in groundwater ducci et al 2016 gao et al 2020 guadagnini et al 2020 libera et al 2017 molinari et al 2018 the complex water rock interactions cation exchange carbonate weather etc in groundwater however are ignored and may cause error in the assessment for example na ca2 cation exchange in groundwater will shift the cl na k cl and the carbonate weather in groundwater will cause ca2 mg2 hco3 meq l close to 1 argamasilla et al 2017 huang et al 2016a wang et al 2013 yang et al 2016 on the other hand groundwater components and interactions will change under the effect of anthropogenic activities thus the source of groundwater pollution could be tracked abu alnaeem et al 2018 in addition single parameter nbls assessment can only find out the pollution of specific components not the whole pollution degree of groundwater he et al 2020 mondal 2021 thus comprehensive nbl that considers the water rock interactions of groundwater is needed wang et al 2019 used mahalanobis distance of two dimensional coordinate points on the groundwater chemistry scatter plots to assess comprehensive nbls of groundwater in shandong province china but the single parameter nbls is not considered which may lead to the missing of specific pollution sources in this study we combined both single parameter and comprehensive nbls to evaluate the groundwater chemical characteristic and we improved the assessment methods based on the statistical distribution of the data among groundwater pollutants nitrate is an important and ubiquitous pollutant there are many studies specifically on groundwater nitrate pollution kazakis et al 2020 torres martínez et al 2020 meghdadi and javar 2018 bu et al 2017 ji et al 2017 clague et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 mondal et al 2010 dual isotope no3 analysis δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 have been widely used to identify the sources of nitrate xue et al 2009 as we all know nitrate from different sources has different δ15n δ18o compositions for example in precipitation δ15n and δ18o range from 13 to 13 and 25 to 75 respectively in synthetic fertilizers δ15n and δ18o range from 6 to 6 and 17 to 25 respectively the value of δ18o in nitrate generated by nitrification is often lower than the above two sources which range from 10 to 15 in ammonium fertilizer and urea δ15n range from 6 to 6 in soil n δ15n range from 0 to 8 sewage and manure have been characterized by similar δ15n value specifically 4 to 25 xue et al 2009 kandal 1998 therefore the distinct dual isotopic composition of nitrate provides a powerful signature to trace the main sources of nitrate and biogeochemical transformation mechanisms meghdadi and javar 2018 in this study we combined stable isotope analysis δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 with nbls assessment to figure out possible groundwater pollution sources in the study area take pinggu basin from china as an example here we showed that the method proposed in this study was efficient in identify the influence of anthropogenic activities on groundwater and the possible sources of contamination 2 study area pinggu district is located in northeast of beijing china bordering tianjin and hebei fig 1 a the study area is the basin of pinggu 116 58 37 117 18 42 n 40 2 19 40 11 48 e fig 1b with an area of about 402 km2 accounting for 42 3 of the total area the basin is an individual intermontane basin hydrogeological unit with limestone aquifer as the major aquifer in the mountain area and quaternary sediment unconsolidated aquifer in the plain area the study area has a temperate continental monsoon climate with large temperature changes in winter and summer the multi year average temperature is 26 1 with multi year average rainfall of 521 1 mm pinggu district is composed of 16 towns of which pinggu town has a population of 80 000 being the most populous town and the most prosperous place in the study area according to the land use of the study area fig 2 the study area was covered by a large area of cropland pinggu town was the center of the study area and mafang town was in the southwest of the study area they are the most prosperous places of the pinggu basin and covered by large areas of artificial surface the northwestern part of the study area mainly develops industry and agriculture and the industrial park focuses on the development of electromechanical electronics clothing woolen and food brewing a landfill which consist of two sites is located in the southwest of the study area the south site was built earlier than 2000 covering an area of about 11 000 m2 and the waste was directly buried in low lying river channels without any treatment until abandonment the north site was built in 2003 covering an area of 30 000 m2 and is still in use li et al 2020 in addition there are two emergency groundwater sources in the study area which are important drinking water resources for beijing residents there are 32 rivers in pinggu district of which three are main rivers namely jv river cuo river and jinji river jv river is the longest river in the area with a length of 54 15 km and a catchment area of 1692 km2 the other rivers are tributaries of jv river the stratigraphic lithology in the study area is simple mainly consisting of dolomite and sandstone hydrogeological profile of a a and b b in fig 1 was shown in supplementary material fig s1 the bedrock of limestone is buried deep and the upper layer is covered with quaternary sediments the quaternary strata are dominated by the flooding of the jv river and cuo river and the thickness of the sediments changes from thin to thick from the piedmont area to the center of the basin with a maximum thickness of 550 m wang et al 2008 the overall flow direction of the groundwater in the study area is mainly from northeast to southwest fig 2 hydraulic conductivity was shown in supplementary material fig s2 groundwater mainly receives recharge from precipitation surface water infiltration and lateral recharge in the piedmont zone the precipitation is distributed from july to september and the groundwater level show lags correspond to the precipitation fig 1c groundwater level data from sample no 24 in the recharge area east of the area reservoir leakage and canal system return infiltration are also important sources of recharge yang et al 2011 the groundwater discharge in pinggu district mainly includes local emergency water source exploitation industrial agricultural and residential domestic water exploitation and lateral runoff of groundwater 3 data and methodology 3 1 data a total of 51 groundwater samples fig 1 were obtained from hydrogeochemical surveys in november 2018 from unconfined aquifer ph and tds were performed by portable multi parameter water quality meter groundwater samples were filtered with 0 45 μm filter membranes and collected in polyethylene bottles 2l after pumping for 20 min nitrate was added to the sample used to test cations for ph 2 all samples were stored in ice boxes at 4 c until laboratory analysis inductively coupled plasma spectrometer was used to analyze ion concentrations k na ca2 and mg2 ion chromatography was used to determine the concentrations of hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and nh4 laboratory quality assurance qa and quality control qc methods were used to ensure the quality of the analytical data including standard calibration the use of standard operating procedures and reagent blank analysis all analyses were performed in triplicate reagent blanks were monitored throughout analysis and used to correct analysis results charge balance error of all results 5 indicating results from all analyses were accurate and reliable for the stable isotope analysis of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 the bore water samples were filtered with 0 45 μm filter membranes and stored in sterile and dark brown polyethylene bottles 0 5l and kept at 4 c until laboratory analysis the stable isotopes were determined by denitrifying bacteria method with isotope radio mass spectrometry irms isoprime100 uk isoprime company which adapted from xu et al 2012 the stable isotope ratios are expressed in delta δ units and a per mil notation relative to an international standard 1 δ s a m p l e r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where r

δ18o values are relative to vienna standard mean ocean water 3 2 hierarchical cluster analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca is an unsupervised multivariate statistical analysis technique which can divide variables r mode or cases q mode into different clusters according to the similarity among variables cases zeng and rasmussen 2005 mathes and rasmussen 2006 many concealed hydrogeochemical processes in groundwater can be identified through hca kazakis et al 2017 güler et al 2012 the clustering process begins with groundwater samples as the individual cluster the number of clusters are reduced by linking according to their similarity until only one left templ et al 2008 the results of hca can be observed as tree graph davis and sampson 1986 whose roots are all groundwater samples hca in this study was conducted in spss 25 0 the measured variables in this study were in different scales and units so the data was treated after data scaling by z transformation 3 3 methodology of nbls assessment in single parameter nbls assessment as the groundwater in the study area provides people with drinking water the stricter standards no3 10 mg l were chosen for pre selection muller et al 2006 parrone et al 2019 sellerino et al 2019 which was proposed by a guideline published in 2017 ghergo et al 2017 then the shapiro wilk test α 0 05 shapiro and wilk 1965 was used to determine if the remaining dataset follows gaussian distribution for parameters following gaussian distribution iterative grubbs test α 0 01 was used and for parameters not following gaussian distribution median 2mad method was used fig 3 then according to the distribution types of the remaining data determined by shapiro wilk test α 0 05 mean x were calculated using different statistical methods arithmetic mean method is applicable to normal cumulative distribution geometric mean method is applicable to the log normal distribution cumulative frequency analysis is applicable to the skewed distribution gao et al 2020 and the x s was the nbls range in comprehensive nbls assessment mahalanobis distances of the two dimensional coordinate points of groundwater chemistry scatter plots were calculated mahalanobis distance is an effective method for calculating the similarity of unknown datasets it is usually used to calculate the distance of points in a two dimensional space unlike the euclidean distance it considers the characteristics between variables so the results can better reflect the interrelated characteristics of the data hamill et al 2016 itagakia et al 2007 zhao et al 2015 the shapiro wilk test α 0 05 was used to determine whether the mahalanobis distances follow gaussian distribution or not for mahalanobis distances following gaussian distribution iterative grubbs test α 0 01 was used otherwise median 2mad method was used same as the single parameter nbls assessment fig 3 sampling points that never be removed in any groundwater chemistry scatter plots were regarded as background points in addition we graded the data to evaluate the comprehensive abnormal level cal the classification process conducted as follow the radio of the mahalanobis distance of the point and the threshold value of the method was regarded as the abnormal level of the point in each scatter plot and the average abnormal level of different plots was taken as the comprehensive abnormal level of the point eq 2 and the data were divided into three levels background points were regarded as class a and median 2mad of the comprehensive abnormal level of the points was taken as the second level limit value to obtain class b and class c reimann et al 2005 2 c a l j 1 n i 1 n m i j t i c a l j is the comprehensive abnormal level of the j t h point n is the number of scatter plots that identify the j t h point m i j is the mahalanobis distance of the j t h point in the i t h scatter plots t i is the threshold value in the i t h scatter plots 4 results 4 1 water sample groupings and hydrogeochemical characterization hca was performed on 51 sampling points using groundwater chemistry parameters as variables q mode the clustering results were shown in fig 4 the sampling points were divided into four clusters c1 c2 c3 and c4 the average values of parameters for each cluster were shown in table 1 and the characteristic of 15n no3 and 18o no3 were shown in table 2 there were ten sampling points in c1 with highest average concentrations of na and hco3 among the four clusters c2 only had seven sampling points but show highest average concentrations of ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and tds in the four clusters and with lowest ph among the four clusters c3 consist of 17 sampling points the average concentrations of all other parameters were the lowest value except for k na hco3 no3 and ph c4 had 17 sampling points with highest average concentration of no3 among the four clusters in addition the average concentrations of no3 in the c1 and c4 exceeded the standard value 20 mg l according to groundwater quality standards gb t 14848 2017 proposed by china national standardization management committee cnsmc 2017 as for stable isotopes the range of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 was 6 51 to 15 64 and 4 75 to 19 17 respectively refer to previous research δ18o no3 in the study area was lower than those of atmospheric 25 75 and the nitrate fertilizer 20 25 all of the δ18o no3 in the study area was within the range of nitrification 10 to 15 except for one point located between nitrification and nitrate fertilizer xue et al 2009 δ15n no3 in the study area was distributed in the three range shown in the previously studies nh4 and urea 6 to 6 soil n 0 8 and manure sewage 4 25 xue et al 2009 yue et al 2014 among them the average values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 of c2 were the largest and the δ15n no3 of c2 was only distributed in the range of manure sewage while the other clusters were distributed in at least two ranges from the spatial distribution map of sampling points fig 1 c1 was distributed in the northwest of the study area c2 was distributed in the southwest of the study area c3 was located in the east of the study area and c4 was located near pinggu town and mafang town 4 2 single parameter nbls assessment pre selection method removed 27 sampling points with no3 10 mg l and the removed samples were all collected from the groundwater in the area with strong influence of human activities industrial parks and farmland shapiro wilk test α 0 05 showed that only k and hco3 followed gaussian distribution so grubbs test was used to identify the outliers of k and hco3 and the outliers of na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 tds and the remaining no3 were identified by median 2mad method the results showed that there were no outliers in the data of k and hco3 and the outliers of the other parameters were shown in probability plots fig 5 and the nbls was shown in table 3 probability plots allow the display of the data and graphically observe the main trends they are clustered on the principle that different sources generate different populations of data that can be separated by statistical techniques preziosi et al 2014 point clusters of probability plots may indicate that the samples belong to a single population that originates from a unique process changes in the slope of the curve may correspond to transitions between different populations so they can be used in separating natural and anthropogenic components but local geochemical anomalies or natural changes in the geochemical phase may also be masked sellerino et al 2019 for groundwater monitoring data lognormal probability plots are commonly used sinclair 1974 the results in fig 5 showed that na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 no3 and tds had 13 10 9 12 10 4 and 9 abnormal points respectively the obvious slope changes or discontinuities between the abnormal points and the others in the probability plots proved the feasibility of the median 2mad method in nbls assessment to some extent however there were also slight slope changes in normal points indicating the heterogeneity of hydrogeochemistry under natural conditions sellerino et al 2019 4 3 comprehensive nbls assessment five classic groundwater chemistry scatter plots were used to assess comprehensive nbls fig 6 a chadha s plot which shows groundwater type chadha 1999 b scatter plot of cai versus cl meq l which shows ion exchange in which cai cl na k cl abu alnaeem et al 2018 c scatter plot of no3 cl versus cl meq l which shows anthropogenic inputs of the groundwater chemistry components murgulet and tick 2013 wang et al 2016 saxena et al 2003 d scatter plot of hco3 cl ratio versus cl meq l which shows the degree of salinity chaudhuri and srinivasulu 2014 october et al 2013 e scatter plot of ca2 mg2 versus hco3 meq l which shows carbonate weathering previous study have shown that carbonate weathering in the study area dominates li et al 2020 compared with the scatter plots selected by wang et al 2019 the piper diagram was replaced by chadha s plot fig 6a chadha 1999 which can avoid errors caused by coordinate conversion and the scatter plots of anthropogenic inputs fig 6c and salinity fig 6d of groundwater were added because the salinity can usually be greatly affected by anthropogenic activities abu alnaeem et al 2018 shapiro wilk test α 0 05 showed the mahalanobis distances of these five scatter plots all did not follow gaussian distribution thus median 2mad method was employed ten abnormal points were detected in fig 6a and all sampling points were hco3 ca type except one was cl ca type seven abnormal points were detected in fig 6b previous study reported that when cai is close to 0 it indicates that there is no ion exchange process in the groundwater when there is a softening process i e ca2 and mg2 of water are immobilized and na and k from the aquifer material are released cai 0 argamasilla et al 2017 elgettafi et al 2012 which is called base ion exchange process conversely when a hardening process occurs i e na and k of water are immobilized and ca2 and mg2 from the aquifer material are released cai 0 abu alnaeem et al 2018 taylor 2016 which is called reverse ion exchange process and if the cai is near to 1 the reverse ion exchange process is strong a lot of points in fig 6b had cai values between 5 to 0 indicating that the existence of base ion exchange process however four abnormal points had the cai values between 0 76 0 91 with higher concentration in cl which indicated the strong reverse ion exchange process fig 6c was usually used to show the concentrates of cl and no3 which usually be regarded as groundwater contamination indicators wang et al 2016 busico et al 2020 and nine abnormal points were detected in this diagram in fig 6d the ratios of hco3 cl were all above 2 which indicated the fresh water chaudhuri and srinivasulu 2014 october et al 2013 seven abnormal points with higher concentration in cl were detected in this diagram in fig 6e the samples were basically distributed along the 1 1 line but ten abnormal points could also be identified the comprehensive abnormal level was shown in fig 7 22 sampling points were grouped into class a which could be considered as nbls 20 sampling points were grouped into class b which could be considered as slight contaminated areas nine sampling points were grouped into class c which could be considered as heavily contaminated areas 5 discussion 5 1 anthropogenic sources of groundwater contamination as a common statistical method hca is often used with other methods to get better results zeng and rasmussen 2005 and mathes et al 2006 analyzed the water quality by combining hca with factor analysis fa and gis respectively and achieved good results this study combined hca with nbls assessment to identify groundwater pollution sources in order to identify groundwater pollution the distribution of the points outside the nbls range needs attention the land use type of the study area can help to identify the possible sources of groundwater pollution fig 2 the spatial distributions of these points were shown in fig 8 c1 was distributed in the northwest of the study area the concentrations of na were the highest in the cluster table 1 and the average concentration of no3 was 30 0 mg l exceeding the standard value 20 mg l cnmsc 2017 according to the field investigation and the land use map fig 2 industrial parks and agricultural land were located in this area so industry and agriculture were the main sources of groundwater contamination in this area na is commonly used in food processing and medicine production processes chalitangkoon et al 2020 ndanuko et al 2020 and the sewage generated during the clothing and food brewing processes might increase the concentrations of cl so4 2 and no3 in the groundwater mcarthur et al 2012 the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 could be increased by the wastewater discharged from electronic equipment factories nalivan et al 2019 pinggu district is an important agricultural product base of beijing no3 in synthetic fertilizer can enter groundwater through precipitation large areas of farmland and orchards covered in the northwest pesticides such as bordeaux mixture that widely used in orchards will lead to enrich of cuso4 in groundwater groundwater in this area flow from the front of the mountain to the south and hydraulic gradient become small in south which lead to the slow flow of groundwater which may facilitate the contaminants accumulation at the downstream of the factory huang et al 2019b which also caused that the south of this area was regarded as class c only seven sampling points were clustered in c2 and this cluster was also considered as class c except one point the average concentrations of ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and tds were the highest of the clusters these results indicated that c2 might have been seriously affected by anthropogenic activities according to the survey and the land use map fig 2 all seven samples were taken from the aquifer near a landfill landfill leachate changed the groundwater environment greatly resulting in an increase in the concentration of ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and tds in the groundwater however there were two points with low concentrations of no3 fig 8g this might caused by denitrification of nitrate because that in many complex landfill leachate environments there is usually organic carbon to drive denitrification christensen et al 2000 rivett et al 2008 and this can be proved by stable isotopic 15n no3 and 18o no3 analysis c3 was located in the east of the study area which can regard as the nbls of the study area and it was considered as class a this area is the recharge area of the basin with scarce population and less affected by the anthropogenic activities according to field surveys although the area is covered by cropland there are few agricultural activities and most cropland has ceased production c4 had 17 sampling points of which were distributed in two areas one is pinggu town located in the center of the study area which is densely populated and the most prosperous place in the study area the other is mafang town which is the only exit of the basin so the traffic here is busy and the population is growing rapidly in recent years therefore the discharge of domestic sewage was the main source of groundwater contaminant that generated class b and class c of this cluster table 1 showed that the average concentration of no3 63 1 mg l here was the highest among the four clusters which is three times of the standard value 20 mg l cnmsc 2017 the concentration of cl in this cluster was 27 2 mg l which was the second highest value after c2 high cl or no3 concentration is usually caused by domestic sewage wang et al 2016 furthermore four abnormal points in fig 5b which had high cl concentrations and strong reverse ion exchange located in this cluster and c2 normally the cai value in low salinity areas is negative indicating that the groundwater in these areas is subject to freshening processes accompanied by the release of na from the aquifer material and the fixation of ca2 in groundwater base ion exchange process on the contrary in the area of sewage invasion the value of cai would be close to 1 and the reverse ion exchange process will occur taylor 2016 therefore the strong reverse ion exchange was caused by the intrusion of sewage in addition the high no3 concentration points were distributed at the west and south edge of pinggu town instead of inside pinggu town this was due to the dense villages around pinggu town the limited sewage treatment facilities of these villages may be the main reason that caused the high no3 in this area 5 2 sources and transformation of nitrate as the pollution of nitrate in groundwater was complex and there were many points exceeding the nbl in fig 8g δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were used to analyze the sources and transformation of nitrate the different 15n 18o isotopic composition of nitrate is affected by the source of nitrate and biological processes in general δ18o no3 formed by nitrification is much lower than that of precipitation and nitrate fertilizers δ18o no3 range from 25 to 75 and 17 to 25 respectively in precipitation and synthetic fertilizers theoretically two oxygen atoms in the nitrate formed by nitrification come from water and one oxygen atom comes from oxygen eq 3 böttcher et al 1990 in fig 9 most of the sampling points were located near the theoretical value however some sampling points were higher than the theoretical value and some sampling points were lower most points of c1 were lower than the theoretical value and most of the points of c2 were higher than the theoretical value the following results could be interpreted as a consequence of the higher points i the ratio of oxygen incorporation from h2o and o2 was not 2 1 e g more o2 may be derived from atmospheric o2 when nh4 is limiting ii soil moisture evaporation and bacterial respiration leaded to an increase in 18o in water kendall et al 2007 iii isotope fractionation caused by respiration made the 18o in the soil higher than the 18o in the atmosphere xue et al 2009 iv denitrification leaded to accumulation of heavier isotopes otero et al 2009 as for the points lower than the theoretical value might be due to that nh4 was high and the nitrification rate was high which leaded to more use of o in water yue et al 2014 or the oxygen exchange between nitrate and water changed the soil oxygen isotope composition kool et al 2011 leading to low δ18o no3 values wexler et al 2012 3 δ 18 o no 3 2 3 δ 18 o h 2 o 1 3 δ 18 o o 2 dual isotopic approach was used to identify the sources of the nitrite fig 10 the points in c1 were widely distributed and were affected by urea and nitrogen fertilizer and sewage the nitrate in c2 and c4 came from waste water of landfill and domestic sewage respectively the nitrate in c3 was mainly from soil n generally the increase in the isotopic composition of nitrate with a ratio of 1 1 dale et al 2014 and 2 1 granger et al 2008 indicated the probability of denitrification the isotopic composition of c1 and c2 in fig 10 tracks well within the denitrification vectors except two points in c1 however the do of c1 and c2 were 1 8 6 4 mg l and 1 6 5 4 mg l respectively according to cey et al 1999 one requirement for denitrification is anaerobic conditions or restricted oxygen availability dissolved oxygen concentration less than around 2 mg l but many studies have found that denitrification occurs in water samples with do 2 mg l moncaster et al 2000 otero et al 2009 there might be two reasons i several species of bacteria from soils were capable of respiring oxygen and nitrate simultaneously under aerobic conditions at up to 80 air saturation and aerobic denitrifying fungi also occur carter et al 1995 cannavo et al 2004 ii micro organisms in sediments do not necessarily experience the same concentrations as those measured by a dissolved oxygen probe in a mixed sample thus denitrification occurs in micro anaerobic environments where dissolved oxygen has been completely removed koba et al 1997 rivett et al 2008 otero et al 2009 there are few instances of the former while the latter is widespread besides the average concentrations of hco3 of c1 and c2 were high in table 1 which may also be the result of denitrification as well known there are two types of denitrification heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic denitrification eq 4 eq 5 eq 7 heterotrophic denitrification produced hco3 in autotrophic denitrification if it is driven by pyrite oxidation the acidity generated in the reaction tends to dissolve carbonate thereby increasing the concentration of hco3 moncaster et al 2000 aravena and robertson 1998 heterotrophic denitrification 4 4 n o 3 5 c 2 h 2 o 2 n 2 4 h c o 3 c o 2 autotrophic denitrification 5 4 f e s 2 14 o 2 4 h 2 o 4

the pinggu basin beijing with multivariate statistical analysis nbls assessment and stable isotope analysis the groundwater in the east of the study area was less affected by human activities while the west and the center groundwater of the study area were affected by industrial activities agricultural activities urban domestic sewage and landfill the nitrate of the study area was mainly formed by nitrification of fertilizer manure and sewage and denitrification happened in the groundwater around the industrial park and the landfill which caused high concentration of hco3 the combination of single parameter and comprehensive nbls assessment with the help of nitrogen and oxygen isotopes is efficient in identifying the possible anthropogenic impact on groundwater quality the pollution

4687,temperate continental monsoon transitional zones are sensitive to variations in the global hydrological climate and the long term patterns of hydrological variability in this zone should be explored urgently in this study based on the tree ring width of platycladus orientalis we reconstructed the annual runoff sequence during 1666 2016 351 years on wula mountain which lies within the low latitude temperate continental monsoon transitional zone our reconstruction model is stable and reliable because our reconstruction results overlap well with the arid and flood years and periods found in local historical records our analysis results show that over the last four centuries the annual runoff in the low latitude transitional zone is characterized by an overall decrease with heightened fluctuations specifically in the 18th century wet and extremely wet years appeared frequently while continuous wet periods grew progressively shorter later this area experienced a mean flow period of approximately 100 years ending in the 1930 s when progressively longer dry periods began to occur in the last 30 years this area has suffered from its longest dry period in 351 years regarding runoff variability over two centuries in the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone high latitude areas had more wet periods with significant variation in large scale periodicities the majority of the zone had simultaneous variation in wetting and drying and a significant drying trend in the first half of the 20th century high and low latitude areas had long and slowly changing arid periods while mid latitude areas had short and quickly changing arid periods this study enriches the understanding of the dendrohydrology of the low and middle latitudes of the temperate continental monsoon transition zone analyzes the runoff variations throughout the transition zone area and helps reconstruct the long term historical runoff sequence over four centuries in the transitional zone keywords runoff reconstruction runoff variability dendrohydrology temperate continental monsoon transitional zone 1 introduction water resource is an irreplaceable precious natural resource that is critical for humans and all other biological species wada and bierkens 2014 konapala et al 2020 since the 1980s shortages of water resources have become more and more severe around the globe wada and bierkens 2014 and uncertainties about climate change have further intensified the water shortage problem konapala et al 2020 the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone in east eurasia is sensitive to variations in global hydrological climate however the pattern and trend of long term historical hydrological variability in the entire transitional zone has remained unclear since hardman s first reconstruction of hydrological factors of the truckee river in nevada usa in 1936 hardman 1936 tree ring width has become a main tool for reconstructing long term historical hydrological variability

distributed of which are the temperate continental climate and the temperature monsoon climate the junction of these two main climate regions forms a unique and sensitive transitional zone known as the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone this transitional zone starts from eastern west siberia extends southwest and finally ends at the hinterland in northwest china in the qilian mountains it obliquely crosses through east eurasia at latitudes 33 63 n and longitudes 102 164 e and the coupling effect of numerous geographic and hydrological climate factors leads to the sensitive and vulnerable characteristics of the hydrological environment in the transitional zone current dendrohydrological research in the transitional zone mainly utilizes p sylvestris bao et al 2012 pinus tabulaeformis liu et al 2005 2017 2019 and has focused on investigating runoff macdonald et al 2007 bao et al 2012 and the palmer drought severity index pdsi bao et al 2012 based on which 130 220 year hydrological histories have been reconstructed in the kolyma river klr and lena river lnr basin macdonald et al 2007 northeast china bao et al 2012 and helan mountain hlm liu et al 2005 2019 little research has utilized thuja sutchuenensis platycladus orientalis or chamaecyparisobtusa sieb et zucc in the transitional zone and some of the previous studies focusing on short sequences only investigated runoff variability in specific areas without considering the whole picture across the entire transitional zone thus it is urgent to reconstruct longer historical runoff variability in the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone and to analyze the associated variability trends and patterns a better understanding of historical runoff variability in the entire transitional zone will be valuable to general long term hydrological research on this special transitional zone on this basis we chose a typical area in the temperature continental monsoon transitional zone at low latitudes wula mountain in china as our sampling area no long term historical runoff sequence has been constructed there so research on this topic is needed many p orientalis aged hundreds of years are densely distributed in this area and are an ideal proxy for reconstructing runoff over long historical periods in this study based on the annual tree ring width table for p orientalis we reconstruct the runoff historical sequence over the last four centuries in the typical temperate continental monsoon transitional zone at low latitudes with the goal of fully revealing the trend and pattern of its variability then to analyze hydrological variability in the entire transitional zone we compare our results against hydrological events found in the local records and against the literature results for other areas in the transitional zone 2 data and methods 2 1 research area background the sampling area lies in a typical low latitude region in the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone fig 1 and belongs to the yinshan mountains the unstable hydrological climate environment in the transitional zone results in a large hydrological variation rate an unbalanced water heat relationship and a quite vulnerable ecosystem the sampling mountainous area has shallow slopes and within the area vegetation is quite sparsely distributed with medium canopy closures and weak competition between trees during 1951 2016 the multiyear temperature mean was 7 13 based on data from baotou meteorological station and the multiyear precipitation mean was 306 49 mm with 52 17 of the annual precipitation concentrated from july to august fig 2 a in this area the runoff depth mean is 17 7 mm and the multiyear runoff mean during 1955 2016 was 0 17 108 m3 with 68 4 of the annual runoff concentrated from july to august fig 2b 2 2 proxy material and tree ring data for reconstruction p orientalis originated in china and belongs to cupressaceae evergreen trees with well developed roots it mainly grows on precipitous rock faces and sheer cliffs is sensitive to hydrothermal conditions and has the characteristics of cold and drought resistant and long lived trees its tree rings have clear boundaries and thus can be used to precisely determine its growth condition in specific years making it an ideal proxy material for reconstructing hydrological climate factors jiang et al 2015 we collected p orientalis samples at different locations with an average altitude of 1500 m 109 26 9 e 109 26 12 e 40 39 41 n 40 39 42 n in a typical low latitude area in the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone wula mountain china fig 1 in august 2017 sampling was performed in strict accordance with the sampling standard of the international tree ring data base itrdb the sampling environment in which the growth of trees is not directly affected by human activities is selected and healthy trees with long tree age and clear tree ring without obvious fire and pest disturbance are selected for sampling we collected 103 samples from 54 trees in three adjacent gullies two samples from each of 49 trees and one sample from each of the other five tree the collected sample cores were dried naturally in a cool ventilated location and then fixed in custom holder after which the cores were polished with dry sand paper with different mesh sizes until the surface of the core was smooth and the tree rings were clearly visible the bmp format image generated by scanner resolution 10200 14039 after scanning is used windendro basic 2012b to measure the width of each tree ring with an accuracy of 0 001 mm we used the quality control program cofecha holmes 1983 to cross check the data and inspect the missing rings false rings and dating errors this paper mainly uses the negative exponential function method in the arstan program to remove the growth trend of the tree ring width sequence and standardize it cook 1985 the detrending process removed the growth of the tree itself and nonclimate change factors while retaining the low frequency signals as much as possible and a negative exponential function was used to fit the growth trend however when there were abnormal growth trends and the negative exponential function was not applicable a spline function with a step length of 50 100 years was used to fit the growth trend a standard std chronology was then synthesized from the detrended de series using the double weighted average method fig 5a cook and briffa 1990 the statistics such as the mean correlation between the trees rbt mean sensitivity ms and expressed population signal eps of the p orientalis std chronology in the study area were calculated to evaluate the quality of the chronology fritts 1976 and the results are summarized in table 1 among them ms is a quantitative index to measure the sensitivity of the width sequence of tree rings to climate information the higher the value is the more climate information is contained in the chronology eps refers to the degree to which the chronology established can reflect the theoretical chronology generally the chronology established when eps 0 85 is relatively reliable it can be seen that the average sensitivity of the std chronology is high and the signal to noise ratio and the first principal component variance interpretation are at high levels indicating that the tree ring indices of the p orientalis in the study area contain strong climate signals which is suitable for the dendroclimatological study 2 3 hydrological climate data we adopted 1955 2016 annual and monthly runoff data obtained by altshan hydrometric station the closest station to the sampling area and the data are from a hydrological yearbook published by the local hydrological survey bureau we used annual and monthly data of average temperature average minimum temperature average maximum temperature precipitation and relative humidity from 1951 to 2016 obtained by baotou meteorological station and annual and monthly precipitation data from 1951 to 2016 obtained by urad qianqi and guyang meteorological stations the data were downloaded from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn 2 4 data analysis 1 since there is no hydrological station in the basin where the sampling point is located only the hydrological station closest to the basin where the sampling point is located and similar climate type and underlying surface of the basin can be used as the reference station we calculated the annual runoff in the basin area where the sampling points were located by adopting the hydrological analogy method the calculation equation is as follows q sp f sp f ats x sp x g q ats in which q sp is the annual runoff in the basin area where the sampling points are located 1 0 108m3 f sp is the area of the basin area where the sampling points are located 960 36 km2 fig 1 f ats is the basin area monitored by the altshan hydrometric station 880 km2 x sp is the precipitation in the basin area where the sampling points are located mm x g is the precipitation in the basin area where the altshan hydrometric station is located mm and q ats is the annual runoff at the altshan hydrometric station 1 0 108m3 2 to obtain the areal precipitation we adopted the inverse square distance method in which we divided the sampling area into a uniform longitudinal and latitudinal network consisting of 0 01 0 01 grids we calculated the weight of each grid point according to its distances to all the meteorological stations based on which we derived the precipitation data at each grid point then we obtained the algorithmic average of the data at all the grid points which represents the areal precipitation of the research area jones and hulme 1996 3 the response relationship between tree growth and hydrological and climatic factors is the basis for the reconstruction of historical hydrological and climatic factors the strength of their correlation reflects whether the response relationship is close or not and a good correlation is the guarantee for reliable reconstruction therefore pearson correlation method is adopted to analyze the correlation between the tree ring index and hydrological and climatic data 4 the reconstruction of historical runoff is one of the core work of this paper it is based on the significant correlation between annual ring index and hydrological and climatic data and constructs a linear regression equation through regression analysis the expression is as follows y a x b in which y is the reconstructed hydrological elements x is the ring index a is the tendency rate b is the equation intercept the least square method is used to estimate the parameters of the linear regression equation when the sum of squares between the values obtained by the equation and the measured values reaches the minimum two unknowns a and b are determined to complete the construction of the reconstruction equation 5 the reliability of the reconstruction equation determines the availability of the historical runoff reconstruction sequence statistical parameters such as correlation coefficient r adjusted determination coefficient r 2 adj mean square error mse f p the durbin watson statistic d w durbin and watson 1950 were used to evaluate the reliability of the reconstruction equation 6 on the basis of the accuracy and reliability of the reconstruction equation the reliability of the reconstruction results should be further verified only the reliability of the reconstruction results can truly reflect the characteristics of historical runoff changes the splite sample method fritts 1991 a periodical verification test commonly used in dendrochronology is adopted to test the reliability of the reconstruction results the involved statistical parameters include pearson s correlation coefficient r r squared r2 the sign test st reduction of error re coefficient of efficiency ce and product means test t cook et al 1999 fritts 1991 re and ce are statistical quantities to precisely test the reliability of reconstructed values when both are positive it means that the reconstructed model has a certain predictive ability the closer the values are to 1 the stronger the predictive ability fritts 1976 cook et al 1999 st tests the similarity between reconstructed values and the corresponding true values in low frequencies based on the number of their similar or different anomaly signs the parameter t considers the anomaly signs between reconstructed values and the corresponding true values and their numerical values as well which can directly imply whether the reconstructed values contain hydrological climate information 7 due to the difference of hydrological climate type area and underlying surface of drainage basin in different regions the precipitation and runoff are greatly different therefore in the comparative analysis it is more intuitive and convenient to compare the historical reconstruction sequence of runoff in each region after standardization the z score method is used to standardize the historical reconstruction sequence of runoff and the calculation equation is shown below z s c o r e r m n s d in which r is the reconstructed runoff value 1 0 108 m3 m n is the mean of the reconstructed sequence 1 0 108 m3 and s d is the standard deviation 1 0 108 m3 8 listed below are the definitions of wet period dry period relatively wet period relatively dry period mean flow period extremely wet year and extremely dry year when runoff exceeds mean σ or falls below mean σ the period is wet or dry respectively when runoff is between the mean and mean σ or between the mean and mean σ the period is relatively wet or relatively dry respectively and the two periods together are called the mean flow period when runoff lies above mean 2σ or below mean 2σ the year is extremely wet or extremely dry respectively 9 the variation trend is one of the important characteristics of runoff historical reconstruction sequence we adopted the residual mass curve method to analyze the variation trend of the reconstructed historical runoff sequence and the calculation equation is shown below a d d a i i 1 n x i x in which a d d a i represents the residual mass curve value of the ith year x i is the annual runoff of the i th year 1 0 108 m3 and x is the mean of the reconstructed sequence 1 0 108 m3 10 the variation intensity of the reconstructed historical runoff sequence is represented by the coefficient of variation cv this is calculated as shown below c v s d m n in which s d is the standard deviation of the reconstructed historical runoff sequence 1 0 108m3 and m n is the mean 1 0 108 m3 11 to analyze the periodicity of the reconstructed historical runoff sequence we adopted the multi taper method mtm park et al 1987 mann and lees 1996 12 to analyze the periodic variations in the reconstructed historical runoff sequence we used the morlet wavelet venugopal and foufoula georgiou 1996 defined as ψ t c e t 2 2 cos 5 t the dilatation factor of morlet wavelet a is related to periodicity t in the following relationship t 4 π ω 0 2 ω 0 2 a in which the empirical value of ω 0 is commonly chosen to be near 6 2 13 to test for sudden variations in the reconstructed runoff sequence we adopted the nonparametric mann kendall test fu and wang 1992 steps 1 10 described above were calculated and analyzed within excel and spss software and steps 11 13 were realized using our in house matlab codes 3 results and discussions 3 1 responsive relationships between tree ring growth and hydrological climate factors the correlation coefficients between the tree ring index of p orientalis and hydrological climate factors are shown in fig 3 the tree ring index is closely correlated with the local hydrothermal conditions specifically the tree ring index is positively correlated with the annual and monthly runoffs of the corresponding year and with the precipitation and relative humidity except for february in april august and october it is also negatively correlated with three temperature measures average temperature average maximum temperature and average minimum temperature generally in arid and semiarid areas the water status is the main factor that assists in the radial growth of trees while temperature affects the growth of trees by influencing the water condition in soils and the respiration efficiency and transpiration rate of trees liu et al 2007 cai et al 2010 song and liu 2011 as shown in fig 3 the responsive relationships between the radial growth of p orientalis and variations in hydrological climate factors in the previous year show similar patterns as those in the current year but with slightly lower correlation coefficients its correlation coefficient with the runoff quantity is greatly reduced this illustrates that variations in the hydrological climate factors in the previous year have relatively small effects on the growth of p orientalis thus in the following analysis we focus on the current year case the correlation coefficients of the tree ring index with temperature factors are in the order of annual average minimum temperature annual average temperature annual average maximum temperature the radial growth of p orientalis responds more strongly to the average minimum temperature and average maximum temperature in february and the average temperature in may than to the others the three temperature measures average temperature average maximum temperature and average minimum temperature in different periods generally have consistent effects on p orientalis characterized by stronger effects in winter and spring and weaker effects in summer and autumn regarding hydrology the tree ring index shows the highest correlation with runoff 0 424 p 0 001 followed by relative humidity 0 371 p 0 05 and the correlations are most significant in august its correlation with the monthly precipitation sequence is quite weak and only those correlations in april 0 26 and september 0 244 pass the 95 significant test the tree ring index shows better correlations with runoff in summer 0 408 p 0 001 and autumn 0 394 p 0 001 than in spring 0 348 p 0 05 and winter 0 352 p 0 05 and its correlation with the relative humidity 0 319 p 0 05 0 497 p 0 05 is higher than its correlation with precipitation 0 123 0 142 in spring and summer the opposite holds true in autumn and winter in the research area a typical arid to semiarid cold region the dormant period of tree growth ends in march and april at this time despite the limited amount of precipitation fig 2a as the temperature rises ice and snow start to melt and soils become unfrozen both of which result in a significant increase in runoff in the research area fig 2b and in turn provide an excellent basis for the continuous growth of p orientalis at a later time in the early growth period april and may runoff and precipitation are low in quantity as temperature gradually rises the limited amount of water in the soil significantly evaporates resulting in reduced available water for trees and formation of a narrow tree ring in june august runoff and precipitation in the research area represent 70 and 62 17 of their annual quantities respectively in this time temperature gradually rises to its annual peak as does evaporation the relative humidity also reaches a high level with the intensified transpiration by trees these simultaneously optimized hydrothermal conditions lead to a peak period for p orientalis growth and the formation of a relatively wide tree ring before entering the dormant growth period september november runoff suddenly drops in the research area and precipitation gradually decreases at this time the relatively low temperatures cannot cause intense evaporation of soil water or transpiration from trees leading to weakened effects of water and heat on the growth of p orientalis 3 2 reconstructing annual runoff the analysis above illustrates that the tree ring index of p orientalis is strongly correlated with the annual runoff 0 424 p 0 001 in the research area thus we ran a linear regression to reconstruct the average annual runoff sequence during 1666 2016 in the research area the reconstruction equation is shown below runoff 0 592 i t 3 966 r 0 424 n 62 r 2 adj 0 152 f 20 88 mse 0 002 p 0 001 d w 2 13 in which runoff is the annual runoff in the t th year 1 0 108m3 and i t is the tree ring index in the t th year it can be seen from the reconstruction equation parameters that r reaches the significance level of 99 and the mse is less than 0 01 which indicates that the fitting effect is good the confidence degree of f test is 99 9 d w durbin and watson 1950 was used to detect the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals from a regression analysis our d w value is between 1 55 and 2 38 n 62 indicated that there was no autocorrelation the comparison of the reconstructed and measured values above fig 4 shows that the two sets of values have quite consistent variability over time and are thus well synchronized we divided the reconstructed sequence into two time periods 1955 1983 and 1984 2016 the two time periods correspond to the calibration period and the test period as shown in table 2 in the test period re and ce are both positive the former close to 1 meaning that the regression model is good at making predictions fritts 1976 cook et al 1999 the st and st1 values are both significant and lie above the 95 confidence bands pointing to the consistency in high and low frequency variability between the reconstructed and measured sequences in the calibration period the r and t between the measured and reconstructed sequences at all times both pass the 95 significant test revealing that the reconstructed values contain much information on hydrological factors in conclusion the reconstruction equation meets the reliability requirements and the test results of reconstruction sequence meet the reliability standard which can be used to reconstruct the annual runoff historical series in the study area 3 3 characteristics of reconstructed annual runoff sequence the reconstructed annual runoff curve reflects multiple cycles between wet and dry conditions during 1666 2016 in the research area fig 5e the whole sequence reveals four wet periods 1688 1712 1731 1738 1754 1763 and 1942 1950 and three dry periods 1824 1830 1908 1926 and 1986 2011 representing 13 68 and 13 96 of the total number of reconstructed years 351 respectively there are 12 extremely wet years and six extremely dry years representing 3 41 and 1 71 of the reconstructed sequence respectively overall the reconstructed sequence can be divided into three periods fig 5d e during the first period from the end of the 17th century to the 1770 s the interdecadal average values are quite high and 83 of wet periods and 67 of extremely wet periods in the whole sequence happen within this time period the transitions to wet periods are fast and relatively dry periods hardly appear fig 5c the length of continuous wet periods shrinks from the initial 24 years to 9 years with significant 5 10 year and 12 25 year periodicities fig 5b these periodicities are confirmed by our power spectral calculation results fig 6 which show that the 7 5 year periodicity agrees with the periodicity of el nino enso allan et al 1996 from the end of the 18th century to the 1930 s the reconstructed sequence is dominated by mean flow periods with the disappearance of wet periods and gradually reduced relatively wet periods fig 5c the annual runoff continuously decreases with dry periods first appearing in the 1920 s after which the continuous arid time increases from 6 to 18 years the sequence shows more intense variations cv 28 24 than in the previous period cv 27 99 and shows two sudden changes in 1822 and 1922 after which the sequence rapidly transits to an increasingly wet trend there are no significant periodicities below 30 years over the whole time period and after the sudden change in 1822 a significant 20 55 year periodicity appears fig 5b during late 1930 s the reconstructed sequence experiences a short rapid uprising and reaches its peak value in the mid 20th century corresponding to the last short wet period 8 year in the 351 years after this time runoff starts to rapidly decrease and reaches its lowest level in the early 21th century and during this period variations in runoff are most intense with the cv reaching 45 33 and interdecadal values all characterized by large magnitude variations especially in the last 30 years this area has experienced the longest dry period 25 years which corresponds to 51 of the total dry time in the 351 years and extremely dry periods are quite concentrated which may be the combined result of increasing temperatures in the past 30 years liang et al 2018 sun et al 2019 and human activities in this area our analysis above demonstrates that the annual runoff is overall characterized by a drying trend with gradually stronger fluctuations and by its periodicities in transitioning from middle small scales to predominantly large scales in the research area 3 4 comparison of the reconstruction results with historical hydrological events and literature data we compared our reconstructed historical runoff data with hydrological events written in local historical records shen 2008 wang 1990 our comparison illustrates the following facts during 1747 1750 areas in the surroundings of baotou and huhhot experienced severe drought disasters the reconstructed sequence during this period shows significant drying features compared with the previous period making it a relatively dry period fig 5c in 1777 1779 1793 1805 1877 and 1878 hohhot baotou and tumd youqi lying between hohhot city and baotou city experienced significant drought events and in 1893 and 1901 severe drought hazards occurred in spring summer and autumn in tumd youqi and baodou resulting in the gathering of no kernels or seeds these years had runoff at or below the average level of the reconstructed sequence in 1908 1911 and 1926 1928 bayannur city and huhhot city suffered from continuous severe dry and hot winds in spring and summer and this made it difficult for crops to mature and caused farmlands to be abandoned this period generally overlaps with the second dry period 1908 1926 captured by the reconstructed sequence in 1928 areas near baotou experienced droughts and after that most areas of inner mongolia suffered from droughts which continued for four years 1929 1932 this resulted in halved farmland crops lack of precipitation in spring and summer disappearance of grass and most livestock being starved to death this period of the reconstructed sequence is in the middle of a relatively dry period after its second sudden change 1922 during 1943 1950 bayannur baotou and huhhot experienced continuous flooding the dam of yellow river broke and torrential floods destroyed farmlands and houses this period corresponds to the last wet period 1942 1950 in the reconstructed sequence and extremely wet years continuously appear during this time the comparison above thus shows that the recorded arid and flooding years are all reflected in the reconstructed sequence demonstrating that the reconstructed runoff results in this study can precisely reflect the regional runoff data with great reliability and applicability to directly illustrate temporal and spatial variability in the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone we compared our reconstruction results to published reconstruction results for the transitional zone fig 7 fig 8 a b shows the reconstructed annual runoff data of klr and lnr during 1800 1990 in high latitude eastern west siberia macdonald et al 2007 fig 8c shows the reconstructed annual runoff data of the yimin river ymr during 1868 2002 in hulunbuir inner mongolia china bao et al 2012 fig 8d shows the reconstructed annual runoff data during 1666 2016 in the wula mountain area based on the tree ring width of p orientalis from this study fig 8e shows the reconstructed total precipitation from january to july during 1775 1999 for hlm china based on the tree ring width of p tabulaeformis liu et al 2005 the total precipitation from january to july accounts for 70 of the whole year which can represent the annual precipitation generally the reconstructed runoff sequences in the transitional zone are characterized by intense fluctuations in high and low latitude areas cvklr 13 3 cvwlm 36 1 cvhlm 18 7 and weak fluctuations in mid latitude areas cvlnr 6 5 cvymr 3 1 comparison of variability over the same time period between 1800 and 1990 reveals that wet periods in high and low latitude areas make up 15 26 and 5 8 of the whole time period respectively and dry periods make up approximately 15 of the time in all areas regarding different stages from the end of the 18th century to the middle of the 19th century the 11 year moving average curves of wlm and hlm both overlap well with the zero line with only small positive and negative fluctuations this indicates that both areas experienced a nearly 100 year mean flow period wlm klr and lnr all experienced a process of drying wetting drying in the first half of the 19th century which means that runoffs in all the three areas are characterized by simultaneous wetting and drying variability during this time period during the second half of the 19th century i e a time after the second industrial revolution runoff in the transitional zone is characterized by an increasing trend which lasts longer time at higher latitudes fig 8 when entering the 20th century all areas are characterized by a significant drying trend which lasts longer 50 80 years with lower drying speeds in high and low latitude areas and lasts shorter 5 15 years with higher drying speeds in mid latitude areas all areas reach their peak value in the whole sequence in mid 20th century with high and low latitude areas arriving first and mid latitude areas later klm and lnr at high latitudes are characterized by a significant 60 100 year periodicity ymr at mid latitudes is characterized by a significant 25 year periodicity and wlm and hlm at mid and low latitudes are characterized by a significant 60 year periodicity 4 conclusions 1 based on the tree ring width of p orientalis we reconstructed the annual runoff sequence over four centuries 351 years in a typical low latitude area in the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone our reconstruction function is stable and reliable and the obtained results are precise for future applications this study provides new insight into the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone at low latitudes from the aspect of dendrohydrology based on runoff variability in the entire transnational zone our four century reconstruction fills the need for a long term historical runoff sequence in the transitional zone 2 in the last four centuries the annual runoff in the research area is characterized by a drying trend with gradually larger fluctuations the 18th century is dominated by wet periods and frequent extremely wet years but the continuous wet periods are progressively shorter later this area experienced a nearly 100 year mean flow period ending in the 1930 s during which dry periods also started to appear with increasing length in the last 30 years this area has suffered from the longest continuous dry period in the last 351 years 3 the reconstruction results from this study correspond well to the arid and flooding years and periods written in local historical records and thus can be used to represent historical runoff in this area regarding runoff variability in the entire transitional zone over the last two centuries there were more wet periods in high latitude areas which had more significant variability and larger scale periodicities most of the areas were characterized by simultaneous wetting and drying variability in the same time period and by a significant drying trend in the first half of the 20th century during this period drying lasted longer in high and low latitude areas with lower speeds and lasted for shorter times in mid latitude areas with higher speeds credit authorship contribution statement bolin sun carried out the conceptualization data curation formal analysis and writing original draft xing huang

4687,temperate continental monsoon transitional zones are sensitive to variations in the global hydrological climate and the long term patterns of hydrological variability in this zone should be explored urgently in this study based on the tree ring width of platycladus orientalis we reconstructed the annual runoff sequence during 1666 2016 351 years on wula mountain which lies within the low latitude temperate continental monsoon transitional zone our reconstruction model is stable and reliable because our reconstruction results overlap well with the arid and flood years and periods found in local historical records our analysis results show that over the last four centuries the annual runoff in the low latitude transitional zone is characterized by an overall decrease with heightened fluctuations specifically in the 18th century wet and extremely wet years appeared frequently while continuous wet periods grew progressively shorter later this area experienced a mean flow period of approximately 100 years ending in the 1930 s when progressively longer dry periods began to occur in the last 30 years this area has suffered from its longest dry period in 351 years regarding runoff variability over two centuries in the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone high latitude areas had more wet periods with significant variation in large scale periodicities the majority of the zone had simultaneous variation in wetting and drying and a significant drying trend in the first half of the 20th century high and low latitude areas had long and slowly changing arid periods while mid latitude areas had short and quickly changing arid periods this study enriches the understanding of the dendrohydrology of the low and middle latitudes of the temperate continental monsoon transition zone analyzes the runoff variations throughout the transition zone area and helps reconstruct the long term historical runoff sequence over four centuries in the transitional zone keywords runoff reconstruction runoff variability dendrohydrology temperate continental monsoon transitional zone 1 introduction water resource is an irreplaceable precious natural resource that is critical for humans and all other biological species wada and bierkens 2014 konapala et al 2020 since the 1980s shortages of water resources have become more and more severe around the globe wada and bierkens 2014 and uncertainties about climate change have further intensified the water shortage problem konapala et al 2020 the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone in east eurasia is sensitive to variations in global hydrological climate however the pattern and trend of long term historical hydrological variability in the entire transitional zone has remained unclear since hardman s first reconstruction of hydrological factors of the truckee river in nevada usa in 1936 hardman 1936 tree ring width has become a main tool for reconstructing long term historical hydrological variability

from eurasia to the arctic ocean through six main rivers in the last two centuries macdonald et al 2007 1978 1982 was the most severe drought period in the last three centuries in the south lake baikal region in siberia magda 2001 and the dramatic increase in extent and frequency of ice jam floods in the 1930 s indicated by the levels of two lakes in northern quebec canada recorded by the ice marks in coastal tree rings bégin 2001 eurasia is the largest continental plate spanning widely in longitude and latitude with diverse geographical environments its hydrological climate environment is quite complex and belongs to one of the typical vulnerable hydrological climate regions in the northern hemisphere tar 2001 ji et al 2012 eurasia has a variety of climate types the most widely distributed of which are the temperate continental climate and the temperature monsoon climate the junction of these two main climate regions forms a unique and sensitive transitional zone known as the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone this transitional zone starts from eastern west siberia extends southwest and finally ends at the hinterland in northwest china in the qilian mountains it obliquely crosses through east eurasia at latitudes 33 63 n and longitudes 102 164 e and the coupling effect of numerous geographic and hydrological climate factors leads to the sensitive and vulnerable characteristics of the hydrological environment in the transitional zone current dendrohydrological research in the transitional zone mainly utilizes p sylvestris bao et al 2012 pinus tabulaeformis liu et al 2005 2017 2019 and has focused on investigating runoff macdonald et al 2007 bao et al 2012 and the palmer drought severity index pdsi bao et al 2012 based on which 130 220 year hydrological histories have been reconstructed in the kolyma river klr and lena river lnr basin macdonald et al 2007 northeast china bao et al 2012 and helan mountain hlm liu et al 2005 2019 little research has utilized thuja sutchuenensis platycladus orientalis or chamaecyparisobtusa sieb et zucc in the transitional zone and some of the previous studies focusing on short sequences only investigated runoff variability in specific areas without considering the whole picture across the entire transitional zone thus it is urgent to reconstruct longer historical runoff variability in the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone and to analyze the associated variability trends and patterns a better understanding of historical runoff variability in the entire transitional zone will be valuable to general long term hydrological research on this special transitional zone on this basis we chose a typical area in the temperature continental monsoon transitional zone at low latitudes wula mountain in china as our sampling area no long term historical runoff sequence has been constructed there so research on this topic is needed many p orientalis aged hundreds of years are densely distributed in this area and are an ideal proxy for reconstructing runoff over long historical periods in this study based on the annual tree ring width table for p orientalis we reconstruct the runoff historical sequence over the last four centuries in the typical temperate continental monsoon transitional zone at low latitudes with the goal of fully revealing the trend and pattern of its variability then to analyze hydrological variability in the entire transitional zone we compare our results against hydrological events found in the local records and against the literature results for other areas in the transitional zone 2 data and methods 2 1 research area background the sampling area lies in a typical low latitude region in the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone fig 1 and belongs to the yinshan mountains the unstable hydrological climate environment in the transitional zone results in a large hydrological variation rate an unbalanced water heat relationship and a quite vulnerable ecosystem the sampling mountainous area has shallow slopes and within the area vegetation is quite sparsely distributed with medium canopy closures and weak competition between trees during 1951 2016 the multiyear temperature mean was 7 13 based on data from baotou meteorological station and the multiyear precipitation mean was 306 49 mm with 52 17 of the annual precipitation concentrated from july to august fig 2 a in this area the runoff depth mean is 17 7 mm and the multiyear runoff mean during 1955 2016 was 0 17 108 m3 with 68 4 of the annual runoff concentrated from july to august fig 2b 2 2 proxy material and tree ring data for reconstruction p orientalis originated in china and belongs to cupressaceae evergreen trees with well developed roots it mainly grows on precipitous rock faces and sheer cliffs is sensitive to hydrothermal conditions and has the characteristics of cold and drought resistant and long lived trees its tree rings have clear boundaries and thus can be used to precisely determine its growth condition in specific years making it an ideal proxy material for reconstructing hydrological climate factors jiang et al 2015 we collected p orientalis samples at different locations with an average altitude of 1500 m 109 26 9 e 109 26 12 e 40 39 41 n 40 39 42 n in a typical low latitude area in the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone wula mountain china fig 1 in august 2017 sampling was performed in strict accordance with the sampling standard of the international tree ring data base itrdb the sampling environment in which the growth of trees is not directly affected by human activities is selected and healthy trees with long tree age and clear tree ring without obvious fire and pest disturbance are selected for sampling we collected 103 samples from 54 trees in three adjacent gullies two samples from each of 49 trees and one sample from each of the other five tree the collected sample cores were dried naturally in a cool ventilated location and then fixed in custom holder after which the cores were polished with dry sand paper with different mesh sizes until the surface of the core was smooth and the tree rings were clearly visible the bmp format image generated by scanner resolution 10200 14039 after scanning is used windendro basic 2012b to measure the width of each tree ring with an accuracy of 0 001 mm we used the quality control program cofecha holmes 1983 to cross check the data and inspect the missing rings false rings and dating errors this paper mainly uses the negative exponential function method in the arstan program to remove the growth trend of the tree ring width sequence and standardize it cook 1985 the detrending process removed the growth of the tree itself and nonclimate change factors while retaining the low frequency signals as much as possible and a negative exponential function was used to fit the growth trend however when there were abnormal growth trends and the negative exponential function was not applicable a spline function with a step length of 50 100 years was used to fit the growth trend a standard std chronology was then synthesized from the detrended de series using the double weighted average method fig 5a cook and briffa 1990 the statistics such as the mean correlation between the trees rbt mean sensitivity ms and expressed population signal eps of the p orientalis std chronology in the study area were calculated to evaluate the quality of the chronology fritts 1976 and the results are summarized in table 1 among them ms is a quantitative index to measure the sensitivity of the width sequence of tree rings to climate information the higher the value is the more climate information is contained in the chronology eps refers to the degree to which the chronology established can reflect the theoretical chronology generally the chronology established when eps 0 85 is relatively reliable it can be seen that the average sensitivity of the std chronology is high and the signal to noise ratio and the first principal component variance interpretation are at high levels indicating that the tree ring indices of the p orientalis in the study area contain strong climate signals which is suitable for the dendroclimatological study 2 3 hydrological climate data we adopted 1955 2016 annual and monthly runoff data obtained by altshan hydrometric station the closest station to the sampling area and the data are from a hydrological yearbook published by the local hydrological survey bureau we used annual and monthly data of average temperature average minimum temperature average maximum temperature precipitation and relative humidity from 1951 to 2016 obtained by baotou meteorological station and annual and monthly precipitation data from 1951 to 2016 obtained by urad qianqi and guyang meteorological stations the data were downloaded from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn 2 4 data analysis 1 since there is no hydrological station in the basin where the sampling point is located only the hydrological station closest to the basin where the sampling point is located and similar climate type and underlying surface of the basin can be used as the reference station we calculated the annual runoff in the basin area where the sampling points were located by adopting the hydrological analogy method the calculation equation is as follows q sp f sp f ats x sp x g q ats in which q sp is the annual runoff in the basin area where the sampling points are located 1 0 108m3 f sp is the area of the basin area where the sampling points are located 960 36 km2 fig 1 f ats is the basin area monitored by the altshan hydrometric station 880 km2 x sp is the precipitation in the basin area where the sampling points are located mm x g is the precipitation in the basin area where the altshan hydrometric station is located mm and q ats is the annual runoff at the altshan hydrometric station 1 0 108m3 2 to obtain the areal precipitation we adopted the inverse square distance method in which we divided the sampling area into a uniform longitudinal and latitudinal network consisting of 0 01 0 01 grids we calculated the weight of each grid point according to its distances to all the meteorological stations based on which we derived the precipitation data at each grid point then we obtained the algorithmic average of the data at all the grid points which represents the areal precipitation of the research area jones and hulme 1996 3 the response relationship between tree growth and hydrological and climatic factors is the basis for the reconstruction of historical hydrological and climatic factors the strength of their correlation reflects whether the response relationship is close or not and a good correlation is the guarantee for reliable reconstruction therefore pearson correlation method is adopted to analyze the correlation between the tree ring index and hydrological and climatic data 4 the reconstruction of historical runoff is one of the core work of this paper it is based on the significant correlation between annual ring index and hydrological and climatic data and constructs a linear regression equation through regression analysis the expression is as follows y a x b in which y is the reconstructed hydrological elements x is the ring index a is the tendency rate b is the equation intercept the least square method is used to estimate the parameters of the linear regression equation when the sum of squares between the values obtained by the equation and the measured values reaches the minimum two unknowns a and b are determined to complete the construction of the reconstruction equation 5 the reliability of the reconstruction equation determines the availability of the historical runoff reconstruction sequence statistical parameters such as correlation coefficient r adjusted determination coefficient r 2 adj mean square error mse f p the durbin watson statistic d w durbin and watson 1950 were used to evaluate the reliability of the reconstruction equation 6 on the basis of the accuracy and reliability of the reconstruction equation the reliability of the reconstruction results should be further verified only the reliability of the reconstruction results can truly reflect the characteristics of historical runoff changes the splite sample method fritts 1991 a periodical verification test commonly used in dendrochronology is adopted to test the reliability of the reconstruction results the involved statistical parameters include pearson s correlation coefficient r r squared r2 the sign test st reduction of error re coefficient of efficiency ce and product means test t cook et al 1999 fritts 1991 re and ce are statistical quantities to precisely test the reliability of reconstructed values when both are positive it means that the reconstructed model has a certain predictive ability the closer the values are to 1 the stronger the predictive ability fritts 1976 cook et al 1999 st tests the similarity between reconstructed values and the corresponding true values in low frequencies based on the number of their similar or different anomaly signs the parameter t considers the anomaly signs between reconstructed values and the corresponding true values and their numerical values as well which can directly imply whether the reconstructed values contain hydrological climate information 7 due to the difference of hydrological climate type area and underlying surface of drainage basin in different regions the precipitation and runoff are greatly different therefore in the comparative analysis it is more intuitive and convenient to compare the historical reconstruction sequence of runoff in each region after standardization the z score method is used to standardize the historical reconstruction sequence of runoff and the calculation equation is shown below z s c o r e r m n s d in which r is the reconstructed runoff value 1 0 108 m3 m n is the mean of the reconstructed sequence 1 0 108 m3 and s d is the standard deviation 1 0 108 m3 8 listed below are the definitions of wet period dry period relatively wet period relatively dry period mean flow period extremely wet year and extremely dry year when runoff exceeds mean σ or falls below mean σ the period is wet or dry respectively when runoff is between the mean and mean σ or between the mean and mean σ the period is relatively wet or relatively dry respectively and the two periods together are called the mean flow period when runoff lies above mean 2σ or below mean 2σ the year is extremely wet or extremely dry respectively 9 the variation trend is one of the important characteristics of runoff historical reconstruction sequence we adopted the residual mass curve method to analyze the variation trend of the reconstructed historical runoff sequence and the calculation equation is shown below a d d a i i 1 n x i x in which a d d a i represents the residual mass curve value of the ith year x i is the annual runoff of the i th year 1 0 108 m3 and x is the mean of the reconstructed sequence 1 0 108 m3 10 the variation intensity of the reconstructed historical runoff sequence is represented by the coefficient of variation cv this is calculated as shown below c v s d m n in which s d is the standard deviation of the reconstructed historical runoff sequence 1 0 108m3 and m n is the mean 1 0 108 m3 11 to analyze the periodicity of the reconstructed historical runoff sequence we adopted the multi taper method mtm park et al 1987 mann and lees 1996 12 to analyze the periodic variations in the reconstructed historical runoff sequence we used the morlet wavelet venugopal and foufoula georgiou 1996 defined as ψ t c e t 2 2 cos 5 t the dilatation factor of morlet wavelet a is related to periodicity t in the following relationship t 4 π ω 0 2 ω 0 2 a in which the empirical value of ω 0 is commonly chosen to be near 6 2 13 to test for sudden variations in the reconstructed runoff sequence we adopted the nonparametric mann kendall test fu and wang 1992 steps 1 10 described above were calculated and analyzed within excel and spss software and steps 11 13 were realized using our in house matlab codes 3 results and discussions 3 1 responsive relationships between tree ring growth and hydrological climate factors the correlation coefficients between the tree ring index of p orientalis and hydrological climate factors are shown in fig 3 the tree ring index is closely correlated with the local hydrothermal conditions specifically the tree ring index is positively correlated with the annual and monthly runoffs of the corresponding year and with the precipitation and relative humidity except for february in april august and october it is also negatively correlated with three temperature measures average temperature average maximum temperature and average minimum temperature generally in arid and semiarid areas the water status is the main factor that assists in the radial growth of trees while temperature affects the growth of trees by influencing the water condition in soils and the respiration efficiency and transpiration rate of trees liu et al 2007 cai et al 2010 song and liu 2011 as shown in fig 3 the responsive relationships between the radial growth of p orientalis and variations in hydrological climate factors in the previous year show similar patterns as those in the current year but with slightly lower correlation coefficients its correlation coefficient with the runoff quantity is greatly reduced this illustrates that variations in the hydrological climate factors in the previous year have relatively small effects on the growth of p orientalis thus in the following analysis we focus on the current year case the correlation coefficients of the tree ring index with temperature factors are in the order of annual average minimum temperature annual average temperature annual average maximum temperature the radial growth of p orientalis responds more strongly to the average minimum temperature and average maximum temperature in february and the average temperature in may than to the others the three temperature measures average temperature average maximum temperature and average minimum temperature in different periods generally have consistent effects on p orientalis characterized by stronger effects in winter and spring and weaker effects in summer and autumn regarding hydrology the tree ring index shows the highest correlation with runoff 0 424 p 0 001 followed by relative humidity 0 371 p 0 05 and the correlations are most significant in august its correlation with the monthly precipitation sequence is quite weak and only those correlations in april 0 26 and september 0 244 pass the 95 significant test the tree ring index shows better correlations with runoff in summer 0 408 p 0 001 and autumn 0 394 p 0 001 than in spring 0 348 p 0 05 and winter 0 352 p 0 05 and its correlation with the relative humidity 0 319 p 0 05 0 497 p 0 05 is higher than its correlation with precipitation 0 123 0 142 in spring and summer the opposite holds true in autumn and winter in the research area a typical arid to semiarid cold region the dormant period of tree growth ends in march and april at this time despite the limited amount of precipitation fig 2a as the temperature rises ice and snow start to melt and soils become unfrozen both of which result in a significant increase in runoff in the research area fig 2b and in turn provide an excellent basis for the continuous growth of p orientalis at a later time in the early growth period april and may runoff and precipitation are low in quantity as temperature gradually rises the limited amount of water in the soil significantly evaporates resulting in reduced available water for trees and formation of a narrow tree ring in june august runoff and precipitation in the research area represent 70 and 62 17 of their annual quantities respectively in this time temperature gradually rises to its annual peak as does evaporation the relative humidity also reaches a high level with the intensified transpiration by trees these simultaneously optimized hydrothermal conditions lead to a peak period for p orientalis growth and the formation of a relatively wide tree ring before entering the dormant growth period september november runoff suddenly drops in the research area and precipitation gradually decreases at this time the relatively low temperatures cannot cause intense evaporation of soil water or transpiration from trees leading to weakened effects of water and heat on the growth of p orientalis 3 2 reconstructing annual runoff the analysis above illustrates that the tree ring index of p orientalis is strongly correlated with the annual runoff 0 424 p 0 001 in the research area thus we ran a linear regression to reconstruct the average annual runoff sequence during 1666 2016 in the research area the reconstruction equation is shown below runoff 0 592 i t 3 966 r 0 424 n 62 r 2 adj 0 152 f 20 88 mse 0 002 p 0 001 d w 2 13 in which runoff is the annual runoff in the t th year 1 0 108m3 and i t is the tree ring index in the t th year it can be seen from the reconstruction equation parameters that r reaches the significance level of 99 and the mse is less than 0 01 which indicates that the fitting effect is good the confidence degree of f test is 99 9 d w durbin and watson 1950 was used to detect the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals from a regression analysis our d w value is between 1 55 and 2 38 n 62 indicated that there was no autocorrelation the comparison of the reconstructed and measured values above fig 4 shows that the two sets of values have quite consistent variability over time and are thus well synchronized we divided the reconstructed sequence into two time periods 1955 1983 and 1984 2016 the two time periods correspond to the calibration period and the test period as shown in table 2 in the test period re and ce are both positive the former close to 1 meaning that the regression model is good at making predictions fritts 1976 cook et al 1999 the st and st1 values are both significant and lie above the 95 confidence bands pointing to the consistency in high and low frequency variability between the reconstructed and measured sequences in the calibration period the r and t between the measured and reconstructed sequences at all times both pass the 95 significant test revealing that the reconstructed values contain much information on hydrological factors in conclusion the reconstruction equation meets the reliability requirements and the test results of reconstruction sequence meet the reliability standard which can be used to reconstruct the annual runoff historical series in the study area 3 3 characteristics of reconstructed annual runoff sequence the reconstructed annual runoff curve reflects multiple cycles between wet and dry conditions during 1666 2016 in the research area fig 5e the whole sequence reveals four wet periods 1688 1712 1731 1738 1754 1763 and 1942 1950 and three dry periods 1824 1830 1908 1926 and 1986 2011 representing 13 68 and 13 96 of the total number of reconstructed years 351 respectively there are 12 extremely wet years and six extremely dry years representing 3 41 and 1 71 of the reconstructed sequence respectively overall the reconstructed sequence can be divided into three periods fig 5d e during the first period from the end of the 17th century to the 1770 s the interdecadal average values are quite high and 83 of wet periods and 67 of extremely wet periods in the whole sequence happen within this time period the transitions to wet periods are fast and relatively dry periods hardly appear fig 5c the length of continuous wet periods shrinks from the initial 24 years to 9 years with significant 5 10 year and 12 25 year periodicities fig 5b these periodicities are confirmed by our power spectral calculation results fig 6 which show that the 7 5 year periodicity agrees with the periodicity of el nino enso allan et al 1996 from the end of the 18th century to the 1930 s the reconstructed sequence is dominated by mean flow periods with the disappearance of wet periods and gradually reduced relatively wet periods fig 5c the annual runoff continuously decreases with dry periods first appearing in the 1920 s after which the continuous arid time increases from 6 to 18 years the sequence shows more intense variations cv 28 24 than in the previous period cv 27 99 and shows two sudden changes in 1822 and 1922 after which the sequence rapidly transits to an increasingly wet trend there are no significant periodicities below 30 years over the whole time period and after the sudden change in 1822 a significant 20 55 year periodicity appears fig 5b during late 1930 s the reconstructed sequence experiences a short rapid uprising and reaches its peak value in the mid 20th century corresponding to the last short wet period 8 year in the 351 years after this time runoff starts to rapidly decrease and reaches its lowest level in the early 21th century and during this period variations in runoff are most intense with the cv reaching 45 33 and interdecadal values all characterized by large magnitude variations especially in the last 30 years this area has experienced the longest dry period 25 years which corresponds to 51 of the total dry time in the 351 years and extremely dry periods are quite concentrated which may be the combined result of increasing temperatures in the past 30 years liang et al 2018 sun et al 2019 and human activities in this area our analysis above demonstrates that the annual runoff is overall characterized by a drying trend with gradually stronger fluctuations and by its periodicities in transitioning from middle small scales to predominantly large scales in the research area 3 4 comparison of the reconstruction results with historical hydrological events and literature data we compared our reconstructed historical runoff data with hydrological events written in local historical records shen 2008 wang 1990 our comparison illustrates the following facts during 1747 1750 areas in the surroundings of baotou and huhhot experienced severe drought disasters the reconstructed sequence during this period shows significant drying features compared with the previous period making it a relatively dry period fig 5c in 1777 1779 1793 1805 1877 and 1878 hohhot baotou and tumd youqi lying between hohhot city and baotou city experienced significant drought events and in 1893 and 1901 severe drought hazards occurred in spring summer and autumn in tumd youqi and baodou resulting in the gathering of no kernels or seeds these years had runoff at or below the average level of the reconstructed sequence in 1908 1911 and 1926 1928 bayannur city and huhhot city suffered from continuous severe dry and hot winds in spring and summer and this made it difficult for crops to mature and caused farmlands to be abandoned this period generally overlaps with the second dry period 1908 1926 captured by the reconstructed sequence in 1928 areas near baotou experienced droughts and after that most areas of inner mongolia suffered from droughts which continued for four years 1929 1932 this resulted in halved farmland crops lack of precipitation in spring and summer disappearance of grass and most livestock being starved to death this period of the reconstructed sequence is in the middle of a relatively dry period after its second sudden change 1922 during 1943 1950 bayannur baotou and huhhot experienced continuous flooding the dam of yellow river broke and torrential floods destroyed farmlands and houses this period corresponds to the last wet period 1942 1950 in the reconstructed sequence and extremely wet years continuously appear during this time the comparison above thus shows that the recorded arid and flooding years are all reflected in the reconstructed sequence demonstrating that the reconstructed runoff results in this study can precisely reflect the regional runoff data with great reliability and applicability to directly illustrate temporal and spatial variability in the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone we compared our reconstruction results to published reconstruction results for the transitional zone fig 7 fig 8 a b shows the reconstructed annual runoff data of klr and lnr during 1800 1990 in high latitude eastern west siberia macdonald et al 2007 fig 8c shows the reconstructed annual runoff data of the yimin river ymr during 1868 2002 in hulunbuir inner mongolia china bao et al 2012 fig 8d shows the reconstructed annual runoff data during 1666 2016 in the wula mountain area based on the tree ring width of p orientalis from this study fig 8e shows the reconstructed total precipitation from january to july during 1775 1999 for hlm china based on the tree ring width of p tabulaeformis liu et al 2005 the total precipitation from january to july accounts for 70 of the whole year which can represent the annual precipitation generally the reconstructed runoff sequences in the transitional zone are characterized by intense fluctuations in high and low latitude areas cvklr 13 3 cvwlm 36 1 cvhlm 18 7 and weak fluctuations in mid latitude areas cvlnr 6 5 cvymr 3 1 comparison of variability over the same time period between 1800 and 1990 reveals that wet periods in high and low latitude areas make up 15 26 and 5 8 of the whole time period respectively and dry periods make up approximately 15 of the time in all areas regarding different stages from the end of the 18th century to the middle of the 19th century the 11 year moving average curves of wlm and hlm both overlap well with the zero line with only small positive and negative fluctuations this indicates that both areas experienced a nearly 100 year mean flow period wlm klr and lnr all experienced a process of drying wetting drying in the first half of the 19th century which means that runoffs in all the three areas are characterized by simultaneous wetting and drying variability during this time period during the second half of the 19th century i e a time after the second industrial revolution runoff in the transitional zone is characterized by an increasing trend which lasts longer time at higher latitudes fig 8 when entering the 20th century all areas are characterized by a significant drying trend which lasts longer 50 80 years with lower drying speeds in high and low latitude areas and lasts shorter 5 15 years with higher drying speeds in mid latitude areas all areas reach their peak value in the whole sequence in mid 20th century with high and low latitude areas arriving first and mid latitude areas later klm and lnr at high latitudes are characterized by a significant 60 100 year periodicity ymr at mid latitudes is characterized by a significant 25 year periodicity and wlm and hlm at mid and low latitudes are characterized by a significant 60 year periodicity 4 conclusions 1 based on the tree ring width of p orientalis we reconstructed the annual runoff sequence over four centuries 351 years in a typical low latitude area in the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone our reconstruction function is stable and reliable and the obtained results are precise for future applications this study provides new insight into the temperate continental monsoon transitional zone at low latitudes from the aspect of dendrohydrology based on runoff variability in the entire transnational zone our four century reconstruction fills the need for a long term historical runoff sequence in the transitional zone 2 in the last four centuries the annual runoff in the research area is characterized by a drying trend with gradually larger fluctuations the 18th century is dominated by wet periods and frequent extremely wet years but the continuous wet periods are progressively shorter later this area experienced a nearly 100 year mean flow period ending in the 1930 s during which dry periods also started to appear with increasing length in the last 30 years this area has suffered from the longest continuous dry period in the last 351 years 3 the reconstruction results from this study correspond well to the arid and flooding years and periods written in local historical records and thus can be used to represent historical runoff in this area regarding runoff variability in the entire transitional zone over the last two centuries there were more wet periods in high latitude areas which had more significant variability and larger scale periodicities most of the areas were characterized by simultaneous wetting and drying variability in the same time period and by a significant drying trend in the first half of the 20th century during this period drying lasted longer in high and low latitude areas with lower speeds and lasted for shorter times in mid latitude areas with higher speeds credit authorship contribution statement bolin sun carried out the conceptualization data curation formal analysis and writing original draft xing huang

4688,the ephemeral inundation of floodplains in semi arid and arid zone climates is an essential driver of biological productivity natural biota depend on floodplain inundation to support critical reproductive life phases in historical times grazing industries have developed taking advantage of phases of high productivity associated with the overbank flow however the modelling of inundation in lowland floodplains is challenged by the complexity of topographic and hydrodynamic constraints here we apply a spatially explicit fine scale inundation model to compare floodplain inundation regimes

hydrological developments in the darling river catchment have substantially increased inter flood period an effect particularly pronounced during dry climatic phases the result explains the decline in

represents the best available estimate of the natural river system though it does not remove the impact of land use change and developments within the floodplain we utilised pre development river flow data derived from hydrologic models developed for the darling river at bourke station under the integrated river system modelling framework see mdba 2012 podger et al 2010 for further details 2 1 2 current development scenario this represents water management immediately prior to the implementation of the murray darling basin plan it includes the water allocation policies water sharing rules and infrastructure operation rules of dams locks and weirs in place in as of june 2009 we used the observed gauged river flow data at the bourke to predict the inundation under current development scenario a comparison between river discharge at the bourke station for 21 years under current and pre development flow scenarios along with the overbank flow at this location is given in fig 2 frequent floodplain inundation through overbank flow was a characteristic of the natural flow regime however under current water development scenario the number of flood peaks capable of floodplain inundation is noticeably less as is the magnitude of those flood peaks the size of the flood peaks generally influences the spatial extent of inundation and consequently the area of a given ecological community that can be supported by a particular flood regime the reduction in peak flows is due to the combined effect of upstream valleys i e the border rivers developments and developments in the darling system itself e g floodplain harvesting through damming and diversion 2 2 inundation mapping according to brennan et al 2002 75 of wetlands in the study area commence to flow at discharges between 14 000 and 50 000 ml d here we set river discharge higher than 30 000 ml d at bourke station as the overbank flow threshold cooney 1994 sheldon 2017 we validated this threshold value by visually inspecting water areas derived from landsat images at dates when river flow was under 30 000 ml d we then simulated inundation maps for those days with discharge higher than the threshold of 30 000 ml d and for the rest of the days with a lower discharge record a base map in which water is restricted to channels was created and inserted to complete the daily time series of the inundation extent for the development scenario comparison these two scenarios together reveal the impact of historical changes in river management on floodplain inundation conceptualising river flow as the most important driver of the darling river floodplain inundation regime mdba 2016b shaeri karimi et al 2019 for the period from 1988 to 2009 we generated two individual inundation maps per day for pre and current development scenarios resulting in a total 15 474 inundation maps which are archived on the open science framework available at https doi org 10 17605 osf io z2sym we then summarised the long period time series of inundation by deriving three inundation characteristic maps inundation frequency duration of inundation and inter flood period in this study we defined frequency as the total number of days that each pixel was inundated over the period of record duration was calculated as the average length of individual inundation events inter flood period was characterised by identifying the maximum period between two consecutive flood events in other words the maximum number of days without overbank flooding all data preparation and analysis were implemented using r r core team 2019 and arcgis 10 6 esri 2018 long time series only represent average system behaviour oni et al 2016 added to this flows between wet and dry years are significantly variable in the darling basin due to rainfall variability thoms and sheldon 2000 therefore we also considered wet and dry years separately to reveal the impact of water development scenarios better we used the deviation from the long term average annual river flow to separate wet and dry years gao et al 2018 wet years were defined as water years with annual river flow higher than the average annual river flow over 1988 2009 1988 1989 1990 1995 1996 1998 and 2000 whereas dry years were defined as years with annual river flow less than the long term average annual flow 1991 1992 1993 1994 1997 1999 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 and 2008 the water year in australia runs from july 1st to the 30th of june the following calendar year 3 results the impact of water resource development on floodplain inundation has been focussed on a section of channelised flood runners within a few kilometres of the main river channel here the duration of inundation has increased fig 3 while inundation frequency has decreased fig 4 reflecting the water delivery demands of extractive users the distal floodplain characterised by infrequent floods of short duration exhibits little change in association with water resource development fig 3c d this is because the proportional effect of water extraction on very large floods of low return interval is less than in smaller events fig 5 shows the changes in maximum inter flood between the pre development and current development scenarios it can be observed that the maximum period between two consecutive flood episodes has increased in the latter case as represented in fig 5c e the more frequently inundated flood runner areas that previously had maximum inter flood of less than three years now experience a higher period between floods under the current development scenario a change that can also be observed in areas with the maximum inter flood period of 3 6 and 6 9 years the higher elevation regions as would be expected to remain unchanged across the two scenarios fig 5g given the lesser proportionate impact of water resource development on the extreme end of the hydrograph the impact of hydrological modification on the frequency of floodplain inundation was greater in dry years than in wet years in the current development scenario areas proximal to the river showed a decrease in inundation frequency with the impact lessening toward the outer floodplain fig 6 table 1 quantifies the dynamic areas of each scenario in hectares and the percentage change from the pre to the current development what is striking is the total exclusion of areas with inundation frequency of 16 20 months under the current scenario and the reduction by over 6000 ha 48 of the area in the 12 16 month category lower inundation frequency categories i e 4 4 8 and 8 12 months were more populated in the current scenario reflecting the consequences of a modified artificial flood regime strategy in dry years most of the network of proximal flood runners were inundated on 40 days under the pre development scenario fig 6b table 1 documents an increase of over 44 000 ha in the category of 10 days inundation under the current development scenario the remaining categories i e 10 20 20 30 30 40 and 40 days showed a reduction to zero hectares in most cases under the current development scenario the 1981 ha documented as retaining inundation frequency higher than 40 days simply mirrors the thalweg of the river the total changes in inundation characteristics of the darling river floodplain have been summarised in table 2 4 discussion statistical learning models were employed for long term predictive inundation mapping for the two different water resource scenarios pre development defined as the removal of all water development structures and diversions and current development as of 2009 prior to recent water re allocations under the murray darling basin plan the results suggest that water resource development has profoundly impacted on inundation characteristics of the upper darling river floodplain while small overbank flows have increased in duration their frequency has declined and inter flood periodicity has increased dramatically which is highlighted in table 2 the findings support projections described by thoms and sheldon 2000 regarding expected water resource development impacts in physical and biological processes within the river 4 1 implications for waterbirds brandis and bino 2016 reviewed waterbird breeding and abundance data from available databases for the condamine balonne and barwon darling river systems including the colonial waterbird breeding database the australian waterbird survey and the atlas of living australia the modelled segment of the darling river between bourke and louth gauges was the most important site for waterbirds in the barwon darling river system and second behind the narran lakes in terms of waterbird numbers and breeding events in the two river systems species observed to be nesting in this section of the river in 1983 84 include several species of teals and ducks anas gracilis chenonetta jubata anas superciliosa malacorhynchus membranaceus the black swan cygnus atratus the yellow billed spoonbill platalea flavipes and the pied cormorant phalacrocorax varius these birds were observed in 1983 1984 1987 1988 1990 1991 1998 and 2000 with highest numbers in the 1983 and 1984 counts the decline in waterbird numbers in the wetlands of the murray darling basin since the aerial bird survey commenced in 1983 has been attributed to declines in water availability in part due to diversion of water for irrigated agriculture kingsford 2000 our results suggest that this change is likely to be associated with increased inter flood period rather than alterations to the duration of inundation of the proximal floodplain during wetter periods the waterbird species observed breeding in the darling river floodplain in the early 1980s require approximately one month for incubation of eggs on nests and one month for fledging brandis and bino 2016 these conditions are more likely to be met in individual events in the current development scenario but the frequency of such events has decreased by 79 table 2 this altered frequency of floodplain inundation may also impact on food sources available during flooding events if the return period is insufficient to support target species of aquatic plants invertebrates and amphibians marshall et al 2006 bino et al 2020 4 2 likely effect on floodplain vegetation floodplain vegetation communities are often located along gradients of soil moisture availability and stress related to the frequency of inundation junk et al 1989 while the relationships between flood frequency flood duration and the distribution of woody and herbaceous vegetation have been extensively studied in humid temperate and tropical systems ferreira and stohlgren 1999 trebino et al 1996 the influence of inundation on vegetation survival and reproduction in the more hydrologically variable semi arid and arid zone floodplains is less well studied capon 2005 found the composition and structure of plant communities in the cooper creek floodplain west of the darling river floodplain to be closely related to flooding history in spite of high temporal variability in the flooding regime importantly the influence of inundation regime on plant community structure was strongest proximal to the channel rather than the distal floodplain where local factors such as soil type and local rainfall patterns may exert a stronger influence wen et al 2018 the implications are that alterations to flooding regime where our modelling suggests changes are greatest are likely to have a more pronounced impact on the composition of floodplain vegetation if the darling floodplain vegetation reflects that of the adjacent cooper creek an increase in inter flood period proximal to the channel might be expected to decrease species richness and total cover significantly particularly for annual monocots capon and reid 2016 river red gum occurring adjacent to water courses in our study were found by wen et al 2018 to have high resilience to drought as indicated by ndvi responses over recent decades this may be related to access to lateral groundwater flow and stream water rather than surface water as proposed by wen et al 2018 and does not seem to have been impacted by the decrease in inundation frequency and increase in inter flood periodicity suggested by our modelling river red gum in these settings may impart resilience to other components of the semi arid floodplain ecosystem colloff and baldwin 2010 farther on the floodplain the effect of hydrological alteration may be more evident lignum communities showed high resistance to the imposition of drought conditions but low resilience suggesting alterations to plant community structure under the extreme inter flood periods imposed by the millennial drought coolibah and black box communities also showed less resilience than river red gum wen et al 2018 and generally located on areas farther away from the streams a large proportion of areas with coolibah and black box communities showed a great increase in intermediate droughts i e inter flood period 10 years fig 5 and decrease intermediate floods frequency 4 months and 20 months fig 4 tables 1 and 2 indicated that these areas would be flooded only during extreme wet periods under this condition the recruitment events would be substantial reduced and the survival of seedlings might not be sustained roberts 1993 the results indicated that these communities should be the restoration focus and the current yearly allocation of small environmental water may not be sufficient for the rejuvenation of these vegetation communities good et al 2011 carefully planned medium to large flooding events should be considered in future environmental water allocations 4 3 likely effect on grazing the above mentioned changes to the diversity and cover of monocots in the proximal zone of the floodplain are likely to have impacted on the value of the darling river floodplain for grazing graziers in the nearby lower balonne floodplain have reported losses of up to one quarter of carrying capacity and earnings due to lower flows since the early 1990s with implications for the economy of local towns mdba 2016c the diversion of water flowing across irrigation properties floodplain harvesting has exacerbated the effect of drought our modelling suggests that the more regular lignum floods the small scale flooding proximal to the river have declined to nearly one quarter of pre development frequency floods occurring in these heavily grazed areas of the floodplain have shifted in periodicity from every 1 6 years to 6 12 years table 2 these are the floods graziers rely on to support feed during dry periods and provide stock and domestic water mdba 2016c maintaining herds between the wet periods in which stock breeding occurs at the time of sale toorale station supported 1 500 head of cattle and 30 000 merino down from 265 000 sheep shorn on the station in 1894 on the basis of this modelling it is not surprising that grazing ceased to be profitable in the upper darling a problem that has beset many of the intensively developed rivers in the northern mdb crimp et al 2010 5 conclusions we examined inundation extent in a large semi arid floodplain in the mdb australia and the likely ecological impacts of water resource development inundation measures based on long term modelled inundation patterns were used to classify inundation regimes for two water resource development scenarios simulated natural inundation regimes pre development of the study area were then compared with that simulated for current development on a 1200 km2 area of the darling river floodplain findings are summarised as 1 an increased duration of small floods in the areas adjacent to rivers and creeks likely to be the result of releasing extra water for agriculture during droughts 2 a large portion of the floodplain experienced decrease in intermediate flooding events both flood frequency and duration were substantially reduced especially for dry periods and 3 the inter flood period was significantly increased for the majority of the floodplain 4 these findings have strong implications for future environmental water plans aiming to maintain and restore the ecological integrity of floodplains in arid and

4688,the ephemeral inundation of floodplains in semi arid and arid zone climates is an essential driver of biological productivity natural biota depend on floodplain inundation to support critical reproductive life phases in historical times grazing industries have developed taking advantage of phases of high productivity associated with the overbank flow however the modelling of inundation in lowland floodplains is challenged by the complexity of topographic and hydrodynamic constraints here we apply a spatially explicit fine scale inundation model to compare floodplain inundation regimes associated with current hydrological development on the darling river floodplain australia and pre development conceptualised as the removal of hydrological control structures our results suggest that hydrological developments in the darling river catchment have substantially increased inter flood period an effect particularly pronounced during dry climatic phases the result explains the decline in

visually inspecting water areas derived from landsat images at dates when river flow was under 30 000 ml d we then simulated inundation maps for those days with discharge higher than the threshold of 30 000 ml d and for the rest of the days with a lower discharge record a base map in which water is restricted to channels was created and inserted to complete the daily time series of the inundation extent for the development scenario comparison these two scenarios together reveal the impact of historical changes in river management on floodplain inundation conceptualising river flow as the most important driver of the darling river floodplain inundation regime mdba 2016b shaeri karimi et al 2019 for the period from 1988 to 2009 we generated two individual inundation maps per day for pre and current development scenarios resulting in a total 15 474 inundation maps which are archived on the open science framework available at https doi org 10 17605 osf io z2sym we then summarised the long period time series of inundation by deriving three inundation characteristic maps inundation frequency duration of inundation and inter flood period in this study we defined frequency as the total number of days that each pixel was inundated over the period of record duration was calculated as the average length of individual inundation events inter flood period was characterised by identifying the maximum period between two consecutive flood events in other words the maximum number of days without overbank flooding all data preparation and analysis were implemented using r r core team 2019 and arcgis 10 6 esri 2018 long time series only represent average system behaviour oni et al 2016 added to this flows between wet and dry years are significantly variable in the darling basin due to rainfall variability thoms and sheldon 2000 therefore we also considered wet and dry years separately to reveal the impact of water development scenarios better we used the deviation from the long term average annual river flow to separate wet and dry years gao et al 2018 wet years were defined as water years with annual river flow higher than the average annual river flow over 1988 2009 1988 1989 1990 1995 1996 1998 and 2000 whereas dry years were defined as years with annual river flow less than the long term average annual flow 1991 1992 1993 1994 1997 1999 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 and 2008 the water year in australia runs from july 1st to the 30th of june the following calendar year 3 results the impact of water resource development on floodplain inundation has been focussed on a section of channelised flood runners within a few kilometres of the main river channel here the duration of inundation has increased fig 3 while inundation frequency has decreased fig 4 reflecting the water delivery demands of extractive users the distal floodplain characterised by infrequent floods of short duration exhibits little change in association with water resource development fig 3c d this is because the proportional effect of water extraction on very large floods of low return interval is less than in smaller events fig 5 shows the changes in maximum inter flood between the pre development and current development scenarios it can be observed that the maximum period between two consecutive flood episodes has increased in the latter case as represented in fig 5c e the more frequently inundated flood runner areas that previously had maximum inter flood of less than three years now experience a higher period between floods under the current development scenario a change that can also be observed in areas with the maximum inter flood period of 3 6 and 6 9 years the higher elevation regions as would be expected to remain unchanged across the two scenarios fig 5g given the lesser proportionate impact of water resource development on the extreme end of the hydrograph the impact of hydrological modification on the frequency of floodplain inundation was greater in dry years than in wet years in the current development scenario areas proximal to the river showed a decrease in inundation frequency with the impact lessening toward the outer floodplain fig 6 table 1 quantifies the dynamic areas of each scenario in hectares and the percentage change from the pre to the current development what is striking is the total exclusion of areas with inundation frequency of 16 20 months under the current scenario and the reduction by over 6000 ha 48 of the area in the 12 16 month category lower inundation frequency categories i e 4 4 8 and 8 12 months were more populated in the current scenario reflecting the consequences of a modified artificial flood regime strategy in dry years most of the network of proximal flood runners were inundated on 40 days under the pre development scenario fig 6b table 1 documents an increase of over 44 000 ha in the category of 10 days inundation under the current development scenario the remaining categories i e 10 20 20 30 30 40 and 40 days showed a reduction to zero hectares in most cases under the current development scenario the 1981 ha documented as retaining inundation frequency higher than 40 days simply mirrors the thalweg of the river the total changes in inundation characteristics of the darling river floodplain have been summarised in table 2 4 discussion statistical learning models were employed for long term predictive inundation mapping for the two different water resource scenarios pre development defined as the removal of all water development structures and diversions and current development as of 2009 prior to recent water re allocations under the murray darling basin plan the results suggest that water resource development has profoundly impacted on inundation characteristics of the upper darling river floodplain while small overbank flows have increased in duration their frequency has declined and inter flood periodicity has increased dramatically which is highlighted in table 2 the findings support projections described by thoms and sheldon 2000 regarding expected water resource development impacts in physical and biological processes within the river 4 1 implications for waterbirds brandis and bino 2016 reviewed waterbird breeding and abundance data from available databases for the condamine balonne and barwon darling river systems including the colonial waterbird breeding database the australian waterbird survey and the atlas of living australia the modelled segment of the darling river between bourke and louth gauges was the most important site for waterbirds in the barwon darling river system and second behind the narran lakes in terms of waterbird numbers and breeding events in the two river systems species observed to be nesting in this section of the river in 1983 84 include several species of teals and ducks anas gracilis chenonetta jubata anas superciliosa malacorhynchus membranaceus the black swan cygnus atratus the yellow billed spoonbill platalea flavipes and the pied cormorant phalacrocorax varius these birds were observed in 1983 1984 1987 1988 1990 1991 1998 and 2000 with highest numbers in the 1983 and 1984 counts the decline in waterbird numbers in the wetlands of the murray darling basin since the aerial bird survey commenced in 1983 has been attributed to declines in water availability in part due to diversion of water for irrigated agriculture kingsford 2000 our results suggest that this change is likely to be associated with increased inter flood period rather than alterations to the duration of inundation of the proximal floodplain during wetter periods the waterbird species observed breeding in the darling river floodplain in the early 1980s require approximately one month for incubation of eggs on nests and one month for fledging brandis and bino 2016 these conditions are more likely to be met in individual events in the current development scenario but the frequency of such events has decreased by 79 table 2 this altered frequency of floodplain inundation may also impact on food sources available during flooding events if the return period is insufficient to support target species of aquatic plants invertebrates and amphibians marshall et al 2006 bino et al 2020 4 2 likely effect on floodplain vegetation floodplain vegetation communities are often located along gradients of soil moisture availability and stress related to the frequency of inundation junk et al 1989 while the relationships between flood frequency flood duration and the distribution of woody and herbaceous vegetation have been extensively studied in humid temperate and tropical systems ferreira and stohlgren 1999 trebino et al 1996 the influence of inundation on vegetation survival and reproduction in the more hydrologically variable semi arid and arid zone floodplains is less well studied capon 2005 found the composition and structure of plant communities in the cooper creek floodplain west of the darling river floodplain to be closely related to flooding history in spite of high temporal variability in the flooding regime importantly the influence of inundation regime on plant community structure was strongest proximal to the channel rather than the distal floodplain where local factors such as soil type and local rainfall patterns may exert a stronger influence wen et al 2018 the implications are that alterations to flooding regime where our modelling suggests changes are greatest are likely to have a more pronounced impact on the composition of floodplain vegetation if the darling floodplain vegetation reflects that of the adjacent cooper creek an increase in inter flood period proximal to the channel might be expected to decrease species richness and total cover significantly particularly for annual monocots capon and reid 2016 river red gum occurring adjacent to water courses in our study were found by wen et al 2018 to have high resilience to drought as indicated by ndvi responses over recent decades this may be related to access to lateral groundwater flow and stream water rather than surface water as proposed by wen et al 2018 and does not seem to have been impacted by the decrease in inundation frequency and increase in inter flood periodicity suggested by our modelling river red gum in these settings may impart resilience to other components of the semi arid floodplain ecosystem colloff and baldwin 2010 farther on the floodplain the effect of hydrological alteration may be more evident lignum communities showed high resistance to the imposition of drought conditions but low resilience suggesting alterations to plant community structure under the extreme inter flood periods imposed by the millennial drought coolibah and black box communities also showed less resilience than river red gum wen et al 2018 and generally located on areas farther away from the streams a large proportion of areas with coolibah and black box communities showed a great increase in intermediate droughts i e inter flood period 10 years fig 5 and decrease intermediate floods frequency 4 months and 20 months fig 4 tables 1 and 2 indicated that these areas would be flooded only during extreme wet periods under this condition the recruitment events would be substantial reduced and the survival of seedlings might not be sustained roberts 1993 the results indicated that these communities should be the restoration focus and the current yearly allocation of small environmental water may not be sufficient for the rejuvenation of these vegetation communities good et al 2011 carefully planned medium to large flooding events should be considered in future environmental water allocations 4 3 likely effect on grazing the above mentioned changes to the diversity and cover of monocots in the proximal zone of the floodplain are likely to have impacted on the value of the darling river floodplain for grazing graziers in the nearby lower balonne floodplain have reported losses of up to one quarter of carrying capacity and earnings due to lower flows since the early 1990s with implications for the economy of local towns mdba 2016c the diversion of water flowing across irrigation properties floodplain harvesting has exacerbated the effect of drought our modelling suggests that the more regular lignum floods the small scale flooding proximal to the river have declined to nearly one quarter of pre development frequency floods occurring in these heavily grazed areas of the floodplain have shifted in periodicity from every 1 6 years to 6 12 years table 2 these are the floods graziers rely on to support feed during dry periods and provide stock and domestic water mdba 2016c maintaining herds between the wet periods in which stock breeding occurs at the time of sale toorale station supported 1 500 head of cattle and 30 000 merino down from 265 000 sheep shorn on the station in 1894 on the basis of this modelling it is not surprising that grazing ceased to be profitable in the upper darling a problem that has beset many of the intensively developed rivers in the northern mdb crimp et al 2010 5 conclusions we examined inundation extent in a large semi arid floodplain in the mdb australia and the likely ecological impacts of water resource development inundation measures based on long term modelled inundation patterns were used to classify inundation regimes for two water resource development scenarios simulated natural inundation regimes pre development of the study area were then compared with that simulated for current development on a 1200 km2 area of the darling river floodplain findings are summarised as 1 an increased duration of small floods in the areas adjacent to rivers and creeks likely to be the result of releasing extra water for agriculture during droughts 2 a large portion of the floodplain experienced decrease in intermediate flooding events both flood frequency and duration were substantially reduced especially for dry periods and 3 the inter flood period was significantly increased for the majority of the floodplain 4 these findings have strong implications for future environmental water plans aiming to maintain and restore the ecological integrity of floodplains in arid and

4689,horizontal borehole ground penetrating radar gpr measurements can provide valuable information on soil water content swc dynamics in the vadose zone and hence show potential to estimate soil hydraulic properties in this study the performance of both sequential and coupled inversion workflows to obtain soil hydraulic properties from time lapse horizontal borehole gpr data obtained during an infiltration experiment were compared using a synthetic modelling study and the analysis of actual field data the sequential inversion using the vadose zone flow model hydrus 1d directly relied on swc profiles determined from the travel time of gpr direct waves using the straight wave approximation the synthetic modelling study showed that sequential inversion did not provide accurate estimates of the soil hydraulic parameters due to interpretation errors in the estimated swc near the infiltration front and the ground surface in contrast the coupled inversion approach which combined hydrus 1d with a forward model of gpr wave propagation gprmax3d and gpr travel time information provided accurate estimates of the hydraulic properties in the synthetic modelling study the application of the coupled inversion approach to measured borehole gpr data also resulted in plausible estimates of the soil hydraulic parameters it was concluded that coupled inversion should be preferred over sequential inversion of time lapse horizontal borehole gpr data in the presence of strong swc gradients that occur during infiltration events keywords ground penetrating radar hydrogeophysics coupled

field scale estimation of hydraulic properties is commonly based on measurements made with point scale sensors such as the neutron probe chanasyk and naeth 1996 and time domain reflectometry tdr

of an ultra wide frequency band for subsurface investigations and hence can potentially provide high resolution information about the soil states however off ground gpr measurements are influenced by surface roughness and only have a limited penetration depth lambot et al 2006a for surface gpr measurements swc can be estimated based on the analysis of the direct ground wave grote et al 2003 weihermüller et al 2007 or reflected waves lunt et al 2005 both gpr acquisition strategies have been successfully used to monitor water flow dynamics in unsaturated soil mangel et al 2012 moysey 2010 allroggen et al 2015 the penetration depth of surface gpr is limited by the soil characteristics especially by the bulk electric conductivity furthermore there is no control on the vertical resolution when using reflected waves for swc determination huisman et al 2003 borehole gpr can overcome these limitations but requires the availability and accessibility of appropriate boreholes or wells and is therefore restricted to specialized test sites and experimental set ups borehole gpr measurements have also been used to monitor swc dynamics looms et al 2008b in addition zero offset profiling zop measurements between horizontal boreholes have been used to monitor swc dynamics galagedara et al 2002 cai et al 2016 klotzsche et al 2019a due to the good control on the vertical resolution and the improved spatial representativeness for the field plot scale this kind of set up provides detailed information on the spatial and temporal variation of swc in order to derive soil hydraulic parameters from time lapse gpr data two types of inversion strategy can be used the first type is commonly called sequential inversion and consists of three steps huisman et al 2010 hinnell et al 2010 first the dielectric permittivity ε is determined from the first arrival time of a gpr measurement using a straight ray approximation e g galagedara et al 2002 or a full waveform inversion e g klotzsche et al 2019b second a petrophysical relationship is used to convert ε to swc using the empirical topp s equation topp et al 1980 or a more advanced dielectric mixing model roth et al 1990 third the obtained time lapse swc data are used in combination with a hydrological model to estimate soil hydraulic parameters using inverse modelling however the use of a sequential inversion strategy may cause errors in the estimated soil hydraulic parameters when errors due to simplified geophysical data interpretations propagate into the estimated soil hydraulic parameters an example of a potential source for such errors is the use of the straight wave approximation for the travel path of the electromagnetic waves rucker and ferré 2004a to overcome this problem a coupled inversion strategy can be used hinnel et al 2010 lambot et al 2006b in contrast to sequential inversion a coupled inversion links a hydrological model directly with a forward model of the geophysical data and the mismatch between measured and modelled geophysical response is minimized i e first arrival time or even the full waveform in the case of gpr in doing so the soil hydraulic parameters used in the hydrological model can be optimized while error propagation is avoided the coupled inversion approach relies heavily on an accurate forward hydrological model a wrong conceptualization of the subsurface in terms of layering or processes not adequately captured by the hydrological model e g dual porosity or macropore flow will introduce errors that propagate into the estimated parameters a range of studies have employed off ground gpr surface gpr and vertical borehole gpr measurements for estimating soil hydraulic properties from time lapse swc information by using either a sequential or a coupled inversion approach e g busch et al 2013 chen et al 2001 2004 jadoon et al 2012 jaumann and roth 2018 jonard et al 2015 kowalsky et al 2005 lambot et al 2009 rucker and ferré 2004b compared to these gpr acquisition strategies horizontal borehole gpr measurements have several advantages to reveal the temporal and spatial swc variations at the field plot scale firstly horizontal borehole gpr measurements can provide swc information at specific depths and thus have larger penetration depth and better control on vertical resolution compared to off ground and surface gpr secondly horizontal borehole gpr measurements provide a higher lateral spatial representativeness of the field plot compared to vertical borehole gpr measurements however no studies have been conducted yet that use horizontal borehole gpr measurements to parameterize a hydrological model in this study the performance of both sequential and coupled inversion workflows to obtain soil hydraulic properties from time lapse horizontal borehole gpr data obtained during an infiltration event will be compared to systematically study the differences between the two inversion approaches a synthetic modelling experiment will be presented first in a second step actual horizontal borehole gpr measurements will be inverted using a coupled inversion approach the resulting estimates of the hydraulic parameters will be compared to available independent hydraulic property estimates obtained from tdr measurements 2 material and methods 2 1 test site and gpr data acquisition an infiltration experiment was carried out on a bare soil plot at a rhizotron facility in selhausen germany in this facility three plots 7 3 m were established with different treatments natural rain rain sheltered and irrigated gpr access tubes of 7 m length were horizontally installed at 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 2 m depth across the entire length of the plot the soil in the facility originates from fluvial gravel deposits from the rur river system and is characterized as an orthic luvisol with high stone content 50 and a loamy texture table 1 due to tillage activity soil porosity φ changes from 0 33 cm3 cm 3 near the surface to approximately 0 25 cm3 cm 3 below 0 3 m depth in order to install the gpr access tubes the entire plot was dug out and refilled layer wise therefore no pedogenetic horizons are detectable anymore below the plough horizon no clear pedogenetic layers are detectable in the gravely layers of the natural soil either for more information about the rhizotron facility the reader is referred to cai et al 2016 and klotzsche et al 2019a the infiltration experiment consisted of five infiltration events that were carried out at the rain sheltered plot during a 4 day period kelter et al 2018 the experimental set up gpr data acquisition and gpr data analysis were reported in yu et al 2020 in detail therefore only a short summary is provided here water was infiltrated using a drip irrigation system that was supplied by water from an underground tank at a constant rate 0 03 cm min 1 approximately 2 7 cm of water was applied for each infiltration event of 90 min fig 1 a zop surveys were made using a gpr system pulseekko sensors software canada with 200 mhz borehole antenna gpr measurements were made at six depths 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 2 m before and after infiltration events during the infiltration events gpr measurements were restricted to the boreholes at 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 m depth as the swc was expected to increase mainly at shallow depths at the beginning of each infiltration event for each zop survey the transmitter and receiver were first pushed to the end of the borehole 7 m and then pulled simultaneously throughout the boreholes in 0 05 m steps the survey ended at 1 5 m distance from the access trench to avoid that reflections from the trench wall and installed sensors interfered with the direct waves the development of the mean gpr travel time at different depths is shown in fig 1b to determine the gpr travel time from the zop data the time zero offset t 0 and first arrival time t obs of the direct wave were determined using the strategy proposed by klotzsche et al 2019a in this strategy t 0 was determined from wide angle reflection and refraction warr measurements with the borehole antennae in air and t obs was manually picked for each trace gpr travel times measured at 0 1 and 0 2 m depth increased after the first infiltration event in response to the second infiltration event travel times up to a depth of 0 8 m responded to the infiltration after the third infiltration event the travel times increased at all depths the standard deviation of the travel times is also shown in in fig 1b which illustrates the spatial variability along the 5 5 m borehole tubes that were generated by the expected differences in the irrigation rate of the used dripping system and small scale lateral water content variations caused by the heterogeneity of the soil based on the straight ray approximation and independent of swc the observed 0 5 ns for the standard deviation of the travel time would lead to an uncertainty of 0 025 cm3cm 3 for swc based on the known distance between the horizontal boreholes d 0 75 m a 1d dielectric permittivity profile ε obs can be calculated from the measured gpr travel times using 1 ε obs c t obs t 0 d 2 where c is the speed of light in vacuum 0 3 m ns 1 swc θ obs was calculated from ε obs using the complex refractive index model crim roth et al 1990 2 θ obs ε obs 1 φ ε s φ ε w 1 where ε w is the permittivity of water 84 at 10 c φ is the porosity of the respective layer and ε s is the permittivity of the solid soil fraction which was assumed to be 4 7 for this facility as considered by klotzsche et al 2019a this value was also suggested by robinson et al 2005 for soil with high quartz content as is the case for this facility 2 2 hydrological modelling vertical swc dynamics during the infiltration experiment were simulated using hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 which calculates one dimensional variably saturated water flow by solving the richards equation 3 θ t z k h h z 1 where h is the pressure head cm θ is the volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 t is time min z refers to the positive upward spatial coordinate cm and k is the hydraulic conductivity cm min 1 as a function of h θ h is the water retention function described by the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 4 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 where θ r is the residual water content cm3 cm 3 θ s is the saturated water content cm3 cm 3 α cm 1 is the inverse of the air entry value n is the pore size distribution index and m is related to n by m 1 1 n the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k r h is given by 5 k

set to 0 5 but can also be estimated for individual soils e g schaap and leij 2000 using this mualem van genuchten parameterization mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the soil hydraulic properties are described by five parameters i e k s θ s θ r α and n for the simulation of vertical swc dynamics the model domain was set to be 150 cm deep and was discretized with 151 nodes with an equal spacing of 1 cm simulations were initialized using linearly interpolated swc estimates from measured permittivity obtained from borehole gpr data acquired prior to the first infiltration event evaporation and root water uptake were both neglected in the simulation as evaporation was low with respect to the amount of infiltrated water and the soil was bare an atmospheric boundary condition with surface run off was used to represent the irrigation events at the upper boundary of the domain at the lower boundary of the domain a seepage face h 0 was used the use of a seepage face was required to match swc observations and avoid excessive drainage out of the profile which occurred when a free drainage boundary condition was used a physical explanation for the need to use a seepage face may be the presence of a compacted soil layer directly below the rhizotron facility caused by the construction of the facility as an alternative to the use of a seepage face a longer soil profile with a dense layer with low k s could have been used however this would have made the hydrological simulations computationally more demanding especially in the case of the coupled inversion 2 3 gpr modeling the gprmax3d model was used to simulate gpr wave propagation with a finite difference time domain fdtd numerical method giannopoulos 2005 warren et al 2016 the size of the simulation domain for the gprmax3d simulation was set to 2 1 1 2 2 m including a soil of 1 5 m thickness below an air layer of 0 7 m the 3d domain was discretized with nodes with 0 02 m spacing and perfectly matched layers pml were used at the boundaries of the model domain berenger 1994 the center frequency of the antenna was set to 200 mhz i e the center frequency of the antenna and the first derivative of a gaussian waveform was selected as the excitation function for the current source as we only considered the velocity information for the gpr data interpretation the electric conductivity of the soil was assumed to be zero 2 4 set up for sequential and coupled inversion to estimate hydraulic parameters from horizontal borehole gpr measurements both sequential and coupled inversion strategies were used the general set ups of the two inversion strategies are illustrated in fig 2 a and fig 2b a key difference between the two approaches is that the sequential inversion approach directly optimizes the misfit between the swc obtained from the gpr measurements θ obs and the simulated swc θ mod provided by hydrus 1d whereas the coupled inversion optimizes the misfit between the travel time of the measured gpr data t obs and the simulated travel time t mod obtained with gprmax3d using swc information θ mod provided by hydrus 1d the misfits for the sequential and coupled inversions were described using cost functions based on the root mean square error rmse between observed and simulated data 7 c mvg θ i 1 n θ i mod θ i obs 2 n 8 c mvg t i 1 n t i mod t i obs 2 n where n is the number of gpr measurements in order to minimize these cost functions the shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm introduced by duan et al 1993 was used sce ua is a global optimization algorithm that not only has been widely used in hydrological research e g chu et al 2010 thyer et al 1999 but also in geophysical applications e g liu et al 2018 mangel et al 2017 the sce ua algorithm requires the specification of parameter bounds for each parameter considered in the optimization the optimization includes several steps first different sets of hydraulic parameters are randomly created in the feasible parameter space and the cost function value for each of these parameter sets is calculated second the parameter sets are sorted in order of their cost function value and distributed into several complexes that are subsequently evolved using the competitive complex evolution cce algorithm duan et al 1994 after this first loop of evolution the complexes are merged again into a single population which again is sorted in order of increasing cost function value and divided into complexes for the next optimization loop the algorithm is considered to be converged if the cost function valued reaches a specified value i e the known error of the data or if the improvement in the best model is below 0 01 in the last 10 evolution loops since no gpr measurements were made in dry soil conditions the inversion is not expected to be sensitive to θ r in order to build an independent hydrological model based on gpr measurement θ r was fixed it to 0 for the inversion and only k s θ s α and n were estimated k s was inverted by using its log transform log k s the algorithms for both sequential and coupled inversion were coded in gnu octave eaton 2012 2 5 set up for synthetic infiltration experiments 2 5 1 set up for a 1 layer soil profile synthetic model experiments were performed to gain further insight into the feasibility of obtaining plausible parameter estimates from sequential and coupled inversion of time lapse borehole gpr data in a first model experiment a 1 layer soil profile was considered we used the soil hydraulic parameters for the top soil 0 30 cm determined by cai et al 2018 which were estimated from tdr measurements at the same depths as the gpr access tubes table 2 in order to generate synthetic data for the model experiments five infiltration events were simulated with an infiltration rate of 0 03 cm min 1 which corresponds with the infiltration rate used in the actual field experiment since the 1 layer soil profile was constructed using the hydraulic parameters of the topsoil higher θ s the amount of applied water was increased in the synthetic modelling experiment in particular the first three irrigation events now lasted 400 min whereas the last two infiltration events still lasted 90 min after obtaining the swc profile θ mod from hydrus 1d a dielectric permittivity profile ε mod was calculated using the rearranged form of the crim model given in eq 2 9 ε mod ε w 1 θ mod 1 φ ε s φ 2 this dielectric permittivity profile was then used to simulate gpr measurements for the six depths using gprmax3d 2 5 2 set up for a 2 layer soil profile a synthetic modelling experiment with a 2 layer soil profile was also performed sequential and coupled inversions for the 2 layer soil profile were conducted based on the infiltration schedule of the actual experiment fig 1a the hydraulic parameters in this second experiment were also based on cai et al 2018 however the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the subsoil k s 2 was changed from 0 0004 cm min 1 reported by cai et al 2018 to 0 04 cm min 1 because it had to be larger than the infiltration rate of 0 03 cm min 1 to avoid ponding of water at the layer interface for a more realistic synthetic modelling study gaussian noise with zero mean and a standard deviation of 0 1 ns and 0 01 cm3 cm 3 was added to the synthetic travel times and swc data respectively for both the 1 layer and the 2 layer model 2 5 3 automatic picking of the first arrival time the implementation of the coupled inversion approach requires an automatic picking of the first arrival time for the simulated gpr data the first arrival time can be automatically determined using an amplitude threshold to obtain this threshold the excitation moment t s of the simulated data was determined from the onset of the source wavelet the source wavelet is defined as the first derivative of the gaussian waveform 10 i 2 ζ e 1 2 ζ e ζ t χ 2 t χ where ζ 2 π 2 f 2 and χ 1 f i is the electric current density a m 2 e is the natural logarithm and f is the center frequency of the antenna 200 mhz from this source wavelet a t s of 1 62 ns was manually determined fig 3 a subsequently an air wave was simulated using antennas positioned at 0 1 m above the ground surface fig 3b with the known propagation velocity in air 0 3 m ns 1 and the antenna separation 0 75 m the true travel time of the air wave is 2 5 ns the appropriate amplitude threshold 0 0158 v m 1 was then determined from the amplitude of the simulated air wave at the travel time of 4 12 ns which is the sum of t s 1 62 ns and true travel time of the air wave 2 5 ns to verify the robustness of the automatic first arrival time determination a synthetic infiltration induced swc profile was generated by hydrus 1d fig 3c and zop measurements were simulated using gprmax3d at different depths the amplitude threshold of 0 0158 v m 1 was used to determine the first arrival time fig 3d it was found that the amplitude of the traces rapidly increased after the determined first arrival time which confirms the robustness of automatic procedure for the determination of the first arrival time 2 6 uncertainty analysis proper quantification of uncertainty in the estimated soil hydraulic parameters is of great importance given that the information content of soil water content measurements for the estimation of soil hydraulic properties depends on the initial and boundary conditions during the experiment mboh et al 2011 in this study we used both response surface analysis toorman et al 1992 and a simple first order approximation kool and parker 1988 kuczera and mroczkowski 1998 vrugt and dane 2006 to investigate the uncertainty of the inverted hydraulic parameters response surfaces provide a 2d view of the cost function distribution obtained with a grid search in order to obtain such surfaces two hydraulic parameters e g α and n are varied between defined bounds whereas the other hydraulic parameters e g log k s and θ s are fixed at their true or optimized value response surfaces are a robust method to visualize parameter uncertainty and the minimum of the cost function however they commonly require a high computational effort especially in the case of many model parameters i e the 2 layer model therefore this method was only used for the synthetic model study with a 1 layer soil profile a classic first order approximation of parameter uncertainty was also used vrugt and dane 2006 it is based on the covariance matrix c of the optimized hydraulic parameters which is calculated by 11 c s 2 j t j 1 where s 2 is the error variance between simulated and observed data and j is the jacobian matrix the jacobian matrix is the first order partial derivative of the cost function for each inverted hydraulic parameter and was obtained using a finite difference approach the marginal posterior distribution of the estimated hydraulic parameters m est is assumed to be a multivariate normal distribution n m est c the uncertainty of the estimated hydraulic parameters can be approximated by the confidence interval for a given level i e 99 of significance calculated from the diagonal elements of c a matrix a that provides the correlation between the estimated hydraulic parameters can be obtained by dividing the elements of c with the square root of the diagonal elements of c 12 a ij c ij c ii 1 2 c jj 1 2 this first order approximation is an efficient way for estimating the uncertainty of the estimated hydraulic parameters for linear or nearly linear hydrologic models and the correlation matrix is a useful indicator of parameter correlation zhu and mohanty 2003 if the hydrological model is highly non linear the first order approximation may be unreliable therefore we only focus on a ij values larger than 0 6 in our analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthetic infiltration experiments the simulated vertical swc profiles at times where gpr measurements were obtained are shown in fig 4 for the synthetic modelling study with a 1 layer soil it can be seen that the infiltration front moved down to 0 6 and 1 2 m depth after the first and second infiltration event respectively after the third infiltration event the entire soil profile was saturated because of the high saturation after the third infiltration event the infiltration front moved rapidly downward through the entire soil profile during infiltration events 4 and 5 the swc estimates obtained from the first arrival time of simulated horizontal borehole gpr measurements using a straight wave approximation are also shown in fig 4b it was found that swc estimates obtained from gpr measurements at shallow depth 0 0 2 m and near the infiltration front underestimated the actual swc fig 4b and 4c this is attributed to the interference of the direct wave with critical refractions generated at the air soil interface and the infiltration front where the dielectric permittivity changes sharply rucker and ferré 2004a for this reason horizontal borehole gpr measurements at 0 1 m depth were previously not considered for swc estimation klotzsche et al 2019a in the synthetic study these data were also not used in the sequential inversion to reduce this interpretation error unfortunately errors in swc estimates near the infiltration front cannot be simply identified and eliminated and thus are expected to affect the estimated hydraulic parameters obtained with the sequential inversion approach for the coupled inversion the effect of the air soil interface is considered in the simulation of gpr wave propagation and therefore there is no need to remove the measurement at 0 1 m depth however the information content with respect to the soil hydraulic properties is expected to be limited for these measurements because of the limited travel path length in the topsoil 3 1 1 response surfaces for the 1 layer soil profile fig 5 a presents the response surface based on true swc data that would be obtained using point measurements i e tdr at the same depth as the borehole gpr measurements the corresponding response surfaces for the noise free coupled inversion of the synthetic gpr data are shown in fig 5b it can be seen that the cost functions for point and gpr measurements have a very similar misfit distribution this is not unexpected given that point and gpr measurements provide a similar type of information albeit with a different sampling volume klotzsche et al 2019a the response surfaces can be used to gain insight in the expected parameter uncertainty in the case of the α parameter the response surfaces for n α θ r α and θ s α indicate that changes in the cost function are parallel to the α axis this suggests that the α parameter is independent from the other parameters although a clear minimum in the cost function value can be observed in these three surfaces it is also elongated in the direction of the α axis suggesting that the α parameter is expected to be less constrained in the inversion results compared to the other model parameters according to the response surfaces for θ s n and θ s log k s estimates of θ s are expected to be correlated with the estimates of n and log k s in the vicinity of the global minimum the response surface is almost perpendicular to the θ s axis and steep which suggests that θ s estimates are well constrained during inversion the global minimum in the response surface between log k s and n is positioned in an elongated valley a strong negative correlation between the parameter estimates for log k s and n is thus expected which implies that the gpr measurements may not contain sufficient information to simultaneously constrain both log k s and n 3 1 2 inversion results for the 1 layer soil profile sequential and coupled inversions were performed using noisy simulated gpr measurements for the 1 layer soil profile in the case of the sequential inversion the fitted swc data showed a large misfit with the expected swc fig 6 a particularly for the shallow depths 0 2 m this is also reflected in the large cost function value 0 05 cm3 cm 3 for the optimized parameters which is much higher than the added uncertainty in the swc data 0 01 cm3 cm 3 additionally the swc profiles simulated by using the estimated parameters from the sequential inversion showed large deviation with the swc profiles from the true forward model fig 7 a due to the poor fit to the data the hydraulic parameters were not accurately estimated by the sequential inversion table 3 in particular θ s was strongly underestimated and this resulted in a large mismatch between the inverted and true water retention curves fig 8 a moreover the estimated value for k s was at the lower boundary of the feasible parameter space 0 035 cm min 1 which is almost equal to the infiltration rate the n and α parameters were also overestimated which resulted in a large difference between the inverted and true relative hydraulic conductivity function fig 8b as detailed above sequential inversion of zop data may lead to erroneous estimates of hydraulic parameters if strong vertical gradients in swc are present e g infiltration induced gradients in the case of the parameters estimated from coupled inversion the simulated travel time fitted the known travel time from the true model well fig 6b as expressed by the low rmse of 0 1 ns also the simulated swc profiles matched well the swc profiles from the true model fig 7a it should be noted that the coupled inversion was ended when the cost function value decreased to the standard deviation of the gaussian noise 0 1 ns table 3 to avoid overfitting therefore the data simulated with the inverted model parameters have the same rmse as the noise free data and the simulated travel times based on the inverted parameters also match well with the noise free data the values for θ s and α were accurately estimated by coupled inversion table 3 however the estimated values for n and log k s showed a slight deviation from the true model likely because of the strong correlation between these two parameters the accurate estimation of the hydraulic parameters is also reflected in the good match between the estimated and known water retention and relative hydraulic conductivity function fig 8a 8b the first order uncertainty estimates for the coupled inversion are presented in table 3 and the associated correlation matrix of the estimated hydraulic parameters is given in table 4 the results indicate a strong negative correlation for log k s n and weak correlations between other pairs of hydraulic parameters this is consistent with the results of the response surface analysis and confirms that the first order approximation provides a meaningful assessment of parameter uncertainty 3 1 3 inversion results for the 2 layer soil profile in a next step the synthetic modelling study for the two layer soil profile was analyzed as expected from the results of the 1 layer soil profile the parameters estimated using sequential inversion deviated considerably from the true hydraulic parameters table 3 and the estimated and true water retention fig 8c 8e and relative hydraulic conductivity functions did not match well fig 8d 8f hence sequential inversion will not be considered for the analysis of the actual field measurements the results of the coupled inversion for the 2 layer soil profile generally were consistent with the results of the 1 layer profile despite the dimensional expansion of the search space from four to eight parameters again the estimated travel times from coupled inversion results nicely fitted the noisy synthetic travel time series fig 9 and the vertical swc profiles from the true model fig 7b in addition accurate hydraulic parameter estimates were obtained table 3 as also confirmed by the minor differences in estimated and true water retention fig 8c 8e and relative hydraulic conductivity functions fig 8d 8f 3 2 inversion of experimental gpr data coupled inversion was used to estimate the hydraulic parameters from the measured horizontal borehole gpr data shown in fig 10 the resulting fit to the measured data is also shown in fig 10 and the estimated soil hydraulic parameters are provided in table 5 for comparison the simulated data using the hydraulic parameters of cai et al 2018 are also provided which are based on long term tdr measurements also made during vegetation periods the comparison between measured and simulated travel times showed a good correspondence at 0 1 m depth both for the inverted hydraulic parameters and the parameters from cai et al 2018 fig 10 for 0 2 m depth the measured gpr travel times steadily increased during the entire infiltration experiment whereas the simulated travel times using both sets of hydraulic parameters remained constant after the second infiltration event because the soil reached saturation this can be explained by the heterogeneous nature of the topsoil which is supported by the large spatial variation of the gpr travel time data for the subsoil the key features of the measured time lapse gpr data were well captured by the coupled inversion also considering the spatial variability in the measured gpr data the simulated travel time data based on the hydraulic parameters of cai et al 2018 did not match the observed gpr data well in the subsoil i e at 0 6 0 8 and 1 2 m depth this is attributed to the small k s 2 used in cai et al 2018 which results in a slow movement of the infiltration front in the subsoil fig 11 and therefore a reduced variation in simulated water content at large depths measured and inverted gpr travel time data are directly compared in fig 12 the use of the hydraulic parameters from cai et al 2018 clearly resulted in a systematic underestimation of the measured data and a relatively high rmse of 0 43 ns the hydraulic parameters obtained using coupled inversion better matched the measured travel time data as indicated by the lower rmse 0 32 ns and a higher r2 value 0 90 nevertheless the rmse between inverted and measured gpr data is still relatively large this is partly attributed to the heterogeneity of the topsoil as the measurements at 0 2 m depth make up a considerable part of the observed misfit furthermore there is uncertainty in the initial swc profile which is solely based on gpr measurements at six different depths here extrapolation from the shallowest borehole to the soil surface is problematic and may have introduced some degree of uncertainty finally there is intrinsic uncertainty in the field gpr measurements and data processing such as the uncertainty in the position of the horizontal boreholes and the uncertainty in the determination of the time zero or first arrival time of measured gpr data these issues obviously did not affect the coupled inversion in the synthetic case study but they are highly relevant for the inversion of actual field measurements the results of the first order uncertainty estimation of the inverted hydraulic parameters are provided in table 5 the uncertainty of α and θ s are comparable for the top and subsoil whereas n and log k s showed a larger uncertainty for the subsoil this can be explained by the strong negative correlation a 0 615 between n 2 and log k s 2 table 6 all other pairs of hydraulic parameters did not show strong correlations fig 13 presents the water retention and relative hydraulic conductivity functions obtained using coupled inversion the associated uncertainty was obtained by randomly plotting 100 sets of hydraulic parameters drawn from the uncertainty bounds provided in table 5 as can be seen from the uncertainty bounds θ s is associated with a relatively low uncertainty whereas the n value is associated with a larger uncertainty as indicated by the increasing spread of the functions at lower pressure heads furthermore uncertainty in the water retention function is similar for the top and subsoil fig 13a 13c for comparison the functions based on the hydraulic parameters of cai et al 2018 were also provided the water retention function obtained using coupled inversion clearly deviated from that of cai et al 2018 which showed a faster decrease of water content with matric potential due to the larger n value additionally a lower θ s was estimated by the coupled inversion the hydraulic conductivity functions obtained using coupled inversion also showed a similar uncertainty for the top and subsoil fig 13b 13d for the topsoil the hydraulic conductivity function obtained using coupled inversion corresponded well with the function obtained in cai et al 2018 this is at least partly due to the similarity in the inverted k s obtained in this study and in cai et al 2018 however there are obvious differences in the hydraulic conductivity functions for the subsoil due to differences in estimated k s there is a range of possible explanations for the observed differences first the estimation of k s is known to be scale dependent for example laboratory methods using small sample volumes often lead to lower k s compared to estimates from in situ measurement from a larger soil volume busch et al 2013 rovey and cherkauer 1995 the results of cai et al 2018 were based on tdr measurement that only cover a small areal fraction of the rhizotron facility whereas the gpr measurements represent a larger volume klotzsche et al 2019a thus a higher k s is perhaps expected for the gpr measurements since the importance of preferential flow in macropores likely increased from the tdr to the gpr scale the analysis presented here also indicated potential parameter correlations between k s and n since larger n values were reported by cai et al 2018 this may explain the small k s values it is also important to note that cai et al 2018 estimated hydraulic parameters with a more complex model set up that considered root water uptake in particular root water uptake parameters were estimated alongside the hydraulic parameters which might have hampered the correct estimation of the soil hydraulic parameters and likely increased the uncertainty in the estimated hydraulic parameters obtained by cai et al 2018 finally it is important to note that cai et al 2018 assumed free drainage as a lower boundary condition whereas a seepage face was used in this study 4 summary and conclusions in this study we used both sequential and coupled inversion strategies to estimate hydraulic parameters from horizontal borehole gpr measurements during an infiltration experiment first a synthetic modelling study was set up to compare the two inversion approaches independent of measurement and model errors in a noise free synthetic study using a 1 layer soil profile a response surface analysis was used to evaluate correlation between hydraulic parameters the results showed that the hydraulic parameters n and log k s were strongly correlated which implies that the gpr measurements were not able to simultaneously constrain log k s and n in a next step synthetic swc and travel time data with added noise were used to estimate hydraulic parameters using sequential and coupled inversion approaches respectively it was observed that a sequential inversion approach relying on the conventional straight ray approximation to estimate swc did not provide accurate hydraulic parameter estimates if strong vertical gradients in swc were present due to infiltration the coupled inversion approach which combined 3d modelling of gpr measurements with a 1d vadose zone flow model was able to provide accurate estimates of the hydraulic parameters both for a 1 layer and a 2 layer soil profile because interpretation errors associated with the straight ray approximation were avoided in a final step horizontal borehole gpr measurements made during an infiltration experiment were inverted using a coupled inversion approach the estimated hydraulic parameters were reasonably consistent with water retention and relative hydraulic conductivity functions reported by cai et al 2018 for the same site in conclusion the coupled inversion of horizontal borehole gpr measurements provided accurate field scale estimates of soil hydraulic parameters because of the larger sampling volume compared to point sensors the estimated hydraulic parameters are expected to have an improved field representativeness in future studies coupled inversion of horizontal borehole gpr data may be used to estimate 2d and perhaps even 3d distributions of soil hydraulic parameters by considering all measured travel times over the profile although this will obviously be associated with a higher computational effort a disadvantage of the proposed approach is that gpr measurements are still taken manually and are thus time consuming whereas point sensors often allow automated data acquisition as an alternative to gpr other geophysical methods such as ert can also be employed to estimate hydraulic parameters ert can investigate the subsurface with high resolution and data acquisition can be automated however the electrical conductivity distribution obtained with ert is not only sensitive to swc but also depends on several other factors e g clay content pore water salinity binley et al 2015 this can complicate vadose zone model parameterization using ert measurements considerably it would be interesting to extend coupled inversion by considering the full gpr waveform instead of solely using travel time information as was recently proposed for seismic data by li et al 2020 it is expected that this would increase the information content of the gpr measurements in the inversion and therefore reduce uncertainty in the estimated hydraulic parameters and provide chances to estimate hydraulic properties of multi layer soils

4689,horizontal borehole ground penetrating radar gpr measurements can provide valuable information on soil water content swc dynamics in the vadose zone and hence show potential to estimate soil hydraulic properties in this study the performance of both sequential and coupled inversion workflows to obtain soil hydraulic properties from time lapse horizontal borehole gpr data obtained during an infiltration experiment were compared using a synthetic modelling study and the analysis of actual field data the sequential inversion using the vadose zone flow model hydrus 1d directly relied on swc profiles determined from the travel time of gpr direct waves using the straight wave approximation the synthetic modelling study showed that sequential inversion did not provide accurate estimates of the soil hydraulic parameters due to interpretation errors in the estimated swc near the infiltration front and the ground surface in contrast the coupled inversion approach which combined hydrus 1d with a forward model of gpr wave propagation gprmax3d and gpr travel time information provided accurate estimates of the hydraulic properties in the synthetic modelling study the application of the coupled inversion approach to measured borehole gpr data also resulted in plausible estimates of the soil hydraulic parameters it was concluded that coupled inversion should be preferred over sequential inversion of time lapse horizontal borehole gpr data in the presence of strong swc gradients that occur during infiltration events keywords ground penetrating radar hydrogeophysics coupled

weihermüller et al 2007 or reflected waves lunt et al 2005 both gpr acquisition strategies have been successfully used to monitor water flow dynamics in unsaturated soil mangel et al 2012 moysey 2010 allroggen et al 2015 the penetration depth of surface gpr is limited by the soil characteristics especially by the bulk electric conductivity furthermore there is no control on the vertical resolution when using reflected waves for swc determination huisman et al 2003 borehole gpr can overcome these limitations but requires the availability and accessibility of appropriate boreholes or wells and is therefore restricted to specialized test sites and experimental set ups borehole gpr measurements have also been used to monitor swc dynamics looms et al 2008b in addition zero offset profiling zop measurements between horizontal boreholes have been used to monitor swc dynamics galagedara et al 2002 cai et al 2016 klotzsche et al 2019a due to the good control on the vertical resolution and the improved spatial representativeness for the field plot scale this kind of set up provides detailed information on the spatial and temporal variation of swc in order to derive soil hydraulic parameters from time lapse gpr data two types of inversion strategy can be used the first type is commonly called sequential inversion and consists of three steps huisman et al 2010 hinnell et al 2010 first the dielectric permittivity ε is determined from the first arrival time of a gpr measurement using a straight ray approximation e g galagedara et al 2002 or a full waveform inversion e g klotzsche et al 2019b second a petrophysical relationship is used to convert ε to swc using the empirical topp s equation topp et al 1980 or a more advanced dielectric mixing model roth et al 1990 third the obtained time lapse swc data are used in combination with a hydrological model to estimate soil hydraulic parameters using inverse modelling however the use of a sequential inversion strategy may cause errors in the estimated soil hydraulic parameters when errors due to simplified geophysical data interpretations propagate into the estimated soil hydraulic parameters an example of a potential source for such errors is the use of the straight wave approximation for the travel path of the electromagnetic waves rucker and ferré 2004a to overcome this problem a coupled inversion strategy can be used hinnel et al 2010 lambot et al 2006b in contrast to sequential inversion a coupled inversion links a hydrological model directly with a forward model of the geophysical data and the mismatch between measured and modelled geophysical response is minimized i e first arrival time or even the full waveform in the case of gpr in doing so the soil hydraulic parameters used in the hydrological model can be optimized while error propagation is avoided the coupled inversion approach relies heavily on an accurate forward hydrological model a wrong conceptualization of the subsurface in terms of layering or processes not adequately captured by the hydrological model e g dual porosity or macropore flow will introduce errors that propagate into the estimated parameters a range of studies have employed off ground gpr surface gpr and vertical borehole gpr measurements for estimating soil hydraulic properties from time lapse swc information by using either a sequential or a coupled inversion approach e g busch et al 2013 chen et al 2001 2004 jadoon et al 2012 jaumann and roth 2018 jonard et al 2015 kowalsky et al 2005 lambot et al 2009 rucker and ferré 2004b compared to these gpr acquisition strategies horizontal borehole gpr measurements have several advantages to reveal the temporal and spatial swc variations at the field plot scale firstly horizontal borehole gpr measurements can provide swc information at specific depths and thus have larger penetration depth and better control on vertical resolution compared to off ground and surface gpr secondly horizontal borehole gpr measurements provide a higher lateral spatial representativeness of the field plot compared to vertical borehole gpr measurements however no studies have been conducted yet that use horizontal borehole gpr measurements to parameterize a hydrological model in this study the performance of both sequential and coupled inversion workflows to obtain soil hydraulic properties from time lapse horizontal borehole gpr data obtained during an infiltration event will be compared to systematically study the differences between the two inversion approaches a synthetic modelling experiment will be presented first in a second step actual horizontal borehole gpr measurements will be inverted using a coupled inversion approach the resulting estimates of the hydraulic parameters will be compared to available independent hydraulic property estimates obtained from tdr measurements 2 material and methods 2 1 test site and gpr data acquisition an infiltration experiment was carried out on a bare soil plot at a rhizotron facility in selhausen germany in this facility three plots 7 3 m were established with different treatments natural rain rain sheltered and irrigated gpr access tubes of 7 m length were horizontally installed at 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 2 m depth across the entire length of the plot the soil in the facility originates from fluvial gravel deposits from the rur river system and is characterized as an orthic luvisol with high stone content 50 and a loamy texture table 1 due to tillage activity soil porosity φ changes from 0 33 cm3 cm 3 near the surface to approximately 0 25 cm3 cm 3 below 0 3 m depth in order to install the gpr access tubes the entire plot was dug out and refilled layer wise therefore no pedogenetic horizons are detectable anymore below the plough horizon no clear pedogenetic layers are detectable in the gravely layers of the natural soil either for more information about the rhizotron facility the reader is referred to cai et al 2016 and klotzsche et al 2019a the infiltration experiment consisted of five infiltration events that were carried out at the rain sheltered plot during a 4 day period kelter et al 2018 the experimental set up gpr data acquisition and gpr data analysis were reported in yu et al 2020 in detail therefore only a short summary is provided here water was infiltrated using a drip irrigation system that was supplied by water from an underground tank at a constant rate 0 03 cm min 1 approximately 2 7 cm of water was applied for each infiltration event of 90 min fig 1 a zop surveys were made using a gpr system pulseekko sensors software canada with 200 mhz borehole antenna gpr measurements were made at six depths 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 2 m before and after infiltration events during the infiltration events gpr measurements were restricted to the boreholes at 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 m depth as the swc was expected to increase mainly at shallow depths at the beginning of each infiltration event for each zop survey the transmitter and receiver were first pushed to the end of the borehole 7 m and then pulled simultaneously throughout the boreholes in 0 05 m steps the survey ended at 1 5 m distance from the access trench to avoid that reflections from the trench wall and installed sensors interfered with the direct waves the development of the mean gpr travel time at different depths is shown in fig 1b to determine the gpr travel time from the zop data the time zero offset t 0 and first arrival time t obs of the direct wave were determined using the strategy proposed by klotzsche et al 2019a in this strategy t 0 was determined from wide angle reflection and refraction warr measurements with the borehole antennae in air and t obs was manually picked for each trace gpr travel times measured at 0 1 and 0 2 m depth increased after the first infiltration event in response to the second infiltration event travel times up to a depth of 0 8 m responded to the infiltration after the third infiltration event the travel times increased at all depths the standard deviation of the travel times is also shown in in fig 1b which illustrates the spatial variability along the 5 5 m borehole tubes that were generated by the expected differences in the irrigation rate of the used dripping system and small scale lateral water content variations caused by the heterogeneity of the soil based on the straight ray approximation and independent of swc the observed 0 5 ns for the standard deviation of the travel time would lead to an uncertainty of 0 025 cm3cm 3 for swc based on the known distance between the horizontal boreholes d 0 75 m a 1d dielectric permittivity profile ε obs can be calculated from the measured gpr travel times using 1 ε obs c t obs t 0 d 2 where c is the speed of light in vacuum 0 3 m ns 1 swc θ obs was calculated from ε obs using the complex refractive index model crim roth et al 1990 2 θ obs ε obs 1 φ ε s φ ε w 1 where ε w is the permittivity of water 84 at 10 c φ is the porosity of the respective layer and ε s is the permittivity of the solid soil fraction which was assumed to be 4 7 for this facility as considered by klotzsche et al 2019a this value was also suggested by robinson et al 2005 for soil with high quartz content as is the case for this facility 2 2 hydrological modelling vertical swc dynamics during the infiltration experiment were simulated using hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 which calculates one dimensional variably saturated water flow by solving the richards equation 3 θ t z k h h z 1 where h

set to 0 5 but can also be estimated for individual soils e g schaap and leij 2000 using this mualem van genuchten parameterization mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the soil hydraulic properties are described by five parameters i e k s θ s θ r α and n for the simulation of vertical swc dynamics the model domain was set to be 150 cm deep and was discretized with 151 nodes with an equal spacing of 1 cm simulations were initialized using linearly interpolated swc estimates from measured permittivity obtained from borehole gpr data acquired prior to the first infiltration event evaporation and root water uptake were both neglected in the simulation as evaporation was low with respect to the amount of infiltrated water and the soil was bare an atmospheric boundary condition with surface run off was used to represent the irrigation events at the upper boundary of the domain at the lower boundary of the domain a seepage face h 0 was used the use of a seepage face was required to match swc observations and avoid excessive drainage out of the profile which occurred when a free drainage boundary condition was used a physical explanation for the need to use a seepage face may be the presence of a compacted soil layer directly below the rhizotron facility caused by the construction of the facility as an alternative to the use of a seepage face a longer soil profile with a dense layer with low k s could have been used however this would have made the hydrological simulations computationally more demanding especially in the case of the coupled inversion 2 3 gpr modeling the gprmax3d model was used to simulate gpr wave propagation with a finite difference time domain fdtd numerical method giannopoulos 2005 warren et al 2016 the size of the simulation domain for the gprmax3d simulation was set to 2 1 1 2 2 m including a soil of 1 5 m thickness below an air layer of 0 7 m the 3d domain was discretized with nodes with 0 02 m spacing and perfectly matched layers pml were used at the boundaries of the model domain berenger 1994 the center frequency of the antenna was set to 200 mhz i e the center frequency of the antenna and the first derivative of a gaussian waveform was selected as the excitation function for the current source as we only considered the velocity information for the gpr data interpretation the electric conductivity of the soil was assumed to be zero 2 4 set up for sequential and coupled inversion to estimate hydraulic parameters from horizontal borehole gpr measurements both sequential and coupled inversion strategies were used the general set ups of the two inversion strategies are illustrated in fig 2 a and fig 2b a key difference between the two approaches is that the sequential inversion approach directly optimizes the misfit between the swc obtained from the gpr measurements θ obs and the simulated swc θ mod provided by hydrus 1d whereas the coupled inversion optimizes the misfit between the travel time of the measured gpr data t obs and the simulated travel time t mod obtained with gprmax3d using swc information θ mod provided by hydrus 1d the misfits for the sequential and coupled inversions were described using cost functions based on the root mean square error rmse between observed and simulated data 7 c mvg θ i 1 n θ i mod θ i obs 2 n 8 c mvg t i 1 n t i mod t i obs 2 n where n is the number of gpr measurements in order to minimize these cost functions the shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm introduced by duan et al 1993 was used sce ua is a global optimization algorithm that not only has been widely used in hydrological research e g chu et al 2010 thyer et al 1999 but also in geophysical applications e g liu et al 2018 mangel et al 2017 the sce ua algorithm requires the specification of parameter bounds for each parameter considered in the optimization the optimization includes several steps first different sets of hydraulic parameters are randomly created in the feasible parameter space and the cost function value for each of these parameter sets is calculated second the parameter sets are sorted in order of their cost function value and distributed into several complexes that are subsequently evolved using the competitive complex evolution cce algorithm duan et al 1994 after this first loop of evolution the complexes are merged again into a single population which again is sorted in order of increasing cost function value and divided into complexes for the next optimization loop the algorithm is considered to be converged if the cost function valued reaches a specified value i e the known error of the data or if the improvement in the best model is below 0 01 in the last 10 evolution loops since no gpr measurements were made in dry soil conditions the inversion is not expected to be sensitive to θ r in order to build an independent hydrological model based on gpr measurement θ r was fixed it to 0 for the inversion and only k s θ s α and n were estimated k s was inverted by using its log transform log k s the algorithms for both sequential and coupled inversion were coded in gnu octave eaton 2012 2 5 set up for synthetic infiltration experiments 2 5 1 set up for a 1 layer soil profile synthetic model experiments were performed to gain further insight into the feasibility of obtaining plausible parameter estimates from sequential and coupled inversion of time lapse borehole gpr data in a first model experiment a 1 layer soil profile was considered we used the soil hydraulic parameters for the top soil 0 30 cm determined by cai et al 2018 which were estimated from tdr measurements at the same depths as the gpr access tubes table 2 in order to generate synthetic data for the model experiments five infiltration events were simulated with an infiltration rate of 0 03 cm min 1 which corresponds with the infiltration rate used in the actual field experiment since the 1 layer soil profile was constructed using the hydraulic parameters of the topsoil higher θ s the amount of applied water was increased in the synthetic modelling experiment in particular the first three irrigation events now lasted 400 min whereas the last two infiltration events still lasted 90 min after obtaining the swc profile θ mod from hydrus 1d a dielectric permittivity profile ε mod was calculated using the rearranged form of the crim model given in eq 2 9 ε mod ε w 1 θ mod 1 φ ε s φ 2 this dielectric permittivity profile was then used to simulate gpr measurements for the six depths using gprmax3d 2 5 2 set up for a 2 layer soil profile a synthetic modelling experiment with a 2 layer soil profile was also performed sequential and coupled inversions for the 2 layer soil profile were conducted based on the infiltration schedule of the actual experiment fig 1a the hydraulic parameters in this second experiment were also based on cai et al 2018 however the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the subsoil k s 2 was changed from 0 0004 cm min 1 reported by cai et al 2018 to 0 04 cm min 1 because it had to be larger than the infiltration rate of 0 03 cm min 1 to avoid ponding of water at the layer interface for a more realistic synthetic modelling study gaussian noise with zero mean and a standard deviation of 0 1 ns and 0 01 cm3 cm 3 was added to the synthetic travel times and swc data respectively for both the 1 layer and the 2 layer model 2 5 3 automatic picking of the first arrival time the implementation of the coupled inversion approach requires an automatic picking of the first arrival time for the simulated gpr data the first arrival time can be automatically determined using an amplitude threshold to obtain this threshold the excitation moment t s of the simulated data was determined from the onset of the source wavelet the source wavelet is defined as the first derivative of the gaussian waveform 10 i 2 ζ e 1 2 ζ e ζ t χ 2 t χ where ζ 2 π 2 f 2 and χ 1 f i is the electric current density a m 2 e is the natural logarithm and f is the center frequency of the antenna 200 mhz from this source wavelet a t s of 1 62 ns was manually determined fig 3 a subsequently an air wave was simulated using antennas positioned at 0 1 m above the ground surface fig 3b with the known propagation velocity in air 0 3 m ns 1 and the antenna separation 0 75 m the true travel time of the air wave is 2 5 ns the appropriate amplitude threshold 0 0158 v m 1 was then determined from the amplitude of the simulated air wave at the travel time of 4 12 ns which is the sum of t s 1 62 ns and true travel time of the air wave 2 5 ns to verify the robustness of the automatic first arrival time determination a synthetic infiltration induced swc profile was generated by hydrus 1d fig 3c and zop measurements were simulated using gprmax3d at different depths the amplitude threshold of 0 0158 v m 1 was used to determine the first arrival time fig 3d it was found that the amplitude of the traces rapidly increased after the determined first arrival time which confirms the robustness of automatic procedure for the determination of the first arrival time 2 6 uncertainty analysis proper quantification of uncertainty in the estimated soil hydraulic parameters is of great importance given that the information content of soil water content measurements for the estimation of soil hydraulic properties depends on the initial and boundary conditions during the experiment mboh et al 2011 in this study we used both response surface analysis toorman et al 1992 and a simple first order approximation kool and parker 1988 kuczera and mroczkowski 1998 vrugt and dane 2006 to investigate the uncertainty of the inverted hydraulic parameters response surfaces provide a 2d view of the cost function distribution obtained with a grid search in order to obtain such surfaces two hydraulic parameters e g α and n are varied between defined bounds whereas the other hydraulic parameters e g log k s and θ s are fixed at their true or optimized value response surfaces are a robust method to visualize parameter uncertainty and the minimum of the cost function however they commonly require a high computational effort especially in the case of many model parameters i e the 2 layer model therefore this method was only used for the synthetic model study with a 1 layer soil profile a classic first order approximation of parameter uncertainty was also used vrugt and dane 2006 it is based on the covariance matrix c of the optimized hydraulic parameters which is calculated by 11 c s 2 j t j 1 where s 2 is the error variance between simulated and observed data and j is the jacobian matrix the jacobian matrix is the first order partial derivative of the cost function for each inverted hydraulic parameter and was obtained using a finite difference approach the marginal posterior distribution of the estimated hydraulic parameters m est is assumed to be a multivariate normal distribution n m est c the uncertainty of the estimated hydraulic parameters can be approximated by the confidence interval for a given level i e 99 of significance calculated from the diagonal elements of c a matrix a that provides the correlation between the estimated hydraulic parameters can be obtained by dividing the elements of c with the square root of the diagonal elements of c 12 a ij c ij c ii 1 2 c jj 1 2 this first order approximation is an efficient way for estimating the uncertainty of the estimated hydraulic parameters for linear or nearly linear hydrologic models and the correlation matrix is a useful indicator of parameter correlation zhu and mohanty 2003 if the hydrological model is highly non linear the first order approximation may be unreliable therefore we only focus on a ij values larger than 0 6 in our analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthetic infiltration experiments the simulated vertical swc profiles at times where gpr measurements were obtained are shown in fig 4 for the synthetic modelling study with a 1 layer soil it can be seen that the infiltration front moved down to 0 6 and 1 2 m depth after the first and second infiltration event respectively after the third infiltration event the entire soil profile was saturated because of the high saturation after the third infiltration event the infiltration front moved rapidly downward through the entire soil profile during infiltration events 4 and 5 the swc estimates obtained from the first arrival time of simulated horizontal borehole gpr measurements using a straight wave approximation are also shown in fig 4b it was found that swc estimates obtained from gpr measurements at shallow depth 0 0 2 m and near the infiltration front underestimated the actual swc fig 4b and 4c this is attributed to the interference of the direct wave with critical refractions generated at the air soil interface and the infiltration front where the dielectric permittivity changes sharply rucker and ferré 2004a for this reason horizontal borehole gpr measurements at 0 1 m depth were previously not considered for swc estimation klotzsche et al 2019a in the synthetic study these data were also not used in the sequential inversion to reduce this interpretation error unfortunately errors in swc estimates near the infiltration front cannot be simply identified and eliminated and thus are expected to affect the estimated hydraulic parameters obtained with the sequential inversion approach for the coupled inversion the effect of the air soil interface is considered in the simulation of gpr wave propagation and therefore there is no need to remove the measurement at 0 1 m depth however the information content with respect to the soil hydraulic properties is expected to be limited for these measurements because of the limited travel path length in the topsoil 3 1 1 response surfaces for the 1 layer soil profile fig 5 a presents the response surface based on true swc data that would be obtained using point measurements i e tdr at the same depth as the borehole gpr measurements the corresponding response surfaces for the noise free coupled inversion of the synthetic gpr data are shown in fig 5b it can be seen that the cost functions for point and gpr measurements have a very similar misfit distribution this is not unexpected given that point and gpr measurements provide a similar type of information albeit with a different sampling volume klotzsche et al 2019a the response surfaces can be used to gain insight in the expected parameter uncertainty in the case of the α parameter the response surfaces for n α θ r α and θ s α indicate that changes in the cost function are parallel to the α axis this suggests that the α parameter is independent from the other parameters although a clear minimum in the cost function value can be observed in these three surfaces it is also elongated in the direction of the α axis suggesting that the α parameter is expected to be less constrained in the inversion results compared to the other model parameters according to the response surfaces for θ s n and θ s log k s estimates of θ s are expected to be correlated with the estimates of n and log k s in the vicinity of the global minimum the response surface is almost perpendicular to the θ s axis and steep which suggests that θ s estimates are well constrained during inversion the global minimum in the response surface between log k s and n is positioned in an elongated valley a strong negative correlation between the parameter estimates for log k s and n is thus expected which implies that the gpr measurements may not contain sufficient information to simultaneously constrain both log k s and n 3 1 2 inversion results for the 1 layer soil profile sequential and coupled inversions were performed using noisy simulated gpr measurements for the 1 layer soil profile in the case of the sequential inversion the fitted swc data showed a large misfit with the expected swc fig 6 a particularly for the shallow depths 0 2 m this is also reflected in the large cost function value 0 05 cm3 cm 3 for the optimized parameters which is much higher than the added uncertainty in the swc data 0 01 cm3 cm 3 additionally the swc profiles simulated by using the estimated parameters from the sequential inversion showed large deviation with the swc profiles from the true forward model fig 7 a due to the poor fit to the data the hydraulic parameters were not accurately estimated by the sequential inversion table 3 in particular θ s was strongly underestimated and this resulted in a large mismatch between the inverted and true water retention curves fig 8 a moreover the estimated value for k s was at the lower boundary of the feasible parameter space 0 035 cm min 1 which is almost equal to the infiltration rate the n and α parameters were also overestimated which resulted in a large difference between the inverted and true relative hydraulic conductivity function fig 8b as detailed above sequential inversion of zop data may lead to erroneous estimates of hydraulic parameters if strong vertical gradients in swc are present e g infiltration induced gradients in the case of the parameters estimated from coupled inversion the simulated travel time fitted the known travel time from the true model well fig 6b as expressed by the low rmse of 0 1 ns also the simulated swc profiles matched well the swc profiles from the true model fig 7a it should be noted that the coupled inversion was ended when the cost function value decreased to the standard deviation of the gaussian noise 0 1 ns table 3 to avoid overfitting therefore the data simulated with the inverted model parameters have the same rmse as the noise free data and the simulated travel times based on the inverted parameters also match well with the noise free data the values for θ s and α were accurately estimated by coupled inversion table 3 however the estimated values for n and log k s showed a slight deviation from the true model likely because of the strong correlation between these two parameters the accurate estimation of the hydraulic parameters is also reflected in the good match between the estimated and known water retention and relative hydraulic conductivity function fig 8a 8b the first order uncertainty estimates for the coupled inversion are presented in table 3 and the associated correlation matrix of the estimated hydraulic parameters is given in table 4 the results indicate a strong negative correlation for log k s n and weak correlations between other pairs of hydraulic parameters this is consistent with the results of the response surface analysis and confirms that the first order approximation provides a meaningful assessment of parameter uncertainty 3 1 3 inversion results for the 2 layer soil profile in a next step the synthetic modelling study for the two layer soil profile was analyzed as expected from the results of the 1 layer soil profile the parameters estimated using sequential inversion deviated considerably from the true hydraulic parameters table 3 and the estimated and true water retention fig 8c 8e and relative hydraulic conductivity functions did not match well fig 8d 8f hence sequential inversion will not be considered for the analysis of the actual field measurements the results of the coupled inversion for the 2 layer soil profile generally were consistent with the results of the 1 layer profile despite the dimensional expansion of the search space from four to eight parameters again the estimated travel times from coupled inversion results nicely fitted the noisy synthetic travel time series fig 9 and the vertical swc profiles from the true model fig 7b in addition accurate hydraulic parameter estimates were obtained table 3 as also confirmed by the minor differences in estimated and true water retention fig 8c 8e and relative hydraulic conductivity functions fig 8d 8f 3 2 inversion of experimental gpr data coupled inversion was used to estimate the hydraulic parameters from the measured horizontal borehole gpr data shown in fig 10 the resulting fit to the measured data is also shown in fig 10 and the estimated soil hydraulic parameters are provided in table 5 for comparison the simulated data using the hydraulic parameters of cai et al 2018 are also provided which are based on long term tdr measurements also made during vegetation periods the comparison between measured and simulated travel times showed a good correspondence at 0 1 m depth both for the inverted hydraulic parameters and the parameters from cai et al 2018 fig 10 for 0 2 m depth the measured gpr travel times steadily increased during the entire infiltration experiment whereas the simulated travel times using both sets of hydraulic parameters remained constant after the second infiltration event because the soil reached saturation this can be explained by the heterogeneous nature of the topsoil which is supported by the large spatial variation of the gpr travel time data for the subsoil the key features of the measured time lapse gpr data were well captured by the coupled inversion also considering the spatial variability in the measured gpr data the simulated travel time data based on the hydraulic parameters of cai et al 2018 did not match the observed gpr data well in the subsoil i e at 0 6 0 8 and 1 2 m depth this is attributed to the small k s 2 used in cai et al 2018 which results in a slow movement of the infiltration front in the subsoil fig 11 and therefore a reduced variation in simulated water content at large depths measured and inverted gpr travel time data are directly compared in fig 12 the use of the hydraulic parameters from cai et al 2018 clearly resulted in a systematic underestimation of the measured data and a relatively high rmse of 0 43 ns the hydraulic parameters obtained using coupled inversion better matched the measured travel time data as indicated by the lower rmse 0 32 ns and a higher r2 value 0 90 nevertheless the rmse between inverted and measured gpr data is still relatively large this is partly attributed to the heterogeneity of the topsoil as the measurements at 0 2 m depth make up a considerable part of the observed misfit furthermore there is uncertainty in the initial swc profile which is solely based on gpr measurements at six different depths here extrapolation from the shallowest borehole to the soil surface is problematic and may have introduced some degree of uncertainty finally there is intrinsic uncertainty in the field gpr measurements and data processing such as the uncertainty in the position of the horizontal boreholes and the uncertainty in the determination of the time zero or first arrival time of measured gpr data these issues obviously did not affect the coupled inversion in the synthetic case study but they are highly relevant for the inversion of actual field measurements the results of the first order uncertainty estimation of the inverted hydraulic parameters are provided in table 5 the uncertainty of α and θ s are comparable for the top and subsoil whereas n and log k s showed a larger uncertainty for the subsoil this can be explained by the strong negative correlation a 0 615 between n 2 and log k s 2 table 6 all other pairs of hydraulic parameters did not show strong correlations fig 13 presents the water retention and relative hydraulic conductivity functions obtained using coupled inversion the associated uncertainty was obtained by randomly plotting 100 sets of hydraulic parameters drawn from the uncertainty bounds provided in table 5 as can be seen from the uncertainty bounds θ s is associated with a relatively low uncertainty whereas the n value is associated with a larger uncertainty as indicated by the increasing spread of the functions at lower pressure heads furthermore uncertainty in the water retention function is similar for the top and subsoil fig 13a 13c for comparison the functions based on the hydraulic parameters of cai et al 2018 were also provided the water retention function obtained using coupled inversion clearly deviated from that of cai et al 2018 which showed a faster decrease of water content with matric potential due to the larger n value additionally a lower θ s was estimated by the coupled inversion the hydraulic conductivity functions obtained using coupled inversion also showed a similar uncertainty for the top and subsoil fig 13b 13d for the topsoil the hydraulic conductivity function obtained using coupled inversion corresponded well with the function obtained in cai et al 2018 this is at least partly due to the similarity in the inverted k s obtained in this study and in cai et al 2018 however there are obvious differences in the hydraulic conductivity functions for the subsoil due to differences in estimated k s there is a range of possible explanations for the observed differences first the estimation of k s is known to be scale dependent for example laboratory methods using small sample volumes often lead to lower k s compared to estimates from in situ measurement from a larger soil volume busch et al 2013 rovey and cherkauer 1995 the results of cai et al 2018 were based on tdr measurement that only cover a small areal fraction of the rhizotron facility whereas the gpr measurements represent a larger volume klotzsche et al 2019a thus a higher k s is perhaps expected for the gpr measurements since the importance of preferential flow in macropores likely increased from the tdr to the gpr scale the analysis presented here also indicated potential parameter correlations between k s and n since larger n values were reported by cai et al 2018 this may explain the small k s values it is also important to note that cai et al 2018 estimated hydraulic parameters with a more complex model set up that considered root water uptake in particular root water uptake parameters were estimated alongside the hydraulic parameters which might have hampered the correct estimation of the soil hydraulic parameters and likely increased the uncertainty in the estimated hydraulic parameters obtained by cai et al 2018 finally it is important to note that cai et al 2018 assumed free drainage as a lower boundary condition whereas a seepage face was used in this study 4 summary and conclusions in this study we used both sequential and coupled inversion strategies to estimate hydraulic parameters from horizontal borehole gpr measurements during an infiltration experiment first a synthetic modelling study was set up to compare the two inversion approaches independent of measurement and model errors in a noise free synthetic study using a 1 layer soil profile a response surface analysis was used to evaluate correlation between hydraulic parameters the results showed that the hydraulic parameters n and log k s were strongly correlated which implies that the gpr measurements were not able to simultaneously constrain log k s and n in a next step synthetic swc and travel time data with added noise were used to estimate hydraulic parameters using sequential and coupled inversion approaches respectively it was observed that a sequential inversion approach relying on the conventional straight ray approximation to estimate swc did not provide accurate hydraulic parameter estimates if strong vertical gradients in swc were present due to infiltration the coupled inversion approach which combined 3d modelling of gpr measurements with a 1d vadose zone flow model was able to provide accurate estimates of the hydraulic parameters both for a 1 layer and a 2 layer soil profile because interpretation errors associated with the straight ray approximation were avoided in a final step horizontal borehole gpr measurements made during an infiltration experiment were inverted using a coupled inversion approach the estimated hydraulic parameters were reasonably consistent with water retention and relative hydraulic conductivity functions reported by cai et al 2018 for the same site in conclusion the coupled inversion of horizontal borehole gpr measurements provided accurate field scale estimates of soil hydraulic parameters because of the larger sampling volume compared to point sensors the estimated hydraulic parameters are expected to have an improved field representativeness in future studies coupled inversion of horizontal borehole gpr data may be used to estimate 2d and perhaps even 3d distributions of soil hydraulic parameters by considering all measured travel times over the profile although this will obviously be associated with a higher computational effort a disadvantage of the proposed approach is that gpr measurements are still taken manually and are thus time consuming whereas point sensors often allow automated data acquisition as an alternative to gpr other geophysical methods such as ert can also be employed to estimate hydraulic parameters ert can investigate the subsurface with high resolution and data acquisition can be automated however the electrical conductivity distribution obtained with ert is not only sensitive to swc but also depends on several other factors e g clay content pore water salinity binley et al 2015 this can complicate vadose zone model parameterization using ert measurements considerably it would be interesting to extend coupled inversion by considering the full gpr waveform instead of solely using travel time information as was recently proposed for seismic data by li et al 2020 it is expected that this would increase the information content of the gpr measurements in the inversion and therefore reduce uncertainty in the estimated hydraulic parameters and provide chances to estimate hydraulic properties of multi layer soils
