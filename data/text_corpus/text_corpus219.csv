1095,greenhouse gas emissions from the three gorges reservoir tgr have received an increasing amount of attention in recent years because of concerns related to regional climate change and clean energy production the present study compared the greenhouse gas emissions from the modaoxi and shennongxi rivers as the southern and northern tributaries of the tgr results indicated that mean annual fluxes of carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 were 55 8950 92 9469mgm 2 h 1 and 0 2544 0 9066mgm 2 h 1 along the shennongxi river and 77 0298 168 8724mgm 2 h 1 and 0 2694 1 1006mgm 2 h 1 along the modaoxi river respectively while more co2 was released along the modaoxi river the methane emissions were similar for these two tributaries multivariate analysis indicated that water quality variables were more closely correlated with co2 emissions along the shennongxi river than along the modaoxi conversely methane emissions were more closely correlated with water quality variables along the modaoxi river than along the shennongxi carbon emissions in these two tributaries were mainly affected by inorganic carbon in the water organic carbon in the water had almost no effect on carbon emissions in these two tributaries further analysis showed that eutrophication and algal blooms may generate the largest amounts of greenhouse gas emissions from the shennongxi river basin while farming and carbon input from the drawdown area may be the crucial factors affecting carbon emissions in the modaoxi river basin keywords three gorges reservoir greenhouse gas emissions from reservoir spatial and temporal variation modaoxi river shennongxi river 1 introduction with the changing global climate and rising air temperatures greenhouse gas concentrations have received an increasing amount of attention over the past several decades cubasch et al 2013 the carbon cycle in inland waters such as rivers ran et al 2015 gómez gener et al 2016 huang et al 2017 lakes huttunen et al 2003 duan et al 2005 podgrajsek et al 2014 jammet et al 2016 chuang et al 2017 ponds downing et al 2006 xiao et al 2014 reservoirs louis et al 2000 guérin et al 2007 demarty et al 2009 guérin and abril 2015 wetlands richey et al 2002 wang et al 2009 and other aquatic ecosystems krauss et al 2016 plays a very important role in the exchange of greenhouse gases between the atmosphere and the terrestrial ecosystems in the carbon cycle in particular allochthonous and autochthonous carbon in water moves from the land to the ocean or atmosphere by surface runoff or ground baseflow in river network systems ran et al 2013 neres lima et al 2017 river network systems are very important for carbon delivery as an indispensable exchange channel among terrestrial oceanic and atmospheric systems although carbon in inland water does not account for a very large proportion of the carbon in the global carbon cycle barros et al 2011 vihermaa et al 2016 the intrinsic carbon transportation model in rivers has been modified by the construction of numerous dams li et al 2015 reservoirs were originally designed and built for flood control hydropower irrigation fisheries and other reasons to support improved economic development moreover hydropower was recommended as a kind of clean energy in comparison with fossil energy for effectively mitigating greenhouse gas emission in the past but the green credentials of hydropower were doubted due to the inundation of soil and vegetation along the drawdown area of reservoir which will release carbon dioxide and methane emission into the atmosphere giles 2006 chen et al 2009 wang and ai 2010 ometto et al 2013 a large number of studies have previously reported on greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs in recent years these mainly included reservoirs in quebec canada demarty et al 2009 french guiana abril et al 2005 sweden aberg et al 2004 brazil kemenes et al 2011 fearnside 2016 south korea haekyung et al 2009 laos chanudet et al 2011 deshmukh et al 2014 the united states soumis et al 2004 and others in various different climate zones worldwide greenhouse gases are released or absorbed by diffusing from the interface between water and the atmosphere demarty et al 2009 marcelino et al 2015 bubbling from deep water delsontro et al 2010 liu et al 2016a b and degassing from turbines and spillways roehm and tremblay 2006 guérin et al 2006 of hydropower reservoirs previous publications showed that significant amounts of greenhouse gas emissions occur in the first ten years after reservoirs are created tremblay et al 2005 barros et al 2011 barros et al 2011 reported that carbon emissions from reservoirs are remarkably correlated with reservoir age and latitude while the highest carbon emissions occurred over the tropical amazon region based on an analysis of data from 85 hydroelectric reservoirs distributed globally greenhouse gas emissions were highly dependent on the location of newly built hydropower reservoirs in that study however while asia has a large proportion of reservoirs of those on a global scale relatively few reservoirs in asia were included due to the shortage of carbon emission data in that study asia has 60 of the dams reported worldwide and 70 of all asian reservoirs are in china a fact that should not be ignored tremblay et al 2005 in addition one major concern is that many hydropower reservoirs in china were built in canyons especially in the changjiang yangtze river basin reservoirs with little topographical relief produce larger amounts of greenhouse gases per kwh than reservoirs built in canyons where less surface area is flooded during impoundment louis et al 2000 in recent years greenhouse gas emissions from cascaded hydropower reservoirs have been studied throughout the changjiang river basin in china yang et al 2014 monthly and seasonal variations of greenhouse gas fluxes and carbon in surface water have been analyzed from cascaded reservoirs throughout the maotiao and qingjiang river basins the danjiangkou and xinanjiang reservoirs wang et al 2011a 2009 2015b li and zhang 2014 zhao et al 2014 2017a 2017b the spatial distribution of greenhouse gas emissions was also analyzed along the mainstream changjiang xiangxi and pengxi rivers of the three gorges reservoir tgr in recent years chen et al 2009 wang et al 2011b zhao et al 2012 xiao et al 2013a yang et al 2013 li et al 2013 li et al 2014 huang et al 2015 hao et al 2017 yang et al 2012 xiao et al 2013b nevertheless all data related to greenhouse gas emissions from the tgr have currently been obtained from the mainstream changjiang river and its northern tributaries greenhouse gas emissions from the southern tributaries of the tgr have not been yet published in the literature therefore the dynamic patterns of carbon emissions from the southern tributary of the tgr should be measured and documented for an overall understanding of total greenhouse gas emissions from the tgr in the present study the southern and northern tributaries of the tgr the modaoxi and shennongxi rivers respectively were selected to compare the temporal and spatial variations in greenhouse gas emissions monthly synchronous measurements of diffusive fluxes of carbon dioxide co2 and methane from the interface between water and air were carried out along the two tributaries from january to december 2016 meanwhile water quality variables dissolved organic carbon in surface water and meteorological parameters also were obtained to analyze and identify factors controlling greenhouse gas emissions carbon emission fluxes and parameters influencing those emissions were compared from the modaoxi river tributary with from the shennongxi river tributary overall the aims of the present study were 1 to obtain the temporal and spatial variations in co2 and methane fluxes from the modaoxi and shennongxi rivers on the southern and northern banks of the tgr respectively 2 to compare the differences in carbon emissions from the above two tributaries 3 to identify the main factors controlling the dynamic changes in carbon emissions from these two tributaries 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the tgr represents the world s largest multipurpose hydropower project developed for flood control power generation and navigation this reservoir controls a drainage area of 1millionkm2 with average annual streamflow of 451billionm3 the water level initially peaked at 175ma s l at the end of october 2010 the mainstream of the changjiang river flows for 145km from the shennongxi to modaoxi rivers fig 1 the confluence of the shennongxi river lies 75km upstream from the dam and its main channel length of 60km makes it the larger first level tributary to the tgr the watershed of this river experiences a subtropical monsoon climate with relatively high air temperature and humidity the confluence of the modaoxi river lies 220km upstream from the dam and its main channel length of 191km also makes it a first level tributary of the reservoir this river drains an area of 1482km2 with mean annual streamflow of 27 6m3 s annual mean precipitation of 1201 5mm and annual mean evaporation of 994 5mm the modaoxi river watershed lies in the same subtropical climate zone and is affected by the southeastern monsoon principally 2 2 sampling design diffusive fluxes of co2 and methane were routinely measured along both the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers for 15th to 20th times each month in 2016 five sampling points were selected along the shennongxi river at louping pingyangba longchuanhe outlet and badong mainstream meanwhile five sampling points were selected along the modaoxi river at zhongduishan pu an xinjin outlet and yunyang mainstream among these points louping and xinjinare were located in the drawdown area of the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers respectively in the present study diffusive fluxes of co2 and methane were measured using a floating chamber in addition picarro g2301 co2 ch4 h2o analyzer picarro inc santa clara ca usa was used to gauge changes in the concentrations of co2 and methane in the floating chamber fluxes were measured for 15min at each point to obtain the slope of the change in co2 and methane concentrations in a reversed floating chamber the sampling frequency of the picarro g2301 analyzer was set to 1s to improve the simulation of the linear change of atmospheric concentrations in the chamber water quality variables such as water temperature dissolved oxygen content conductivity ph and chlorophyll a content were measured online by a hydrolab ds5 multi parameter analyzer hach loveland co usa water transparency was measured using a secchi disk wind speed air temperature air pressure relative humidity and other meteorological parameters were also obtained by a kestrel portable automatic weather system nielsen kellerman boothwyn pa usa at the same time moreover air temperature and atmosphere pressure in the floating chamber were detected to estimate fluxes of co2 and methane by a handheld digital thermometer jm 624 jinming instrument co ltd tianjin china water samples were collected at each site using 500ml brown glass bottles these were taken to the laboratory for measurements within 48h water samples were analyzed using a vario toc analyzer elementar inc hanau germany after samples had been filtered using glass fiber filter paper in the laboratory total dissolved carbon tc total inorganic carbon tic and dissolved organic carbon doc concentration in surface water were attained from samples collected at each point each year water fills the tgr from september to next april to meet the needs of hydropower generation then water held for flood control is released in summer starting at the end of april each year the cuntan three gorges and yichang hydrological stations were selected as typical stations to represent typical areas such as the backwater area before the dam and downstream respectively hydrological data of three hydrological stations was collected from china three gorges corporation who was in charge of management of the tgr in this paper the temporal variation of water level and streamflow at these three hydrological stations recorded on an hourly scale from january to december 2016 is documented in supplemental information each year water fills the tgr from september to next april to meet the needs of hydropower generation then water held for flood control is released in summer starting at the end of april each year the cuntan three gorges and yichang hydrological stations were selected as typical stations to represent typical areas such as the backwater area before the dam and downstream respectively hydrological data of three hydrological stations was collected from china three gorges corporation who was in charge of management of the tgr in this paper the temporal variation of water level and streamflow at these three hydrological stations recorded on an hourly scale from january to december 2016 is documented in supplemental information 2 3 flux estimation carbon fluxes were calculated based on the linear regression slope of change in co2 and methane concentrations in a reversed floating chamber using eq 1 as following goldenfum 2010 1 flux mg m 2 h 1 slope ppv s 1 f 1 f 2 chamber volume m 3 chamber surface m 2 where f 1 is a conversion factor from ppm to mgm 3 under the standard temperature and pressure for greenhouse gas in the atmosphere 2 f 1 gas conc mg m 3 gas conc ppv molecular weight g

experiments the molecular weights of co2 and methane are 44 and 16 respectively next f 2 a conversion factor from seconds to hours was calculated using eq 3 3 f 2 60 min 60 s 3600 sh 1 2 4 data analysis methods statistical analyses were performed to compare the differences in greenhouse gas fluxes water quality carbon concentrations in surface water and meteorological parameters between the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers in this study the minimum mean and maximum values were used to describe the changes in the range of variables measured and described above in addition the error and sample dispersion or extent of variation was expressed by standard deviations sd and coefficients of variation cv respectively a boxplot was created using r language to understand the temporal and spatial variation of carbon fluxes and environmental variables along the two tributaries canonical correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between carbon emissions and environmental variables along the two tributaries of the tgr in addition correlation matrixes of fluxes of co2 and methane with environmental variables were created using r language to explore the factors controlling these fluxes along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers 3 results 3 1 monthly variation of co2 and methane fluxes along the two tributaries monthly variation of the mean fluxes of co2 and methane was documented along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers fig 2 overall more co2 was emitted than absorbed along the two tributaries during most months in 2016 in june alone more co2 was absorbed than emitted with a monthly mean flux of 34 316 163 924mgm 2 h 1 along the shennongxi river more co2 was released along the modaoxi river than the shennongxi river in most months for the shennongxi river the highest co2 emissions were found in october 2016 with monthly mean fluxes of 142 2670 40 2110mgm 2 h 1 monthly mean fluxes of co2 were about 30 0mgm 2 h 1 from march to september even though the co2 flux converted into an absorbed status in june along the shennongxi river however cvs were very interestingly higher in months with relatively low co2 emissions carbon dioxide emissions displayed gradual decreasing trend in the first half of 2016 but rose sharply from july to december in the latter half of the year for the modaoxi river the highest co2 emissions also occurred in october 2016 with monthly mean fluxes of 182 8469 159 2320mgm 2 h 1 comparatively the lowest co2 emissions appeared in march 2016 with monthly mean fluxes of only 0 344 31 443mgm 2 h 1 overall the trends in the temporal variation of co2 fluxes along the modaoxi river were less obvious than along the shennongxi river higher co2 emissions were observed in winter from october to december and in january 2016 the monthly mean co2 fluxes were above 100mgm 2 h 1 in all months of winter in summary the cvs of monthly mean co2 fluxes were lower in months when higher co2 emissions occurred along the modaoxi river monthly mean methane fluxes above the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers showed that more methane was emitted than absorbed along these two tributaries in most months of 2016 fig 2 the two rivers only absorbed methane in april and december with monthly mean fluxes of 0 9321 1 5400mgm 2 h 1 and 1 6960 0 8100mgm 2 h 1 along the modaoxi river respectively overall methane emissions rose from january to may and then decreased until december 2016 along the shennongxi river unlike the temporal variation of co2 emissions methane emissions were higher in summer and lower in winter and autumn however methane was emitted in all months of 2016 along the shennongxi river while the highest methane emissions occurred in may with monthly mean fluxes of 1 4405 2 8527mgm 2 h 1 in addition the highest cv of monthly mean fluxes of methane was observed in may 2016 with a value of 2 8527mgm 2 h 1 which illustrated the notable temporal variation of methane emissions in this month in addition higher cvs were observed with higher methane emissions in months along the shennongxi river methane was relatively weakly absorbed in some months along the modaoxi river however higher methane emissions occurred in the relatively moist and hot climate in summer along the modaoxi river which was analogous with findings along the shennongxi river the highest methane emissions appeared in august with a monthly mean flux of 1 7699 2 1480mgm 2 h 1 while the lowest methane emissions were found in march with a monthly mean flux of only 0 0333 0 0290mgm 2 h 1 3 2 seasonal variation of co2 and methane fluxes along the two tributaries the seasonal variation of mean fluxes of co2 was greater along the modaoxi river than along the shennongxi river fig 3 for all seasons overall greater amounts of co2 emissions occurred in autumn and winter than in other seasons along both tributaries of the tgr in detail the mean annual co2 flux reached 55 8950 92 9469mgm 2 h 1 along the shennongxi river and 77 0298 168 8724mgm 2 h 1 along the modaoxi river for the shennongxi river the highest and lowest co2 emissions appeared in autumn and summer with mean fluxes of 96 3509 71 3629mgm 2 h 1 and 12 2027 137 1604mgm 2 h 1 respectively moreover higher co2 emissions were observed in autumn and winter when seasonal mean fluxes were very similar to each other at about 90 0mgm 2 h 1 although the lowest co2 emissions occurred in summer the coefficient of variation peaked in the summer of 2016 indicating the most remarkable temporal and spatial variation of co2 emissions occurred at this time in spring lower emissions and higher coefficients of variation occurred with mean fluxes of 24 1731 71 2265mgm 2 h 1 and with a cv of 2 9465 for the modaoxi river the highest co2 emissions appeared in winter with a diffusive flux of 122 0024 135 8769mgm 2 h 1 while the cv of co2 fluxes was very small in winter specifically the lowest co2 emissions occurred in summer with a flux of 28 1689 187 8897mgm 2 h 1 in the entire year therefore much more temporal and spatial heterogeneity was observed for co2 emissions in spring and in summer despite the fact that seasonal mean fluxes were lower at this time the seasonal variation of methane fluxes fig 3 obviously revealed that more methane was released along the modaoxi river than the shennongxi river in summer while less methane was emitted along the modaoxi river than the shennongxi river in spring moreover the annual mean fluxes of methane along the two tributaries showed little difference overall the difference of methane fluxes between along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers was larger in spring and summer than in autumn and winter the methane emission along the shennongxi river appeared more noticeably in the autumn and winter than in other seasons of 2016 however higher methane emission was found in spring and summer methane emission peaked noticeably with a mean flux of 0 5425 1 6637mgm 2 h 1 and the temporal and spatial variation with its cv reached 3 0670 most prominently in spring as revealed in the comparison of cvs of co2 and methane fluxes methane emission had a more notable temporal and spatial variation than co2 emission along the shennongxi river therefore the seasonal and spatial variation of methane emission displayed very differently from carbon dioxide emission along the shennongxi river which is in particular true during the impoundment periods in autumn and winter the seasonal variation of methane emission was more complex along the modaoxi river than the shennongxi river methane emission peaked in summer with a flux of 1 1112 1 6235mgm 2 h 1 while it hit the bottom in autumn with a flux of 0 2 0 3587mgm 2 h 1 along the modaoxi river in contrast methane were absorbed with fluxes of 0 1707 1 0191mgm 2 h 1 and 0 0630 0 4596mgm 2 h 1 in spring and winter respectively to sum up seasonal mean methane fluxes were inversely proportional to seasonal mean co2 fluxes in terms of cv along the modaoxi river 3 3 spatial distribution of co2 and methane along the two tributaries the spatial distribution of fluxes of co2 and methane along the two tributaries is shown in fig 4 carbon dioxide was emitted at most points along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers with the exception of pingyangba point along the shennongxi river carbon dioxide emissions increased from louping point to outlet point along the shennongxi river fig 4 the highest co2 emissions occurred at outlet point with mean fluxes of 84 9962 62 2600mgm 2 h 1 while co2 emissions were lowest at louping point with mean fluxes of 20 5101 68 4410mgm 2 h 1 compared with the points along the shennongxi river co2 showed obviously higher emissions with a mean flux of 144 7340 64 9190mgm 2 h 1 at the badong mainstream point of the changjiang river moreover more co2 was absorbed than emitted with a mean flux of 16 476 100 257mgm 2 h 1 at pingyangba point which was located in the drawdown area of the tgr for the modaoxi river the highest co2 emissions occurred at the yunyang mainstream point with mean fluxes of 325 1273 185 8601mgm 2 h 1 and the lowest cv of co2 fluxes appeared at this point with a cv of 0 572 only more co2 was emitted than absorbed at most points except at zhongduishan point carbon dioxide emissions increased from pu an point to outlet point and yunyang mainstream point gradually more co2 was absorbed than emitted only at zhongduishan point which was located in the upstream portion of the modaoxi river with a mean flux of 21 894 92 112mgm 2 h 1 the lowest co2 emissions occurred at xinjin point with mean fluxes of 0 309 40 423mgm 2 h 1 however the cv of the mean co2 flux was highest at xinjin point with a cv of 130 747 the spatial distribution of methane emissions from louping point to the badong mainstream was apparently opposite to that of co2 emissions along the shennongxi river fig 4 overall methane was emitted at all points although methane fluxes decreased gradually from the upstream to outlet point and badong mainstream point the highest methane emissions occurred at louping point with mean fluxes of 0 9366 1 9171mgm 2 h 1 while the highest cv 2 046 was also found at this point the lowest methane emissions occurred at outlet point with a mean flux of 0 036 0 03mgm 2 h 1 and the lowest cv 0 838 was also found at this point for the modaoxi river methane was emitted at all points except for xinjin point where mean fluxes of methane were 0 192 0 719mgm 2 h 1 fig 4 methane fluxes were below 0 6mgm 2 h 1 at all points where more methane was released than absorbed the highest and lowest methane emissions appeared at pu an and zhongduishan points with mean fluxes of 0 5938 1 5790mgm 2 h 1 and 0 2130 1 6320mgm 2 h 1 respectively however the highest cv for methane mean fluxes 7 659 occurred at zhongduishan point which exhibited a relatively strong monthly variation of mean methane flux at this point methane emissions at yunyang point were more than at badong point and the latter being located in the mainstream of the changjiang river 3 4 co2 and methane variation under different hydrological dynamic along the two tributaries during measurement periods the effects of the impoundment and changes in water level on the greenhouse gas emissions were evaluated for the northern and southern tributaries specifically water is typically released in april while a lower water level is maintained until september each year as indicated in supplemental information a year is divided into two periods the low and high water level periods in 2016 the low water level period began in april and ended in september while the high water period included the other months during measurement periods the effects of the impoundment and changes in water level on the greenhouse gas emissions were evaluated for the northern and southern tributaries specifically water is typically released in april while a lower water level is maintained until september each year as indicated in supplemental information a year is divided into two periods the low and high water level periods in 2016 the low water level period began in april and ended in september while the high water period included the other months the mean co2 and methane fluxes varied during the periods of low and high water along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers table 1 more co2 was released during stable periods of high water for both tributaries of the tgr moreover the modaoxi river emitted greater amounts of co2 than the shennongxi river regardless of changes in water level releases of co2 were 65 44mgm 2 h 1 higher in the high water period than with low water along the modaoxi river table 1 the methane fluxes along the modaoxi river and shennongxi rivers were very close to each other during periods of both low and high water however more methane was released during low water than during high water while more co2 was released during high water than during low water along the two tributaries methane releases were ten times higher during low water than during high water along the southern and northern tributaries of the tgr 3 5 environmental variables along the two tributaries according to the temporal variation of environment variables yearly water temperature and ph were very similar along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers however remarkable differences were observed between the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers in terms of dissolved oxygen do conductivity chlorophyll a and water transparency specifically the largest difference among water quality variables appeared in the chlorophyll a concentration along these two tributaries especially in spring chlorophyll a concentration had much larger mean values of 8 8438μg l and 3 2209μg l along these two rivers respectively in addition the water transparency of two tributaries could not be ignored with mean annual values of 2 2067m and 1 7444m and especially seasonally mean values of 4 60m and 3 12m in winter along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers respectively however the total inorganic carbon and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were insignificantly different between these two tributaries the mean annual total inorganic carbon concentration was 24 9663mg l and 23 6815mg l along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers respectively moreover larger differences in dissolved organic carbon content were observed between the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers with mean annual concentrations of 1 8548mg l and 2 5994mg l respectively this difference was especially obvious in spring when the mean dissolved organic carbon concentration in the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers was 1 8320mg l and 3 0289mg l respectively in summary greater amounts of inorganic carbon were found in the shennongxi river than in the modaoxi river while the latter had greater amounts of organic carbon canonical correlation analysis between greenhouse gas fluxes and water quality variables was carried out using data from along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers fig 5 and table 2 the water quality variables had larger effects on co2 emissions than methane emissions along the two tributaries water quality variables had a stronger effect on co2 emissions along the shennongxi river than along the modaoxi river fig 5 however methane emissions were affected by water quality variables more easily along the modaoxi river than along the shennongxi river moreover methane fluxes there were positively correlated with the chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen content the level of carbon emissions was determined by ph and dissolved oxygen content of water along the shennongxi river while dissolved oxygen conductivity and chlorophyll a in water produced remarkable effects on carbon emissions along the modaoxi river the co2 fluxes were more negatively correlated with ph and dissolved oxygen along the shennongxi river in addition the dissolved oxygen concentration was higher in spring and summer along the shennongxi river than in fall and winter the co2 fluxes from the modaoxi river were more negatively correlated with chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen than in the shennongxi river methane fluxes were positively correlated with ph and water temperature and negatively correlated with conductivity table 2 the results of canonical correlation analysis between carbon emissions and carbon in water are shown in fig 6 the correlation matrix of co2 and methane fluxes with carbon in water along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers are also shown in table 2 multivariate statistical analysis indicated that carbon in water more strongly and obviously influenced carbon emissions from the modaoxi river than from the shennongxi river canonical correlation analysis also basically showed that carbon emissions along the two tributaries were affected by inorganic carbon in water organic carbon in water had little effect on the carbon emissions along the two tributaries no obvious relationship was found between co2 and methane fluxes with the carbon content of water along the shennongxi river however methane fluxes were negatively correlated with the inorganic carbon content of water with a correlation coefficient of 0 6154 along the modaoxi river in addition co2 fluxes were not correlated with organic or inorganic carbon in water along the modaoxi river 4 discussion 4 1 effects of hydrological dynamics on greenhouse gas emissions the tgr plays a very important role in flood control along the changjiang river basin in china the water level in the reservoir falls every year as flood waters are slowly released to prepare the next round of volume from rainstorms each summer although more co2 was released along the modaoxi river than the shennongxi river changes in water level affected co2 emissions more strongly along the shennongxi river than the modaoxi river this may have occurred since the modaoxi river has a much longer main channel and larger basin area than the shennongxi river allowing the modaoxi river to transport and accumulate more organic matter into its water body from terrestrial vegetation and soil this finding could be validated by the difference in doc between these two rivers table 1 overall the doc along the modaoxi was higher than along the shennongxi despite any changes in water level however the doc was higher during low water than during high water along both of these tributaries generally periods of low water occurred during spring and summer while high water arrived in autumn and winter in the tgr more vegetation or phytoplankton was present in spring and summer during periods of low water which could contribute to higher chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen concentrations in water during this period according to the literature goldenfum 2010 tremblay et al 2005 barros et al 2011 methane is only released in an anaerobic environment but less methane was produced during high water in autumn and winter along the two tributaries an anaerobic environment occurred easily under high water conditions with deeper water and slower waterflow velocity the water level fluctuated from 145m to 175m each year while the mean water depth increased from 30m to 70m in the tgr moreover a relatively high water level behind the dam resulted in slower waterflow and a longer residence time for water in the tgr in addition the high water and slower water flow conditions may cause thermal stratification in the water body in the backwater area therefore as nutrients and organic matter accumulate changes in water temperature and the growth of phytoplankton will affect carbon matter transportation and transfer in the channel system zhang et al 2005 liu et al 2016a wu et al 2018 the present study only measured methane emissions from the interface between water and the atmosphere however most methane may be released as bubbles from deep water and become oxidized into co2 as it gradually ascends in the water column therefore only a small quantity of methane emissions may have been measured using a floating chamber in the present study however effects of impoundment on the methane fluxes were also obvious along the two tributaries 4 2 effects of water quality on greenhouse gas emissions along the two tributaries as mentioned above water quality variables had larger effects on co2 emissions than methane emissions along the two tributaries table 2 generally eutrophication and algal blooms occurred in spring and summer during periods of low water along the shennongxi river plankton produce chlorophyll a and plankton biomass enrichment of the water body can result in eutrophication and algal blooms zhu et al 2012 the average chlorophyll a concentration peaked at 8 19μg l during a period of low water along the shennongxi river the dissolved oxygen concentration in surface water was also highest in spring and summer along this river in addition humans have become more active along the shennongxi river after this tributary was developed as a 5a ranked national tourist sightseeing spot most sightseeing occurs in spring and summer along this tributary however the development of a massive fishery had already been prohibited along the shennongxi river with the goal of reducing nutrient input that could result in eutrophication and algal blooms further analysis indicated that eutrophication and algal blooms often occurred as a result of the longer water residence time relatively high nutrient concentrations and slow water flow velocity in may along the shennongxi river zhu et al 2012 relatively high chlorophyll a concentrations and total carbon content in water probably supported the occurrence of eutrophication and algal blooming in may along the shennongxi river therefore one can conclude that eutrophication and algal blooms maybe impose the largest effects on greenhouse gas emissions from the shennongxi river nutrient and organic matter would gather and accumulate as the water depth increased and water flow velocity decreased along both tributaries of the tgr liu et al 2016b therefore eutrophication has already occurred as a response to nutrient accumulation and increased water temperatures along the shennongxi xiangxi daning and xiaojiang tributaries of the tgr liu et al 2013 interestingly no public reports related to eutrophication of the modaoxi river could be located increased eutrophication and more frequent algal blooms may strongly affect the co2 and methane emissions from the tributaries of the tgr during the processes of photosynthesis and decomposition of phytoplankton and algal qin et al 2018 guo et al 2011 in addition chlorophyll a dissolved oxygen and conductivity were also lower along the modaoxi than the shenongxi river regardless of water level however jiang et al 2017 concluded that conductivity was the major variable that affected eutrophication and algal blooms along the pengxi and modaoxi rivers eutrophication and algal blooms were not the major variable determining the level of greenhouse gas emissions from the modaoxi river in contrast with a higher population and increased amounts of farming activities along the modaoxi river in its larger basin area more vegetation and soil type drawdown area existed along the modaoxi river than the shennongxi river which has a rocky shoreline therefore farming and carbon input from the drawdown area may be the crucial factors for the higher levels of carbon emissions along the modaoxi river 4 3 effects of carbon concentration in water on greenhouse gas emissions along the two tributaries the carbon content of water serves as an important parameter for understanding the nature of co2 and methane emissions from reservoirs since these greenhouse gases are released as a byproduct of decomposition and are involved in the transfer of carbon to water goldenfum 2010 carbon in water should be the main source for greenhouse gas emissions from a reservoir tremblay et al 2005 barros et al 2011 therefore the relationship between co2 and methane fluxes with carbon in water was obtained to identify the source of greenhouse gases from the two tributaries carbon in water can be divided into inorganic and organic carbon inorganic carbon comes from the dissolution of rocks and inorganic matter on land while organic carbon derived from the decomposition of vegetation and plankton the shennongxi river had more inorganic carbon than the modaoxi river while the organic carbon in water was highest in the modaoxi river the differences of carbon concentrations in water may be explained by the presence of greater amounts of rock type banks in the drawdown area along the shennongxi river while soil was present along the shorelines in the drawdown area along the modaoxi river that is more organic matter input from runoff or ground baseflow occurred along the modaoxi river basin because of its longer channel more soil along the shoreline greater amounts of human activity and larger basin area of this river however more inorganic matter entered and accumulated in water along the shennongxi river because of the presence of more rock type banks on the shoreline slower water flow velocity deeper water and fewer human activities carbon emissions from these two tributaries was not correlated with carbon sources in the water but were only correlated with nutrient content water temperature dissolved oxygen content and meteorological parameters 4 4 comparison with other tributaries and reservoirs a comparison of the co2 and methane fluxes among the tributaries of the tgr and other reservoirs in the world is provided in table 3 the highest co2 and methane fluxes occurred along the pengxi river among the tributaries of the tgr similar mean methane fluxes were observed along the xiangxi shennongxi and modaoxi rivers however larger differences of mean co2 fluxes were observed among the tributaries of the tgr carbon dioxide fluxes along the modaoxi river were very close to those along the xiangxi river a river located on the northern bank of the tgr the differences of carbon emissions among tributaries with the same variations in water level may have been caused by many factors such as basin area carbon input from land nutrient accumulation and farming activities in the basins of each tributary jiang et al 2012 yang et al 2012 chen et al 2009 louis et al 2000 pointed out that reservoirs with low topographical relief would produce more greenhouse gases per kwh than those built in canyons the inundated area was very different for the same water level within each tributary having various types of topographical relief along the tgr reservoir the large scale drawdown area along the pengxi river among tributaries of the tgr li et al 2012 resulted in the highlighted status of co2 emissions from the pengxi river more soil type lakeshore banks and crop farming could be found along the modaoxi river than the shennongxi river which led to more carbon and nutrients from land transferred into the water body along the modaoxi river therefore more co2 was released along the modaoxi river than the shennongxi river while similar methane fluxes appeared along these two tributaries with similar water levels and anaerobic environments 5 conclusions greenhouse gas emissions from the southern modaoxi river and northern shennongxi river tributaries of the tgr were measured the mean annual fluxes of co2 and methane were 55 8950 92 9469mgm 2 h 1 and 0 2544 0 9066mgm 2 h 1 along the shennongxi river respectively meanwhile the mean annual fluxes of co2 and methane were 77 0298 168 8724mgm 2 h 1 and 0 2694 1 1006mgm 2 h 1 along the modaoxi river respectively while methane emissions were similar along the two tributaries more co2 was released along the modaoxi river a gradual increase of co2 emissions occurred as one moved from upstream to the outlets of the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers in contrast methane emissions decreased as one moved downstream along the two tributaries more co2 emissions appeared in autumn and in winter along the two tributaries multivariate statistical analysis indicated that water quality variables have a stronger influence on co2 emissions along the shennongxi river than along the modaoxi river in addition methane emissions were affected by water quality variables more easily along the modaoxi river than along the shennongxi river in addition the carbon content of water obviously had a larger influence on carbon emissions from the modaoxi river than from the shennongxi river carbon emissions along the two tributaries were generally affected by the inorganic carbon content of water organic carbon in water had very little effect on the carbon emissions along the two tributaries further analysis showed that eutrophication and algal blooms may impose the largest effects on greenhouse gas emissions from the shennongxi river while farming and carbon input from the drawdown area may be crucial factors controlling carbon emissions along the modaoxi river more detailed carbon isotope measurement and model simulation will be needed to fully understand the changes from carbon source to sink from the tgr in the future ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to

1095,greenhouse gas emissions from the three gorges reservoir tgr have received an increasing amount of attention in recent years because of concerns related to regional climate change and clean energy production the present study compared the greenhouse gas emissions from the modaoxi and shennongxi rivers as the southern and northern tributaries of the tgr results indicated that mean annual fluxes of carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 were 55 8950 92 9469mgm 2 h 1 and 0 2544 0 9066mgm 2 h 1 along the shennongxi river and 77 0298 168 8724mgm 2 h 1 and 0 2694 1 1006mgm 2 h 1 along the modaoxi river respectively while more co2 was released along the modaoxi river the methane emissions were similar for these two tributaries multivariate analysis indicated that water quality variables were more closely correlated with co2 emissions along the shennongxi river than along the modaoxi conversely methane emissions were more closely correlated with water quality variables along the modaoxi river than along the shennongxi carbon emissions in these two tributaries were mainly affected by inorganic carbon in the water organic carbon in the water had almost no effect on carbon emissions in these two tributaries further analysis showed that eutrophication and algal blooms may generate the largest amounts of greenhouse gas emissions from the shennongxi river basin while farming and carbon input from the drawdown area may be the crucial factors affecting carbon emissions in the modaoxi river basin keywords three gorges reservoir greenhouse gas emissions from reservoir

amount of attention over the past several decades cubasch et al 2013 the carbon cycle in inland waters such as rivers ran et al 2015 gómez gener et al 2016 huang et al 2017 lakes huttunen et al 2003

2015 wetlands richey et al 2002 wang et al 2009 and other aquatic ecosystems krauss et al 2016 plays a very important role in the exchange of greenhouse gases between the atmosphere and the terrestrial ecosystems in the carbon cycle in particular allochthonous and autochthonous carbon in water moves from the land to the ocean or atmosphere by surface runoff or ground baseflow in river network systems ran et al 2013 neres lima et al 2017 river network systems are very important for carbon delivery as an indispensable exchange channel among terrestrial oceanic and atmospheric systems although carbon in inland water does not account for a very large proportion of the carbon in the global carbon cycle barros et al 2011 vihermaa et al 2016 the intrinsic carbon transportation model in rivers has been modified by the construction of numerous dams li et al 2015 reservoirs were originally designed and built for flood control hydropower irrigation fisheries and other reasons to support improved economic development moreover hydropower was recommended as a kind of clean energy in comparison with fossil energy for effectively mitigating greenhouse gas emission in the past but the green credentials of hydropower were doubted due to the inundation of soil and vegetation along the drawdown area of reservoir which will release carbon dioxide and methane emission into the atmosphere giles 2006 chen et al 2009 wang and ai 2010 ometto et al 2013 a large number of studies have previously reported on greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs in recent years these mainly included reservoirs in quebec canada demarty et al 2009 french guiana abril et al 2005 sweden aberg et al 2004 brazil kemenes et al 2011 fearnside 2016 south korea haekyung et al 2009 laos chanudet et al 2011 deshmukh et al 2014 the united states soumis et al 2004 and others in various different climate zones worldwide greenhouse gases are released or absorbed by diffusing from the interface

2006 guérin et al 2006 of hydropower reservoirs previous publications showed that significant amounts of greenhouse gas emissions occur in the first ten years after reservoirs are created tremblay et al 2005 barros et al 2011 barros et al 2011 reported that carbon emissions from reservoirs are remarkably correlated with reservoir age and latitude while the highest carbon emissions occurred over the tropical amazon region based on an analysis of data from 85 hydroelectric reservoirs distributed globally greenhouse gas emissions were highly dependent on the location of newly built hydropower reservoirs in that study however while asia has a large proportion of reservoirs of those on a global scale relatively few reservoirs in asia were included due to the shortage of carbon emission data in that study asia has 60 of the dams reported worldwide and 70 of all asian reservoirs are in china a fact that should not be ignored tremblay et al 2005 in addition one major concern is that many hydropower reservoirs in china were built in canyons especially in the changjiang yangtze river basin reservoirs with little topographical relief produce larger amounts of greenhouse gases per kwh than reservoirs built in canyons where less surface area is flooded during impoundment louis et al 2000 in recent years greenhouse gas emissions from cascaded hydropower reservoirs have been studied throughout the changjiang river basin in china yang et al 2014 monthly and seasonal variations of greenhouse gas fluxes and carbon in surface water have been analyzed from cascaded reservoirs throughout the maotiao and qingjiang river basins the danjiangkou and xinanjiang reservoirs wang et al 2011a 2009 2015b li and zhang 2014 zhao et al 2014 2017a 2017b the spatial distribution of greenhouse gas emissions was also analyzed along the mainstream changjiang xiangxi and pengxi rivers of the three gorges reservoir tgr in recent years chen et al 2009 wang et al 2011b zhao et al 2012 xiao et al 2013a yang et al 2013 li et al 2013 li et al 2014 huang et al 2015 hao et al 2017 yang et al 2012 xiao et al 2013b nevertheless all data related to greenhouse gas emissions from the tgr have currently been obtained from the mainstream changjiang river and its northern tributaries greenhouse gas emissions from the southern tributaries of the tgr have not been yet published in the literature therefore the dynamic patterns of carbon emissions from the southern tributary of the tgr should be measured and documented for an overall understanding of total greenhouse gas emissions from the tgr in the present study the southern and northern tributaries of the tgr the modaoxi and shennongxi rivers respectively were selected to compare the temporal and spatial variations in greenhouse gas emissions monthly synchronous measurements of diffusive fluxes of carbon dioxide co2 and methane from the interface between water and air were carried out along the two tributaries from january to december 2016 meanwhile water quality variables dissolved organic carbon in surface water and meteorological parameters also were obtained to analyze and identify factors controlling greenhouse gas emissions carbon emission fluxes and parameters influencing those emissions were compared from the modaoxi river tributary with from the shennongxi river tributary overall the aims of the present study were 1 to obtain the temporal and spatial variations in co2 and methane fluxes from the modaoxi and shennongxi rivers on the southern and northern banks of the tgr respectively 2 to compare the differences in carbon emissions from the above two tributaries 3 to identify the main factors controlling the dynamic changes in carbon emissions from these two tributaries 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the tgr represents the world s largest multipurpose hydropower project developed for flood control power generation and navigation this reservoir controls a drainage area of 1millionkm2 with average annual streamflow of 451billionm3 the water level initially peaked at 175ma s l at the end of october 2010 the mainstream of the changjiang river flows for 145km from the shennongxi to modaoxi rivers fig 1 the confluence of the shennongxi river lies 75km upstream from the dam and its main channel length of 60km makes it the larger first level tributary to the tgr the watershed of this river experiences a subtropical monsoon climate with relatively high air temperature and humidity the confluence of the modaoxi river lies 220km upstream from the dam and its main channel length of 191km also makes it a first level tributary of the reservoir this river drains an area of 1482km2 with mean annual streamflow of 27 6m3 s annual mean precipitation of 1201 5mm and annual mean evaporation of 994 5mm the modaoxi river watershed lies in the same subtropical climate zone and is affected by the southeastern monsoon principally 2 2 sampling design diffusive fluxes of co2 and methane were routinely measured along both the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers for 15th to 20th times each month in 2016 five sampling points were selected along the shennongxi river at louping pingyangba longchuanhe outlet and badong mainstream meanwhile five sampling points were selected along the modaoxi river at zhongduishan pu an xinjin outlet and yunyang mainstream among these points louping and xinjinare were located in the drawdown area of the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers respectively in the present study diffusive fluxes of co2 and methane were measured using a floating chamber in addition picarro g2301 co2 ch4 h2o analyzer picarro inc santa clara ca usa was used to gauge changes in the concentrations of co2 and methane in the floating chamber fluxes were measured for 15min at each point to obtain the slope of the change in co2 and methane concentrations in a reversed floating chamber the sampling frequency of the picarro g2301 analyzer was set to 1s to improve the simulation of the linear change of atmospheric concentrations in the chamber water quality variables such as water temperature dissolved oxygen content conductivity ph and chlorophyll a content were measured online by a hydrolab ds5 multi parameter analyzer hach loveland co usa water transparency was measured using a secchi disk wind speed air temperature air pressure relative humidity and other meteorological parameters were also obtained by a kestrel portable automatic weather system nielsen kellerman boothwyn pa usa at the same time moreover air temperature and atmosphere pressure in the floating chamber were detected to estimate fluxes of co2 and methane by a handheld digital thermometer jm 624 jinming instrument co ltd tianjin china water samples were collected at each site using 500ml brown glass bottles these were taken to the laboratory for measurements within 48h water samples were analyzed using a vario toc analyzer elementar inc hanau germany after samples had been filtered using glass fiber filter paper in the laboratory total dissolved carbon tc total inorganic carbon tic and dissolved organic carbon doc concentration in surface water were attained from samples collected at each point each year water fills the tgr from september to next april to meet the needs of hydropower generation then water held for flood control is released in summer starting at the end of april each year the cuntan three gorges and yichang hydrological stations were selected as typical stations to represent typical areas such as the backwater area before the dam and downstream respectively hydrological data of three hydrological stations was collected from china three gorges corporation who was in charge of management of the tgr in this paper the temporal variation of water level and streamflow at these three hydrological stations recorded on an hourly scale from january to december 2016 is documented in supplemental information each year water fills the tgr from september to next april to meet the needs of hydropower generation then water held for flood control is released in summer starting at the end of april each year the cuntan three gorges and yichang hydrological stations were selected as typical stations to represent typical areas such as the backwater area before the dam and downstream respectively hydrological data of three hydrological stations was collected from china three gorges corporation who was in charge of management of the tgr in this paper the temporal variation of water level and streamflow at these three hydrological stations recorded on an hourly scale from january to december 2016 is documented in supplemental information 2 3 flux estimation carbon fluxes were calculated based on the linear regression slope of change in co2 and methane concentrations in a reversed floating chamber using eq 1 as following goldenfum 2010 1 flux mg m 2 h 1 slope ppv s 1 f 1 f 2 chamber volume m 3 chamber

experiments the molecular weights of co2 and methane are 44 and 16 respectively next f 2 a conversion factor from seconds to hours was calculated using eq 3 3 f 2 60 min 60 s 3600 sh 1 2 4 data analysis methods statistical analyses were performed to compare the differences in greenhouse gas fluxes water quality carbon concentrations in surface water and meteorological parameters between the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers in this study the minimum mean and maximum values were used to describe the changes in the range of variables measured and described above in addition the error and sample dispersion or extent of variation was expressed by standard deviations sd and coefficients of variation cv respectively a boxplot was created using r language to understand the temporal and spatial variation of carbon fluxes and environmental variables along the two tributaries canonical correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between carbon emissions and environmental variables along the two tributaries of the tgr in addition correlation matrixes of fluxes of co2 and methane with environmental variables were created using r language to explore the factors controlling these fluxes along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers 3 results 3 1 monthly variation of co2 and methane fluxes along the two tributaries monthly variation of the mean fluxes of co2 and methane was documented along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers fig 2 overall more co2 was emitted than absorbed along the two tributaries during most months in 2016 in june alone more co2 was absorbed than emitted with a monthly mean flux of 34 316 163 924mgm 2 h 1 along the shennongxi river more co2 was released along the modaoxi river than the shennongxi river in most months for the shennongxi river the highest co2 emissions were found in october 2016 with monthly mean fluxes of 142 2670 40 2110mgm 2 h 1 monthly mean fluxes of co2 were about 30 0mgm 2 h 1 from march to september even though the co2 flux converted into an absorbed status in june along the shennongxi river however cvs were very interestingly higher in months with relatively low co2 emissions carbon dioxide emissions displayed gradual decreasing trend in the first half of 2016 but rose sharply from july to december in the latter half of the year for the modaoxi river the highest co2 emissions also occurred in october 2016 with monthly mean fluxes of 182 8469 159 2320mgm 2 h 1 comparatively the lowest co2 emissions appeared in march 2016 with monthly mean fluxes of only 0 344 31 443mgm 2 h 1 overall the trends in the temporal variation of co2 fluxes along the modaoxi river were less obvious than along the shennongxi river higher co2 emissions were observed in winter from october to december and in january 2016 the monthly mean co2 fluxes were above 100mgm 2 h 1 in all months of winter in summary the cvs of monthly mean co2 fluxes were lower in months when higher co2 emissions occurred along the modaoxi river monthly mean methane fluxes above the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers showed that more methane was emitted than absorbed along these two tributaries in most months of 2016 fig 2 the two rivers only absorbed methane in april and december with monthly mean fluxes of 0 9321 1 5400mgm 2 h 1 and 1 6960 0 8100mgm 2 h 1 along the modaoxi river respectively overall methane emissions rose from january to may and then decreased until december 2016 along the shennongxi river unlike the temporal variation of co2 emissions methane emissions were higher in summer and lower in winter and autumn however methane was emitted in all months of 2016 along the shennongxi river while the highest methane emissions occurred in may with monthly mean fluxes of 1 4405 2 8527mgm 2 h 1 in addition the highest cv of monthly mean fluxes of methane was observed in may 2016 with a value of 2 8527mgm 2 h 1 which illustrated the notable temporal variation of methane emissions in this month in addition higher cvs were observed with higher methane emissions in months along the shennongxi river methane was relatively weakly absorbed in some months along the modaoxi river however higher methane emissions occurred in the relatively moist and hot climate in summer along the modaoxi river which was analogous with findings along the shennongxi river the highest methane emissions appeared in august with a monthly mean flux of 1 7699 2 1480mgm 2 h 1 while the lowest methane emissions were found in march with a monthly mean flux of only 0 0333 0 0290mgm 2 h 1 3 2 seasonal variation of co2 and methane fluxes along the two tributaries the seasonal variation of mean fluxes of co2 was greater along the modaoxi river than along the shennongxi river fig 3 for all seasons overall greater amounts of co2 emissions occurred in autumn and winter than in other seasons along both tributaries of the tgr in detail the mean annual co2 flux reached 55 8950 92 9469mgm 2 h 1 along the shennongxi river and 77 0298 168 8724mgm 2 h 1 along the modaoxi river for the shennongxi river the highest and lowest co2 emissions appeared in autumn and summer with mean fluxes of 96 3509 71 3629mgm 2 h 1 and 12 2027 137 1604mgm 2 h 1 respectively moreover higher co2 emissions were observed in autumn and winter when seasonal mean fluxes were very similar to each other at about 90 0mgm 2 h 1 although the lowest co2 emissions occurred in summer the coefficient of variation peaked in the summer of 2016 indicating the most remarkable temporal and spatial variation of co2 emissions occurred at this time in spring lower emissions and higher coefficients of variation occurred with mean fluxes of 24 1731 71 2265mgm 2 h 1 and with a cv of 2 9465 for the modaoxi river the highest co2 emissions appeared in winter with a diffusive flux of 122 0024 135 8769mgm 2 h 1 while the cv of co2 fluxes was very small in winter specifically the lowest co2 emissions occurred in summer with a flux of 28 1689 187 8897mgm 2 h 1 in the entire year therefore much more temporal and spatial heterogeneity was observed for co2 emissions in spring and in summer despite the fact that seasonal mean fluxes were lower at this time the seasonal variation of methane fluxes fig 3 obviously revealed that more methane was released along the modaoxi river than the shennongxi river in summer while less methane was emitted along the modaoxi river than the shennongxi river in spring moreover the annual mean fluxes of methane along the two tributaries showed little difference overall the difference of methane fluxes between along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers was larger in spring and summer than in autumn and winter the methane emission along the shennongxi river appeared more noticeably in the autumn and winter than in other seasons of 2016 however higher methane emission was found in spring and summer methane emission peaked noticeably with a mean flux of 0 5425 1 6637mgm 2 h 1 and the temporal and spatial variation with its cv reached 3 0670 most prominently in spring as revealed in the comparison of cvs of co2 and methane fluxes methane emission had a more notable temporal and spatial variation than co2 emission along the shennongxi river therefore the seasonal and spatial variation of methane emission displayed very differently from carbon dioxide emission along the shennongxi river which is in particular true during the impoundment periods in autumn and winter the seasonal variation of methane emission was more complex along the modaoxi river than the shennongxi river methane emission peaked in summer with a flux of 1 1112 1 6235mgm 2 h 1 while it hit the bottom in autumn with a flux of 0 2 0 3587mgm 2 h 1 along the modaoxi river in contrast methane were absorbed with fluxes of 0 1707 1 0191mgm 2 h 1 and 0 0630 0 4596mgm 2 h 1 in spring and winter respectively to sum up seasonal mean methane fluxes were inversely proportional to seasonal mean co2 fluxes in terms of cv along the modaoxi river 3 3 spatial distribution of co2 and methane along the two tributaries the spatial distribution of fluxes of co2 and methane along the two tributaries is shown in fig 4 carbon dioxide was emitted at most points along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers with the exception of pingyangba point along the shennongxi river carbon dioxide emissions increased from louping point to outlet point along the shennongxi river fig 4 the highest co2 emissions occurred at outlet point with mean fluxes of 84 9962 62 2600mgm 2 h 1 while co2 emissions were lowest at louping point with mean fluxes of 20 5101 68 4410mgm 2 h 1 compared with the points along the shennongxi river co2 showed obviously higher emissions with a mean flux of 144 7340 64 9190mgm 2 h 1 at the badong mainstream point of the changjiang river moreover more co2 was absorbed than emitted with a mean flux of 16 476 100 257mgm 2 h 1 at pingyangba point which was located in the drawdown area of the tgr for the modaoxi river the highest co2 emissions occurred at the yunyang mainstream point with mean fluxes of 325 1273 185 8601mgm 2 h 1 and the lowest cv of co2 fluxes appeared at this point with a cv of 0 572 only more co2 was emitted than absorbed at most points except at zhongduishan point carbon dioxide emissions increased from pu an point to outlet point and yunyang mainstream point gradually more co2 was absorbed than emitted only at zhongduishan point which was located in the upstream portion of the modaoxi river with a mean flux of 21 894 92 112mgm 2 h 1 the lowest co2 emissions occurred at xinjin point with mean fluxes of 0 309 40 423mgm 2 h 1 however the cv of the mean co2 flux was highest at xinjin point with a cv of 130 747 the spatial distribution of methane emissions from louping point to the badong mainstream was apparently opposite to that of co2 emissions along the shennongxi river fig 4 overall methane was emitted at all points although methane fluxes decreased gradually from the upstream to outlet point and badong mainstream point the highest methane emissions occurred at louping point with mean fluxes of 0 9366 1 9171mgm 2 h 1 while the highest cv 2 046 was also found at this point the lowest methane emissions occurred at outlet point with a mean flux of 0 036 0 03mgm 2 h 1 and the lowest cv 0 838 was also found at this point for the modaoxi river methane was emitted at all points except for xinjin point where mean fluxes of methane were 0 192 0 719mgm 2 h 1 fig 4 methane fluxes were below 0 6mgm 2 h 1 at all points where more methane was released than absorbed the highest and lowest methane emissions appeared at pu an and zhongduishan points with mean fluxes of 0 5938 1 5790mgm 2 h 1 and 0 2130 1 6320mgm 2 h 1 respectively however the highest cv for methane mean fluxes 7 659 occurred at zhongduishan point which exhibited a relatively strong monthly variation of mean methane flux at this point methane emissions at yunyang point were more than at badong point and the latter being located in the mainstream of the changjiang river 3 4 co2 and methane variation under different hydrological dynamic along the two tributaries during measurement periods the effects of the impoundment and changes in water level on the greenhouse gas emissions were evaluated for the northern and southern tributaries specifically water is typically released in april while a lower water level is maintained until september each year as indicated in supplemental information a year is divided into two periods the low and high water level periods in 2016 the low water level period began in april and ended in september while the high water period included the other months during measurement periods the effects of the impoundment and changes in water level on the greenhouse gas emissions were evaluated for the northern and southern tributaries specifically water is typically released in april while a lower water level is maintained until september each year as indicated in supplemental information a year is divided into two periods the low and high water level periods in 2016 the low water level period began in april and ended in september while the high water period included the other months the mean co2 and methane fluxes varied during the periods of low and high water along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers table 1 more co2 was released during stable periods of high water for both tributaries of the tgr moreover the modaoxi river emitted greater amounts of co2 than the shennongxi river regardless of changes in water level releases of co2 were 65 44mgm 2 h 1 higher in the high water period than with low water along the modaoxi river table 1 the methane fluxes along the modaoxi river and shennongxi rivers were very close to each other during periods of both low and high water however more methane was released during low water than during high water while more co2 was released during high water than during low water along the two tributaries methane releases were ten times higher during low water than during high water along the southern and northern tributaries of the tgr 3 5 environmental variables along the two tributaries according to the temporal variation of environment variables yearly water temperature and ph were very similar along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers however remarkable differences were observed between the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers in terms of dissolved oxygen do conductivity chlorophyll a and water transparency specifically the largest difference among water quality variables appeared in the chlorophyll a concentration along these two tributaries especially in spring chlorophyll a concentration had much larger mean values of 8 8438μg l and 3 2209μg l along these two rivers respectively in addition the water transparency of two tributaries could not be ignored with mean annual values of 2 2067m and 1 7444m and especially seasonally mean values of 4 60m and 3 12m in winter along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers respectively however the total inorganic carbon and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were insignificantly different between these two tributaries the mean annual total inorganic carbon concentration was 24 9663mg l and 23 6815mg l along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers respectively moreover larger differences in dissolved organic carbon content were observed between the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers with mean annual concentrations of 1 8548mg l and 2 5994mg l respectively this difference was especially obvious in spring when the mean dissolved organic carbon concentration in the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers was 1 8320mg l and 3 0289mg l respectively in summary greater amounts of inorganic carbon were found in the shennongxi river than in the modaoxi river while the latter had greater amounts of organic carbon canonical correlation analysis between greenhouse gas fluxes and water quality variables was carried out using data from along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers fig 5 and table 2 the water quality variables had larger effects on co2 emissions than methane emissions along the two tributaries water quality variables had a stronger effect on co2 emissions along the shennongxi river than along the modaoxi river fig 5 however methane emissions were affected by water quality variables more easily along the modaoxi river than along the shennongxi river moreover methane fluxes there were positively correlated with the chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen content the level of carbon emissions was determined by ph and dissolved oxygen content of water along the shennongxi river while dissolved oxygen conductivity and chlorophyll a in water produced remarkable effects on carbon emissions along the modaoxi river the co2 fluxes were more negatively correlated with ph and dissolved oxygen along the shennongxi river in addition the dissolved oxygen concentration was higher in spring and summer along the shennongxi river than in fall and winter the co2 fluxes from the modaoxi river were more negatively correlated with chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen than in the shennongxi river methane fluxes were positively correlated with ph and water temperature and negatively correlated with conductivity table 2 the results of canonical correlation analysis between carbon emissions and carbon in water are shown in fig 6 the correlation matrix of co2 and methane fluxes with carbon in water along the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers are also shown in table 2 multivariate statistical analysis indicated that carbon in water more strongly and obviously influenced carbon emissions from the modaoxi river than from the shennongxi river canonical correlation analysis also basically showed that carbon emissions along the two tributaries were affected by inorganic carbon in water organic carbon in water had little effect on the carbon emissions along the two tributaries no obvious relationship was found between co2 and methane fluxes with the carbon content of water along the shennongxi river however methane fluxes were negatively correlated with the inorganic carbon content of water with a correlation coefficient of 0 6154 along the modaoxi river in addition co2 fluxes were not correlated with organic or inorganic carbon in water along the modaoxi river 4 discussion 4 1 effects of hydrological dynamics on greenhouse gas emissions the tgr plays a very important role in flood control along the changjiang river basin in china the water level in the reservoir falls every year as flood waters are slowly released to prepare the next round of volume from rainstorms each summer although more co2 was released along the modaoxi river than the shennongxi river changes in water level affected co2 emissions more strongly along the shennongxi river than the modaoxi river this may have occurred since the modaoxi river has a much longer main channel and larger basin area than the shennongxi river allowing the modaoxi river to transport and accumulate more organic matter into its water body from terrestrial vegetation and soil this finding could be validated by the difference in doc between these two rivers table 1 overall the doc along the modaoxi was higher than along the shennongxi despite any changes in water level however the doc was higher during low water than during high water along both of these tributaries generally periods of low water occurred during spring and summer while high water arrived in autumn and winter in the tgr more vegetation or phytoplankton was present in spring and summer during periods of low water which could contribute to higher chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen concentrations in water during this period according to the literature goldenfum 2010 tremblay et al 2005 barros et al 2011 methane is only released in an anaerobic environment but less methane was produced during high water in autumn and winter along the two tributaries an anaerobic environment occurred easily under high water conditions with deeper water and slower waterflow velocity the water level fluctuated from 145m to 175m each year while the mean water depth increased from 30m to 70m in the tgr moreover a relatively high water level behind the dam resulted in slower waterflow and a longer residence time for water in the tgr in addition the high water and slower water flow conditions may cause thermal stratification in the water body in the backwater area therefore as nutrients and organic matter accumulate changes in water temperature and the growth of phytoplankton will affect carbon matter transportation and transfer in the channel system zhang et al 2005 liu et al 2016a wu et al 2018 the present study only measured methane emissions from the interface between water and the atmosphere however most methane may be released as bubbles from deep water and become oxidized into co2 as it gradually ascends in the water column therefore only a small quantity of methane emissions may have been measured using a floating chamber in the present study however effects of impoundment on the methane fluxes were also obvious along the two tributaries 4 2 effects of water quality on greenhouse gas emissions along the two tributaries as mentioned above water quality variables had larger effects on co2 emissions than methane emissions along the two tributaries table 2 generally eutrophication and algal blooms occurred in spring and summer during periods of low water along the shennongxi river plankton produce chlorophyll a and plankton biomass enrichment of the water body can result in eutrophication and algal blooms zhu et al 2012 the average chlorophyll a concentration peaked at 8 19μg l during a period of low water along the shennongxi river the dissolved oxygen concentration in surface water was also highest in spring and summer along this river in addition humans have become more active along the shennongxi river after this tributary was developed as a 5a ranked national tourist sightseeing spot most sightseeing occurs in spring and summer along this tributary however the development of a massive fishery had already been prohibited along the shennongxi river with the goal of reducing nutrient input that could result in eutrophication and algal blooms further analysis indicated that eutrophication and algal blooms often occurred as a result of the longer water residence time relatively high nutrient concentrations and slow water flow velocity in may along the shennongxi river zhu et al 2012 relatively high chlorophyll a concentrations and total carbon content in water probably supported the occurrence of eutrophication and algal blooming in may along the shennongxi river therefore one can conclude that eutrophication and algal blooms maybe impose the largest effects on greenhouse gas emissions from the shennongxi river nutrient and organic matter would gather and accumulate as the water depth increased and water flow velocity decreased along both tributaries of the tgr liu et al 2016b therefore eutrophication has already occurred as a response to nutrient accumulation and increased water temperatures along the shennongxi xiangxi daning and xiaojiang tributaries of the tgr liu et al 2013 interestingly no public reports related to eutrophication of the modaoxi river could be located increased eutrophication and more frequent algal blooms may strongly affect the co2 and methane emissions from the tributaries of the tgr during the processes of photosynthesis and decomposition of phytoplankton and algal qin et al 2018 guo et al 2011 in addition chlorophyll a dissolved oxygen and conductivity were also lower along the modaoxi than the shenongxi river regardless of water level however jiang et al 2017 concluded that conductivity was the major variable that affected eutrophication and algal blooms along the pengxi and modaoxi rivers eutrophication and algal blooms were not the major variable determining the level of greenhouse gas emissions from the modaoxi river in contrast with a higher population and increased amounts of farming activities along the modaoxi river in its larger basin area more vegetation and soil type drawdown area existed along the modaoxi river than the shennongxi river which has a rocky shoreline therefore farming and carbon input from the drawdown area may be the crucial factors for the higher levels of carbon emissions along the modaoxi river 4 3 effects of carbon concentration in water on greenhouse gas emissions along the two tributaries the carbon content of water serves as an important parameter for understanding the nature of co2 and methane emissions from reservoirs since these greenhouse gases are released as a byproduct of decomposition and are involved in the transfer of carbon to water goldenfum 2010 carbon in water should be the main source for greenhouse gas emissions from a reservoir tremblay et al 2005 barros et al 2011 therefore the relationship between co2 and methane fluxes with carbon in water was obtained to identify the source of greenhouse gases from the two tributaries carbon in water can be divided into inorganic and organic carbon inorganic carbon comes from the dissolution of rocks and inorganic matter on land while organic carbon derived from the decomposition of vegetation and plankton the shennongxi river had more inorganic carbon than the modaoxi river while the organic carbon in water was highest in the modaoxi river the differences of carbon concentrations in water may be explained by the presence of greater amounts of rock type banks in the drawdown area along the shennongxi river while soil was present along the shorelines in the drawdown area along the modaoxi river that is more organic matter input from runoff or ground baseflow occurred along the modaoxi river basin because of its longer channel more soil along the shoreline greater amounts of human activity and larger basin area of this river however more inorganic matter entered and accumulated in water along the shennongxi river because of the presence of more rock type banks on the shoreline slower water flow velocity deeper water and fewer human activities carbon emissions from these two tributaries was not correlated with carbon sources in the water but were only correlated with nutrient content water temperature dissolved oxygen content and meteorological parameters 4 4 comparison with other tributaries and reservoirs a comparison of the co2 and methane fluxes among the tributaries of the tgr and other reservoirs in the world is provided in table 3 the highest co2 and methane fluxes occurred along the pengxi river among the tributaries of the tgr similar mean methane fluxes were observed along the xiangxi shennongxi and modaoxi rivers however larger differences of mean co2 fluxes were observed among the tributaries of the tgr carbon dioxide fluxes along the modaoxi river were very close to those along the xiangxi river a river located on the northern bank of the tgr the differences of carbon emissions among tributaries with the same variations in water level may have been caused by many factors such as basin area carbon input from land nutrient accumulation and farming activities in the basins of each tributary jiang et al 2012 yang et al 2012 chen et al 2009 louis et al 2000 pointed out that reservoirs with low topographical relief would produce more greenhouse gases per kwh than those built in canyons the inundated area was very different for the same water level within each tributary having various types of topographical relief along the tgr reservoir the large scale drawdown area along the pengxi river among tributaries of the tgr li et al 2012 resulted in the highlighted status of co2 emissions from the pengxi river more soil type lakeshore banks and crop farming could be found along the modaoxi river than the shennongxi river which led to more carbon and nutrients from land transferred into the water body along the modaoxi river therefore more co2 was released along the modaoxi river than the shennongxi river while similar methane fluxes appeared along these two tributaries with similar water levels and anaerobic environments 5 conclusions greenhouse gas emissions from the southern modaoxi river and northern shennongxi river tributaries of the tgr were measured the mean annual fluxes of co2 and methane were 55 8950 92 9469mgm 2 h 1 and 0 2544 0 9066mgm 2 h 1 along the shennongxi river respectively meanwhile the mean annual fluxes of co2 and methane were 77 0298 168 8724mgm 2 h 1 and 0 2694 1 1006mgm 2 h 1 along the modaoxi river respectively while methane emissions were similar along the two tributaries more co2 was released along the modaoxi river a gradual increase of co2 emissions occurred as one moved from upstream to the outlets of the shennongxi and modaoxi rivers in contrast methane emissions decreased as one moved downstream along the two tributaries more co2 emissions appeared in autumn and in winter along the two tributaries multivariate statistical analysis indicated that water quality variables have a stronger influence on co2 emissions along the shennongxi river than along the modaoxi river in addition methane emissions were affected by water quality variables more easily along the modaoxi river than along the shennongxi river in addition the carbon content of water obviously had a larger influence on carbon emissions from the modaoxi river than from the shennongxi river carbon emissions along the two tributaries were generally affected by the inorganic carbon content of water organic carbon in water had very little effect on the carbon emissions along the two tributaries further analysis showed that eutrophication and algal blooms may impose the largest effects on greenhouse gas emissions from the shennongxi river while farming and carbon input from the drawdown area may be crucial factors controlling carbon emissions along the modaoxi river more detailed carbon isotope measurement and model simulation will be needed to fully understand the changes from carbon source to sink from the tgr in the future ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to

1096,eastmain 1 reservoir james bay area quebec canada is a 600km2 boreal reservoir created in november 2005 in the eastmain river watershed to increase the volume of water transiting in eastmain 1 em 1 the rupert river was diverted partial flooding of the rupert diversion bays rd took place in 2009 and the flooding was completed in 2011 co2 and ch4 partial pressures and emissions were monitored for 7 years on the reservoir and bays according to field campaigns measurements at eastmain 1 reservoir average ice free period pco2 varied between 969μatm and 2230μatm whereas the average pco2 of the reference sampled lakes and eastmain river stations was 592μatm 101 before the impoundment contrary to pco2 pch4 partial pressures presented any pattern to outline after flooding of the eastmain 1 reservoir and varied between 21 and 250μatm with an overall average of 106μatm sd 91 co2 diffusive emissions at the air water interface of the eastmain 1 reservoir ranged between 113mg c co2 m 2 day 1 and 8237mg c co2 m 2 day 1 ch4 fluxes ranged from null to 102mg c ch4 m 2 day 1 this article also shows that the impoundment of the rupert river and the related transport of sediment and organic matter into eastmain 1 reservoir did not have a significant long term effect on pco2 remarkably the different approaches methods used to monitor these variables showed comparable results a net decrease in co2 emissions in the first three years followed by stabilization around seven years after the reservoir creation therefore we advocate for long term around 10 years ghg monitoring the use of various methods beforehand intercalibrated offers a non negligible flexibility reducing the sampling costs which should favor an increase in this kind of studies worldwide keywords pco2 pch4 ghg

greenhouse effect is crucial for life on earth as it contributes to maintain a mean annual temperature of about 15 c lindsey 2009 however over the last two decades the rate of increase of anthropogenic ghg emissions to the atmosphere has reached a critical level the major ghgs related to the creation of reservoirs are carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o eggleston et al 2006 geography water residence time reservoir shape and volume and amount and type of vegetation flooded are variables that affect the duration and quantity of emissions st louis et al 2000 barros et

et al 2005 nevertheless in regards to climate change the contribution of freshwater reservoirs to the increase of ghgs in the atmosphere is of growing concern e g st louis et al 2000 rudd et al 1993 for government and the energy sectors as erosion and sediment transport due to intense storm events and water pollution increase worldwide co2 and ch4 production in aquatic systems is fueled by inputs from the watershed marchand et al 2009 campeau et al 2014 these processes can lead to co2 supersaturation in the water column del giorgio et al 1999 duarte and prairie 2005 and or ch4 accumulation in the sediments and thus produce gas emission to the atmosphere through diffusion at the water surface kling et al 1992 macintyre et al 1995 and bubbling deshmukh et al 2014 in hydroelectric reservoirs greenhouse gases ghgs can be emitted by three main pathways the two first being also observed in natural waterbodies diffusive emissions at the reservoir surface huttunen et al 2003 abril et al 2005 bubbling mostly in shallow areas huttunen et al 2003 rosa et al 2002 and downstream emissions comprising degassing in the turbulent waters up to 1km downstream the dam roehm and tremblay 2006 and diffusive and bubble emissions in the river up to 50km downstream the dam in canada preliminary results showed that bubbling was of minor extent compared to diffusive emissions bastien et al 2010 degassing estimates are under study unpublished data here we thus focused on diffusive fluxes according to the available studies on young and old reservoirs worldwide the magnitude of co2 diffusive emissions is related to the reservoirs age and latitude barros et al 2011 typically the largest amount of ghg emissions takes place during the first 10 years after flooding for boreal tremblay et al 2005 marchand et al 2012 as well as for tropical reservoirs abril et al 2005 demarty and bastien 2011 after the first 10 years co2 emissions are similar to those from natural aquatic systems in the same watershed such a clear pattern is not observed for ch4 as organic matter mineralization in ch4 is highly dependent of the hypolimnetic oxygen concentration clayer et al 2016 and ch4 bubbling is also related to sedimentation rate and its nature delsontro et al 2010 several methods can be used to monitor emissions before and after a reservoir creation such as floating chambers automated systems eddy covariance towers unesco iha 2010 some studies confirmed the reliability of different techniques used to measure the same processes demarty et al 2009 deshmukh et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 some other studies demonstrated disparities between methods vachon et al 2010 the need of new data about ghg emissions from reservoir is recognized worldwide for novel insights and better understanding of the processes involved hence the main objective of the present article is to present new dataset on ghg emissions from reservoir considering the use of recognized approaches and methods however the quality the temporal and spatial distribution of our data and the different methods used in our follow up allowed robust analysis of the technologies and approaches in one hand and of the pattern of ghg concentrations and emissions in the other hand these analyses were based on the following hypothesis in 2009 demarty et al reported a matching between trends stemming from measurements made either with automated systems in generating station or during discrete field campaigns for the first years after impoundment we hypothesize this concordance to be valuable for the entire study period in 2012 teodoru et al presented the decreasing trend in co2 emissions at the eastmain 1 reservoir from its impoundment in 2005 2009 according to their results we expected co2 emissions for the 2009 2012 period to be much lower however the impoundment of the rupert bays upstream the eastmain 1 reservoir in 2010 represented an important input of organic matter in the reservoir it was then hypothesized that this event led to an increase in surface co2 and ch4 partial pressures in the eastmain 1 reservoir 2 material and methods 2 1 study area eastmain 1 reservoir 52 19 n 75 05 w fig 1a is located in the boreal zone northwestern québec canada within this region mean monthly temperatures vary between 23 c and 14 c and total rainfall and total snow precipitation are up to 430mm and 260mm respectively the eastmain river s catchment 25 857km2 is dominated by coniferous forest shallow podzolic and peat soils and igneous bedrock the aquatic system studied is oligotrophic with an overall low primary production planas et al 2005 the reservoir is partially to totally covered by ice from about 15 december to 15 may according to hydro québec surveys eastmain 1 reservoir 603km2 was flooded in november 2005 and the generating station 480mw was commissioned in 2006 the eastmain 1 a sarcelle rupert project aimed to give hydro québec s generating fleet additional capacity of 918mw and additional output of 8 7twh per year it implied an increase in the volume of the eastmain 1 reservoir and by diverting the rupert river partial flooding of the rupert river diversion rd started in 2009 with the upstream bay 229km2 and the flooding was completed in 2011 in the downstream bay 118km2 fig 1c the rd bays flow into the southeast section of eastmain 1 reservoir 600m3 s 1 the zone of sedimentation at the point of entry into the reservoir is presented in fig 1b this map also presents ghg sampling stations in this specific area sampling dates between 2005 so called reference lakes and river sampled before reservoir creation and 2012 and the number of sampling stations visited once per sampling period are described in table 1 sampling strategy regarding the spatial variability and sampling stations location for the field campaigns are described in demarty et al 2011 2 2 field campaigns co2 and ch4 partial pressures measurements and fluxes calculation the partial pressure of co2 and ch4 pco2 and pch4 was measured at the water surface 0 1m for all sampling stations at eastmain 1 reservoir to measure pco2 water was sampled with a peristaltic pump and surface water pco2 was measured in situ with a non dispersive infrared ndir sensor egm 4 manufactured by pp systems coupled with a gas exchanger membrana celgard ten consecutive measurements one per minute were averaged to obtain the pco2 at each station mean variation coefficient of 1 3 due to technical improvement with time different sensors techniques were used for pch4 measurements head space technique and chromatography flame ionization detector demarty et al 2011 were used in 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 peristaltic pump and gas exchanger setup as for pco2 coupled with a tunable diode laser spectroscopy sensor tdls manufactured by franatech were used in 2009 2011 and 2012 co2 and ch4 dissolve concentrations were calculated according to demarty et al 2011 diffusive fluxes were then calculated according to thin boundary layer tbl model and estimates of k 600 from vachon and prairie 2013 model c these authors argue for a better predictive model when using lake area together with wind speed which we measured also considering that wind speed to k 600 relationships are site specific and that the majority of vachon and prairie s samples came from eastmain 1 reservoir this equation was the most suitable to our study 2 3 co2 and ch4 surface diffusive fluxes measurement point in time diffusive flux measurements were made using a floating chamber fc this method is known to overestimate the fluxes due to excess turbulence created by the chamber macintyre et al 1995 vachon et al 2010 for technical reasons turbulences were not measured concomitantly to fluxes and therefore not taken into account to correct fluxes accordingly in 2008 the gas collection chamber was rectangular made of plastic has an area of 0 20m2 and a volume of 18l the subsequent years the chamber was improved with a tapered shape heavier structure for better stability aluminum and fixed buoys but similar area 0 16m2 and volume 17 6l in both cases the chamber walls extended 15cm under water thus ensuring a tight seal between the chamber and the water usually the chamber was ventilated 5min before the flux measurement begins until the air ghg concentration measured by the gas analysers stabilizes and was comparable to that in the atmosphere approximately 385μatm for co2 and 1 8μatm for ch4 measured in the study area after the chamber was set on the water surface the internal pressure was equalized with that of the atmosphere by means of a port positioned on top of the chamber this port was hermetically sealed with a rubber stopper at the beginning of the flux measurement an external pump circulates air between the chamber and the gas analysers a flow meter allows the circuit air flow to be controlled at 2 8lmin 1 over the years for technical reasons ghg fluxes were measured using different sensors coupled in closed circuit to the floating collection chamber co2 and ch4 diffusive emissions were measured using a gasmet dx4010 fourier transform infra red sensor in 2006 and 2007 in 2008 and 2009 only co2 emissions were measured using a ppsystems ciras sc non dispersive infra red sensor finally from 2010 to 2012 co2 and ch4 diffusive emissions were measured using a picarro g1301 in any case the flux measurement was carried out over a period of 7min during which the co2 ch4 partial pressure trapped under the chamber was constantly recorded the linear regression slope was used to calculate a ghg flux in mgco2 m 2 day 1 or in mgch4 m 2 day 1 representing a ghg quantity emitted or collected per area and time unit using the following equation flux slope f 1 f 2 volume area where f1 is a conversion factor from μatm to mgm 3 for normal temperature and pressure conditions 25 c and 101 3kpa f2 is a conversion factor of seconds on a daily basis and the volume and area are those of the floating chamber three replicates were measured per sampling station 2 4 continuous co2 and ch4 partial pressures measurements with automated systems the continuous gas monitor was developed by fisheries and oceans canada in conjunction with manitoba hydro after carignan s design 1998 and built of commercial components every three hours co2 and ch4 are measured by two different sensors licor li 820 ndir sensor and neodym panterra metal oxide semiconductor sensor respectively on a gas stream that has been equilibrated with the source water demarty et al 2009 long term partial pressure measurements taken at a single sampling station with monitors installed in gs have been shown to give conservative compared to point in time measurements with floating chambers and representative estimates of ghg fluxes for the whole reservoir québec and manitoba demarty et al 2009 automated ghg systems monitors as have been in place at eastmain 1 generating station gs since 2006 to obtain co2 and ch4 partial pressure time series since june 2007 and for the ice free period june to october two as were installed on rafts the as located in the eastmain river upstream the reservoir gorge prospere gp in fig 1 was representative of the partial pressures entering the reservoir the second as was installed in the center of the reservoir marie eve me in fig 1 since june 2010 and for the ice free period two additional rafts with as were installed at the entrance of the rupert diversion into eastmain 1 reservoir the as at nemiscau nem was dedicated to the outflow from the rupert diversion whereas as at ruisseau caché rc was at the confluence of the two water bodies 2 5 ancillary water quality measurements each sampling station was located according to a gps garmin wgs 84 total depth at the sampling stations was measured with a depth meter digital hondex water column transparency was estimated with a secchi disc atmospheric pressure air temperature and wind speed were measured with a portative weather station kestrel extech instruments 407112 surface and profiles for water temperature ph and dissolved oxygen concentration were measured with a ysi 600xl alcalinity was measured with a ph meter thermo orion tree stars 8102 bnwp 3 results and discussion 3 1 general observations at the eastmain 1 reservoir surface water quality transparency temperature ph alkalinity dissolve oxygen saturation and meteorological wind speed air temperature parameters measured for 6 years at eastmain 1 reservoir are presented in table 2 means and standard deviations a significant increase in transparency was observed from 2006 to 2011 anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 concomitantly ph increased anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 as expected this trend in ph was related to decrease in pco2 however the weakness of the relationship tend to demonstrate that ph measured on the field in situ ysi probe is not sensitive enough to be used as a proxy for pco2 estimation regression p 0 05 r 2 0 47 the entire system is well oxygenated apart from two stations that experienced o2 depletion in the first spring after flooding april 2008 concentrations of 3 1 and 3 2mgl 1 were measured compared to an average of 10 0 1 1mgl 1 for the 34 other stations monitored at the same period summertime sampling showed a stratification of the reservoir for stations deeper than 8m with low o2 and high co2 concentrations at the bottom autumnal sampling did not show this stratification confirming that the water column mixing occurred before our autumnal campaigns as lakes and rivers the eastmain 1 reservoir was supersaturated in co2 for the entire study period hydrometric follow up showed two flood events per year fig 1d in spring and fall they represent organic matter inputs that surely sustained the heterotrophic mode of the system and favored the co2 supersaturation indeed berggren et al 2012 demonstrated that in heterotrophic systems the respiratory quotient moles of co2 produced per mole of o2 consumed of the bacterioplankton was higher than in autotrophic systems hence allochtonous organic matter entering the system twice a year leads to more co2 per o2 consumed than would have done organic matter produced by the algal community of the reservoir 3 2 temporal trends in pco2 in eastmain 1 reservoir results from year round pco2 monitored with an as installed in eastmain 1 generating station gs are presented in fig 2a and measurements from field campaigns are presented in fig 2b as stated in demarty et al 2009 measurements made on the water passing through the turbines should be representative of the whole reservoir in that article authors presented conclusions from one year measurement at eastmain 1 reservoir and several years of measurements in manitoba reservoirs the multi annual datasets presented in this article tend to confirm their observations trends depicted from 2006 to 2012 as results are similar to those from field campaigns measurements for the same period the advantage of the as is clearly to get a year round dataset which is not feasible with field campaigns that cannot be performed in spring and late autumn for security reasons ice break up or formation pco2 trends can be described as follow first pco2 increase under ice cover demarty et al 2011 huttunen et al 2004 is clearly demonstrated every year with the highest peak in pco2 observed the first winter after impoundment 2007 winter field campaigns performed in 2007 and 2008 corroborate as measurements in case of eastmain 1 under ice cover pco2 increase observed is an indication of the degradation of in situ organic matter as during winter organic matter income from the watershed is relatively small 23 of the summer income in the main channel incomes in dentritic parts of the reservoir are thus considered close to null information form hydro québec hydrometric services not shown secondly springtime degassing linked to ice break up is obvious measured pco2 at the end of this degassing phase decreased year after year anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 this corresponds to a background pco2 for the ice free period third as records showed that lowest pco2 values are reached at the end of autumn at eastmain 1 reservoir according to field campaigns measurements average ice free period pco2 varied between 969μatm summer 2012 and 2230μatm autumn 2006 fig 2 and table 2 before impoundment 2005 the average pco2 of the reference sampled lakes and eastmain river stations was 592μatm 101 the averaged pco2 increased drastically after impoundment 2330μatm in summer 2006 and decreased significantly the subsequent 2007 and 2008 summers the difference in pco2 from 2008 to 2011 was insignificant and a drop occurred in 2012 anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 in parallel to field campaigns data analysis summer autumn as datasets were used to compute mean summer co2 partial pressures and concentrations from 2007 to 2012 table 3 the decreasing trend in pco2 observed through yearly field campaigns is confirmed with a significant decrease from summer 2007 to summer 2010 pco2 recorded by the as at eastmain 1 gs are generally higher than those measured during field campaigns in fact records in the gs are made on the integrated water column whose highly depended on the water intake depth whereas field campaigns data represented water surface measurements as presented earlier profiles conducted on the reservoir showed that pco2 increased with depth which supports these observations since june 2007 the two automated systems installed upstream the reservoir gp and in a central station of the reservoir me depicted ice free periods daily variations in pco2 table 4 and fig 3 trends observed at gp represented the natural variation of the eastmain river upstream the reservoir at this location pco2 varied from 455 in 2010 to 1323μatm in 2009 but there was no specific trend over the years see table 4 for ice free period average and the overall averaged pco2 was 656μatm 127 due to its location the me station was supposed to reflect the overall reservoir trends in pco2 here again a decrease in pco2 from 2007 to 2010 and highest values were recorded in 2011 anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 pco2 recorded at this representative station of the reservoir were higher than those measured at gp but lower than those measured 1 by the as in the eastmain 1 gs which integrate the entire water column and 2 during the field campaigns spatial variation taken into account interestingly we demonstrated that three different approaches can be used to adequately depict major trends in pco2 in a reservoir considering the absolute values pco2 values recorded in the gs were the highest in average 1 8 times higher than the measurements made at marie eve as station consequently the monitoring method must be chosen carefully considering the purpose of the study 3 3 temporal trends in pch4 in eastmain 1 reservoir contrary to pco2 pch4 partial pressures presented any pattern to outline after flooding of the eastmain 1 reservoir there was no significant difference among measurements gathered during ice free campaigns from 2006 to 2012 table 2 pch4 varied between 21 measured in summer 2010 and 250μatm measured in autumn 2011 with an overall average of 106μatm sd 91 measurements made at the different sampling stations with as gs me or gp showed the same range of partial pressures table 4 and fig 3 either on the ice free period or on the year round scales the weak ch4 concentrations observed and the absence of a trend among seasons and years is certainly linked to methane oxidation in this well oxygenated environment resulting in pco2 increase rather than ch4 even in ice cover period canelhas et al 2016 3 4 trends in pco2 and pch4 in the rupert diversion bays partial flooding of the rupert diversion bays took place in 2009 in august 2010 90 of the forebay were flooded compared to 50 for the tailbay the flooding was completed in spring 2011 this sequence is illustrated by the lag in the dissolve gases increases observed between the forebay and the tailbay fig 4a and b measurements made in the rupert diversion bays during summer field campaigns around 35 sampling stations each year showed that after impoundment pco2 increased significantly fig 4a but reached values in the range of those observed in eastmain 1 reservoir since its creation the averaged pco2 for the forebay and tailbay varied from 679μatm sd 164 before impoundment to 1303μatm sd 645 for 2010 2011 for the 2008 2009 period before flooding the mean pch4 was 31μatm sd 37 for the entire diversion it increased in 2010 after flooding in the forebay and more significantly in 2011 for the tailbay reaching a mean value of 138μatm sd 102 which is higher than what was observed in eastmain 1 reservoir fig 4b mean value of 106μatm presented earlier for eastmain 1 reservoir both pco2 and pch4 were significantly higher than those measured in nearby reference lakes all through the survey or in the impounded lakes surveyed in 2008 before the diversion reference lakes do not show significant trend through the studied years 3 5 scale down to the rupert diversion bays and eastmain 1 reservoir confluence area automated systems installed on rafts at the stations nem and rc showed high mean pco2 and pch4 in 2010 and 2011 and a clear drop in 2012 fig 3 anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 table 5 presents mean pco2 and pch4 measured at the two stations sampled yearly once per summer cache 2 and or cache 6 fig 1b in the sediment fan area downstream of the rupert diversion bays there is no evidence of pco2 increase at these stations after the bays impoundment 2010 2012 in 2010 however pch4 increased by a factor of 30 and then returned to values closer to pre impoundment pch4 in 2011 different sensors were used in various years but such differences cannot be attributed to variability among them once again the use of as combined with field campaigns allowed us to capture temporal trends and punctual events overall pco2 recorded at nem automated system were higher than those measured at rc mean pco2 1811μatm 560 and mean pco2 1234μatm 315 respectively t test p 0 05 gas diffusion at the air water interface along the rupert derivation bays outlet to the eastmain 1 reservoir explain the difference observed between these two stations this phenomenon is currently observed downstream flooded systems guérin et al 2006 kemenes et al 2011 campeau et al 2014 scaling down in september 2011 15 stations were sampled for pco2 and pch4 fig 1b to better determine the influence of the rupert diversion on eastmain 1 reservoir stations 1 to 5 5 are considered to be in the sediment fan area stations 6 5 10 11 and 15 are considered a transition zone stations 14 16 12 and 17 are influenced by the eastmain river water inflow we found no significant difference between mean pco2 measured in these three different areas anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 overall averaged pco2 1347 137μatm mean pch4 in the third area 70μatm influenced by the eastmain river was significantly lower than averaged pch4 in the transition area 312μatm and the fan area 40μatm anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 in conclusion the impoundment of the rupert river and the related transport of sediment and organic matter into eastmain 1 reservoir did not have a significant long term effect on pco2 measured in the reservoir systematic sampling conducted in 2011 in the sediment fan area downstream of the rupert diversion clearly showed a gradual dilution of ch4 in eastmain 1 reservoir it thus appears that the ch4 produced by the rupert diversion and exported into the reservoir led to a significant increase in ch4 concentration in the reservoir the downstream influence of the rupert diversion is probably due to an export of ch4 and consequently limited in time significant drop observed in 2012 by different monitoring methods rather than to an export of organic matter degraded in the reservoir 3 6 eastmain 1 reservoir co2 and ch4 diffusive emissions for each field campaign diffusive emissions were either measured fc or estimated partial pressures and tbl model since two different chambers were used during our follow up fluxes obtained in 2008 with the first type were analyzed apart for this period measured fluxes were significantly lower than estimated fluxes match pairs t test p 0 05 n 128 y 0 63x and r 2 0 58 for the subsequent years there was a strong match between measured and estimated fluxes match pairs t test p 0 05 n 338 y 0 89x and r 2 0 67 thus validating the new chamber design in this section for presentation purpose only measured fluxes are presented this decision is supported by consistent methods and because theoretically measured fluxes with fc are susceptible to be overestimated and thus more conservative co2 diffusive emissions at the air water interface ranged between 113mg c co2 m 2 day 1 negative value corresponding to co2 capture and 8237mg c co2 m 2 day 1 measured in 2008 and 2006 respectively in average highest emissions were recorded in 2006 after reservoir impoundment and lowest fluxes were measured in 2008 table 6 anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 ch4 fluxes ranged from null to 102mg c ch4 m 2 day 1 measured in 2010 in average highest ch4 emission was recorded in 2010 whereas lowest emission was measured in 2007 anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 in 2012 6 years and half after the beginning of the reservoir creation mean co2 and ch4 diffusive emissions were 791mg c co2 m 2 day 1 563 and 6 3mg c ch4 m 2 day 1 7 7 respectively in quebec overall measurements made in lakes and rivers in the context of ghg emissions studies related to reservoirs hydro quebec datasets between 1999 and 2012 n 1123 unpublished results showed averaged co2 emissions of 296mg c co2 m 2 day 1 359 eastmain 1 reservoir emissions are thus close to the range of those observed in these systems according to other studies tremblay et al 2005 abril et al 2005 the observed decreasing trend would continue at a smaller extent for the three consecutive years teodoru et al 2012 then 10 years after flooding the eastmain 1 reservoir is expected to behave like a natural lake in terms of diffusive emissions 3 7 wintertime respiration rates variations in co2 concentration in the system were monitored year round with the as installed in eastmain 1 generating station in winter the daily pattern presented in fig 4 is not observable due to co2 accumulation under ice cover the heterotrophic activity rc is considered as the main metabolic activity in the reservoir photosynthesis being reduced by the low light availability under ice cover huner et al 1998 the difference in co2 concentrations at the beginning of the winter and at the peak just before ice break up and the corresponding number of days around 165 were used to calculate the daily rc at the whole reservoir scale thereby decreasing rc rates were found from winter 2006 2007 to winter 2011 2012 with values ranging respectively from 1 5 to 0 8μmoll 1 day 1 table 3 this decreasing trend is viewed as the result of the drop in organic matter availability in the reservoir over the years this pattern was also observed by venkiteswaran et al 2013 in experimental boreal reservoirs 4 conclusion results presented in this article confirm the predicted co2 trend emissions from a boreal reservoir by teodoru et al 2012 with a net decrease in the first three years followed by a co2 emissions stabilization around seven years after the reservoir creation see fig 2a the novelty in our article lies in the different methods used to demonstrate this phenomenon all of them showing the same trend the present study advocates for long term ghg monitoring around 10 years the use of various methods beforehand intercalibrated thereby offers a non negligible flexibility reducing the sampling costs which should favor an increase in this kind of studies worldwide the present study also demonstrates that methane concentrations in the eastmain 1 reservoir were very low did not vary with time after flooding and were not impacted by the flooding of the rupert diversion bays in this last area an increase in methane was observed after flooding further measurements are planned in 2018 to document the evolution of this phenomenon with time however it is hypothesized that methane concentration will reach weak values comparable to those of the eastmain 1 reservoir thus our understanding of the studied watersheds tends to demonstrate that methane is not a ghg of concern considering the reservoirs lifetime we also demonstrated that the supersaturation in co2 observed in the eastmain 1 reservoir by the end of winter is supported by the winter respiration and co2 accumulation under the water year after year the availability of the leachable and labile organic matter derived from the flooded soils decreases resulting in lower background pco2 for the ice free period finally we demonstrated that the impoundment of an upstream reservoir had no influence on the metabolism of the eastmain 1 reservoir these results indicate that the flooded soils contribution is negligible after 7 years and that the reservoir effect is over within a 10 years period as predicted by tremblay et al 2005 conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgments we acknowledge jean

1096,eastmain 1 reservoir james bay area quebec canada is a 600km2 boreal reservoir created in november 2005 in the eastmain river watershed to increase the volume of water transiting in eastmain 1 em 1 the rupert river was diverted partial flooding of the rupert diversion bays rd took place in 2009 and the flooding was completed in 2011 co2 and ch4 partial pressures and emissions were monitored for 7 years on the reservoir and bays according to field campaigns measurements at eastmain 1 reservoir average ice free period pco2 varied between 969μatm and 2230μatm whereas the average pco2 of the reference sampled lakes and eastmain river stations was 592μatm 101 before the impoundment contrary to pco2 pch4 partial pressures presented any pattern to outline after flooding of the eastmain 1 reservoir and varied between 21 and 250μatm with an overall average of 106μatm sd 91 co2 diffusive emissions at the air water interface of the eastmain 1 reservoir ranged between 113mg c co2 m 2 day 1 and 8237mg c co2 m 2 day 1 ch4 fluxes ranged from null to 102mg c ch4 m 2 day 1 this article also shows that the impoundment of the rupert river and the related transport of sediment and organic matter into eastmain 1 reservoir did not have a significant long term effect on pco2 remarkably the different approaches methods used to monitor these variables showed comparable results a net decrease in co2 emissions in the first three years followed by stabilization around seven years after the reservoir creation therefore we advocate for long term around 10 years ghg monitoring the use of various methods beforehand intercalibrated offers a non negligible flexibility reducing the sampling costs which should favor an increase in this kind of studies worldwide keywords pco2 pch4 ghg

diffusive and bubble emissions in the river up to 50km downstream the dam in canada preliminary results showed that bubbling was of minor extent compared to diffusive emissions bastien et al 2010 degassing estimates are under study unpublished data here we thus focused on diffusive fluxes according to the available studies on young and old reservoirs worldwide the magnitude of co2 diffusive

2005 marchand et al 2012 as well as for tropical reservoirs abril et al 2005 demarty and bastien 2011 after the first 10 years co2 emissions are similar to those from natural aquatic systems in the

also related to sedimentation rate and its nature delsontro et al 2010 several methods can be used to monitor emissions before and after a reservoir creation such as floating chambers automated

some other studies demonstrated disparities between methods vachon et al 2010 the need of new data about ghg emissions from reservoir is recognized worldwide for novel insights and better understanding of the processes involved hence the main objective of the present article is to present new dataset on ghg emissions from reservoir considering the use of recognized approaches and methods however the quality the temporal and spatial distribution of our data and the different methods used in our follow up allowed robust analysis of the technologies and approaches in one hand and of the pattern of ghg concentrations and emissions in the other hand these analyses were based on the following hypothesis in 2009 demarty et al reported a matching between trends stemming from measurements made either with automated systems in generating station or during discrete field campaigns for the first years after impoundment we hypothesize this concordance to be valuable for the entire study period in 2012 teodoru et al presented the decreasing trend in co2 emissions at the eastmain 1 reservoir from its impoundment in 2005 2009 according to their results we expected co2 emissions for the 2009 2012 period to be much lower however the impoundment of the rupert bays upstream the eastmain 1 reservoir in 2010 represented an important input of organic matter in the reservoir it was then hypothesized that this event led to an increase in surface co2 and ch4 partial pressures in the eastmain 1 reservoir 2 material and methods 2 1 study area eastmain 1 reservoir 52 19 n 75 05 w fig 1a is located in the boreal zone northwestern québec canada within this region mean monthly temperatures vary between 23 c and 14 c and total rainfall and total snow precipitation are up to 430mm and 260mm respectively the eastmain river s catchment 25 857km2 is dominated by coniferous forest shallow podzolic and peat soils and igneous bedrock the aquatic system studied is oligotrophic with an overall low primary production planas et al 2005 the reservoir is partially to totally covered by ice from about 15 december to 15 may according to hydro québec surveys eastmain 1 reservoir 603km2 was flooded in november 2005 and the generating station 480mw was commissioned in 2006 the eastmain 1 a sarcelle rupert project aimed to give hydro québec s generating fleet additional capacity of 918mw and additional output of 8 7twh per year it implied an increase in the volume of the eastmain 1 reservoir and by diverting the rupert river partial flooding of the rupert river diversion rd started in 2009 with the upstream bay 229km2 and the flooding was completed in 2011 in the downstream bay 118km2 fig 1c the rd bays flow into the southeast section of eastmain 1 reservoir 600m3 s 1 the zone of sedimentation at the point of entry into the reservoir is presented in fig 1b this map also presents ghg sampling stations in this specific area sampling dates between 2005 so called reference lakes and river sampled before reservoir creation and 2012 and the number of sampling stations visited once per sampling period are described in table 1 sampling strategy regarding the spatial variability and sampling stations location for the field campaigns are described in demarty et al 2011 2 2 field campaigns co2 and ch4 partial pressures measurements and fluxes calculation the partial pressure of co2 and ch4 pco2 and pch4 was measured at the water surface 0 1m for all sampling stations at eastmain 1 reservoir to measure pco2 water was sampled with a peristaltic pump and surface water pco2 was measured in situ with a non dispersive infrared ndir sensor egm 4 manufactured by pp systems coupled with a gas exchanger membrana celgard ten consecutive measurements one per minute were averaged to obtain the pco2 at each station mean variation coefficient of 1 3 due to technical improvement with time different sensors techniques were used for pch4 measurements head space technique and chromatography flame ionization detector demarty et al 2011 were used in 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 peristaltic pump and gas exchanger setup as for pco2 coupled with a tunable diode laser spectroscopy sensor tdls manufactured by franatech were used in 2009 2011 and 2012 co2 and ch4 dissolve concentrations were calculated according to demarty et al 2011 diffusive fluxes were then calculated according to thin boundary layer tbl model and estimates of k 600 from vachon and prairie 2013 model c these authors argue for a better predictive model when using lake area together with wind speed which we measured also considering that wind speed to k 600 relationships are site specific and that the majority of vachon and prairie s samples came from eastmain 1 reservoir this equation was the most suitable to our study 2 3 co2 and ch4 surface diffusive fluxes measurement point in time diffusive flux measurements were made using a floating chamber fc this method is known to overestimate the fluxes due to excess turbulence created by the chamber macintyre et al 1995 vachon et al 2010 for technical reasons turbulences were not measured concomitantly to fluxes and therefore not taken into account to correct fluxes accordingly in 2008 the gas collection chamber was rectangular made of plastic has an area of 0 20m2 and a volume of 18l the subsequent years the chamber was improved with a tapered shape heavier structure for better stability aluminum and fixed buoys but similar area 0 16m2 and volume 17 6l in both cases the chamber walls extended 15cm under water thus ensuring a tight seal between the chamber and the water usually the chamber was ventilated 5min before the flux measurement begins until the air ghg concentration measured by the gas analysers stabilizes and was comparable to that in the atmosphere approximately 385μatm for co2 and 1 8μatm for ch4 measured in the study area after the chamber was set on the water surface the internal pressure was equalized with that of the atmosphere by means of a port positioned on top of the chamber this port was hermetically sealed with a rubber stopper at the beginning of the flux measurement an external pump circulates air between the chamber and the gas analysers a flow meter allows the circuit air flow to be controlled at 2 8lmin 1 over the years for technical reasons ghg fluxes were measured using different sensors coupled in closed circuit to the floating collection chamber co2 and ch4 diffusive emissions were measured using a gasmet dx4010 fourier transform infra red sensor in 2006 and 2007 in 2008 and 2009 only co2 emissions were measured using a ppsystems ciras sc non dispersive infra red sensor finally from 2010 to 2012 co2 and ch4 diffusive emissions were measured using a picarro g1301 in any case the flux measurement was carried out over a period of 7min during which the co2 ch4 partial pressure trapped under the chamber was constantly recorded the linear regression slope was used to calculate a ghg flux in mgco2 m 2 day 1 or in mgch4 m 2 day 1 representing a ghg quantity emitted or collected per area and time unit using the following equation flux slope f 1 f 2 volume area where f1 is a conversion factor from μatm to mgm 3 for normal temperature and pressure conditions 25 c and 101 3kpa f2 is a conversion factor of seconds on a daily basis and the volume and area are those of the floating chamber three replicates were measured per sampling station 2 4 continuous co2 and ch4 partial pressures measurements with automated systems the continuous gas monitor was developed by fisheries and oceans canada in conjunction with manitoba hydro after carignan s design 1998 and built of commercial components every three hours co2 and ch4 are measured by two different sensors licor li 820 ndir sensor and neodym panterra metal oxide semiconductor sensor respectively on a gas stream that has been equilibrated with the source water demarty et al 2009 long term partial pressure measurements taken at a single sampling station with monitors installed in gs have been shown to give conservative compared to point in time measurements with floating chambers and representative estimates of ghg fluxes for the whole reservoir québec and manitoba demarty et al 2009 automated ghg systems monitors as have been in place at eastmain 1 generating station gs since 2006 to obtain co2 and ch4 partial pressure time series since june 2007 and for the ice free period june to october two as were installed on rafts the as located in the eastmain river upstream the reservoir gorge prospere gp in fig 1 was representative of the partial pressures entering the reservoir the second as was installed in the center of the reservoir marie eve me in fig 1 since june 2010 and for the ice free period two additional rafts with as were installed at the entrance of the rupert diversion into eastmain 1 reservoir the as at nemiscau nem was dedicated to the outflow from the rupert diversion whereas as at ruisseau caché rc was at the confluence of the two water bodies 2 5 ancillary water quality measurements each sampling station was located according to a gps garmin wgs 84 total depth at the sampling stations was measured with a depth meter digital hondex water column transparency was estimated with a secchi disc atmospheric pressure air temperature and wind speed were measured with a portative weather station kestrel extech instruments 407112 surface and profiles for water temperature ph and dissolved oxygen concentration were measured with a ysi 600xl alcalinity was measured with a ph meter thermo orion tree stars 8102 bnwp 3 results and discussion 3 1 general observations at the eastmain 1 reservoir surface water quality transparency temperature ph alkalinity dissolve oxygen saturation and meteorological wind speed air temperature parameters measured for 6 years at eastmain 1 reservoir are presented in table 2 means and standard deviations a significant increase in transparency was observed from 2006 to 2011 anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 concomitantly ph increased anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 as expected this trend in ph was related to decrease in pco2 however the weakness of the relationship tend to demonstrate that ph measured on the field in situ ysi probe is not sensitive enough to be used as a proxy for pco2 estimation regression p 0 05 r 2 0 47 the entire system is well oxygenated apart from two stations that experienced o2 depletion in the first spring after flooding april 2008 concentrations of 3 1 and 3 2mgl 1 were measured compared to an average of 10 0 1 1mgl 1 for the 34 other stations monitored at the same period summertime sampling showed a stratification of the reservoir for stations deeper than 8m with low o2 and high co2 concentrations at the bottom autumnal sampling did not show this stratification confirming that the water column mixing occurred before our autumnal campaigns as lakes and rivers the eastmain 1 reservoir was supersaturated in co2 for the entire study period hydrometric follow up showed two flood events per year fig 1d in spring and fall they represent organic matter inputs that surely sustained the heterotrophic mode of the system and favored the co2 supersaturation indeed berggren et al 2012 demonstrated that in heterotrophic systems the respiratory quotient moles of co2 produced per mole of o2 consumed of the bacterioplankton was higher than in autotrophic systems hence allochtonous organic matter entering the system twice a year leads to more co2 per o2 consumed than would have done organic matter produced by the algal community of the reservoir 3 2 temporal trends in pco2 in eastmain 1 reservoir results from year round pco2 monitored with an as installed in eastmain 1 generating station gs are presented in fig 2a and measurements from field campaigns are presented in fig 2b as stated in demarty et al 2009 measurements made on the water passing through the turbines should be representative of the whole reservoir in that article authors presented conclusions from one year measurement at eastmain 1 reservoir and several years of measurements in manitoba reservoirs the multi annual datasets presented in this article tend to confirm their observations trends depicted from 2006 to 2012 as results are similar to those from field campaigns measurements for the same period the advantage of the as is clearly to get a year round dataset which is not feasible with field campaigns that cannot be performed in spring and late autumn for security reasons ice break up or formation pco2 trends can be described as follow first pco2 increase under ice cover demarty et al 2011 huttunen et al 2004 is clearly demonstrated every year with the highest peak in pco2 observed the first winter after impoundment 2007 winter field campaigns performed in 2007 and 2008 corroborate as measurements in case of eastmain 1 under ice cover pco2 increase observed is an indication of the degradation of in situ organic matter as during winter organic matter income from the watershed is relatively small 23 of the summer income in the main channel incomes in dentritic parts of the reservoir are thus considered close to null information form hydro québec hydrometric services not shown secondly springtime degassing linked to ice break up is obvious measured pco2 at the end of this degassing phase decreased year after year anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 this corresponds to a background pco2 for the ice free period third as records showed that lowest pco2 values are reached at the end of autumn at eastmain 1 reservoir according to field campaigns measurements average ice free period pco2 varied between 969μatm summer 2012 and 2230μatm autumn 2006 fig 2 and table 2 before impoundment 2005 the average pco2 of the reference sampled lakes and eastmain river stations was 592μatm 101 the averaged pco2 increased drastically after impoundment 2330μatm in summer 2006 and decreased significantly the subsequent 2007 and 2008 summers the difference in pco2 from 2008 to 2011 was insignificant and a drop occurred in 2012 anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 in parallel to field campaigns data analysis summer autumn as datasets were used to compute mean summer co2 partial pressures and concentrations from 2007 to 2012 table 3 the decreasing trend in pco2 observed through yearly field campaigns is confirmed with a significant decrease from summer 2007 to summer 2010 pco2 recorded by the as at eastmain 1 gs are generally higher than those measured during field campaigns in fact records in the gs are made on the integrated water column whose highly depended on the water intake depth whereas field campaigns data represented water surface measurements as presented earlier profiles conducted on the reservoir showed that pco2 increased with depth which supports these observations since june 2007 the two automated systems installed upstream the reservoir gp and in a central station of the reservoir me depicted ice free periods daily variations in pco2 table 4 and fig 3 trends observed at gp represented the natural variation of the eastmain river upstream the reservoir at this location pco2 varied from 455 in 2010 to 1323μatm in 2009 but there was no specific trend over the years see table 4 for ice free period average and the overall averaged pco2 was 656μatm 127 due to its location the me station was supposed to reflect the overall reservoir trends in pco2 here again a decrease in pco2 from 2007 to 2010 and highest values were recorded in 2011 anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 pco2 recorded at this representative station of the reservoir were higher than those measured at gp but lower than those measured 1 by the as in the eastmain 1 gs which integrate the entire water column and 2 during the field campaigns spatial variation taken into account interestingly we demonstrated that three different approaches can be used to adequately depict major trends in pco2 in a reservoir considering the absolute values pco2 values recorded in the gs were the highest in average 1 8 times higher than the measurements made at marie eve as station consequently the monitoring method must be chosen carefully considering the purpose of the study 3 3 temporal trends in pch4 in eastmain 1 reservoir contrary to pco2 pch4 partial pressures presented any pattern to outline after flooding of the eastmain 1 reservoir there was no significant difference among measurements gathered during ice free campaigns from 2006 to 2012 table 2 pch4 varied between 21 measured in summer 2010 and 250μatm measured in autumn 2011 with an overall average of 106μatm sd 91 measurements made at the different sampling stations with as gs me or gp showed the same range of partial pressures table 4 and fig 3 either on the ice free period or on the year round scales the weak ch4 concentrations observed and the absence of a trend among seasons and years is certainly linked to methane oxidation in this well oxygenated environment resulting in pco2 increase rather than ch4 even in ice cover period canelhas et al 2016 3 4 trends in pco2 and pch4 in the rupert diversion bays partial flooding of the rupert diversion bays took place in 2009 in august 2010 90 of the forebay were flooded compared to 50 for the tailbay the flooding was completed in spring 2011 this sequence is illustrated by the lag in the dissolve gases increases observed between the forebay and the tailbay fig 4a and b measurements made in the rupert diversion bays during summer field campaigns around 35 sampling stations each year showed that after impoundment pco2 increased significantly fig 4a but reached values in the range of those observed in eastmain 1 reservoir since its creation the averaged pco2 for the forebay and tailbay varied from 679μatm sd 164 before impoundment to 1303μatm sd 645 for 2010 2011 for the 2008 2009 period before flooding the mean pch4 was 31μatm sd 37 for the entire diversion it increased in 2010 after flooding in the forebay and more significantly in 2011 for the tailbay reaching a mean value of 138μatm sd 102 which is higher than what was observed in eastmain 1 reservoir fig 4b mean value of 106μatm presented earlier for eastmain 1 reservoir both pco2 and pch4 were significantly higher than those measured in nearby reference lakes all through the survey or in the impounded lakes surveyed in 2008 before the diversion reference lakes do not show significant trend through the studied years 3 5 scale down to the rupert diversion bays and eastmain 1 reservoir confluence area automated systems installed on rafts at the stations nem and rc showed high mean pco2 and pch4 in 2010 and 2011 and a clear drop in 2012 fig 3 anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 table 5 presents mean pco2 and pch4 measured at the two stations sampled yearly once per summer cache 2 and or cache 6 fig 1b in the sediment fan area downstream of the rupert diversion bays there is no evidence of pco2 increase at these stations after the bays impoundment 2010 2012 in 2010 however pch4 increased by a factor of 30 and then returned to values closer to pre impoundment pch4 in 2011 different sensors were used in various years but such differences cannot be attributed to variability among them once again the use of as combined with field campaigns allowed us to capture temporal trends and punctual events overall pco2 recorded at nem automated system were higher than those measured at rc mean pco2 1811μatm 560 and mean pco2 1234μatm 315 respectively t test p 0 05 gas diffusion at the air water interface along the rupert derivation bays outlet to the eastmain 1 reservoir explain the difference observed between these two stations this phenomenon is currently observed downstream flooded systems guérin et al 2006 kemenes et al 2011 campeau et al 2014 scaling down in september 2011 15 stations were sampled for pco2 and pch4 fig 1b to better determine the influence of the rupert diversion on eastmain 1 reservoir stations 1 to 5 5 are considered to be in the sediment fan area stations 6 5 10 11 and 15 are considered a transition zone stations 14 16 12 and 17 are influenced by the eastmain river water inflow we found no significant difference between mean pco2 measured in these three different areas anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 overall averaged pco2 1347 137μatm mean pch4 in the third area 70μatm influenced by the eastmain river was significantly lower than averaged pch4 in the transition area 312μatm and the fan area 40μatm anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 in conclusion the impoundment of the rupert river and the related transport of sediment and organic matter into eastmain 1 reservoir did not have a significant long term effect on pco2 measured in the reservoir systematic sampling conducted in 2011 in the sediment fan area downstream of the rupert diversion clearly showed a gradual dilution of ch4 in eastmain 1 reservoir it thus appears that the ch4 produced by the rupert diversion and exported into the reservoir led to a significant increase in ch4 concentration in the reservoir the downstream influence of the rupert diversion is probably due to an export of ch4 and consequently limited in time significant drop observed in 2012 by different monitoring methods rather than to an export of organic matter degraded in the reservoir 3 6 eastmain 1 reservoir co2 and ch4 diffusive emissions for each field campaign diffusive emissions were either measured fc or estimated partial pressures and tbl model since two different chambers were used during our follow up fluxes obtained in 2008 with the first type were analyzed apart for this period measured fluxes were significantly lower than estimated fluxes match pairs t test p 0 05 n 128 y 0 63x and r 2 0 58 for the subsequent years there was a strong match between measured and estimated fluxes match pairs t test p 0 05 n 338 y 0 89x and r 2 0 67 thus validating the new chamber design in this section for presentation purpose only measured fluxes are presented this decision is supported by consistent methods and because theoretically measured fluxes with fc are susceptible to be overestimated and thus more conservative co2 diffusive emissions at the air water interface ranged between 113mg c co2 m 2 day 1 negative value corresponding to co2 capture and 8237mg c co2 m 2 day 1 measured in 2008 and 2006 respectively in average highest emissions were recorded in 2006 after reservoir impoundment and lowest fluxes were measured in 2008 table 6 anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 ch4 fluxes ranged from null to 102mg c ch4 m 2 day 1 measured in 2010 in average highest ch4 emission was recorded in 2010 whereas lowest emission was measured in 2007 anova and tukey kramer p 0 05 in 2012 6 years and half after the beginning of the reservoir creation mean co2 and ch4 diffusive emissions were 791mg c co2 m 2 day 1 563 and 6 3mg c ch4 m 2 day 1 7 7 respectively in quebec overall measurements made in lakes and rivers in the context of ghg emissions studies related to reservoirs hydro quebec datasets between 1999 and 2012 n 1123 unpublished results showed averaged co2 emissions of 296mg c co2 m 2 day 1 359 eastmain 1 reservoir emissions are thus close to the range of those observed in these systems according to other studies tremblay et al 2005 abril et al 2005 the observed decreasing trend would continue at a smaller extent for the three consecutive years teodoru et al 2012 then 10 years after flooding the eastmain 1 reservoir is expected to behave like a natural lake in terms of diffusive emissions 3 7 wintertime respiration rates variations in co2 concentration in the system were monitored year round with the as installed in eastmain 1 generating station in winter the daily pattern presented in fig 4 is not observable due to co2 accumulation under ice cover the heterotrophic activity rc is considered as the main metabolic activity in the reservoir photosynthesis being reduced by the low light availability under ice cover huner et al 1998 the difference in co2 concentrations at the beginning of the winter and at the peak just before ice break up and the corresponding number of days around 165 were used to calculate the daily rc at the whole reservoir scale thereby decreasing rc rates were found from winter 2006 2007 to winter 2011 2012 with values ranging respectively from 1 5 to 0 8μmoll 1 day 1 table 3 this decreasing trend is viewed as the result of the drop in organic matter availability in the reservoir over the years this pattern was also observed by venkiteswaran et al 2013 in experimental boreal reservoirs 4 conclusion results presented in this article confirm the predicted co2 trend emissions from a boreal reservoir by teodoru et al 2012 with a net decrease in the first three years followed by a co2 emissions stabilization around seven years after the reservoir creation see fig 2a the novelty in our article lies in the different methods used to demonstrate this phenomenon all of them showing the same trend the present study advocates for long term ghg monitoring around 10 years the use of various methods beforehand intercalibrated thereby offers a non negligible flexibility reducing the sampling costs which should favor an increase in this kind of studies worldwide the present study also demonstrates that methane concentrations in the eastmain 1 reservoir were very low did not vary with time after flooding and were not impacted by the flooding of the rupert diversion bays in this last area an increase in methane was observed after flooding further measurements are planned in 2018 to document the evolution of this phenomenon with time however it is hypothesized that methane concentration will reach weak values comparable to those of the eastmain 1 reservoir thus our understanding of the studied watersheds tends to demonstrate that methane is not a ghg of concern considering the reservoirs lifetime we also demonstrated that the supersaturation in co2 observed in the eastmain 1 reservoir by the end of winter is supported by the winter respiration and co2 accumulation under the water year after year the availability of the leachable and labile organic matter derived from the flooded soils decreases resulting in lower background pco2 for the ice free period finally we demonstrated that the impoundment of an upstream reservoir had no influence on the metabolism of the eastmain 1 reservoir these results indicate that the flooded soils contribution is negligible after 7 years and that the reservoir effect is over within a 10 years period as predicted by tremblay et al 2005 conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgments we acknowledge jean

1097,this paper presents results of greenhouse gas ghg measurements in the pre filling phase of three hydroelectric reservoirs in brazil belo monte hydroelectric complex batalha hydroelectric plant and santo ant nio hydroelectric plant in contrast to most of the estimates available in the literature on hydroelectric reservoirs which take into consideration only gross emissions these data will enable the calculation of the net emissions of the hydroelectric reservoirs studied carbon dioxide and methane flux measurements were carried out in terrestrial in different types of soil and vegetation and aquatic rivers lakes and marshes ecosystems before the reservoir flooding in each reservoir four measurement campaigns were carried out in order to represent different rainfall regimes and river water levels the median values of ch4 emissions were 9 97 3 55mgch4 m 2 day 1 and 11 34 1 62mgch4 m 2 day 1 for pasture and forest landuse types respectively for co2 emission was 10 448 41 3036 48mgco2 m 2 day 1 and 8004 50 1314 98mgco2 m 2 day 1 for pasture and forest lands respectively the median fluxes for n2o were near zero and 0 78 0 56mgn2om 2 day 1 for pasture and 0 67 0 29mgn2om 2 day 1 for forest the study showed that the terrestrial areas prior reservoir creation act as potential emitters of greenhouse gases hydropower sites under construction where hydroelectric reservoirs have not been installed yet create a great opportunity to carry out gas flux measurements in the pre filling phase the results can be further compared with the same measurements after the dam closure in order to more precisely estimate the net reservoir emissions in the case of reservoirs already built off course the possibility of taking pre filling phase measurements no longer exists however the results of the present study allow for reassessment of the available flux estimates for such reservoirs keywords methane carbon dioxide nitrous oxide hydropower reservoirs 1 introduction the possibility that the contribution of hydropower plants to global anthropogenic greenhouse gase ghg emissions may not be negligible has been indicated by several studies done in hydropower reservoirs rosa and schaeffer 1994 some studies identified hydropower reservoirs as potential sources of ghg rudd et al 1993 st louis et al 2000 at the end of the 1990s the broad review performed by the world commission on dams wcd on the development effectiveness of large dams included in its themes the role of dams in contributing the greenhouse effect a report prepared for the wcd by rosa and santos 2000 which was included in the wcd s final report 2000 prompted much debate on this topic worldwide the motivating point of this research was to introduce the concept of net emissions of greenhouse gases in hydroelectric plants according to iea 2012 net emissions of greenhouse effect gases are defined as differences between the balances of post filling emissions and removals excluding emissions from anthropogenic sources not related to the reservoir and the balances of gas emissions and removals in the pre filling stage in contrast to most estimates available in the literature on hydroelectric plants which consider only gross emissions the concept of net emissions introduces the description understanding and measurement of processes affecting carbon and nitrogen storage and transport in the flooding area before and after the filling of the reservoir in this sense measurement campaigns during the construction stage of the plants before the closure of the dams to fill the reservoirs aim to measure the gases in conditions prior to the formation of these reservoirs sites of hydroelectric projects under construction where the reservoirs have not yet been installed constitute a great opportunity to carry out gas flux measurements in the pre filling stage in cases where reservoirs have already been installed the possibility of going to the field to measure pre filling fluxes is no longer available and the estimation of these emissions is done based on a mapping of the soil coverage and use before filling associating the typologies found to gas fluxes values available in the literature for the study areas or in similar areas thus in addition to providing the opportunity for net emissions estimates based entirely on specific measurements for the studied uses the pre filling campaigns add to the available database to support estimates of pre filling emissions from existing reservoirs in the pre impoundment period regimes of transformations transport and storage of carbon and nitrogen containing compounds are established at each different places of the reservoir at the upland compartment the biomass of vegetation and surface soil peat layer cover may make it a sink area of co2 the floodplain may be a significant source of ch4 where permanent carbon burial may occur at a significant rate in the water bodies surface the river and streams transport water and sediments collected by the drainage network in the upstream watershed this is combined in the downstream to the water and sediments collected by the drainage network in the floodplain and from the upland lands of the inundation area within the flowing river ghg emissions are constantly produced by microbial community activity in general the water bodies surface is conceived to act in the pre impoundment period as a source area for co2 ch4 and n2o whereas at the lakes sub compartment substantial permanent carbon burial rate can be present 2 materials and methods 2 1 reservoirs studied the belo monte hydroelectric complex is located in the xingu river basin in the amazon belo monte has 11 233mw of installed capacity and the reservoir comprises 503km2 the xingu river belongs to the amazonian central fluvial system and has an extensive network of igarapés and igapós in rivers of white and black waters where the marginal forest is periodically flooded during the flood period junk et al 1989 it is one of the main tributaries of the right bank of the amazon river ending in the proximity of the city of porto de moz pa approximately 300km east of santarém and 400km from the city of belém the river regime of the medium and low xingu region follows the rainfall regime of the region showing floods from december to may with peaks in march and april in contrast the ebb period is concentrated between the months of may and november with minimal precipitation in the months of august october the batalha hydroelectric plant is located in the paranaíba river basin in the cerrado biome region and has 52 5mw of installed capacity the reservoir area is 138km2 the plant still under construction is located in the são marcos river one of the main tributaries of the right bank of the paranaíba river and divides the states of minas gerais and goiás at the border between the municipalities of paracatu and cristalina respectively the santo antônio hydroelectric power plant is located in the madeira river basin in the amazon region the plant has 3150mw of installed capacity and a reservoir of 350km2 the madeira river has a flow that varies from 4000m3 per second in the dry season to 45 000m3 per second in the flood the flooded areas will be virtually the same as those occurring during the annual floods of the madeira river table 1 shows information about the studied reservoirs field campaigns were performed from march 2011 to december 2012 table 2 shows the seasonal campaigns schedule the measurement campaigns in belo monte occurred in march july september and december 2012 in each campaign diffusive flux samplings were carried out by chambers in 14 soil sites 7 in riparian forest and 7 outside the riparian forest grasslands pasture creeping vegetation in the aquatic area river and streams diffusive flow samplings were carried out by floating chambers at 25 points ebbulitive flux samplings by funnels in 13 points the campaigns in santo antonio took place in may september and december 2011 and march 2012 in these campaigns samples of diffusive flow were carried out by soil chambers in 18 points being 11 in riparian forest and 2 in pasture and 5 in deforested area in the river diffusive flow samplings were carried out by floating chambers in 33 points ebbulitive flux samplings by funnels in 16 points the campaigns in batalha occurred in march june september and december 2011 in each campaign samples of diffusive flux were carried out by soil chambers in 14 points 7 in riparian forest and 7 outside the riparian forest grass pasture vegetation creeping in the river diffusive flux samplings were carried out by floating chambers at 25 points ebbulitive flux samplings by funnels in 13 points table 3 shows the land cover area of the reservoirs studied the location of each measurement sites within land use classes in terrestrial areas was determined by a series of issues such as accessibility of sites presence of land routes and spatial representation in the context of each class of use some sampling sites are close to the river channel and others distant however generally no site suffers periodic flooding of the river the measurements sites in water are determined as follows a floating chambers homogeneously distributed in the area of the rivers involving at least three sub areas downstream of the future dam the central body of the future reservoir and arms of rivers with areas of less water circulation in our study in the used chamber a volume of 1000ml and area of 0 047m2 is used and the samples are taken at times that varied from time zero 2min 4min and 8min after the initial time with the results of the chromatographic analysis of the samples of the floating chamber a linear adjustment with the four concentrations is made to obtain the rate of growth positive flow or decay negative flow of the concentration of the gases inside the chamber b funnels the placement of the funnels in the rivers has shrunk the criterion that the shallower areas are gas emitters while the region of the central body of the rivers present higher velocities of current and they provide a more sandy bed not being emitters of gases the sampling points determined in the first campaign were revisited exactly in the same places considering the geographical coordinates and gps signal degradation figs 1 3 presents the sampling sites of each reservoir studied 2 2 methods estimates of pre existing emissions were calculated from measurements of fluxes between surface and atmosphere for the three considered greenhouse gases co2 ch4 and n2o made at spatially distributed sites at the inundation areas the inundation areas were schematically divided into two compartments aquatic areas river and lakes and land areas the land areas were further divided in sub compartments representing the different coverage and land uses it was sought to adopt as far as the conditions of access permitted a random process for the choice of measuring points within each sub compartment the obtained spatial distributions were considered representative for each campaign representative estimates of the flux of each gas at each sub compartment were obtained together with assessments of their uncertainties assuming that measured values deviate from the sub compartment mean gas flux by the sum of homogeneous spatial random variations inside the sub compartment area and homogeneous random measurement errors simple arithmetic mean would be adequate to estimate the mean gas fluxes otherwise we have used the median of the measured values as a more robust estimation method providing protection against occurrence of outliers and against cases of different accuracies as the median is used bootstrap method provided the standard uncertainties efron and tibshirani 1993 annual representative flux values for each gas and compartment were calculated using the arithmetic mean of the four campaign estimated values in this method we synthetically construct other sets of single measurements of the same length by resampling the actual set of single measurements with replacement for each synthetically constructed set of measurements we calculate the median the standard deviation of these synthetic medians is the standard uncertainty the error bars are computed using the median minus and plus the standard uncertainty geometric mean can be a good estimator especially when the random variability is well modeled using lognormal distribution and we have large samples for contaminated data and moderate samples median are better shih and binkowitz 1987 it was decided to not replicate measurements at each location in favor of visiting a larger number of locations the geographical location of the studied reservoirs is presented in fig 4 our field equipment are a diffusive fluxes at water air interface diffusive gas fluxes at the water air interface in the river floating diffusion chambers were used the representative values of each campaign for the diffusive fluxes were calculated by the medians of the fluxes measured in the diffusion chambers operated during the campaign b diffusive fluxes at soils the gases fluxes from the soil were measured by the static chambers method the chambers are made up of a pvc ring with 30cm diameter and 14cm height equipped with a copper capillary respirator cover and a septum for syringe sampling fig 5 the chambers were inserted in the soil at depths ranging from 2 to 20mm to ensure sealing and then 30ml air samples were taken from the chamber with a 60ml polypropylene syringe samples were taken at intervals of 0 5 10 15 and 20min after the introduction of the chambers in the soil in case of ch4 and co2 and at 0 5 15 20 and 30min in case of n2o subsequently gas samples were transferred to pre evacuated glass bottles and kept until analysis c funnels the ebbulitive flux occurs due to the release of bubbles produced in the reservoir bottom sediment the bubbles were captured using inverted funnels made of waterproof material each funnel covers area of 0 69m2 and its vertex is connected to a volumetric bottle which is used to collect the samples fig 6 d gas analysis the concentrations of gases of the samples were determined by gas chromatography in the same day of the sampling shimadzu gas chromatograph the concentrations of ch4 co2 and n2o were determined by gas chromatography using porapack q columns and fid tcd ecd respectively for the bubbling fluxes the river area was stratified into depth zones 0 5m 5 10m 10 15m 15 20m 20m the bubbling flux in the fifth zone was considered null for the other zones the median of the measurements of the set of inverted funnels traps placed in these depth bands was considered the representative value was calculated as the average of the zone medians weighted by the zone areas as regards the diffusive gas fluxes in soil a classification of the use and coverage of the region to be flooded was used moreover for each land use class the fluxes were established according to the following criteria i measurements through soil diffusion chambers were used for the ch4 and n2o gases in the campaigns ii co2 fluxes from livestock areas and annual crops were not considered following the ipcc guidelines ipcc 2006 which suggest to consider net co2 emissions in these areas as null since the co2 captured by photosynthesis returns to the atmosphere through respiration iii in the case of co2 flux in natural environments forests savannas fields and caatingas as the chambers are heavily influenced by soil respiration data from the literature of experiments that take photosynthesis into account were used e g eddy covariance measurement towers in particular for forests due to the great uncertainties involved in the co2 balance of these areas three flux scenarios were considered a removal scenario a removal of 0 89tonc ha year 894mgc m2 day measured in studies located in mature natural tropical forests phillips et al 1998 malhi and phillips 2004 b neutral scenario a forest that is basically neutral in the balance of positive and negative co2 fluxes and c emission

access permitted a random process for the choice of measuring points within each luc the obtained spatial distributions were considered representative land use class luc meaning that is the observed bio physical cover on the earth s surface 3 results 3 1 belo monte the literature on effect gas emissions prior to reservoir filling is scarce and little attention has been paid to the subject lessa et al 2015 measured the gases in the terrestrial areas specifically in soils before the formation of the belo monte reservoir in the amazon four campaigns were carried out over a period of one year fifteen areas sampled in each campaign scattered in areas with vegetation of forest and grassland the carbon dioxide fluxes co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o of soils were measured the median values of ch4 emissions were 9 97 3 55mgch4 m 2 day 1 and 11 34 1 62mgch4 m 2 day 1 for pasture and forest respectively for co2 in the pasture emission was 10 448 41 3036 48mgco2 m 2 day 1 and forest emission was 8004 50 1314 98mgco2 m 2 day 1 the median fluxes for n2o were near zero and 0 78 0 56mgn2om 2 day 1 for pasture and 0 67 0 29mgn2om 2 day 1 for forest the study showed that the terrestrial areas prior to reservoir creation act as potential emitter of greenhouse gases the area to be flooded was divided into three regions river 359 21km2 riparian forest 228km2 and pasture 39 73km2 the average fluxes of the campaigns were considered for i fluxes of the three gases in the river sector and ii ch4 and n2o fluxes from the riparian forest and pasture the co2 flux from the pasture was not considered following the ipcc guidelines ipcc 2006 which suggest considering net co2 emissions in pastures as null since the co2 captured by photosynthesis returns to the atmosphere through respiration for the co2 fluxes of the riparian forest the three tropical forest scenarios described above were considered fig 7 shows the measured values for each type of gas each type of

comparative values of gas flux measurements co2 ch4 and n2o for pasture and forest environments in the amazon region as can be observed the carbon dioxide values of this study are quite similar to results published by other research groups in the study region table 7 table 8 shows some methane flow values found in the literature compared with our data in this specific case we found a slight difference of results found among different studies while we obtained methane absorption in one of the cases studied batalha the literature brings us slightly positive values in the other two cases belo monte and santo antonio the measured values are compatible with the values raised regarding the emissions of nitrous oxide we obtained values compatible with other studies carried out in the region for the cases of belo monte and batalha the study of santo antonio provided us with higher values but absolutely within the expected range of values our flow values of ch4 are about 2 9 times higher than the values found by saminez 1999 but the variability of the results can be explained by the different conditions in the rainfall regime of the field campaigns between the studies different soil moisture content as different sites sampled in the field campaigns 5 conclusions in the pre impoundment period reflecting local environmental conditions different compartments of the inundation area present different regimes of ghg fluxes between surface and atmosphere the results obtained in the studied reservoirs show that the emissions prior to the dam closure for reservoir construction are significant the measurements in the three studied rivers show that diffusive co2 emissions are predominant in the analyzed gas spectrum considering the neutral forest scenario diffusive co2 emissions comprised 80 or more of the total co2eq flux in belo monte and santo antonio and more than 50 in batalha this should be considered when post impoundment and net emissions are assessed one can pose the hypothesis that co2 net emissions are negligible and the important reservoir impact is the production of methane in its expanded anoxic region the co2 bubbling flux is weak methane is the second most important gas in rivers and n2o is almost null emissions from land areas vary greatly between the analyzed gases and between the various types of land use co2 emissions are more significant but when the gwp and the gases converted to equivalent carbon dioxide are applied gases other than co2 become important in general our results are similar to previous studies conducted in the same biome the balance of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions and removals was created for each sampling site based on gas flux measurements and literature data in the case of carbon dioxide above canopy vegetation data obtained show that in case of santo antonio and belo monte the aquatic fluxes are more relevant than terrestrial fluxes and in the case of batalha we found more intensive fluxes from terrestrial habitats further studies in other sites should be encouraged in order to increase knowledge about the dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions before the formation of reservoirs management of the carbon balance in hydropower reservoirs includes the monitoring of the greenhouse gas emissions from the constructed reservoir including the various exchange of greenhouse gases with the atmosphere and its temporal and spatial fluctuations as well as nutrient loads to the reservoir although in several hydrological and limnological monitoring of water quality where the main parameters include bod od temperature transparency electrical conductivity ph concentrations of pollutants etc there is no news that the monitoring of ghg emissions is implemented in some hydroelectric use in general the literature shows the occurrence of measurement campaigns linked to research projects similar to those carried out here several of the water quality management practices can be included as good practice guidelines for carbon balance management in particular those occurrence of anoxia dissolved oxygen deficit and eutrophy excess of phosphorus and chlorophyll

and santo ant nio hydroelectric plant in contrast to most of the estimates available in the literature on hydroelectric reservoirs which take into consideration only gross emissions these data will enable the calculation of the net emissions of the hydroelectric reservoirs studied carbon dioxide and methane flux measurements were carried out in terrestrial in different types of soil and vegetation and aquatic rivers lakes and marshes ecosystems before the reservoir flooding in each reservoir four measurement campaigns were carried out in order to represent different rainfall regimes and river water levels the median values of ch4 emissions were 9 97 3 55mgch4 m 2 day 1 and 11 34 1 62mgch4 m 2 day 1 for pasture and forest landuse types respectively for co2 emission was 10 448 41 3036 48mgco2 m 2 day 1 and 8004 50 1314 98mgco2 m 2 day 1 for pasture and forest lands respectively the median fluxes for n2o were near zero and 0 78 0 56mgn2om 2 day 1 for pasture and 0 67 0 29mgn2om 2 day 1 for forest the study showed that the terrestrial areas prior reservoir creation act as potential emitters of greenhouse gases hydropower sites under construction where hydroelectric reservoirs have not been installed yet create a great opportunity to carry out gas flux measurements in the pre filling phase the results can be further compared with the same measurements after the dam closure in order to more precisely estimate the net reservoir emissions in the case of reservoirs already built off course the possibility of taking pre filling phase measurements no longer exists however the results of the present study allow for reassessment of the available flux estimates for such reservoirs keywords methane carbon dioxide nitrous oxide hydropower reservoirs 1 introduction the possibility that the contribution of hydropower plants to global anthropogenic greenhouse gase ghg emissions may not be negligible has been indicated by several studies done in hydropower reservoirs rosa and schaeffer 1994 some studies identified hydropower reservoirs as potential sources of ghg rudd et al 1993 st louis et al 2000 at the end of the 1990s the broad review performed by the world commission on dams wcd on the development effectiveness of large dams included in its themes the role of dams in contributing the greenhouse effect a report prepared for the wcd by rosa and santos 2000 which was included in the wcd s final report 2000 prompted much debate on this topic worldwide the motivating point of this research was to introduce the concept of net emissions of greenhouse gases in hydroelectric plants according to iea 2012 net emissions of greenhouse effect gases are defined as differences between the balances of post filling emissions and removals excluding emissions from anthropogenic sources not related to the reservoir and the balances of gas emissions and removals in the pre filling stage in contrast to most estimates available in the literature on hydroelectric plants which consider only gross emissions the concept of net emissions introduces the description understanding and measurement of processes affecting carbon and nitrogen storage and transport in the flooding area before and after the filling of the reservoir in this sense measurement campaigns during the construction stage of the plants before the closure of the dams to fill the reservoirs aim to measure the gases in conditions prior to the formation of these reservoirs sites of hydroelectric projects under construction where the reservoirs have not yet been installed constitute a great opportunity to carry out gas flux measurements in the pre filling stage in cases where reservoirs have already been installed the possibility of going to the field to measure pre filling fluxes is no longer available and the estimation of these emissions is done based on a mapping of the soil coverage and use before filling associating the typologies found to gas fluxes values available in the literature for the study areas or in similar areas thus in addition to providing the opportunity for net emissions estimates based entirely on specific measurements for the studied uses the pre filling campaigns add to the available database to support estimates of pre filling emissions from existing reservoirs in the pre impoundment period regimes of transformations transport and storage of carbon and nitrogen containing compounds are established at each different places of the reservoir at the upland compartment the biomass of vegetation and surface soil peat layer cover may make it a sink area of co2 the floodplain may be a significant source of ch4 where permanent carbon burial may occur at a significant rate in the water bodies surface the river and streams transport water and sediments collected by the drainage network in the upstream watershed this is combined in the downstream to the water and sediments collected by the drainage network in the floodplain and from the upland lands of the inundation area within the flowing river ghg emissions are constantly produced by microbial community activity in general the water bodies surface is conceived to act in the pre impoundment period as a source area for co2 ch4 and n2o whereas at the lakes sub compartment substantial permanent carbon burial rate can be present 2 materials and methods 2 1 reservoirs studied the belo monte hydroelectric complex is located in the xingu river basin in the amazon belo monte has 11 233mw of installed capacity and the reservoir comprises 503km2 the xingu river belongs to the amazonian central fluvial system and has an extensive network of igarapés and igapós in rivers of white and black waters where the marginal forest is periodically flooded during the flood period junk et al 1989 it is one of the main tributaries of the right bank of the amazon river ending in the proximity of the city of porto de moz pa approximately 300km east of santarém and 400km from the city of belém the river regime of the medium and low xingu region follows the rainfall regime of the region showing floods from december to may with peaks in march and april in contrast the ebb period is concentrated between the months of may and november with minimal precipitation in the months of august october the batalha hydroelectric plant is located in the paranaíba river basin in the cerrado biome region and has 52 5mw of installed capacity the reservoir area is 138km2 the plant still under construction is located in the são marcos river one of the main tributaries of the right bank of the paranaíba river and divides the states of minas gerais and goiás at the border between the municipalities of paracatu and cristalina respectively the santo antônio hydroelectric power plant is located in the madeira river basin in the amazon region the plant has 3150mw of installed capacity and a reservoir of 350km2 the madeira river has a flow that varies from 4000m3 per second in the dry season to 45 000m3 per second in the flood the flooded areas will be virtually the same as those occurring during the annual floods of the madeira river table 1 shows information about the studied reservoirs field campaigns were performed from march 2011 to december 2012 table 2 shows the seasonal campaigns schedule the measurement campaigns in belo monte occurred in march july september and december 2012 in each campaign diffusive flux samplings were carried out by chambers in 14 soil sites 7 in riparian forest and 7 outside the riparian forest grasslands pasture creeping vegetation in the aquatic area river and streams diffusive flow samplings were carried out by floating chambers at 25 points ebbulitive flux samplings by funnels in 13 points the campaigns in santo antonio took place in may september and december 2011 and march 2012 in these campaigns samples of diffusive flow were carried out by soil chambers in 18 points being 11 in riparian forest and 2 in pasture and 5 in deforested area in the river diffusive flow samplings were carried out by floating chambers in 33 points ebbulitive flux samplings by funnels in 16 points the campaigns in batalha occurred in march june september and december 2011 in each campaign samples of diffusive flux were carried out by soil chambers in 14 points 7 in riparian forest and 7 outside the riparian forest grass pasture vegetation creeping in the river diffusive flux samplings were carried out by floating chambers at 25 points ebbulitive flux samplings by funnels in 13 points table 3 shows the land cover area of the reservoirs studied the location of each measurement sites within land use classes in terrestrial areas was determined by a series of issues such as accessibility of sites presence of land routes and spatial representation in the context of each class of use some sampling sites are close to the river channel and others distant however generally no site suffers periodic flooding of the river the measurements sites in water are determined as follows a floating chambers homogeneously distributed in the area of the rivers involving at least three sub areas downstream of the future dam the central body of the future reservoir and arms of rivers with areas of less water circulation in our study in the used chamber a volume of 1000ml and area of 0 047m2 is used and the samples are taken at times that varied from time zero 2min 4min and 8min after the initial time with the results of the chromatographic analysis of the samples of the floating chamber a linear adjustment with the four concentrations is made to obtain the rate of growth positive flow or decay negative flow of the concentration of the gases inside the chamber b funnels the placement of the funnels in the rivers has shrunk the criterion that the shallower areas are gas emitters while the region of the central body of the rivers present higher velocities of current and they provide a more sandy bed not being emitters of gases the sampling points determined in the first campaign were revisited exactly in the same places considering the geographical coordinates and gps signal degradation figs 1 3 presents the sampling sites of each reservoir studied 2 2 methods estimates of pre existing emissions were calculated from measurements of fluxes between surface and atmosphere for the three considered greenhouse gases co2 ch4 and n2o made at spatially distributed sites at the inundation areas the inundation areas were schematically divided into two compartments aquatic areas river and lakes and land areas the land areas were further divided in sub compartments representing the different coverage and land uses it was sought to adopt as far as the conditions of access permitted a random process for the choice of measuring points within each sub compartment the obtained spatial distributions were considered representative for each campaign representative estimates of the flux of each gas at each sub compartment were obtained together with assessments of their uncertainties assuming that measured values deviate from the sub compartment mean gas flux by the sum of homogeneous spatial random variations inside the sub compartment area and homogeneous random measurement errors simple arithmetic mean would be adequate to estimate the mean gas fluxes otherwise we have used the median of the measured values as a more robust estimation method providing protection against occurrence of outliers and against cases of different accuracies as the median is used bootstrap method provided the standard uncertainties efron and tibshirani 1993 annual representative flux values for each gas and compartment were calculated using the arithmetic mean of the four campaign estimated values in this method we synthetically construct other sets of single measurements of the same length by resampling the actual set of single measurements with replacement for each synthetically constructed set of measurements we calculate the median the standard deviation of these synthetic medians is the standard uncertainty the error bars are computed using the median minus and plus the standard uncertainty geometric mean can be a good estimator especially when the random variability is well modeled using lognormal distribution and we have large samples for contaminated data and moderate samples median are better shih and binkowitz 1987 it was decided to not replicate measurements at each location in favor of visiting a larger number of locations the geographical location of the studied reservoirs is presented in fig 4 our field equipment are a diffusive fluxes at water air interface diffusive gas fluxes at the water air interface in the river floating diffusion chambers were used the representative values of each campaign for the diffusive fluxes were calculated by the medians of the fluxes measured in the diffusion chambers operated during the campaign b diffusive fluxes at soils the gases fluxes from the soil were measured by the static chambers method the chambers are made up of a pvc ring with 30cm diameter and 14cm height equipped with a copper capillary respirator cover and a septum for syringe sampling fig 5 the chambers were inserted in the soil at depths ranging from 2 to 20mm to ensure sealing and then 30ml air samples were taken from the chamber with a 60ml polypropylene syringe samples were taken at intervals of 0 5 10 15 and 20min after the introduction of the chambers in the soil in case of ch4 and co2 and at 0 5 15 20 and 30min in case of n2o subsequently gas samples were transferred to pre evacuated glass bottles and kept until analysis c funnels the ebbulitive flux occurs due to the release of bubbles produced in the reservoir bottom sediment the bubbles were captured using inverted funnels made of waterproof material each funnel covers area of 0 69m2 and its vertex is connected to a volumetric bottle which is used to collect the samples fig 6 d gas analysis the concentrations of gases of the samples were determined by gas chromatography in the same day of the sampling shimadzu gas chromatograph the concentrations of ch4 co2 and n2o were determined by gas chromatography using porapack q columns and fid tcd ecd respectively for the bubbling fluxes the river area was stratified into depth zones 0 5m 5 10m 10 15m 15 20m 20m the bubbling flux in the fifth zone was considered null for the other zones the median of the measurements of the set of inverted funnels traps placed in these depth bands was considered the representative value was calculated as the average of the zone medians weighted by the zone areas as regards the diffusive gas fluxes in soil a classification of the use and coverage of the region to be flooded was used moreover for each land use class the fluxes were established according to the following criteria i measurements through soil diffusion chambers were used for the ch4 and n2o gases in the campaigns ii co2 fluxes from livestock areas and annual crops were not considered following the ipcc guidelines ipcc 2006 which suggest to consider net co2 emissions in these areas as null since the co2 captured by photosynthesis returns to the atmosphere through respiration iii in the case of co2 flux in natural environments forests savannas fields and caatingas as the chambers are heavily influenced by soil respiration data from the literature of experiments that take photosynthesis into account were used e g eddy covariance measurement towers in particular for forests due to the great uncertainties involved in the co2 balance of these areas three flux scenarios were considered a removal scenario a removal of 0 89tonc ha year 894mgc m2 day measured in studies located in mature natural tropical forests phillips et al 1998 malhi and phillips 2004 b neutral scenario a forest that is basically neutral in the balance of positive and negative co2 fluxes and c emission scenario an emission of 1 3 ton c ha year 1306mgco2 m2 day found in tower measurements during a three year period in central amazonia saleska 2003 it was sought to adopt as far as the conditions of access permitted a random process for the choice of measuring points within each luc the obtained spatial distributions were considered representative land use class luc meaning that is the observed bio physical cover on the earth s surface 3 results 3 1 belo monte the literature on effect gas emissions prior to reservoir filling is scarce and little attention has been paid to the subject lessa et al 2015 measured the gases in the terrestrial areas specifically in soils before the formation of the belo monte reservoir in the amazon four campaigns were carried out over a period of one year fifteen areas sampled in each campaign scattered in areas with vegetation of forest and grassland the carbon dioxide fluxes co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o of soils were measured the median values of ch4 emissions were 9 97 3 55mgch4 m 2 day 1 and 11 34 1 62mgch4 m 2 day 1 for pasture and forest respectively for co2 in the pasture emission was 10 448 41 3036 48mgco2 m 2 day 1 and forest emission was 8004 50 1314 98mgco2 m 2 day 1 the median fluxes for n2o were near zero and 0 78 0 56mgn2om 2 day 1 for pasture and 0 67 0 29mgn2om 2 day 1 for forest the study showed that the terrestrial areas prior to reservoir creation act as potential emitter of greenhouse gases the area to be flooded was divided into three regions river 359 21km2 riparian forest 228km2 and pasture 39 73km2 the average fluxes of the campaigns were considered for i fluxes of the three gases in the river sector and ii ch4 and n2o fluxes from the riparian forest and pasture the co2 flux from the pasture was not considered following the ipcc guidelines ipcc 2006 which suggest considering net co2 emissions in pastures as null since the co2 captured by photosynthesis returns to the atmosphere through respiration for the co2 fluxes of the riparian forest the three tropical forest scenarios described above were considered fig 7 shows the measured values for each type of gas each type of environment and in the seasonal campaigns considered in the study the error bars represent the standard uncertainty interval table 4 presents the balance of emissions and removals for each gas

and pasture 31 8km2 the average fluxes of the campaigns were considered for i fluxes of the three gases of the river sector ii co2 flux of the deforested area and iii ch4 and n2o fluxes of the riparian forest deforested area and pasture the co2 flux from the pasture was not considered following the ipcc guidelines ipcc 2006 since the co2 captured by photosynthesis returns to the atmosphere through respiration for the co2 fluxes of the riparian forest the three tropical forest scenarios described above were considered fig 8 shows the gas fluxes in all compartments studied during the seasonal campaigns table 5 shows the balance of emissions and removals for each gas obtained for the santo antônio area in t day the last line shows aggregate values in co2 equivalent tons where the

shows the balance of emissions and removals for each gas obtained for the batalha area in t day the last line shows aggregate values in co2 equivalent tons where the emissions of each gas are

comparative values of gas flux measurements co2 ch4 and n2o for pasture and forest environments in the amazon region as can be observed the carbon dioxide values of this study are quite similar to results published by other research groups in the study region table 7 table 8 shows some methane flow values found in the literature compared with our data in this specific case we found a slight difference of results found among different studies while we obtained methane absorption in one of the cases studied batalha the literature brings us slightly positive values in the other two cases belo monte and santo antonio the measured values are compatible with the values raised regarding the emissions of nitrous oxide we obtained values compatible with other studies carried out in the region for the cases of belo monte and batalha the study of santo antonio provided us with higher values but absolutely within the expected range of values our flow values of ch4 are about 2 9 times higher than the values found by saminez 1999 but the variability of the results can be explained by the different conditions in the rainfall regime of the field campaigns between the studies different soil moisture content as different sites sampled in the field campaigns 5 conclusions in the pre impoundment period reflecting local environmental conditions different compartments of the inundation area present different regimes of ghg fluxes between surface and atmosphere the results obtained in the studied reservoirs show that the emissions prior to the dam closure for reservoir construction are significant the measurements in the three studied rivers show that diffusive co2 emissions are predominant in the analyzed gas spectrum considering the neutral forest scenario diffusive co2 emissions comprised 80 or more of the total co2eq flux in belo monte and santo antonio and more than 50 in batalha this should be considered when post impoundment and net emissions are assessed one can pose the hypothesis that co2 net emissions are negligible and the important reservoir impact is the production of methane in its expanded anoxic region the co2 bubbling flux is weak methane is the second most important gas in rivers and n2o is almost null emissions from land areas vary greatly between the analyzed gases and between the various types of land use co2 emissions are more significant but when the gwp and the gases converted to equivalent carbon dioxide are applied gases other than co2 become important in general our results are similar to previous studies conducted in the same biome the balance of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions and removals was created for each sampling site based on gas flux measurements and literature data in the case of carbon dioxide above canopy vegetation data obtained show that in case of santo antonio and belo monte the aquatic fluxes are more relevant than terrestrial fluxes and in the case of batalha we found more intensive fluxes from terrestrial habitats further studies in other sites should be encouraged in order to increase knowledge about the dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions before the formation of reservoirs management of the carbon balance in hydropower reservoirs includes the monitoring of the greenhouse gas emissions from the constructed reservoir including the various exchange of greenhouse gases with the atmosphere and its temporal and spatial fluctuations as well as nutrient loads to the reservoir although in several hydrological and limnological monitoring of water quality where the main parameters include bod od temperature transparency electrical conductivity ph concentrations of pollutants etc there is no news that the monitoring of ghg emissions is implemented in some hydroelectric use in general the literature shows the occurrence of measurement campaigns linked to research projects similar to those carried out here several of the water quality management practices can be included as good practice guidelines for carbon balance management in particular those occurrence of anoxia dissolved oxygen deficit and eutrophy excess of phosphorus and chlorophyll

1098,the increasing demand for water for multiple uses in the watershed of the são francisco river makes the knowledge of the hydrological characteristics an important instrument so that the use of its resources are optimized with less environmental impact the analysis of changes in the lower são francisco river resulting from the successive introduction of dams along the passages and their environmental effects are extremely important when seeking the revival of this waterway the objective of this study was to determine changes in flow regime in the periods before and after the construction of the xingó reservoir on the são francisco river and relate these changes with some ecological implications for this we used the method of hydrologic alteration indicators iha and the method of the environment flow components efcs there was a reduction of 31 21 and 35 respectively for average minimum and maximum flow when comparing the studied periods keywords hydrological changes environmental impacts and water resources 1 introduction the construction of dams in order to regulate river flow rates causes changes in the quantity and quality of water the direct effects to the downstream of the reservoirs are reduction on the number of species of fish and invertebrates reduction on sediment and nutrient deposition levels in the floodplain impediments to navigation changes in the biophysical processes of estuaries reduction of groundwater recharge and commitment of water availability for multiple uses syvitski et al 2005 song et al 2007 stevaux et al 2009 zahar et al 2008 the intensification of exploitation of the natural resources in the brazilian northeast region has generated land and water resources degradation which added to the climatic factors may result in significant changes in hydrological processes significant changes can arise in the flow conditions of a watercourse due to water supplying operations along its course building dams or significant changes in the conditions of use of the soil of the watershed therefore understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of water availability is of fundamental importance for the planning of land use and availability of water resources in the basin pereira et al 2009 the basin of san francisco is an important inducer of development of the various states that it crosses knowledge of its hydrological behavior is extremely valuable to support decision making in the management of water resources it will allow knowing the availability of this resource making it possible to identify the areas that this feature is or may be scarce pereira et al 2007 currently several available hydrological tools increase the understanding of human interventions on water resources hydrological rates are used to describe the different components of the flow regime and its ecological functions several sets of indicators have been developed to assess flow regime changes such as indicators of hydrologic change ihc which characterize the magnitude duration time frequency and rate of change of hydrological flows this study used the evaluation methodology indicators of hydrologic change ihc originally developed by the nature conservancy in the 1990s to process the daily hydrological records and allow to characterize the natural conditions of the rivers and to facilitate the evaluation of the induced changes by man to the flow regime several studies have been published over the past few years using the ihc tool in order to assess the impacts of large dams on the hydrological indicators shiau and wu 2004 hu et al 2008 yang et al 2008 zeilhofer and de moura 2009 yan et al 2010 zhao et al 2012 boodoo et al 2014 mittal et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 pfeiffer and ionita 2017 based on this approach this study aims at performing the analysis of the variation of the hydrological behavior of the são francisco river in its lower course besides associating ecological aspects impacted with statistical indicators of hydrological changes during the period from 1979 to 2012 2 methodology 2 1 description of the study area the basin of the são francisco river sfr is located between latitudes 7 and 21 s and drains an area of 634000km2 representing 7 5 of the brazilian territory its length 2830km goes through the state of bahia making its border to the north of the state of pernambuco as well as the natural border between the states of sergipe and alagoas and empties into the atlantic ocean 13 million inhabitants distributed in 464 municipalities genz and luz 2012 live in this river basin the basin of the sfr is usually divided into four segments high 100060km2 16 medium 398716km2 63 sub middle 110481km2 17 and low 25524km2 4 as shown in fig 1 the basin covers various weather conditions comprising average annual rainfall of 400mm sub middle and 1500mm high the average annual air temperature 18 27 c relatively high evaporation rates of 2300 3000mm year 2400 3300h of light per year ecological areas ranging from atlantic forest in savanna cerrado and shrubs caatinga and climates ranging from tropical humid to semi arid sato and godinho 2004 the são francisco river has nine major hydroelectric plants hp throughout its main course hydroelectric plants installed by the hydroelectric company of são francisco chesf mostly in sub middle region comprising the largest hydroelectric complex in brazil with a total capacity 10618mw volume accumulation of 5 0 1010 m3 martins et al 2011 the study area comprises the lower são francisco river that occupies the western portion of the basin with land area of approximately 25417km2 covering the states of bahia pernambuco sergipe and alagoas the area extends from the hydroelectric power plant hpp xingó canindé do são francisco se to the region of the sfr mouth corresponding to a length of approximately 210km low são francisco river has the lowest water availability among the four regions being classified by the un as water stress situation 1000m3 hab 1 yr 1 unesco and wwap 2003 the major hydrological changes in the lower sfr were especially aggravated after the construction of the hpp xingó in 1994 it represents a milestone in the artificiality and control of hydro sedimentological conditions firstly for retaining the small contribution of alluvial sediment from hpp paulo afonso the final link of the blocking chain of almost all the particles coming from upstream and secondly because its operation produces artificial fluctuations of daily flow rates which play a key role in the current dynamics of this river fontes 2011 the hpp xingó has regulated flow with reservoir area equal to 60km2 drained area of 608722km2 accumulation volume of 4 3 107 m3 and water residence time in its reservoir of 16 days for the study we analyzed the daily data from 1979 to 2012 from the fluviometric station belonging to the hydro meteorological network of the national water agency awa the fluviometric station selected for the study pão de açúcar code 49370000 has a drainage area of approximately 608900km2 which represents 97 of the são francisco river basin we considered the study periods of 1979 1994 and 1995 2013 which correspond to periods before and after the construction of the hydroelectric of xingó and human impacts in order to identify changes in the behavior of the flow the flow data were obtained using the discharge curve method that represents a cota curve x flow of a cross section of a river for the filling of flow failures of the daily data simple linear regression represented by equation 1 was used 1 y β 0 x β 1 where y is the flow of the failed station x is the flow of the station with data and β 0 and β 1 are the adjusted parameters in the regression the consistency of the fluviometric data was made using the multiple regression method eq 2 2 y e s t β 1 β 2 y m β 3 y j where y est is the observation to be estimated in the station under analysis y m is the observation of the station upstream of the station under analysis y j is the observation of the station downstream of the station under analysis and β 1 β 2 and β 3 are multiple regression coefficients 3 the iha method the iha is method for assessing the degree of hydrologic alteration based on biologically relevant hydrologic attributes developed to assess the degree of hydrologic change caused by human activities richter et al 1996 poff et al 1997 it consists of 67 parameters which are divided into two groups from which 33 parameters calculate the hydrological behavior and 34 parameters determines the components of ecological flow cve these hydrological parameters table 1 were developed based on ecological relevance and its ability to reflect changes induced by man in flow regimes including operations of dams water diversions groundwater pumping and landscape modification mathews and richter 2007 the iha method is based on the historical series of daily average flow rates and can be used to statistically characterize the temporal variability of hydrological regimes and quantify the hydrological changes associated with alteration by comparing the hydrological regime before the impact and post impact the iha calculation was performed using the software iha 7 1 according to opperman 2006 it compares sets of hydrological data and calculates the statistical variability to assess the degree of hydrological change among them according to richter et al 1996 the software analyzes daily hydrological data available as well as flow or precipitation data generated by modeling indicators of hydrologic change ihc consider some features of the hydrological regime including magnitude of flows duration frequency of occurrence occurrence period and rate of change as defined in poff et al 1997 each of these characteristics is represented in five large groups associated with thirty three parameters considered in the method richter et al 1996 you can use the software to calculate parameters for five different environment flow components efcs low flow defined as flows that are not classified as extremely low flows and which are below the 50th percentile extremely low flow defined as those with values equal to or below the 10th percentile of the daily flows of the analyzed period high flow pulses defined as those exceeding the 75th percentile small floods defined as those with peak flooding with return period of 2 years and large floods defined as those with peak flood with a 10 year return period the nature conservancy 2014 4 rate of change of hydrological indicators we also calculated the rate of change of the five hydrological indicators for each parameter considering the period before and after the construction of the hydroelectric of xingó a positive value indicates that the rate of change is increasing a negative value indicates that the rate of change is slowing the water rate change is calculated as 3 change rate q n p o s q n p r e q n p r e 100 where n may be the minimum medium or maximum flow 5 results and discussion 5 1 influence on the hydrological regime the results of ihc for the lower são francisco river are in tables 2 and 3 where you can view all the parameters and the corresponding standard deviation calculated per period the relative differences ranged for all groups with average values of variation 31 36 35 57 and 19 for groups 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively the magnitude of the flow at any time interval is simply the moving water content passing by a fixed site per unit of time the magnitude can be referred to either absolute or relative discharge maximum and minimum flow magnitudes range between rivers depending on the weather and the size of their river basins stewardson and gippel 2003 rocha 2010 the results of the monthly variability magnitude group 1 showed high values of alteration of the river regime in the post impact period especially for the months of january february march and april with a deviation of magnitude of 51 50 56 and 55 but in none of the noted months we found monthly flow rate bigger than in the period after the water dam was built table 2 fig 2a c the reduction also occurred for minimum and maximum flow in all evaluated months with higher rate of hydrologic alteration in february 30 28 in october and december 31 for minimum and january 62 58 in march and april to 75 maximum throughout the hydrological year the flow rates decreased with the largest changes occurring in the maximum flows fig 2c annual changes were respectively 31 21 and 35 for average minimum and maximum flow indicating that the flow of the são francisco river decreased by more than thirty percent in the last 18 years importantly the reduction in the minimum flows observed in the study is something worrying because the purpose of the regularization of a river is to increase these figures to increase the availability of water in periods of drought or low availability all the alterations provoked after the construction of the reservoirs are related to the evaporation due to the accumulation reservoirs implanted along the são francisco river as well as due to the growth of the economic exploitation mainly irrigation the results obtained by maneta et al 2009 show that the flow rate for irrigation purposes in the são francisco river before reaching the sobradinho reservoir corresponds to 90m3 s 1 in the rainy season and 122 2m3 s 1 in the dry period according to lima and miranda 2001 between 1970 and 1990 the irrigated area in the são francisco basin had an increase of 286 equivalent to 8620hayear 1 while the growth rate in the country was of 266 in 2012 the irrigated area in the são francisco river basin corresponds to approximately 620000ha with a withdrawal of 213 7m3 s 1 which is equivalent to 11 8 of the average são francisco river flow agência nacional de águas 2013 for best understanding we selected some monthly flow values to demonstrate the alterations of the monthly water condition which indicated alteration magnitude in the lower são francisco river from an ecological point of view periods of low flows may represent opportunities for recruitment of species of riparian plants in regions where there are the annual floods poff et al 1997 those species that occupy the lower parts of the river channel which periodically remained dry may have been eliminated another important aspect of this change relates to the use of environments by some species that remained in dryness within the floodplain mainly as food sources predation or shelter rocha 2010 regarding the magnitude and duration of annual extreme conditions group 2 the results showed greater changes in average extreme events 38 and 34 maximum compared with extreme minimum 14 in the post impact period table 3 in fig 3 one can see the values for the rate of change of all parameters studied the annual average values lasting 1 day 3 days 7 days 30 days and 90 consecutive days suffered large increase when comparing the two periods of study the annual minimum in contrast remained within the acceptable variability where the minimum and maximum of 1 day match the lowest and highest flow for a given hydrological year the average value of maximum 1 day 3 days 7 days 30 days and 90 days decreased by 56 02 56 33 56 91 56 40 and 52 06 respectively comparing the period before and after the construction of the xingó hydroelectric plant fig 3a the maximum flows also suffered large variations with maximum values of 1 day 3 days 7 days 30 days and 90 days respectively 40 68 41 70 46 92 52 01 and 55 82 fig 3a c the hydrological extreme events play a role in regulating the structure and function of rivers besides affecting the uses and water management by man the duration of a specific flow condition often has an ecological significance differences in tolerance to prolonged flood in riparian plants and to prolonged low flows in aquatic invertebrates and fish allow these species to persist in places where they might otherwise be dislodged by dominant species but less tolerant among other effects poff et al 1997 the frequency of extreme events group 3 indicates when extreme events begin and end the results of tables 2 and 3 indicate strong change to the maximum extreme events events in the post impact period began to occur in a different time maximum events that occurred on the 49th julian day february period prior to the xingó hydroelectric plant began to occur in the 338th julian day december thus the maximum events have become less predictable and minimum became more predictable less variability contrary to what was observed in the natural period this allows the interpretation that maximum flow events increased variability less predictable and the minimum events have now become less variable more predictable unlike the natural period of the river system in the opinion of thomas et al 1997 changing the natural hydrometric regime amplitude and frequency is considered a major cause of anthropogenic changes in flood plains located at downstream of the reservoirs the frequency refers to how often a flow rate was above a certain magnitude and specifically repeats over time the duration is the time associated with a particular flow condition the minimum and maximum frequency pulses group 4 had distinctive features of alteration before and after the dam was built table 3 the duration of maximum pulses simply failed to occur the minimum flow pulses occurred with greater frequency and duration in the post impact period these characteristics fit perfectly those related to discharge control performed by dams where the maximum and minimum magnitudes and the average annual variability are flattened rocha 2010 aquatic ecosystems depend on the hydrological regimes flood and drought cycles they are essential for maintaining a variety of community of plants and animals chen and zhao 2011 changes in hydrological regimes may change the composition structure or function of aquatic systems riparian vegetation and ecosystems of wetlands through their effects on the physical characteristics of the habitat including water temperature dissolved oxygen content substrate and particle sizes richter et al 1996 group 5 is related to the daily flow variations decrease or increase in the water level expressed as an annual average table 3 shows the average of daily high flow rates and average daily decrease in flow rates analyzing the pre impact period we note that the daily variations in flow showed slow standard in the natural period i e practically there were no falls or rises of the flows and the rise variations had higher magnitudes than the fall this increase and decrease in the water level tend to produce respectively flow and reflow of subsurface on the sandy shores in the water ascent stage a gradient river channel develops into the edges in the descent stage the energy gradient reverses its direction and the water moves toward the river channel decreasing the stability of the marginal slope throughout the day fluctuations in the são francisco river water flows meet the energy demand of the plant that are usually considerably larger than at night or on weekends brandt 2000 and during the rainy season there is the accumulation of water to use during the dry season a pattern also observed in water discharges by xingó hpp in the são francisco river according to holanda et al 2008 the implementation of large hydropower projects in the basin of the são francisco river caused changes in water regime and has resulted in its lower course an advance of erosion process by sloping the base of undermining marginal due to the lowering of the water level and deforestation of riparian vegetation besides the projects that change the hydrological regime of the river by the direct action on the river flow we may consider here other forms of impact on the hydrological regime such as those caused by deforestation and misuse of land from irregular land appropriation impacts from industrial developments and poorly planned urbanization such processes can be related from the hydrological point of view with greater variability in river flow and increased discharges but that are camouflaged by the reservoir operation regime 5 2 environment flow components efc the components of ecological flow divide the magnitude of flows in five classifications that occur naturally in rivers table 4 and fig 4 show major changes in the hydrological behavior by comparing the periods before and after the construction of the xingó hydroelectric plant during the study period only one value of major flooding occurred in 1979 with a duration of 137 days and 13640m3 flows 1 the 1979 flood was caused by three intense rainfall series that took place between the months of january and february in upper and middle são francisco various social and economic impacts have been identified as flooding the urban area of many municipal seats located on the river banks as well as inconvenience and loss to the population the total absence of large floods record after the construction of the xingó hydroelectric power plant reflects the river regulation it must be noted that large floods are very important for ecological processes another hydrological component that has undergone major changes was the occurrence of small floods with a reduction of 98 5 totaling 828 events were identified of which 812 13 9 were recorded in the period of 1979 1994 and 16 0 2 from 1995 to 2012 this large decrease in the number of small flood events is due to the regularization of the subsequent flow scheme after the construction of the xingó hydroelectric power plant it is true that these floods allow fish and other organisms to migrate to access areas of wetlands and habitats such as secondary channels ponds and wetlands in addition these areas can provide significant food resources which allow rapid growth provide high speed refuge water with lower temperature in the main channel or be used for spawning and rearing the reduction of large and small flood events has compromised the reproduction of several species of fish that require specific habitat characteristics for breeding martins et al 2011 according to araújo et al 2016 after the construction of the xingo hydroelectric plant all 76 marginal lagoons that existed on the lower são francisco river were extinct these areas served as nurseries for reproduction of several native species this meant that many species could not adapt to new environmental conditions allowing their disappearance the impacts generated on the marginal lagoons caused a series of changes in the behavior and composition of the ichthyofauna threatening some native species of extinction holanda et al 2009 as the river flow continues to decline in the last three decades the resistance of the river against the tide also decreases vasco et al 2017 as a result the atlantic ocean advanced at the mouth of the river for 10km causing an increase in its salinity fish that are historically important to the local economy such as the pseudoplatystoma corruscans are locally extinct meanwhile non native species such as the nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus proliferate because they are adapted to these conditions assis et al 2017 the regularization of the flow regime can enhance specific conflict conditions of use between the currently existing demands for example in critical availability situations where there is a need to store water for power generation thereby reducing the magnitude of flows to downstream of the dam raising the risk of not meeting the demands as mentioned by garcia et al 2007 the high flow pulses in the post impact period showed shorter duration than the pre impact period i e the floods besides being less intensive have also become less durable this may have serious implications as influences in the size of organisms which require longer lasting floods to develop and predation okawa 2009 504 8 6 days were recorded with high flow pulse in the period before the construction of the xingó hydroelectric plant and 114 1 7 after as for low flows were recorded 3791 64 9 and 4634 70 5 respectively according to poff et al 1997 changes in these components cause disruptions in the spawning process in the migration of fish change in the structure of the aquatic food chain and invasion of alien riparian species from an ecological point of view periods of low flows may represent opportunities for recruitment of species of riparian plants in regions where there are the annual floods poff et al 1997 those species that occupy the lower parts of the river channel which periodically remained dry may have been eliminated another important aspect of this change relates to the use by some species within the floodplain mainly as food sources predation or shelter the extremely low flow component increased by 62 5 in the number of events becoming more frequent in the post impact period we identified 600 10 3 events mainly in 1987 1989 and 1990 against 1811 27 5 in the post impact period with events primarily in the years 2001 2002 2003 2005 2008 2009 and 2011 the event of extremely low flows is important to eliminate invasive species introduced from aquatic communities and also concentrate prey into limited areas benefiting from predators but severe changes in the number of events of this component may indicate human impacts that jeopardize the fauna and aquatic flora as well the impacts to other uses such as water availability for human consumption greater penetration of the salt wedge changing natural habitats and difficulty for navigation 6 conclusions the use of indicators of hydrological changes allowed verification of an extensive modification in hydrology of the lower san francisco river the main changes are related to the regulation of flows established by the operation of the xingó hydroelectric power plant deployed over time there was a reduction of respectively 31 21 and 35 for average flow minimum and maximum comparing the study period indicating that the flow of the san francisco river declined by more than thirty percent in the last 18 years the floods that often occurred in the lower são francisco river became meaningless causing various effects including the reduction in the number of lagoons shelter and important refuge of several aquatic species the increasing record of low and extremely low flows in the period after the construction of the xingó hydroelectric power plant is a concern for the lower são francisco river as it decreases the water availability in the region hinders navigation and fosters the advance of the sea over the river changing the entire ecosystem conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was

1098,the increasing demand for water for multiple uses in the watershed of the são francisco river makes the knowledge of the hydrological characteristics an important instrument so that the use of its resources are optimized with less environmental impact the analysis of changes in the lower são francisco river resulting from the successive introduction of dams along the passages and their environmental effects are extremely important when seeking the revival of this waterway the objective of this study was to determine changes in flow regime in the periods before and after the construction of the xingó reservoir on the são francisco river and relate these changes with some ecological implications for this we used the method of hydrologic alteration indicators iha and the method of the environment flow components efcs there was a reduction of 31 21 and 35 respectively for average minimum and maximum flow when comparing the studied periods keywords hydrological changes environmental impacts and water resources 1 introduction the construction of dams in order to regulate river flow rates causes changes in the quantity and quality of water the direct effects to the downstream of the reservoirs are reduction on the number of species of fish and invertebrates reduction on sediment and nutrient deposition levels in the floodplain impediments to navigation changes in the biophysical processes of estuaries reduction of groundwater recharge and commitment of water availability for multiple uses syvitski et al 2005 song et al 2007 stevaux et al 2009 zahar et al 2008 the intensification of exploitation of the natural resources in the brazilian northeast region has generated land and water resources degradation which added to the climatic factors may result in significant changes in hydrological processes significant changes can arise in the flow conditions of a watercourse due to water supplying operations along its course building dams or significant changes in the conditions of use of the soil of the watershed therefore understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of water availability is of fundamental importance for the planning of land use and availability of water resources in the basin pereira et al 2009 the basin of san francisco is an important inducer of development of the various states that it crosses knowledge of its hydrological behavior is extremely valuable to support decision making in the management of water resources it will allow knowing the availability of this resource making it possible to identify the areas that this feature is or may be scarce pereira et al 2007 currently several available hydrological tools increase the understanding of human interventions on water resources hydrological rates are used to describe the different components of the flow regime and its ecological functions several sets of indicators have been developed to assess flow regime changes such as indicators of hydrologic change ihc which characterize the magnitude duration time frequency and rate of change of hydrological flows this study used the evaluation methodology indicators of hydrologic change ihc originally developed by the nature conservancy in the 1990s to process the daily hydrological records and allow to characterize the natural conditions of the rivers and to facilitate the evaluation of the induced changes by man to the flow regime several studies have been published over the past few years using the ihc tool in order to assess the impacts of large dams on the hydrological indicators

approach this study aims at performing the analysis of the variation of the hydrological behavior of the são francisco river in its lower course besides associating ecological aspects impacted with statistical indicators of hydrological changes during the period from 1979 to 2012 2 methodology 2 1 description of the study area the basin of the são francisco river sfr is located between latitudes 7 and 21 s and drains an area of 634000km2 representing 7 5 of the brazilian territory its length 2830km goes through the state of bahia making its border to the north of the state of pernambuco as well as the natural border between the states of sergipe and alagoas and empties into the atlantic ocean 13 million inhabitants distributed in 464 municipalities genz and luz 2012 live in this river basin the basin of the sfr is usually divided into four segments high 100060km2 16 medium 398716km2 63 sub middle 110481km2 17 and low 25524km2 4 as shown in fig 1 the basin covers various weather conditions comprising average annual rainfall of 400mm sub middle and 1500mm high the average annual air temperature 18 27 c relatively high evaporation rates of 2300 3000mm year 2400 3300h of light per year ecological areas ranging from atlantic forest in savanna cerrado and shrubs caatinga and climates ranging from tropical humid to semi arid sato and godinho 2004 the são francisco river has nine major hydroelectric plants hp throughout its main course hydroelectric plants installed by the hydroelectric company of são francisco chesf mostly in sub middle region comprising the largest hydroelectric complex in brazil with a total capacity 10618mw volume accumulation of 5 0 1010 m3 martins et al 2011 the study area comprises the lower são francisco river that occupies the western portion of the basin with land area of approximately 25417km2 covering the states of bahia pernambuco sergipe and alagoas the area extends from the hydroelectric power plant hpp xingó canindé do são francisco se to the region of the sfr mouth corresponding to a length of approximately 210km low são francisco river has the lowest water availability among the four regions being classified by the un as water stress situation 1000m3 hab 1 yr 1 unesco and wwap 2003 the major hydrological changes in the lower sfr were especially aggravated after the construction of the hpp xingó in 1994 it represents a milestone in the artificiality and control of hydro sedimentological conditions firstly for retaining the small contribution of alluvial sediment from hpp paulo afonso the final link of the blocking chain of almost all the particles coming from upstream and secondly because its operation produces artificial fluctuations of daily flow rates which play a key role in the current dynamics of this river fontes 2011 the hpp xingó has regulated flow with reservoir area equal to 60km2 drained area of 608722km2 accumulation volume of 4 3 107 m3 and water residence time in its reservoir of 16 days for the study we analyzed the daily data from 1979 to 2012 from the fluviometric station belonging to the hydro meteorological network of the national water agency awa the fluviometric station selected for the study pão de açúcar code 49370000 has a drainage area of approximately 608900km2 which represents 97 of the são francisco river basin we considered the study periods of 1979 1994 and 1995 2013 which correspond to periods before and after the construction of the hydroelectric of xingó and human impacts in order to identify changes in the behavior of the flow the flow data were obtained using the discharge curve method that represents a cota curve x flow of a cross section of a river for the filling of flow failures of the daily data simple linear regression represented by equation 1 was used 1 y β 0 x β 1 where y is the flow of the failed station x is the flow of the station with data and β 0 and β 1 are the adjusted parameters in the regression the consistency of the fluviometric data was made using the multiple regression method eq 2 2 y e s t β 1 β 2 y m β 3 y j where y est is the observation to be estimated in the station under analysis y m is the observation of the station upstream of the station under analysis y j is the observation of the station downstream of the station under analysis and β 1 β 2 and β 3 are multiple regression coefficients 3 the iha method the iha is method for assessing the degree of hydrologic alteration based on biologically relevant hydrologic attributes developed to assess the degree of hydrologic change caused by human activities richter et al 1996 poff et al 1997 it consists of 67 parameters which are divided into two groups from which 33 parameters calculate the hydrological behavior and 34 parameters determines the components of ecological flow cve these hydrological parameters table 1 were developed based on ecological relevance and its ability to reflect changes induced by man in flow regimes including operations of dams water diversions groundwater pumping and landscape modification mathews and richter 2007 the iha method is based on the historical series of daily average flow rates and can be used to statistically characterize the temporal variability of hydrological regimes and quantify the hydrological changes associated with alteration by comparing the hydrological regime before the impact and post impact the iha calculation was performed using the software iha 7 1 according to opperman 2006 it compares sets of hydrological data and calculates the statistical variability to assess the degree of hydrological change among them according to richter et al 1996 the software analyzes daily hydrological data available as well as flow or precipitation data generated by modeling indicators of hydrologic change ihc consider some features of the hydrological regime including magnitude of flows duration frequency of occurrence occurrence period and rate of change as defined in poff et al 1997 each of these characteristics is represented in five large groups associated with thirty three parameters considered in the method richter et al 1996 you can use the software to calculate parameters for five different environment flow components efcs low flow defined as flows that are not classified as extremely low flows and which are below the 50th percentile extremely low flow defined as those with values equal to or below the 10th percentile of the daily flows of the analyzed period high flow pulses defined as those exceeding the 75th percentile small floods defined as those with peak flooding with return period of 2 years and large floods defined as those with peak flood with a 10 year return period the nature conservancy 2014 4 rate of change of hydrological indicators we also calculated the rate of change of the five hydrological indicators for each parameter considering the period before and after the construction of the hydroelectric of xingó a positive value indicates that the rate of change is increasing a negative value indicates that the rate of change is slowing the water rate change is calculated as 3 change rate q n p o s q n p r e q n p r e 100 where n may be the minimum medium or maximum flow 5 results and discussion 5 1 influence on the hydrological regime the results of ihc for the lower são francisco river are in tables 2 and 3 where you can view all the parameters and the corresponding standard deviation calculated per period the relative differences ranged for all groups with average values of variation 31 36 35 57 and 19 for groups 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively the magnitude of the flow at any time interval is simply the moving water content passing by a fixed site per unit of time the magnitude can be referred to either absolute or relative discharge maximum and minimum flow magnitudes range between rivers depending on the weather and the size of their river basins stewardson and gippel 2003 rocha 2010 the results of the monthly variability magnitude group 1 showed high values of alteration of the river regime in the post impact period especially for the months of january february march and april with a deviation of magnitude of 51 50 56 and 55 but in none of the noted months we found monthly flow rate bigger than in the period after the water dam was built table 2 fig 2a c the reduction also occurred for minimum and maximum flow in all evaluated months with higher rate of hydrologic alteration in february 30 28 in october and december 31 for minimum and january 62 58 in march and april to 75 maximum throughout the hydrological year the flow rates decreased with the largest changes occurring in the maximum flows fig 2c annual changes were respectively 31 21 and 35 for average minimum and maximum flow indicating that the flow of the são francisco river decreased by more than thirty percent in the last 18 years importantly the reduction in the minimum flows observed in the study is something worrying because the purpose of the regularization of a river is to increase these figures to increase the availability of water in periods of drought or low availability all the alterations provoked after the construction of the reservoirs are related to the evaporation due to the accumulation reservoirs implanted along the são francisco river as well as due to the growth of the economic exploitation mainly irrigation the results obtained by maneta et al 2009 show that the flow rate for irrigation purposes in the são francisco river before reaching the sobradinho reservoir corresponds to 90m3 s 1 in the rainy season and 122 2m3 s 1 in the dry period according to lima and miranda 2001 between 1970 and 1990 the irrigated area in the são francisco basin had an increase of 286 equivalent to 8620hayear 1 while the growth rate in the country was of 266 in 2012 the irrigated area in the são francisco river basin corresponds to approximately 620000ha with a withdrawal of 213 7m3 s 1 which is equivalent to 11 8 of the average são francisco river flow agência nacional de águas 2013 for best understanding we selected some monthly flow values to demonstrate the alterations of the monthly water condition which indicated alteration magnitude in the lower são francisco river from an ecological point of view periods of low flows may represent opportunities for recruitment of species of riparian plants in regions where there are the annual floods poff et al 1997 those species that occupy the lower parts of the river channel which periodically remained dry may have been eliminated another important aspect of this change relates to the use of environments by some species that remained in dryness within the floodplain mainly as food sources predation or shelter rocha 2010 regarding the magnitude and duration of annual extreme conditions group 2 the results showed greater changes in average extreme events 38 and 34 maximum compared with extreme minimum 14 in the post impact period table 3 in fig 3 one can see the values for the rate of change of all parameters studied the annual average values lasting 1 day 3 days 7 days 30 days and 90 consecutive days suffered large increase when comparing the two periods of study the annual minimum in contrast remained within the acceptable variability where the minimum and maximum of 1 day match the lowest and highest flow for a given hydrological year the average value of maximum 1 day 3 days 7 days 30 days and 90 days decreased by 56 02 56 33 56 91 56 40 and 52 06 respectively comparing the period before and after the construction of the xingó hydroelectric plant fig 3a the maximum flows also suffered large variations with maximum values of 1 day 3 days 7 days 30 days and 90 days respectively 40 68 41 70 46 92 52 01 and 55 82 fig 3a c the hydrological extreme events play a role in regulating the structure and function of rivers besides affecting the uses and water management by man the duration of a specific flow condition often has an ecological significance differences in tolerance to prolonged flood in riparian plants and to prolonged low flows in aquatic invertebrates and fish allow these species to persist in places where they might otherwise be dislodged by dominant species but less tolerant among other effects poff et al 1997 the frequency of extreme events group 3 indicates when extreme events begin and end the results of tables 2 and 3 indicate strong change to the maximum extreme events events in the post impact period began to occur in a different time maximum events that occurred on the 49th julian day february period prior to the xingó hydroelectric plant began to occur in the 338th julian day december thus the maximum events have become less predictable and minimum became more predictable less variability contrary to what was observed in the natural period this allows the interpretation that maximum flow events increased variability less predictable and the minimum events have now become less variable more predictable unlike the natural period of the river system in the opinion of thomas et al 1997 changing the natural hydrometric regime amplitude and frequency is considered a major cause of anthropogenic changes in flood plains located at downstream of the reservoirs the frequency refers to how often a flow rate was above a certain magnitude and specifically repeats over time the duration is the time associated with a particular flow condition the minimum and maximum frequency pulses group 4 had distinctive features of alteration before and after the dam was built table 3 the duration of maximum pulses simply failed to occur the minimum flow pulses occurred with greater frequency and duration

1989 and 1990 against 1811 27 5 in the post impact period with events primarily in the years 2001 2002 2003 2005 2008 2009 and 2011 the event of extremely low flows is important to eliminate invasive species introduced from aquatic communities and also concentrate prey into limited areas benefiting from predators but severe changes in the number of events of this component may indicate human impacts that jeopardize the fauna and aquatic flora as well the impacts to other uses such as water availability for human consumption greater penetration of the salt wedge changing natural habitats and difficulty for navigation 6 conclusions the use of indicators of hydrological changes allowed verification of an extensive modification in hydrology of the lower san francisco river the main changes are related to the regulation of flows established by the operation of the xingó hydroelectric power plant deployed over time there was a reduction of respectively 31 21 and 35 for average flow minimum and maximum comparing the study period indicating that the flow of the san francisco river declined by more than thirty percent in the last 18 years the floods that often occurred in the lower são francisco river became meaningless causing various effects including the reduction in the number of lagoons shelter and important refuge of several aquatic species the increasing record of low and extremely low flows in the period after the construction of the xingó hydroelectric power plant is a concern for the lower são francisco river as it decreases the water availability in the region hinders navigation and fosters the advance of the sea over the river changing the entire ecosystem conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was

1099,the spatiotemporal variability of the cyanobacteria community was studied in volta grande reservoir brazil during 12 months in five sampling sites the sites followed a spatial gradient from the river inflow to the dam to evaluate the molecular diversity of the community we used the fingerprinting method dgge denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and at the same time taxonomic analyses based on species morphology were performed under inverted microscope the most important genera were assembled in three groups picocyanobacteria filamentous cyanobacteria and microstistis species picocyanobacteria belong to a group known for smaller cell size were observed in all five sampling sites and were dominant especially in sites closer to the dam or in the transition zone filamentous cyanobacteria were mainly found closer to the river inflow a seasonal variation was detected with higher picocyanobacterial biomass during the rainy season while nanoplanktonic species were more common in the dry season thus the reservoir showed spatial and temporal variability in the phytoplankton community composition these patterns were related to variations observed in nutrient concentration and temperature picocyanobacteria were a very important part of the phytoplankton community and represented on average 85 of total cyanobacteria biomass the morphological technique revealed higher diversity than the molecular method possibly because of the low number of deposited sequences available for picocyanobacteria the oligomesotrophic status observed in volta grande reservoir was most likely the main factor responsible for the dominance of this group since the relative importance of picocyanobacteria increases in less eutrophic environments keywords cyanobacteria

occupation and use which cause serious damage to the aquatic ecosystems the volta grande reservoir is used for electric power generation and is in the category of oligomesotrophic low average

for the extraction of the main trends between environmental variables and phytoplankton variables we performed a principal component analysis pca using the free program past due to existence of autocorrelation nitrite was excluded from the pca because of correlation with nitrate and chlorophyll because of correlation with picocyanobacteria the pca was performed to a dataset including environmental and biological variables some variables showed heterogeneity of variance and data were log transformed to obtain normality and homogeneity required to evaluate data on a similar scale 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variation of cyanobacterial communities colonial picocyanobacteria taxa were present in 44 of 60 samples and amounted to 85 of the total cyanobacterial community biomass figs 2 and 3 the other main groups were the order chroococcales represented by microcystis species represented in the figure as other cyanobacteria and several filamentous cyanobacteria nostocales and oscillatoriales that were mainly found in vg4 and vg5 sites located closer to the river inflow into the reservoir figs 1 and 2 three genera of picoyanobacteria were the most dominant chroococcus aphanocapsa and merismopedia and were detected in all five sampling points during several months fig 3 the vg1 and vg2 sampling stations showed similarity with regard to species composition and the same genera were recorded snowella cyanodictyon aphanothece chroococcus aphanocapsa and merismopedia in vg3 most genera were similar with exception of snowella and aphanothece not detected and the genus epigloesphaera not found in vg1 and vg2 fig 3 the main picocyanobacteria species were also found in vg4 and vg5 cyanodictyon aphanothece chroococcus aphanocapsa merismopedia and coelosphaerium but their biovolume was lower than elsewhere the distribution of the species followed the same seasonal trend in most sampling stations with higher cell biovolume especially of picocyanobacteria during the rainy season fig 2 between april and august dry season cyanobacteria biovolume was often close to zero only microcystis spp represented by several species m aeruginosa m novacekii m smithii m protocystis showed high peaks during the dry season vg2 and vg5 as well as some filamentous cyanobacteria vg2 and vg4 the main species of filamentous cyanobacteria observed during this study were dolichospermum sp geitlerinema amphibium g splendidum geitlerinema sp planktolyngbya limnetica p minor planktothrix agardhii p clathrata p isothrix pseudanabaena catenata raphidiopsis sp 3 2 molecular diversity of picocyanobacterial populations in total 358 bands were observed in the dgge analysis in 18 different positions 78 of these bands were extracted from the gels and successfully sequenced the banding patterns were analyzed for similarity and similar bands were clustered together forming a dendrogram fig 4 clusters clearly represented different months showing that the dominant species or strains changed along the seasons the most separated cluster the first from below corresponded to march and april i e the period that characterizes the end of summer and of the rainy season although dgge band profiles showed a consistent temporal variation in all five sampling sites fig s1 suggesting the presence of several genetically different strains the sequences obtained from these bands analyzed by blast showed to be affiliated to very few genera there was very low diversity between the 35 bands sequenced and used to construct the phylogenetic tree fig s1 three clades were formed related to picocyanobacterial genera synechococcus sp and cyanobium sp the first clade was represented in the tree by bands from 278 to 230 these sequences were clustering with synechococcus sp forming a clade where the sequences obtained a minimum of 99 16s rrna gene sequence similarity to genbank strains the second clade represented sequenced bands from 223 to 73 clustering with synechococcus sp and cyanobium sp with minimum of 98 16s rrna gene sequence similarity the third clade comprised also the picocyanobacteria sequences of bands from 91 to 280 clustering with synechococcus sp with minimum de 99 16s rrna gene sequence similarity in total 30 bands 85 clustered with synechococcus 3 3 physical and chemical analyses a principal component analysis pca fig 5 was used to test the relationships among environmental variables secchi depth water temperature dissolved oxygen nutrient nitrate ammonium orthophosphate total phosphorus and biological variables picocyanobacteria and filamentous cyanobacteria biomass the first two axis explained together 64 of the total variability pc1 35 57 and pc2 28 40 and these two components were helpful to explain patterns found in the reservoir as it can be seen in the correlation table fig 5 the main parameters that influenced the system as a whole were nutrients temperature and secchi depth due to association with temperature axis 1 suggests a relationship with seasonality it is in the rainy season with higher temperatures that we observe an increase of total p as well as a decrease of transparency measured as secchi depth more suspended particles in the water column due to rain axis 2 was strongly correlated to orthophosphate fig 5 and at lower degree to other nutrients as nitrate and ammonium and secchi and could describe some spatial variability due to differences among stations closer to the dam or to the river inflow analyses of nitrate ammonium and secchi showed a spatial distribution tables s2 and s3 a third component pc3 fig s2 explained 15 09 of the variance the main variables associated with this third axis are the two cyanobacteria communities picocyanobacteria negative and filamentous positive with positive association to ammonium and dissolved oxygen fig s2 the opposite trends between the two cyanobacteria communities were also visible in fig 2 4 discussion in volta grande reservoir we observed several colonial picocyanobacteria genera commonly reported in freshwater environments like aphanocapsa aphanothece chroococcus cyanodictyon merismopedia snowella and epigloeosphaera callieri and stockner 2002 three genera were recorded in all sites aphanocapsa chroococcus and merismopedia as also observed by laux et al 2018 in this reservoir colonial picocyanobacteria were an important part of the cyanobacteria community showing an average of 85 of the total biomass and were found in 73 of the samples we observed a seasonal pattern and picocyanobacteria were dominant especially during the rainy season generally during summer months and under stratified conditions the relative success of the picocyanobacteria found in volta grande reservoir at low nutrient concentrations is given by the ability of these cells to use any sources of phosphate including organic besides their low cost metabolism callieri 2007 in freshwater environments such as lakes and reservoirs phosphorus has been regarded as the main limiting nutrient for phytoplankton reynolds 2006 but data from the ultraoligotrophic lakes of the patagonian region of argentina diaz et al 2007 have demonstrated that nitrogen deficiency even more than phosphorus can be the cause of low productivity in volta grande reservoir both phosphorus and nitrogen presented low concentration values during several months characterizing the oligomesotrophic state of this environment these relatively low values can be attributed to the capacity of the system to absorb external inputs and to the high flow rate that acts as a dilution factor sarmento et al 2008 also observed in the oligotrophic tropical lake kivu eastern africa that the proportion of two picocyanobacteria subpopulations was larger under stratified conditions with stronger nutrient limitation gomes et al 2012 detected the dominance of aphanocapsa in a tropical reservoir in brazil during the warmer rainy season previously dominated by potentially toxic species such as microcystis this change in dominance may indicate an improvement in the water quality of that reservoir following the reduction in nutrient concentrations there was a spatial variation in the structure of the cyanobacteria community in the reservoir and the sampling sites most centrally located vg2 and vg3 and near the dam vg1 differed from the upstream sites vg4 and vg5 the latter sampling stations are located closer to the river inflow in a portion of the reservoir characterized by lotic features such as high flow and shorter water residence time and this structure difference can be related to higher environmental variability such as larger fluctuation in nutrient supply and higher turbidity of water callieri 2007 harris 1980 nutrient concentrations were also higher in vg4 and vg5 and were associated to higher biomass of filamentous cyanobacteria in these sites this confirms how changes in the nutrient status of the environment could easily affect the cyanobacteria community composition since the trophic state is known to be an important condition for the predominant growth of the picocyanobacteria in a phytoplankton community callieri and stockner 2000 however the trophic state alone cannot explain the prevalence of picocyanobacteria that appear to be favored under p limitation and they are also sensitive to grazing pressure and light ruber et al 2016 light temperature and phytoplankton community structure can interfere in photosynthetic carbon uptake callieri and stockner 2000 and in some cases the trophic state combined with temperature conditions can explain half of the variation in picocyanobacteria abundance across aquatic environments contant and pick 2013 the importance of temperature can be observed in this study because the picocyanobacteria were more abundant during the rainy season in summer the period characterized by higher temperatures beside its direct influence on metabolic rates like photosynthesis and respiration temperature also affects water stratification patterns thus having an effect on nutrient availability in the upper layers of the water body o neil et al 2012 thus it is possible that in warmer months picocyanobacteria were more competitive than larger species in volta grande reservoir and produced higher biomass water temperature is not always considered as a regulating condition for tropical environments where temperature and light are high throughout the year allowing a permanently high biological activity sarmento 2012 however our data showed a clear trend of higher picocyanobacteria biomass in the warmer season indicating that even in tropical environments seasonality may play an important role in shaping communities on the other hand the values of water transparency in volta grande reservoir estimated by secchi disk were quite elevated throughout the entire study period therefore light availability should not be characterized as a limiting factor in this environment even though we could only estimate the abundance of the colonial morphotypes the almost constant dominance of picocyanobacterial taxa that we observed may be related to the higher mean primary production of this group in tropical than in temperate lakes as previously reported kilham and kilham 1990 1991 sarmento 2012 promoted by high and constant irradiance high water transparency and more efficient nutrient recycling in the water column favored by rapid metabolic activity at higher temperatures factors such as nutrient limitation variability of the light competition with other phytoplankton species and food web structure isumbisho et al 2006 have also shown their importance in determining picocyanobacterial abundance weisse and kenter 1991 sarmento et al 2006 2008 komárek et al 2014 and references therein and the changes of picocyanobacteria structure are probably caused by the combined effect of several environmental and biological factors zhong et al 2013 the taxonomic identity of the picocyanobacteria colonial species detected in volta grande reservoir by morphological analysis was not confirmed by molecular dgge analysis according to the molecular analysis only few taxonomic units otus were detected cyanobium an unicellular genus of common occurrence in freshwater environments callieri et al 2012 and synechococcus also unicellular described in freshwater and marine environments and in different ecological niches including pelagic environment as well as growing in periphytic consortia and which versatility explains its global dispersal callieri et al 2013 synechococcus is abundant in aquatic environments marine and freshwater and widespread worldwide ahlgren and rocap 2012 stockner et al 2000 unicellular picocyanobacteria are very abundant in oligo to mesotrophic environments while colonial forms may occur in meso to eutrophic environments callieri 2007 callieri and stockner 2000 therefore the traditional method of identifying and quantifying plankton communities utermöhl 1958 although widely recognized and accepted for the cyanobacteria group as a whole is not able to detect correctly the presence of unicellular genera of picocyanobacteria due to their small size 0 5 2 0μm and simple morphology crosbie et al 2003 for these forms the identification and quantification of cells by epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry is more appropriate diamond and de maggio 2000 in our study even though several picocyanobacteria species were recorded by microscopy they belonged to colonial forms nevertheless the low genetic diversity that we measured in this work could suggest as first hypothesis lack of specificity of the chosen primers since the detection of microbes is strictly dependent upon the primers chosen and the analyses performed wilmotte and golubić 1991 we used a set of primers specific for cyanobacteria nübel et al 1997 however the primers showed only identified sequences belonging to unicellular genera synechococccus cyanobium and no colonial picocyanobacteria were detected by molecular method it is possible that the difficulty of isolating and cultivating picocyanobacteria means that the number of deposited sequences is still very small which makes it difficult to compare the data obtained from natural environments with strain sequences deposited from the genbank a proof to this second hypothesis is that the dendrogram that was constructed based on the bands diversity showed the presence of several distinct clusters with clearly seasonal pattern thus even though the sequences identified only two main genera there were several unique strains among them that could characterize the presence of different species as mentioned above the widespread distribution of synechococcus in several habitats and environments is an indication that this genus is possibly representing several different organisms which identification need to be revisited using a metagenomic approach laux et al 2018 also found low genetic diversity and cyanobium and synechococcus as the most common genera in this reservoir the authors also emphasized the still poor knowledge of molecular sequences for picocyanobacteria taxa jasser et al 2013 studying the seasonal changes in the picocyanobacterial community of nine lakes ranging from mesotrophic to hypereutrophic highlighted that dgge is a method biased towards more abundant populations and it possibly underestimates the overall genetic diversity of the community but it is important to remember that due to the difficulty in culturing and isolating picocyanobacteria cells in environmental studies dgge is a technique that allows in situ dna characterization of the species caravati et al 2010 on the other hand molecular data do not provide unequivocal phylogenetic information wilmotte and golubić 1991 even more modern methods such as high trough putting sequencing have limitations since for example they do not differentiate viable from dead cells as all dna fragments are detected potentially overestimating diversity douterelo et al 2014 therefore through the combination of molecular morphological and ecophysiological approaches we should be able to provide a better description of the environment as the failure of one methodology may be compensated by the results given by the other in our case it is possible that the apparently low genetic diversity registered in this reservoir may hide a high percentage of new strains not yet described at present the morphological analysis was more successful to detect higher diversity in the cyanobacteria community of this reservoir dominated by small colonial picocyanobacteria 5 conclusions picocyanobacteria were the dominat group in volta grande reservoir and were present in all five sampling sites the genera observed are of the common occurrence in freshwater environments callieri and stockner 2002 the most abundant colonial picocyanobacteria were aphanocapsa merismopedia and chrooococcus there was a seasonal difference in picocyanobacteria occurrence and the highest biovolumes and richness were recorded during the rainy season there was a spatial pattern in the planktonic community structure from sites vg1 and vg2 closer to the dam toward the more upstream vg4 and vg5 stations following a gradient from lower to higher nutrient concentrations the low trophic state found in volta grande reservoir oligo to mesotrophic is probably favoring the maintenance and dominance of a picocyanobacterial rich community that represented on average 85 of the cyanobacteria total biovolume species belonging to the order chroococcales nostocales and oscillatoriales were also detected and they were in general better represented in the upstream stations the presence of potential toxic species as microcystis even though rare is a reminder that changes in the trophic conditions could promote the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria blooms downing et al 2001 the techniques used to evaluate the composition and dynamics of picocyanobacteria in volta grande reservoir showed the presence of several species by morphology but very few genera were identified by molecular methods however even though few genera were recognized by band sequencing the analysis of the dgge band patterns showed the presence of different community composition in different periods of the year suggesting the need of increasing the genetic description of several small sized picocyanobacteria even with these limitations the use of the two methodologies to characterize the community offered new insights into its composition and confirmed that the current underestimated diversity of picocyanobacteria deserves increased consideration in assessments of microbial and freshwater biodiversity ruber et al 2016 conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the

for the extraction of the main trends between environmental variables and phytoplankton variables we performed a principal component analysis pca using the free program past due to existence of autocorrelation nitrite was excluded from the pca because of correlation with nitrate and chlorophyll because of correlation with picocyanobacteria the pca was performed to a dataset including environmental and biological variables some variables showed heterogeneity of variance and data were log transformed to obtain normality and homogeneity required to evaluate data on a similar scale 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variation of cyanobacterial communities colonial picocyanobacteria taxa were present in 44 of 60 samples and amounted to 85 of the total cyanobacterial community biomass figs 2 and 3 the other main groups were the order chroococcales represented by microcystis species represented in the figure as other cyanobacteria and several filamentous cyanobacteria nostocales and oscillatoriales that were mainly found in vg4 and vg5 sites located closer to the river inflow into the reservoir figs 1 and 2 three genera of picoyanobacteria were the most dominant chroococcus aphanocapsa and merismopedia and were detected in all five sampling points during several months fig 3 the vg1 and vg2 sampling stations showed similarity with regard to species composition and the same genera were recorded snowella cyanodictyon aphanothece chroococcus aphanocapsa and merismopedia in vg3 most genera were similar with exception of snowella and aphanothece not detected and the genus epigloesphaera not found in vg1 and vg2 fig 3 the main picocyanobacteria species were also found in vg4 and vg5 cyanodictyon aphanothece chroococcus aphanocapsa merismopedia and coelosphaerium but their biovolume was lower than elsewhere the distribution of the species followed the same seasonal trend in most sampling stations with higher cell biovolume especially of picocyanobacteria during the rainy season fig 2 between april and august dry season cyanobacteria biovolume was often close to zero only microcystis spp represented by several species m aeruginosa m novacekii m smithii m protocystis showed high peaks during the dry season vg2 and vg5 as well as some filamentous cyanobacteria vg2 and vg4 the main species of filamentous cyanobacteria observed during this study were dolichospermum sp geitlerinema amphibium g splendidum geitlerinema sp planktolyngbya limnetica p minor planktothrix agardhii p clathrata p isothrix pseudanabaena catenata raphidiopsis sp 3 2 molecular diversity of picocyanobacterial populations in total 358 bands were observed in the dgge analysis in 18 different positions 78 of these bands were extracted from the gels and successfully sequenced the banding patterns were analyzed for similarity and similar bands were clustered together forming a dendrogram fig 4 clusters clearly represented different months showing that the dominant species or strains changed along the seasons the most separated cluster the first from below corresponded to march and april i e the period that characterizes the end of summer and of the rainy season although dgge band profiles showed a consistent temporal variation in all five sampling sites fig s1 suggesting the presence of several genetically different strains the sequences obtained from these bands analyzed by blast showed to be affiliated to very few genera there was very low diversity between the 35 bands sequenced and used to construct the phylogenetic tree fig s1 three clades were formed related to picocyanobacterial genera synechococcus sp and cyanobium sp the first clade was represented in the tree by bands from 278 to 230 these sequences were clustering with synechococcus sp forming a clade where the sequences obtained a minimum of 99 16s rrna gene sequence similarity to genbank strains the second clade represented sequenced bands from 223 to 73 clustering with synechococcus sp and cyanobium sp with minimum of 98 16s rrna gene sequence similarity the third clade comprised also the picocyanobacteria sequences of bands from 91 to 280 clustering with synechococcus sp with minimum de 99 16s rrna gene sequence similarity in total 30 bands 85 clustered with synechococcus 3 3 physical and chemical analyses a principal component analysis pca fig 5 was used to test the relationships among environmental variables secchi depth water temperature dissolved oxygen nutrient nitrate ammonium orthophosphate total phosphorus and biological variables picocyanobacteria and filamentous cyanobacteria biomass the first two axis explained together 64 of the total variability pc1 35 57 and pc2 28 40 and these two components were helpful to explain patterns found in the reservoir as it can be seen in the correlation table fig 5 the main parameters that influenced the system as a whole were nutrients temperature and secchi depth due to association with temperature axis 1 suggests a relationship with seasonality it is in the rainy season with higher temperatures that we observe an increase of total p as well as a decrease of transparency measured as secchi depth more suspended particles in the water column due to rain axis 2 was strongly correlated to orthophosphate fig 5 and at lower degree to other nutrients as nitrate and ammonium and secchi and could describe some spatial variability due to differences among stations closer to the dam or to the river inflow analyses of nitrate ammonium and secchi showed a spatial distribution tables s2 and s3 a third component pc3 fig s2 explained 15 09 of the variance the main variables associated with this third axis are the two cyanobacteria communities picocyanobacteria negative and filamentous positive with positive association to ammonium and dissolved oxygen fig s2 the opposite trends between the two cyanobacteria communities were also visible in fig 2 4 discussion in volta grande reservoir we observed several colonial picocyanobacteria genera commonly reported in freshwater environments like aphanocapsa aphanothece chroococcus cyanodictyon merismopedia snowella and epigloeosphaera callieri and stockner 2002 three genera were recorded in all sites aphanocapsa chroococcus and merismopedia as also observed by laux et al 2018 in this reservoir colonial picocyanobacteria were an important part of the cyanobacteria community showing an average of 85 of the total biomass and were found in 73 of the samples we observed a seasonal pattern and picocyanobacteria were dominant especially during the rainy season generally during summer months and under stratified conditions the relative success of the picocyanobacteria found in volta grande reservoir at low nutrient concentrations is given by the ability of these cells to use any sources of phosphate including organic besides their low cost metabolism callieri 2007 in freshwater environments such as lakes and reservoirs phosphorus has been regarded as the main limiting nutrient for phytoplankton reynolds 2006 but data from the ultraoligotrophic lakes of the patagonian region of argentina diaz et al 2007 have demonstrated that nitrogen deficiency even more than phosphorus can be the cause of low productivity in volta grande reservoir both phosphorus and nitrogen presented low concentration values during several months characterizing the oligomesotrophic state of this environment these relatively low values can be attributed to the capacity of the system to absorb external inputs and to the high flow rate that acts as a dilution factor sarmento et al 2008 also observed in the oligotrophic tropical lake kivu eastern africa that the proportion of two picocyanobacteria subpopulations was larger under stratified conditions with stronger nutrient limitation gomes et al 2012 detected the dominance of aphanocapsa in a tropical reservoir in brazil during the warmer rainy season previously dominated by potentially toxic species such as microcystis this change in dominance may indicate an improvement in the water quality of that reservoir following the reduction in nutrient concentrations there was a spatial variation in the structure of the cyanobacteria community in the reservoir and the sampling sites most centrally located vg2 and vg3 and near the dam vg1 differed from the upstream sites vg4 and vg5 the latter sampling stations are located closer to the river inflow in a portion of the reservoir characterized by lotic features such as high flow and shorter water residence time and this structure difference can be related to higher environmental variability such as larger fluctuation in nutrient supply and higher turbidity of water callieri 2007 harris 1980 nutrient concentrations were also higher in vg4 and vg5 and were associated to higher biomass of filamentous cyanobacteria in these sites this confirms how changes in the nutrient status of the environment could easily affect the cyanobacteria community composition since the trophic state is known to be an important condition for the predominant growth of the picocyanobacteria in a phytoplankton community callieri and stockner 2000 however the trophic state alone cannot explain the prevalence of picocyanobacteria that appear to be favored under p limitation and they are also sensitive to grazing pressure and light ruber et al 2016 light temperature and phytoplankton community structure can interfere in photosynthetic carbon uptake callieri and stockner 2000 and in some cases the trophic state combined with temperature conditions can explain half of the variation in picocyanobacteria abundance across aquatic environments contant and pick 2013 the importance of temperature can be observed in this study because the picocyanobacteria were more abundant during the rainy season in summer the period characterized by higher temperatures beside its direct influence on metabolic rates like photosynthesis and respiration temperature also affects water stratification patterns thus having an effect on nutrient availability in the upper layers of the water body o neil et al 2012 thus it is possible that in warmer months picocyanobacteria were more competitive than larger species in volta grande reservoir and produced higher biomass water temperature is not always considered as a regulating condition for tropical environments where temperature and light are high throughout the year allowing a permanently high biological activity sarmento 2012 however our data showed a clear trend of higher picocyanobacteria biomass in the warmer season indicating that even in tropical environments seasonality may play an important role in shaping communities on the other hand the values of water transparency in volta grande reservoir estimated by secchi disk were quite elevated throughout the entire study period therefore light availability should not be characterized as a limiting factor in this environment even though we could only estimate the abundance of the colonial morphotypes the almost constant dominance of picocyanobacterial taxa that we observed may be related to the higher mean primary production of this group in tropical than in temperate lakes as previously reported kilham and kilham 1990 1991 sarmento 2012 promoted by high and constant irradiance high water transparency and more efficient nutrient recycling in the water column favored by rapid metabolic activity at higher temperatures factors such as nutrient limitation variability of the light competition with other phytoplankton species and food web structure isumbisho et al 2006 have also shown their importance in determining picocyanobacterial abundance weisse and kenter 1991 sarmento et al 2006 2008 komárek et al 2014 and references therein and the changes of picocyanobacteria structure are probably caused by the combined effect of several environmental and biological factors zhong et al 2013 the taxonomic identity of the picocyanobacteria colonial species detected in volta grande reservoir by morphological analysis was not confirmed by molecular dgge analysis according to the molecular analysis only few taxonomic units otus were detected cyanobium an unicellular genus of common occurrence in freshwater environments callieri et al 2012 and synechococcus also unicellular described in freshwater and marine environments and in different ecological niches including pelagic environment as well as growing in periphytic consortia and which versatility explains its global dispersal callieri et al 2013 synechococcus is abundant in aquatic environments marine and freshwater and widespread worldwide ahlgren and rocap 2012 stockner et al 2000 unicellular picocyanobacteria are very abundant in oligo to mesotrophic environments while colonial forms may occur in meso to eutrophic environments callieri 2007 callieri and stockner 2000 therefore the traditional method of identifying and quantifying plankton communities utermöhl 1958 although widely recognized and accepted for the cyanobacteria group as a whole is not able to detect correctly the presence of unicellular genera of picocyanobacteria due to their small size 0 5 2 0μm and simple morphology crosbie et al 2003 for these forms the identification and quantification of cells by epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry is more appropriate diamond and de maggio 2000 in our study even though several picocyanobacteria species were recorded by microscopy they belonged to colonial forms nevertheless the low genetic diversity that we measured in this work could suggest as first hypothesis lack of specificity of the chosen primers since the detection of microbes is strictly dependent upon the primers chosen and the analyses performed wilmotte and golubić 1991 we used a set of primers specific for cyanobacteria nübel et al 1997 however the primers showed only identified sequences belonging to unicellular genera synechococccus cyanobium and no colonial picocyanobacteria were detected by molecular method it is possible that the difficulty of isolating and cultivating picocyanobacteria means that the number of deposited sequences is still very small which makes it difficult to compare the data obtained from natural environments with strain sequences deposited from the genbank a proof to this second hypothesis is that the dendrogram that was constructed based on the bands diversity showed the presence of several distinct clusters with clearly seasonal pattern thus even though the sequences identified only two main genera there were several unique strains among them that could characterize the presence of different species as mentioned above the widespread distribution of synechococcus in several habitats and environments is an indication that this genus is possibly representing several different organisms which identification need to be revisited using a metagenomic approach laux et al 2018 also found low genetic diversity and cyanobium and synechococcus as the most common genera in this reservoir the authors also emphasized the still poor knowledge of molecular sequences for picocyanobacteria taxa jasser et al 2013 studying the seasonal changes in the picocyanobacterial community of nine lakes ranging from mesotrophic to hypereutrophic highlighted that dgge is a method biased towards more abundant populations and it possibly underestimates the overall genetic diversity of the community but it is important to remember that due to the difficulty in culturing and isolating picocyanobacteria cells in environmental studies dgge is a technique that allows in situ dna characterization of the species caravati et al 2010 on the other hand molecular data do not provide unequivocal phylogenetic information wilmotte and golubić 1991 even more modern methods such as high trough putting sequencing have limitations since for example they do not differentiate viable from dead cells as all dna fragments are detected potentially overestimating diversity douterelo et al 2014 therefore through the combination of molecular morphological and ecophysiological approaches we should be able to provide a better description of the environment as the failure of one methodology may be compensated by the results given by the other in our case it is possible that the apparently low genetic diversity registered in this reservoir may hide a high percentage of new strains not yet described at present the morphological analysis was more successful to detect higher diversity in the cyanobacteria community of this reservoir dominated by small colonial picocyanobacteria 5 conclusions picocyanobacteria were the dominat group in volta grande reservoir and were present in all five sampling sites the genera observed are of the common occurrence in freshwater environments callieri and stockner 2002 the most abundant colonial picocyanobacteria were aphanocapsa merismopedia and chrooococcus there was a seasonal difference in picocyanobacteria occurrence and the highest biovolumes and richness were recorded during the rainy season there was a spatial pattern in the planktonic community structure from sites vg1 and vg2 closer to the dam toward the more upstream vg4 and vg5 stations following a gradient from lower to higher nutrient concentrations the low trophic state found in volta grande reservoir oligo to mesotrophic is probably favoring the maintenance and dominance of a picocyanobacterial rich community that represented on average 85 of the cyanobacteria total biovolume species belonging to the order chroococcales nostocales and oscillatoriales were also detected and they were in general better represented in the upstream stations the presence of potential toxic species as microcystis even though rare is a reminder that changes in the trophic conditions could promote the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria blooms downing et al 2001 the techniques used to evaluate the composition and dynamics of picocyanobacteria in volta grande reservoir showed the presence of several species by morphology but very few genera were identified by molecular methods however even though few genera were recognized by band sequencing the analysis of the dgge band patterns showed the presence of different community composition in different periods of the year suggesting the need of increasing the genetic description of several small sized picocyanobacteria even with these limitations the use of the two methodologies to characterize the community offered new insights into its composition and confirmed that the current underestimated diversity of picocyanobacteria deserves increased consideration in assessments of microbial and freshwater biodiversity ruber et al 2016 conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the
