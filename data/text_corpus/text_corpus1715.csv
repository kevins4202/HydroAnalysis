8575,climate change will have both quantitative and qualitative effects on groundwater resources these impacts differ for aquifers in solid and unconsolidated rock in urban or rural locations and in the principal processes of groundwater recharge having knowledge about the intrinsic key parameters aquifer geometries storage properties groundwater renewal rates residence times etc the principal groundwater recharge processes and the temperature imprinting makes it possible to compare and forecast the sensitivity of individual aquifers to climate change the sensitivity of future groundwater temperature development for selected climate projections was qualitatively investigated for representative swiss unconsolidated rock groundwater resources in the central plateau as well as the jura and alpine region for non urban and rural areas climate change is expected to have a strong overall impact on groundwater temperatures in urban areas however direct anthropogenic influences are likely to dominate increased thermal subsurface use and waste heat from underground structures as well as adaptation strategies to mitigate global warming increase groundwater temperatures likewise measurements for the city of basel show that groundwater temperatures increased by an average of 3 0 0 7 c in the period from 1993 to 2016 and that they can exceed 18 c especially in densely urbanized areas similarly regarding shallow aquifers with low groundwater saturated zone thicknesses such as in davos canton grisons groundwater temperatures will strongly be influenced by changes in groundwater recharge regimes in contrast groundwater temperature changes within deep aquifers with large groundwater saturated zone thicknesses such as in biel bienne canton bern or in some cases in aquifers with large distances from the land surface to the groundwater table and extended unsaturated zones such as in winterthur canton zurich are strongly attenuated and can only be expected over long time periods in the context of the presented research we hypothesized that quantitative groundwater recharge and the associated temperature imprinting of aquifers is primarily determined by infiltrating surface waters i e river fed aquifers we show that seasonal shifts in groundwater recharge processes could be an important factor affecting future groundwater temperatures moreover the interaction with surface waters and increased groundwater recharge during high runoff periods are likely to strongly influence groundwater temperatures accordingly for the business as usual climate change scenario and for the end of the century a shift in precipitation and river flood events from summer to winter months could be accompanied by an increase in groundwater recharge in comparatively cool seasons which would be accompanied by a tendency to cool down groundwater resources keywords groundwater recharge temperature imprinting river fed aquifers precipitation fed aquifers seasonal shift 1 introduction climate change cc ipcc 2014 is an important topic on the political agenda not only at national and international level but also with regard to regional adaptation strategies in current discussions questions are raised about many topics including how water resources are affected quantitatively and qualitatively by increased air temperatures although cc is a global phenomenon it is likely that local water balances will also change oni et al 2014 porporato et al 2004 to be able to develop specific adaptation strategies for regions at an early stage it is thus important to understand local impacts that cc may have groundwater temperatures are influenced by various factors some of which are interdependent and effective on different spatiotemporal scales in addition to considering natural thermal influences e g infiltrating surface waters and precipitation regional groundwater flow thermal conductivity of the ground cover anthropogenic inputs must be considered e g thermal groundwater use as well as buildings and tunnel structures likewise we must consider intrinsic properties of aquifers and the influence of anthropogenic activities such as agricultural evolution and urbanization elevated temperatures have complex effects on groundwater quality including biological chemical and physical aspects cec 2000 bates et al 2008 brielmann et al 2009 jesu√üek et al 2013 kipfer and livingstone 2008 kurylyk et al 2014 menberg et al 2014 possemiers et al 2014 for instance municipal drinking water suppliers and industrial groundwater users will be confronted with considerable investments in drinking water treatment in the context of adaptation strategies in urban areas especially with often numerous contaminated industrial sites an increase in groundwater temperatures can result in changes in microbial activity and groundwater chemistry catalysis of biodegradation of pollutants growth of prejudicial bacteria see brock and madigan 1988 increased groundwater temperatures additionally changes the solubility of gases and solids palmer et al 1992 furthermore temperature induced chemical reactions and mixing of injection water can change the porosities and permeability of an aquifer system garcia gil et al 2016 saripalli et al 2001 increased groundwater temperatures also have several practical implications including e g alterations of the thermal use potentials of groundwater resources in general involving positive and negative impacts on existing geothermal energy systems ges and aquifer thermal energy storage ates applications or modification of river stretches where groundwater exfiltrates into surface waters especially in summer comparatively low temperatures in groundwater recharge zones provide refugia for coldwater fish species during periods of thermal stress a clear increasing trend on surface water temperature both lakes and rivers has been observed over the last decades at a global scale dokulil 2014 hannah and garner 2015 morrison et al 2002 o reilly et al 2015 watts et al 2015 webb 1996 in switzerland a sudden warming of about 1 c has been observed at the end of the 1980s which was caused by a shift in the arctic oscillation hari et al 2006 however recent studies using observations since the 1970s show that this shift is part of an underlying trend of an 0 33 c increase per decade in water temperature similar to observations for air temperature michel et al 2020 this increasing trend is more marked in the swiss plateau lowland catchments than in higher altitude streams meanwhile no clear trend in discharge can be identified over the last few decades a correspondingly significant large scale increase in groundwater temperature as could be expected as a result of cc and observed regionally for example in austria umweltbundesamt 2011 has not yet been observed in switzerland bafu 2019 however already since the 1980s a significant increase in groundwater temperatures in the order of 1 c has been observed locally for some unconsolidated alluvial aquifers on the swiss plateau along the rhine emme aare and toess rivers which are fed predominantly by river bank infiltration figura et al 2011 likewise in densely urbanized areas in the city of basel groundwater temperatures increased by an average of 3 0 0 7 c from 1993 to 2016 and locally can exceed 18 c mueller et al 2018 also for aquifers with nivo glacial groundwater regimes climate induced increased glacier melt can lead to a decline in groundwater temperature in the medium term if the temperature of the watercourses infiltrating the groundwater decrease due to the melt water negative response to rising air temperatures at the end of the 1980s groundwater temperature also rose suddenly in many places due to the arctic oscillation as the climate in large parts of the northern hemisphere changed abruptly figura et al 2011 reid et al 2016 serra maluquer et al 2019 during the unusually hot and dry summer of 2003 it was observed that drinking water consumption increased and groundwater temperatures rose to such an extent that in some cases anoxic conditions in the aquifer resulted hoehn and scholtis 2011 in addition to the effects that increased groundwater temperature has on groundwater quality sprenger et al 2011 problems with drinking water production and possible clogging of drinking water wells by precipitated manganese and iron may be of relevance hunt et al 2002 such phenomena must also be considered when interpreting the development of groundwater temperatures hydrological climate studies such as ch2014 impacts 2014 and nfp61 2015 estimate that dry periods in switzerland will occur more frequently in summer in the future while slightly higher precipitation and a rising snow line in winter ch2018 2018 should lead to increased groundwater recharge the studies also predict that the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation will increase in the long term because of cc as a result short term high groundwater levels and spring discharges are likely to occur more frequently in fast reacting karst and shallow unconsolidated rock aquifers according to cchydro bafu 2012 however swiss water resources including groundwater will only change slightly overall in the future nevertheless local to regional bottlenecks in the water supply could increasingly occur because of a shift in the seasonal distribution of precipitation and runoff regarding the effects of cc on groundwater temperature increase a distinction must be made between urban and rural aquifers for non urban and rural areas the cumulative effects of cc temperature imprint associated with the various components of groundwater recharge are expected to have a strong quantitative and qualitative impact on groundwater resources in contrast elevated temperatures observed in urban aquifers are mainly due to local and regional anthropogenic factors while cc only plays a secondary role those factors include underground structures and thermal use of the subsurface water and groundwater by a broad variety of shallow and deep open and closed systems such borehole heat exchangers open loop thermal groundwater usage or energy piles among others bayer et al 2016 epting and huggenberger 2013 it is therefore to be expected particularly in urbanized areas that increased thermal use of the subsurface and adaptation strategies e g more frequent thermal use of aquifers for cooling purposes or increased managed aquifer recharge in summer month in connection with global warming will result in an increase in groundwater temperatures epting et al 2017a garcia gil et al 2015 likewise anthropogenic adaptation strategies could have a greater influence than cc itself sprenger et al 2011 within the framework of the ch2014 impacts 2014 study an initial assessment was carried out for future groundwater temperatures and possible groundwater warming for selected aquifers on the central plateau the study was based on the ch2011 2011 climate projections and concluded that the essential impact that atmospheric cc will have on aquifers not only for those in unconsolidated rock deposits is expected to occur via groundwater recharge for the aquifers examined the essential components of groundwater recharge could be distinguished i e the infiltration of river water river fed aquifers as well as the percolation of precipitation water precipitation fed aquifers the results show that groundwater temperatures will rise in summer especially at locations where groundwater is mainly supplied by infiltrating surface waters the ch2014 impacts 2014 study also notes that there are few studies on the influence that the climate has on quantitative and qualitative changes on aquifers in switzerland likewise those studies did not consider temperature changes in surface waters and thus also increased or decreased temperatures of infiltrating surface waters the evaluations carried out were limited to statistical relationships between the projected air and groundwater temperatures and are therefore subject to relatively large uncertainties accordingly the ch2014 impacts 2014 study concluded that further research should focus on suitable groundwater models temperature based field experiments and long term monitoring most research to date has focused on predicting possible impacts on the hydrology of surface waters while large regional and coarse resolution models have been used for groundwater systems to determine their sensitivity to changes in critical input parameters such as precipitation and runoff york et al 2002 yusoff et al 2002 likewise changnon et al 1988 and zektser and loaiciga 1993 showed that one expected consequence will be changes in recharge to regional groundwater aquifers thus causing shifts in groundwater levels with a few exceptions of detailed investigations of very small aquifers e g malcolm and soulsby 2000 most studies concentrate on entire catchment areas and only on changes in percolating precipitation water i e precipitation fed aquifers likewise in a synopsis of cc effects on groundwater recharge smerdon 2017 highlights the importance of understanding groundwater recharge processes including timing and location for the characterization of groundwater resource assessment the author summarizes six review articles crosbie et al 2013 green et al 2011 kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 meixner et al 2016 moeck et al 2016 taylor et al 2013 which illustrate the uncertainty of distribution and trend in future precipitation from general circulation models gcms results in varying predictions of recharge so much so that modelling studies are often not able to predict the magnitude and direction increase or decrease of future recharge conditions of interest are coupled hydrologic systems where changes in surface flow regime and changes in recharge to groundwater interact to affect both groundwater and surface water however only a few studies exist which address groundwater surface water interactions under cc scenarios e g scibek et al 2007 allen et al 2004 investigated variations in recharge to an aquifer in british columbia canada under different cc scenarios and demonstrate the high impact on the groundwater system caused by changes in river stage elevations these interactions are particularly important since in contrast to common assumptions of many groundwater protection concepts groundwater recharge often comprises large fractions of river water infiltration huggenberger and epting 2011 the work presented here originates from the hydro ch2018 project and the add on module called current status and temperature development of swiss unconsolidated rock groundwater resources within the scope of this research project for generally highly productive river valley aquifers we hypothesized that quantitative groundwater recharge and the associated temperature imprinting of aquifers is primarily determined by infiltrating surface waters i e river fed aquifers to support this hypothesis we investigated 38 representative urban and rural swiss porous aquifers from which we derived intrinsic key parameters such as aquifer geometries storage properties groundwater renewal rates residence times and the principal groundwater recharge processes including temperature imprinting subsequently we investigated the effects that seasonal shifts had on the main groundwater recharge components and the sensitivity to future groundwater temperature development for selected climate projections specifically we focused on the aquifers interaction with surface waters and the increased groundwater recharge during high runoff periods which are expected to have a strong influence on groundwater temperatures of river fed aquifers 2 investigation areas fig 1 shows the representative urban and rural swiss porous aquifers unconsolidated sediments mainly coarse fluvial gravel deposits in the river valleys that we selected for the study a urban area and surroundings of canton basel city and the main river valleys of canton basel land b winterthur city and the surrounding areas in canton zurich c biel bienne city and the surrounding areas in canton bern and d the urban area and surroundings of davos in canton grisons 3 concept and methods to derive the intrinsic key parameters of the aquifers that we investigated the aquifer geometries were first delineated this delineation is related to the regional settings of the aquifers according to the river corridor concept stanford and ward 1993 we describe how a hydraulic and thermal current state can be defined for the investigated aquifers which is a prerequisite that allows us to discuss changes subsequently we explain our approach on how to determine groundwater renewal rates and mean residence times as well as how to assess the relevant processes for groundwater recharge and water balances finally the chosen climate projections are introduced 3 1 delineation of aquifer geometries the lower boundary of the studied aquifers is defined by the bedrock surface shaped during the last glaciations to enable a systematic evaluation of intrinsic and extrinsic settings and boundary conditions the aquifers were subdivided to define hydraulic and thermal boundary conditions a definition of boundary conditions for individual aquifers or aquifer subdomains which can be understood as management units makes it possible to quantify inflows outflows and different components of groundwater recharge and thermal influences such a delineation is not only relevant to managing subsurface resources practically manageable aquifer units but also to defining model boundaries or sub boundaries that can be used for mass and heat balance calculations for specific aquifer domains epting et al 2017b having knowledge of aquifer geometries allows us to investigate groundwater resources sensitivity to e g drought events shallow aquifers with relatively small storage volumes and short groundwater residence times empty relatively quickly during drought periods but subsequently can also rapidly be filled up again on the contrary aquifers with large storage volume and long groundwater residence times react in a damped and retarded way to individual drought events subsequently more time and more precipitation are required to re fill these aquifers for example the high yields of the aquifer along the river langete canton bern showed practically no reaction during the great drought of 2003 buwal et al 2004 the aquifer geometries of the unconsolidated rock groundwater resources were derived based on topographic data along the solid rock surface the land surface and the mean groundwater surface with the information of the aquifer geometries the storage properties of the aquifers are qualitatively characterized this information includes 1 the volumes of saturated and unsaturated unconsolidated rock deposits which are stored in individual aquifers during average hydrological boundary conditions 2 groundwater saturated zone thicknesses and 3 depths from the surface to the groundwater table also for individual sites low and high groundwater levels were considered likewise the seasonal dependence of the percolation of precipitation to the groundwater table as well as thermal influences on especially shallow aquifers were qualitatively evaluated 3 2 the river corridor concept for the aquifers we studied we followed the river corridor concept of stanford and ward 1993 which emphasizes exchange processes between surface waters and groundwater systems fig 2 many alluvial rivers in central europe flow in very porous floodplains while the base of aquifers in river valleys is characterized by complex bedrock topography furthermore sequences of aquifers are often observed whereby basins filled with unconsolidated gravel deposits are separated by bedrock steps the bedrock steps knick points stanford and ward 1993 formed as a result of differences in erodibility of the local bedrock or geological formations formed by fluvial or faulting activity huggenberger et al 2013 in river reaches upstream of knick points groundwater is forced out of the aquifer to the surface due to a reduction of the saturated cross sectional area and a subsurface barrier with lower hydraulic conductivity whereas the continuity of the main groundwater flow within the valleys may partially be interrupted by rock steps there still may be a connection between the unconsolidated rock groundwater resources via karst and or fracture systems epting et al 2015 2018a losing and gaining reaches of channels are related to so called knick points or bedrock steps stanford and ward 1993 infiltration of river water into groundwater aquifers structured by fluvial outwash materials can reach specific infiltration rates of up to 1 m3 d 1 per m2 of river bed affolter et al 2010 exchange rates are controlled by the difference between the river stage and groundwater head and the hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed seasonal variation in the height of the water table and channel stage can alter the magnitude location and direction of exchange affolter et al 2010 3 3 hydraulic and thermal current state the hydraulic and thermal current state describes an average situation including seasonal but also event and use related variations in groundwater flow and thermal regimes for a defined groundwater area an inventory of the current state of aquifers or subsurface resources in general involves assessing the geological hydrological and anthropogenic settings mostly stationary character as well as boundary conditions mostly transient character to assess the anthropogenic changes of subsurface resources that have already occurred the current state can be compared with a potential natural state epting et al 2017a a differentiated characterization of the hydraulic and thermal current state of the aquifers could be performed based on existing data sets geographical information systems gis hydraulic and temperature measurements in groundwater and surface waters in canton basel city epting and huggenberger 2013 and in canton basel land epting et al 2015 annex 1 the concept and methodological approaches developed for these aquifers could subsequently be applied to the other selected unconsolidated rock groundwater resources fig 1 having a definition of potentially natural groundwater temperatures allows us to estimate how strongly thermal groundwater regimes have already been affected by cc or other anthropogenic impacts since temporally and spatially high resolution groundwater heat transport models currently only exist for canton basel city for the other investigation areas the warming of the aquifers was evaluated based on long term temperature measurements in groundwater monitoring wells in relation to annual mean atmospheric temperatures 3 4 groundwater renewal rates and mean residence times a derivation of groundwater flow paths times and velocities allowed us to estimate renewal rates and mean residence times these are the basis for assessing aquifer sensitivity to climate and anthropogenic change the residence time calculation was carried out based on the hydrology tool in arcmap and the geotherm tools developed by alcaraz et al 2016 the residence times œÑ can be calculated by using the following formula 1 œÑ f l gw œï v darcy where flgw m is the groundwater flow length ŒΩdarcy m s 1 is the darcy flow velocity and œï is the effective porosity ranging between 0 œï 1 the groundwater flow direction and fl gw can be calculated based on the groundwater head raster data sets annex 1 it is assumed that the calculated fl gw describes the travelled distance of a water particle along a flow path within the aquifer towards a draining feature e g a watercourse or hydraulically lower boundary of the aquifer renewal rates and mean residence times were derived by investigating a range of realistic aquifer properties hydraulic permeability and porosity for the aquifers that we investigated 3 5 groundwater recharge balance contrary to the consideration of entire river catchment areas for which a more or less closed water balance can be calculated additional water components inflows and outflows must be considered for aquifers over different boundaries as an example fig 3 illustrates which water components must be considered for the aquifer of the aesch and reinach municipalities canton basel land table 1 summarizes the main groundwater recharge components natural boundary conditions include percolating precipitation regional groundwater inflow imported groundwater regimes and outflow inflow from the lateral hillslope catchment areas and linear interaction of surface waters with groundwater in addition in the mountainous regions of the jura mountains and the alps we must consider the interaction of unconsolidated rock groundwater resources with regional karst and fissured rock aquifers anthropogenic boundary conditions include groundwater extraction and artificial recharge as well as for thermal issues the subsurface and groundwater use for cooling and heating purposes along with thermal influences of underground structures some of the groundwater recharge components are directly influenced by atmospheric cc via hydrological runoff conditions due to changing precipitation patterns and temperatures furthermore the various groundwater recharge components have no linear relationship with precipitation events likewise groundwater recharge also depends on soil water saturation as well as the duration and intensity of individual precipitation events or vegetation periods changes in the various groundwater recharge processes take place at a time scale which is largely unknown fig 3 also summarizes the different types of river groundwater interaction whereas for our studies the infiltration of surface waters into groundwater represents the most important groundwater recharge component to evaluate the effects that cc has on the interaction of surface waters with groundwater one must consider the following three relationships a climate induced hydraulic change higher lower groundwater and or river levels and the associated changes in interaction type b climate induced temperature change of river water and groundwater and c temperature dependence of viscosity and thus of river bed and aquifer permeability the quantification of river section lengths for the different types of interaction allows us to make a qualitative description of the changes expected by the climate projections likewise in the case of extended drought periods both river and groundwater levels will decrease river sections with interaction types c and d will increase and interaction types a and b will decrease fig 3 accordingly the exfiltration of groundwater to surface waters decreases and the infiltration from surface water into groundwater increases 3 6 climate projections to evaluate climate related changes to the different groundwater recharge components of aquifers 17 climate projections developed within ch2018 2018 have been selected ch project team 2018 ch 2018 feigenwinter et al 2018 based on the description of the climate projection given in ch2018 2018 these scenarios are representative of the whole range of precipitation and temperature output in the future the emission scenarios rcp 2 6 4 scenarios consistent climate protection and limitation of warming to 2 c compared to the pre industrial state rcp 4 5 6 scenarios medium development with limited climate protection and rcp 8 5 7 scenarios no climate protection were studied table a2 1 annex 2 summarizes the 17 selected climate projections these scenarios have already been used in hydrological application such as in brunner et al 2019 as the ch2018 scenarios only provide daily data for the modelling of river runoff and temperatures michel et al 2021 developed a disaggregation method which allows to generate hourly values with a daily cycle this method uses a delta approach similar to bosshard et al 2011 which is widely used see e g ch2011 2011 historical and future daily data are averaged for each day of the year i e all first of january all 2nd of january and so on to obtain a time series length of 365 days these time series are further smoothed by using harmonic functions then the difference between past and future smoothed time series is computed additive difference for temperature multiplicative for other variables to obtain the delta between the two time periods finally the delta is applied to historical hourly data to obtain an hourly time series in the future the main improvement compared to the work of bosshard et al 2011 and what was used in ch2011 is about the choice of the best harmonic to smooth the data to capture the main seasonal signal of the cc projection without adding non natural noise in the data in addition this method allows to correct one of the main limitations of the ch2018 dataset indeed michel et al 2021 show that the missing inter variable and inter station correlation in ch2018 is restored by applying the temporal downscaling algorithm the meteorological data are downscaled to hourly data for the reference periods 1985 2015 2040 2070 and 2070 2100 a benefit of this method is that the time series obtained represent the mean climate of the 30 years future periods with the year to year variability being the same as the historical time series used for the downscaling this method is shown to really capture the monthly or seasonal behavior of the cc scenario however the main drawback is that some information is lost by using this approach in particular regarding extreme events e g for precipitation with this method the frequency of precipitation remains the same in the future as in the past and only the amplitude is modified which is an important simplification the dataset obtained is nevertheless relevant to study the main trends induced by cc and to analyzing the output at monthly to yearly scale but it is not suited to study extreme events or short time variations these time series are then used in the models alpine3d streamflow over 10 year periods i e 10 years in the middle of the 30 year period where downscaling is applied since computational limits forbid running the model over 30 year periods however the delta method is shown to capture the mean behavior of the 30 year time series reducing the error made by using shorter time series in addition while 30 year time series are the standard it is recognized by the wmo that for most applications 10 year time series are perfectly suited wmo 2017 the main concern while using short time series is precipitation which presents oscillations driven by long term oscillations in the climate system by using 30 years to compute the delta between historical and future time series we smooth out most of these oscillations when delta is applied to historical time series some oscillations from the historical hourly time series itself remain and might be present especially when we use only 10 years however the same historical time series serve as basis for all the periods where downscaling is applied so this signal will be exactly the same for all the time periods consequently when comparing model output in the past and in the future we see the impact that the main cc signal has and omit most of the perturbation form large scale atmospheric oscillations an example for the eulach catchment is given in annex 2 figs a2 1 and a2 2 where the difference between the end of the century and the historical period is shown to change by a maximum of 15 for discharge and 8 for temperature when using 10 year instead of 30 year time periods this uncertainty is not negligible however small enough to not impact the analysis presented here 3 7 discharge and water temperature modelling in the framework of the hydro ch2018 project the hourly time series have been used with the alpine3d lehning et al 2006 and streamflow models gallice et al 2016 to simulate water discharge and temperature for the reference periods 1995 2005 2050 2060 and 2080 2090 michel et al 2020 alpine3d is a physically based snow and soil model which provides output on soil temperature and runoff at the bottom of the soil column it is based on the snowpack model lehning et al 2002a 2002b this model is physically based and most processes such as the energy balance of the mass fluxes are computed using state of the art formulations these outputs are then used in streamflow a semi distributed physical hydrological mode to compute the discharge and water temperature models source codes are available at https models slf ch examples of the application of these models are e g brauchli et al 2017 wever et al 2017 or griessinger et al 2016 both models run at 500 m resolution and use as input air temperature precipitation relative humidity and incoming shortwave and longwave radiation from meteoswiss point measurement stations input meteorological data are extrapolated to the grid with algorithms provided by the meteoio library bavay and egger 2014 for the landwasser catchment alpine3d uses glacier maps provided by zekollari et al 2019 for historical and future periods obtained with the same ch2018 scenarios the water residence time in the soil reservoirs and the ground heat flux need to be calibrated in streamflow table a2 2 annex 2 shows the performance of the model over the calibration and verification period along with the meteoswiss stations used in each catchment more discussion about the calibration is given as supplementary information for the rivers birs suze and eulach the kling gupta efficiency kge coefficient gupta et al 2012 that we used to assess discharge performance is above 0 85 which is indeed good results are a bit less good for the river ergolz 0 72 and the river landwasser 0 62 but still acceptable regarding temperature the mean square error mse computed on daily values is between 0 7 and 1 2 c for all catchments except for the river suze where it is 1 75 c the further evaluations cover the future periods 2050 2060 and 2080 2090 which were compared to the reference period 1995 2005 in annex 2 the ability of the model and ch2018 forcing time series to correctly reproduce discharge and water temperature for the historical period 1995 2015 is discussed this discussion shows that the model obtains good performances which are comparable to other results in the literature e g brunner et al 2020 figs a2 5 and a2 6 annex 2 illustrate the simulation results for all projections over the ten year periods 1995 2005 2050 2060 and 2080 2090 it is important to notice that the boxplots show the range between different scenarios but not year to year variability indeed the plots show the seasonal mean averaged over the 11 years of simulation for each scenario this way the main climatic behavior can be observed but not potential extreme years as discussed above the downscaling method used is not suited for extreme event studies explaining why they are not discussed in the analysis future developments of the downscaling method might focus on not losing information about extreme events as their occurrence might also change in the future in contrast for the stream discharge and temperature simulations five meteorological variables were used and only the relative changes of precipitation and temperatures were analyzed to describe the development of the groundwater recharge component by percolating precipitation likewise to derive climate related changes in quantitative groundwater recharge via infiltrating surface waters and associated temperature effects it was important to evaluate changed river runoff and temperatures at selected locations along the rivers within the aquifers that we investigated fig 1 the development of streamflow duration curves streamflow analysis and assessment software metcalfe and schmidt 2016 was investigated annex 3 and we paid attention to the different emission scenarios as well as to the seasonal shift of peak runoff the analysis was possible for all investigation areas except for the groundwater resources in canton basel city this is because no simulations of runoff and temperature development of the rivers rhine and wiese were available from hydro ch2018 4 results table 2 summarizes the main results of the key parameters we evaluated i e aquifer geometries storage properties aquifer connectivity with surface waters and estimated flow paths and times these key parameters are the basis for discussing the principal groundwater recharge processes in the aquifers that we investigated these key parameters allow us to identify parameters that significantly influence the sensitivity to cc that the aquifers we investigated have in the following parts the results presented in table 2 are summarized as are the results from the climate related changes in quantitative groundwater recharge components for the individual aquifers that we investigated figs 4 to 8 generally according to the projections for the annual mean air temperatures ch2014 impacts 2014 annual mean groundwater temperatures will adapt in the long term this temperature response to cc has also been observed for shallow urban groundwater resources e g taylor and stefan 2009 for all the aquifers we investigated the simulations indicate that groundwater recharge by percolating precipitation generally shifts to the winter months which would be accompanied by a tendency to cool down groundwater resources depending on the emission scenario considered and the point in time in the future the ch2018 2018 scenario for the end of the century compared to the period 2005 2015 predicts that air temperatures which can be associated with the temperature imprinting of percolating precipitation will increase by 1 to 3 5 c bas canton basel by 0 9 to 3 8 c rue canton basel land by 1 1 to 3 6 c tae canton thurgau by 1 0 to 3 5 c neu canton neuch√¢tel by 1 1 to 3 9 c cha canton bern by 1 2 to 5 0 c dav canton grisons and by 1 2 to 4 5 c wfj canton grisons in short the increases range from 0 9 to 5 0 c in addition the evaluation of the seasonal runoff duration lines hydrological year show that fewer events with high runoff will occur especially for the months july to september and for all emission scenarios considered fig a3 1 annex 3 if we assume that quantitative groundwater recharge and the associated temperature imprinting of groundwater occurs mainly during characteristic events with high runoff intensity duration a tendency to cool down groundwater resources can be expected 4 1 canton basel city in recent years groundwater temperatures in canton basel city have continuously been higher than annual mean air temperatures which can be regarded as reference temperatures for thermally unaffected groundwater the rise in groundwater temperatures is mainly due to the waste heat introduced by underground structures buildings and infrastructure increasing surface sealing and increased use of groundwater for cooling purposes epting et al 2013 at about half of all groundwater monitoring sites located in urban areas the groundwater temperature was 3 0 0 7 c higher than mean air temperatures mueller et al 2018 an evaluation of the river rhine in the investigated aquifers shows that except during flood events and low groundwater levels the river rhine is largely a receiving watercourse and the process of groundwater exfiltration dominates interaction type b fig 3 accordingly groundwater recharge and temperature imprinting by means of infiltrating surface water plays a minor role and therefore has not been further investigated in the present study nevertheless the river rhine in basel has shown an increase of about 3 c between 1960 and 2010 foen 2012 for the four investigated aquifers in basel city distances from the surface to the groundwater table largely exceed 10 m particularly on the left hand side i e west bank of the river rhine therefore changes in seasonal temperature regimes will affect only part of the aquifers the mean groundwater saturated zone thicknesses are 2 1 to 7 7 m and estimated mean groundwater renewal times range between 42 and 659 days table 2 by means of heat transport modelling in feflow groundwater and energy balances could be investigated mueller et al 2018 for all four aquifers groundwater exfiltration into the river rhine as receiving watercourse dominates see above three exceptions are the infiltration of surface water of the river wiese locally along the river rhine in vicinity of a river dam and the birsfelden hydroelectric power plant furthermore the regional inflows are essential groundwater recharge components whereas the percolation of precipitation plays a negligible role compared to the other boundary conditions given the high degree of sealing in the urban areas of basel and the higher evapotranspiration losses in summer the changes in groundwater recharge and thus the effects on groundwater temperatures will be even smaller compared to rural areas the heat flow over the earth s surface which represents the thermal interaction with the atmosphere is comparatively large but balances out over the year the heat flow associated with the regional groundwater flow and surface waters as well as the heat input of buildings reaching into the groundwater saturated zone are essential for the temperature regime 4 2 canton basel land for the canton basel land 31 aquifers located in the valleys along the main watercourses were evaluated table 2 figs 1 and 4 the groundwater saturated zone thicknesses range between 2 4 and 10 8 m for the aquifers along the rivers birs and birsig distances from the surface to the groundwater table mainly range between 1 and 10 m one exception is the aquifer near the aesch and reinach municipalities where distances range between 10 and 50 m generally for the aquifers along the river ergolz the distances from the surface to the groundwater table as well as the volume of the groundwater saturated zone of the aquifers increase from the headwaters to the confluence with the river rhine estimated mean groundwater renewal times range between 0 6 and 34 9 days in the catchment of the rivers birs and ergolz annual precipitation sums amount to 1 296 and 1 111 mm respectively and evaporation heights are 503 and 557 mm respectively standard period 1981 2010 https hydromaps ch this results in estimates of potential groundwater recharge by means of percolating precipitation of 793 and 554 mm respectively converted to the area of the aquifers we investigated table 2 estimated potential groundwater recharge by means of percolating precipitation ranges between 4 2 and 39 l s 1 aquifers along the river birs and between 2 1 and 33 l s 1 aquifers along the river ergolz excluding surface water runoff for those aquifers for which groundwater flow models exist along the lower valleys of the river birs affolter et al 2010 epting et al 2018b and the rivers ergolz and frenke epting et al 2018b groundwater budgets for different hydrological and operational boundary conditions could be calculated and evaluated annex 4 the evaluations show that except for the aquifer located upstream of the municipality laufen the infiltration of surface water during flood events can increase by orders of magnitude because of changed hydraulics within the rivers and aquifers as well as the transient character of river bed permeability for the different river sections an indirect correlation between groundwater recharge by infiltrating surface water and discharge level in the rivers could be shown epting et al 2018b further relevant boundary conditions are the regional groundwater flow quantitatively the share of the inflow via hillslope areas and if available artificial groundwater recharge and extraction is of varying relevance for the different modelled aquifers interactions with regional karst systems can be important whereas the percolation of precipitation is quantitatively insignificant for the rivers birs and ergolz different locations in the headwaters and near the confluence with the river rhine were evaluated for the rcp 8 5 scenarios and for the reference periods 1995 2005 and 2080 2090 figs 1 and 5 because of decreased runoff during summer jja and autumn son months for all sites it can be expected that groundwater recharge by means of infiltrating surface water also decreases this effect could be associated with a reduction of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively warm surface water infiltration in contrast in winter djf runoff tends to increase but less in spring mam months likewise this effect could be associated with an increase of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively cold surface water infiltration all in all these developments would be accompanied by a tendency to cool down groundwater resources fig a2 5 in annex 2 summarizes the simulation results for all rcps and time periods with respect to rcp 2 6 and 4 5 no major change in mean is expected but it is expected in the variability of river runoff compared to the hypothesized tendency to cool down groundwater for climate projection rcp 8 5 due to the shift of runoff and associated elevated groundwater recharge from summer to winter this effect would not occur for the rcp 2 6 and 4 5 scenarios eventually only the warming effect of raising surface water temperatures would remain 4 3 winterthur canton zurich in recent years groundwater temperatures measured in the city of winterthur and its surroundings were only slightly higher than the annual mean air temperature the groundwater saturated zone thickness can reach up to 105 m whereas distances from the surface to the groundwater table largely exceed 10 m for which neither daily nor seasonal temperature fluctuations play a role estimated mean groundwater residence times range between 17 and 26 days table 2 in the catchment of the river eulach annual precipitation sums amount to 1 178 mm and evaporation height are 497 mm winterthur chzh 009 standard period 1981 2010 https hydromaps ch this results in estimates of potential groundwater recharge by means of percolating precipitation of 681 mm for the area of the investigated aquifer of approx 9 3 km2 table 2 this groundwater recharge component results in 180 l s 1 excluding surface water runoff in addition there is a further reduction of percolating recharge in urbanized areas characterized by surface sealing therefore compared to the regional groundwater inflow and outflow the areal groundwater recharge from percolating precipitation is low this is probably also the case for the not yet quantified interaction with surface waters results of groundwater flow modelling alberich 1997 show that groundwater budgets are mainly characterized by regional groundwater inflow and outflow 920 l s 1 from northeast 2 500 l s 1 from east the influence of the inflow via the lateral hill slope areas approx 22 l s 1 is very low fig 6 shows a cross section of the aquifer along the river eulach over large areas the river is separated from the groundwater table by a thick unsaturated zone however between river lengths 4 8 and 5 2 km the river can be in contact with the groundwater table for the river eulach the results of the simulations for the rcp 8 5 scenarios and for the reference periods 1995 2005 and 2080 2090 show figs 1 and 6 that runoff during summer jja decreases although it is less during the autumn son months in summer this decrease could be associated with a reduction of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively warm surface water infiltration in contrast in winter djf months runoff tends to increase but it is less in spring mam likewise this increase could be associated with an increase of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively cold surface water infiltration all in all these developments would be accompanied by a tendency to cool down groundwater resources fig a2 6 in annex 2 summarizes the simulation results for all rcps and reference periods with respect to rcp 2 6 and 4 5 different behaviors for means are expected and also for the variability of river runoff however for rcp 2 6 river discharge in the winter months djf also is expected to decrease likewise future temperature developments are indistinct for these climate projections and groundwater resource 4 4 biel bienne canton bern in general both groundwater levels and temperatures of most monitoring stations in biel show a high variability and strong trends towards temperature increases https www map apps be ch the aquifer is limited locally and is not in contact with the large aquifer of the river aare fig 7 furthermore deep groundwater recharge through confined artesian aquifers may exist i e karstification of the limestones and dolomites near lake biel at the south western boundary groundwater saturated zone thicknesses can reach up to 167 m whereas distances from the surface to the groundwater table largely range between 1 and 10 m for which daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations play a role estimated mean groundwater recharge times are 61 4 days table 2 in the catchment of the river suze annual precipitation sums amount to 1 411 mm and evaporation height are 497 mm biel 137897 standard period 1981 2010 https hydromaps ch this results in estimates of potential groundwater recharge by means of percolating precipitation of 914 mm for the aquifer we investigated with an area of approx 8 2 km2 table 2 this groundwater recharge component results in 240 l s 1 excluding surface water runoff since most of the slopes around the unconsolidated groundwater near biel are built up most of the slope inflows are captured and an inflow via the lateral slope catchment areas is negligible in the overall water balance therefore the inflow via the lateral hill slope catchments and groundwater recharge from percolating precipitation indicate that these groundwater recharge components play a subordinate role fig 7 also shows a cross section through the aquifer along the river suze the thickness of the unsaturated zone below the river decreases from about 10 to almost 0 m from the inflow into the aquifer to the confluence with lake biel during high runoff there are areas where the river can encounter the groundwater table for the river suze the results for all rcp scenarios figs 1 and 7 fig a2 6 in annex 2 show that runoff during summer jja autumn son and spring mam months decreases particularly for the summer months this decrease could be associated with a reduction of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively warm surface water infiltration in contrast in winter djf months runoff tends to increase likewise this increase could be associated with an increase of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively cold surface water infiltration all in all these developments would be accompanied by a tendency to cool down groundwater resources 4 5 davos canton grisons the groundwater temperatures measured in davos are strongly influenced by the interaction with the river landwasser over large areas of the landwasser valley the groundwater saturated zone thicknesses are comparatively low and on average less than 2 m near the river landwasser and its tributaries distances between the surface and the groundwater table largely range between 1 and 10 m to the hill slopes on the valley margins distances often are above 10 m estimated mean groundwater recharge times are only 7 8 days table 2 results of groundwater modelling performed by geotest ag show that groundwater budgets are characterized mainly by regional groundwater flow approx 30 to 65 l s 1 and inflow from the hill slope catchments approx 132 l s 1 by the interaction with surface waters infiltration 180 l s 1 exfiltration 279 l s 1 but also by groundwater use approx 113 l s 1 in the catchment of the river landwasser annual precipitation sums amount to 1 032 mm and evaporation heights are 328 mm frauenkirch ch 0169 standard period 1981 2010 https hydromaps ch this results in estimates of potential groundwater recharge by means of percolating precipitation of 704 mm for the aquifer we investigated with an area of approx 5 4 km2 table 2 this groundwater recharge component results in 120 l s 1 excluding surface water runoff therefore the estimation of groundwater recharge from percolating precipitation shows that this groundwater recharge component is lower compared to other groundwater recharge components fig 8 also shows a cross section through the aquifer along the river landwasser over large areas the river is separated from the groundwater table by an unsaturated zone however between river lengths 5 5 and 6 km the river can encounter the groundwater table locally and groundwater can exfiltrate into the watercourse the results for all rcp scenarios of the simulations for the river landwasser figs 1 and 8 fig a2 6 in annex 2 show that runoff during summer jja months decreases particularly for the summer months and given the higher evapotranspiration losses in summer this decrease could be associated with a reduction of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively warm surface water infiltration an effect which could be accompanied by a tendency to cool down groundwater resources in contrast in winter djf months runoff tends to increase likewise this effect could be associated with an increase of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively cold surface water infiltration the evaluation of the seasonal runoff duration lines hydrological year for the different emission scenarios shows that tendentially higher runoff for the months october to june can be expected fig a3 1 annex 3 along with the lower runoff for the months july to september seen in all the all aquifers we investigated 5 discussion our evaluation of the aquifers including groundwater saturated and unsaturated zones allowed us to assess their sensitivity to changes in groundwater saturated zone thickness and or the distance from the surface to the groundwater table generally beyond 1 m below the earth s surface temperatures are insensitive to diurnal cycles of air temperature and solar radiation and temperature variations beyond 9 to 12 m below the earth s surface are insensitive to seasonal cycles ashrae 1991 florides and kalogirou 2005 kalogirou and florides 2004 for all aquifers we investigated there are only a few areas where the distance from the surface to the groundwater table is below 1 m penetration depth of daily atmospheric temperature signals with some exceptions distances between the surface and the groundwater table range between 1 and 10 m penetration depth of seasonal atmospheric temperature signals e g epting et al 2013 only some aquifers have average groundwater saturated zone thicknesses below 5 m table 2 the density of watercourses as a measure for interaction of aquifers with surface waters also varies greatly there are very low densities for basel city and in some cases comparatively high densities for individual aquifers in basel land and davos table 2 depending on the distance to watercourses or aquifer outlets estimated groundwater renewal rates range from a few days to more than a year table 2 an evaluation of the surface waters in the aquifers we studied shows that the river rhine in canton basel city is primarily a receiving watercourse and that groundwater exfiltration into the river dominates except during periods of high runoff and low groundwater levels accordingly for most areas in basel water infiltration from the river rhine is a subordinate groundwater recharge component different types of interaction between surface waters and the aquifers can be observed for canton basel land where groundwater flow in the valleys is partially interrupted by rock steps nevertheless there is often a connection between the aquifers via karst and or fracture systems epting et al 2018a the river eulach in winterthur and for the most part the river landwasser in davos are decoupled from the groundwater table even for different hydrological conditions the river suze in biel bienne is also largely decoupled from the groundwater table only at the estuary into lake biel is the river connected to the groundwater table here processes of surface water infiltration into the aquifer dominate which represent temperature imprinting and an important component of groundwater recharge within the scope of the research carried out here the role of regional flood events in connection with increased groundwater recharge could be investigated however the effect that local events such as thunderstorms in summer have on runoff generation and groundwater recharge could not be further investigated even so it is expected that during extreme events especially in the headwaters and middle reaches of watercourses infiltration rates of surface waters will increase in the short term i e local flooding while snow covers plays a minor role in most of the catchments it is an important factor within the landwasser catchment around davos in future the increase of snowmelt and liquid precipitation in winter can come along with an increase of snowmelt and runoff in spring fig a2 6 in annex 2 again more comparatively cold surface water would presumably infiltrate the aquifer in spring months which would tend to cool down groundwater resources 5 1 development of groundwater recharge and groundwater temperatures for the aquifers we investigated it is expected that a change in groundwater recharge through the percolation of precipitation plays a minor role in the overall water balance however a change of inflow via regional groundwater flow components because of changed groundwater recharge in the upstream catchment areas can play a more important role imported groundwater regime in the case of groundwater exfiltrating settings fig 3 larger hydraulic gradients from the groundwater to the surface waters associated with increased groundwater exfiltration would result from more frequent and longer lasting drought periods and lower river stages in alpine regions such as davos a reduced inflow via regional groundwater flow components from the hill slope catchment and changes in snowmelt water contribution may play a more important role see also above fig 9 summarizes the precipitation development and the simulation results for the surface water runoff for the hydrological half year periods and also for the rcp 2 6 and 8 5 emission scenarios for the years 2055 and 2085 in comparison to the reference year 2000 apart from the river landwasser aquifer in davos all the climate projections for the aquifers we investigated show that compared to the reference year 2000 precipitation increases from october to march and decreases from april to september those half year periods roughly coincide with autumn and winter on the one hand and spring and summer on the other hand diverse developments can be observed in the simulation results for surface water runoff for the hydrological half year periods and for the rcp 2 6 and 8 5 emission scenarios for the rivers birs and ergolz in canton basel land and for climate projection rcp 8 5 surface runoff shifts from summer to winter however with respect to the rcp 2 6 and 4 5 scenarios cf fig 2 4 annex 2 no major change in mean is expected although change is expected in the variability of river runoff for the river suze in biel bienne for all rcp scenarios cf fig a2 6 in annex 2 runoff decreases in summer and increases in winter for the river eulach in winterthur and for the river landwasser in davos an overall reduction of future surface water runoff is expected apart from the winter half year period for rcp 8 5 and the year 2085 generally if runoff during summer jja and autumn son months decreases it can be expected that groundwater recharge by means of infiltrating surface water will also decrease this effect as observed could be associated with a reduction of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively warm surface water infiltration furthermore this effect comes along with higher evapotranspiration losses during the vegetation period especially in summer in contrast increased runoff in winter djf and spring mam could be associated with an increase of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively cold surface water infiltration all in all we observed these developments for the rcp 8 5 scenarios and between the periods 1995 2005 and 2080 2090 for the rivers birs and ergolz in canton basel land the river eulach in winterthur and the river suze in biel bienne it is expected that these developments would be accompanied by a tendency to cool down groundwater however with respect to the rcp 2 6 and 4 5 emission scenarios different behaviors are expected for both the mean and also the variability of river runoff whereas decreased discharge in the winter djf months are expected e g for the river eulach in winterthur the hypothesized tendency of groundwater to cool down in the rcp 8 5 scenario is due to the shift in runoff and to the associated elevated groundwater recharge from summer to winter but this effect would not occur for rcp 2 6 and 4 5 eventually only the warming effect caused by rising surface water temperatures would remain 5 2 utilization potentials adaptation strategies many subsurface use interests in urban areas often conflict requiring new use concepts to be developed for a differentiated assessment and sustainable use of groundwater and thermal energy of the shallow subsurface such concepts in energy planning should make it possible to consider thermal use potentials e g for individual districts while at the same time also considering the qualitative aspects of urban aquifers and the legal requirements for groundwater protection the knowledge we now have on the variability of hydraulic and thermal groundwater regimes for representative swiss unconsolidated rock groundwater resources offers a basis to formulate local adaptation strategies likewise waste heat related to elevated groundwater temperatures in urban aquifers could be used in a targeted and efficient manner having optimization strategies for the documentation of long term temperature changes at reference sites would enable researchers to differentiate anthropogenic induced changes from climate induced changes in aquifers the concepts and methodological approaches developed here can enable public authorities to compare characteristic hydraulic and thermal boundary conditions of aquifers and to assess how sensitive the relevant groundwater recharge processes are to cc comparing the hydraulic characteristics e g aquifer properties groundwater recharge interaction with surface waters etc and thermal boundary conditions e g seasonal temperature signals anthropogenic heat input etc in the swiss groundwater resources that we have studied here can serve as a basis to be transferred to groundwater resources in general anthropogenic adaptation strategies e g decreased river and increased groundwater abstraction artificial recharge of river water to replenish groundwater resources could have effects on groundwater resources that could be greater than the effects of cc itself concerning future groundwater use it can be assumed that groundwater extraction and artificial recharge will increase during extended droughts further reduction of residual water flow rates in rivers e g required for ecosystems certainly is a problematic development especially for those with low discharges such as the rivers birs and ergolz in canton basel land since such situations will occur mainly in the summer months and since comparatively warm surface water will be artificially recharged it can be expected that groundwater temperatures will thus rise accordingly for example the high maximum surface water temperatures of the river rhine above 26 c in summer already observed will affect the drinking water supply in the basel region where by means of different systems surface water is artificially recharged to the aquifer likewise it should not be forgotten that extractions of surface water and groundwater can intensify low water runoff situations in rivers in agricultural areas during periods of low precipitation water withdrawals from watercourses are expected to increase reduced quantities of low water runoff would accordingly also reduce groundwater recharge due to reduced infiltration of surface water 5 3 requirements monitoring systems pilot studies for long term monitoring thanks to the increased availability of comparatively inexpensive temperature sensors more and more temperature data have been collected since the 1980s data from observation networks provide valuable information on temperature distributions in groundwater resources and are prerequisites for model calibration and validation however they are inappropriate for studying specific thermal processes such as the heat transport from the surface via the unsaturated zone to the groundwater table the influence of subsurface structures the river groundwater interactions etc for this reason the installation of depth oriented monitoring systems is recommended such systems allow researchers to draw conclusions about vertical temperature distributions in the groundwater or in the unsaturated zone as well as determine the effects that aquifer heterogeneities have on subsurface temperature distributions epting et al 2013 for the aquifers investigated in this study deficits in the available data were shown despite cases of insufficient data this analysis nevertheless allows monitoring concepts to be adjusted and optimized at cantonal level furthermore it is recommended especially in urbanized areas to systematically collect data on thermal groundwater use e g extraction and recharge quantities and temperatures and on the spatial distribution of building structures in the subsurface with such data researchers will be able to quantify the anthropogenic influences on shallow subsurface hydraulic and thermal regimes 5 4 research gaps and open questions it must be noted that future development as well as spatial and temporal dynamics of groundwater temperatures cannot satisfactorily be captured only by statistical evaluations or by spatially interpolated temperature distributions flow and heat transport modelling are required to understand the relevant hydraulic and thermal processes only then can heat balances and thermal utilization potentials be calculated and the thermal effects of future uses of the shallow subsurface be quantified in urbanized areas especially it is expected that an increased thermal use of the subsurface as well as adaptation strategies in connection with global warming positive and negative responses will further impact aquifer temperatures epting and huggenberger 2013 this complex interplay of the various natural and anthropogenic influencing factors can only be adequately analyzed by using flow and heat transport models in addition such models make it possible to quantify the interaction of surface waters with groundwater both spatially and temporally and investigate in greater depth the quantitative and qualitative effects of cc by means of scenario calculations likewise with reasonable effort and further investigations river sections could be evaluated regarding their interaction with groundwater under different hydrological boundary conditions seasonal changes about the occurrence of extreme events could also be studied the possible hydraulic and thermal effects that cc has on surface waters and groundwater could thus be clarified 6 conclusions a significant large scale increase in groundwater temperature as would be expected because of cc has not yet been observed in switzerland although it is clearly observed for surface water temperature bafu 2019 one reason for this observation could be underestimations of quantitative increases of groundwater recharge in the hydrological winter half year which tend to cool down aquifers accordingly for the aquifers we studied both for the business as usual cc scenario and for the end of the century groundwater recharge via percolating precipitation and infiltrating surface waters increasingly will take place in comparatively cold months that change would be accompanied by a tendency to cool down groundwater in addition the quantitative share of groundwater recharge decreases in comparatively warm months a process which is intensified by increased evapotranspiration during the vegetation growth period to understand the future development of groundwater temperatures it is necessary to take a differentiated view of geological site conditions and relevant hydrogeological processes including the processes of groundwater recharge positive and negative responses as well as direct anthropogenic influences these fundamentals are essential for understanding the response of aquifers to anthropogenic and cc impacts within the scope of this research project it was possible to show which basic information is required to characterize hydraulic and thermal current states of aquifers together with the derivation of key parameters such as storage properties water balance dynamics renewal rates and an evaluation of the relevant groundwater recharge processes the tools developed here make it possible to perform an initial assessment on how sensitive aquifers are to the effects of cc for the valley aquifers we investigated the interaction with surface waters and increased groundwater recharge during high runoff might have a strong influence on groundwater temperature likewise the exceedance of characteristic hydraulic threshold values e g relation of river stage to groundwater table along bedrock steps for individual aquifers can be accompanied by increased groundwater recharge for our studies we did not follow the commonly used catchment approach but used the river corridor concept of stanford and ward 1993 and concentrated instead on aquifers located in river valleys such aquifers are most productive not only for water supply but also for agriculture accordingly they are locations where decisions must be taken for groundwater resource management and the development of adaptation strategies the decisive factor for stakeholders is maintaining water supply and quality for different conditions our studies show that by applying relatively simple methods at reasonable costs the sensitivity of aquifers to climate or anthropogenic induced changes can be assessed in general not all aquifers will react in the same way and only appropriate monitoring systems for groundwater and surface waters facilitate to adequately capture the individual relevant hydrological and hydrogeological processes

8575,climate change will have both quantitative and qualitative effects on groundwater resources these impacts differ for aquifers in solid and unconsolidated rock in urban or rural locations and in the principal processes of groundwater recharge having knowledge about the intrinsic key parameters aquifer geometries storage properties groundwater renewal rates residence times etc the principal groundwater recharge processes and the temperature imprinting makes it possible to compare and forecast the sensitivity of individual aquifers to climate change the sensitivity of future groundwater temperature development for selected climate projections was qualitatively investigated for representative swiss unconsolidated rock groundwater resources in the central plateau as well as the jura and alpine region for non urban and rural areas climate change is expected to have a strong overall impact on groundwater temperatures in urban areas however direct anthropogenic influences are likely to dominate increased thermal subsurface use and waste heat from underground structures as well as adaptation strategies to mitigate global warming increase groundwater temperatures likewise measurements for the city of basel show that groundwater temperatures increased by an average of 3 0 0 7 c in the period from 1993 to 2016 and that they can exceed 18 c especially in densely urbanized areas similarly regarding shallow aquifers with low groundwater saturated zone thicknesses such as in davos canton grisons groundwater temperatures will strongly be influenced by changes in groundwater recharge regimes in contrast groundwater temperature changes within deep aquifers with large groundwater saturated zone thicknesses such as in biel bienne canton bern or in some cases in aquifers with large distances from the land surface to the groundwater table and extended unsaturated zones such as in winterthur canton zurich are strongly attenuated and can only be expected over long time periods in the context of the presented research we hypothesized that quantitative groundwater recharge and the associated temperature imprinting of aquifers is primarily determined by infiltrating surface waters i e river fed aquifers we show that seasonal shifts in groundwater recharge processes could be an important factor affecting future groundwater temperatures moreover the interaction with surface waters and increased groundwater recharge during high runoff periods are likely to strongly influence groundwater temperatures accordingly for the business as usual climate change scenario and for the end of the century a shift in precipitation and river flood events from summer to winter months could be accompanied by an increase in groundwater recharge in comparatively cool seasons which would be accompanied by a tendency to cool down groundwater resources keywords groundwater recharge temperature imprinting river fed aquifers precipitation fed aquifers seasonal shift 1 introduction climate change cc ipcc 2014 is an important topic on the political agenda not only at national and international level but also with regard to regional adaptation strategies in current discussions questions are raised about many topics including how water resources are affected quantitatively and qualitatively by increased air temperatures although cc is a global phenomenon it is likely that local water balances will also change oni et al 2014 porporato et al 2004 to be able to develop specific adaptation strategies for regions at an early stage it is thus important to understand local impacts that cc may have groundwater temperatures are influenced by various factors some of which are interdependent and effective on different spatiotemporal scales in addition to considering natural thermal influences e g infiltrating surface waters and precipitation regional groundwater flow thermal conductivity of the ground cover anthropogenic inputs must be considered e g thermal groundwater use as well as buildings and tunnel structures likewise we must consider intrinsic properties of aquifers and the influence of anthropogenic activities such as agricultural evolution and urbanization elevated temperatures have complex effects on groundwater quality including biological chemical and physical aspects cec 2000 bates et al 2008 brielmann et al 2009 jesu√üek et al 2013 kipfer and livingstone 2008 kurylyk et al 2014 menberg et al 2014 possemiers et al 2014 for instance municipal drinking water suppliers and industrial groundwater users will be confronted with considerable investments in drinking water treatment in the context of adaptation strategies in urban areas especially with often numerous contaminated industrial sites an increase in groundwater temperatures can result in changes in microbial activity and groundwater chemistry catalysis of biodegradation of pollutants growth of prejudicial bacteria see brock and madigan 1988 increased groundwater temperatures additionally changes the solubility of gases and solids palmer et al 1992 furthermore temperature induced chemical reactions and mixing of injection water can change the porosities and permeability of an aquifer system garcia gil et al 2016 saripalli et al 2001 increased groundwater temperatures also have several practical implications including e g alterations of the thermal use potentials of groundwater resources in general involving positive and negative impacts on existing geothermal energy systems ges and aquifer thermal energy storage ates applications or modification of river stretches where groundwater exfiltrates into surface waters especially in summer comparatively low temperatures in groundwater recharge zones provide refugia for coldwater fish species during periods of thermal stress a clear increasing trend on surface water temperature both lakes and rivers has been observed over the last decades at a global scale dokulil 2014 hannah and garner 2015 morrison et al 2002 o reilly et al 2015 watts et al 2015 webb 1996 in switzerland a sudden warming of about 1 c has been observed at the end of the 1980s which was caused by a shift in the arctic oscillation hari et al 2006 however recent studies using observations since the 1970s show that this shift is part of an underlying trend of an 0 33 c increase per decade in water temperature similar to observations for air temperature michel et al 2020 this increasing trend is more marked in the swiss plateau lowland catchments than in higher altitude streams meanwhile no clear trend in discharge can be identified over the last few decades a correspondingly significant large scale increase in groundwater temperature as could be expected as a result of cc and observed regionally for example in austria umweltbundesamt 2011 has not yet been observed in switzerland bafu 2019 however already since the 1980s a significant increase in groundwater temperatures in the order of 1 c has been observed locally for some unconsolidated alluvial aquifers on the swiss plateau along the rhine emme aare and toess rivers which are fed predominantly by river bank infiltration figura et al 2011 likewise in densely urbanized areas in the city of basel groundwater temperatures increased by an average of 3 0 0 7 c from 1993 to 2016 and locally can exceed 18 c mueller et al 2018 also for aquifers with nivo glacial groundwater regimes climate induced increased glacier melt can lead to a decline in groundwater temperature in the medium term if the temperature of the watercourses infiltrating the groundwater decrease due to the melt water negative response to rising air temperatures at the end of the 1980s groundwater temperature also rose suddenly in many places due to the arctic oscillation as the climate in large parts of the northern hemisphere changed abruptly figura et al 2011 reid et al 2016 serra maluquer et al 2019 during the unusually hot and dry summer of 2003 it was observed that drinking water consumption increased and groundwater temperatures rose to such an extent that in some cases anoxic conditions in the aquifer resulted hoehn and scholtis 2011 in addition to the effects that increased groundwater temperature has on groundwater quality sprenger et al 2011 problems with drinking water production and possible clogging of drinking water wells by precipitated manganese and iron may be of relevance hunt et al 2002 such phenomena must also be considered when interpreting the development of groundwater temperatures hydrological climate studies such as ch2014 impacts 2014 and nfp61 2015 estimate that dry periods in switzerland will occur more frequently in summer in the future while slightly higher precipitation and a rising snow line in winter ch2018 2018 should lead to increased groundwater recharge the studies also predict that the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation will increase in the long term because of cc as a result short term high groundwater levels and spring discharges are likely to occur more frequently in fast reacting karst and shallow unconsolidated rock aquifers according to cchydro bafu 2012 however swiss water resources including groundwater will only change slightly overall in the future nevertheless local to regional bottlenecks in the water supply could increasingly occur because of a shift in the seasonal distribution of precipitation and runoff regarding the effects of cc on groundwater temperature increase a distinction must be made between urban and rural aquifers for non urban and rural areas the cumulative effects of cc temperature imprint associated with the various components of groundwater recharge are expected to have a strong quantitative and qualitative impact on groundwater resources in contrast elevated temperatures observed in urban aquifers are mainly due to local and regional anthropogenic factors while cc only plays a secondary role those factors include underground structures and thermal use of the subsurface water and groundwater by a broad variety of shallow and deep open and closed systems such borehole heat exchangers open loop thermal groundwater usage or energy piles among others bayer et al 2016 epting and huggenberger 2013 it is therefore to be expected particularly in urbanized areas that increased thermal use of the subsurface and adaptation strategies e g more frequent thermal use of aquifers for cooling purposes or increased managed aquifer recharge in summer month in connection with global warming will result in an increase in groundwater temperatures epting et al 2017a garcia gil et al 2015 likewise anthropogenic adaptation strategies could have a greater influence than cc itself sprenger et al 2011 within the framework of the ch2014 impacts 2014 study an initial assessment was carried out for future groundwater temperatures and possible groundwater warming for selected aquifers on the central plateau the study was based on the ch2011 2011 climate projections and concluded that the essential impact that atmospheric cc will have on aquifers not only for those in unconsolidated rock deposits is expected to occur via groundwater recharge for the aquifers examined the essential components of groundwater recharge could be distinguished i e the infiltration of river water river fed aquifers as well as the percolation of precipitation water precipitation fed aquifers the results show that groundwater temperatures will rise in summer especially at locations where groundwater is mainly supplied by infiltrating surface waters the ch2014 impacts 2014 study also notes that there are few studies on the influence that the climate has on quantitative and qualitative changes on aquifers in switzerland likewise those studies did not consider temperature changes in surface waters and thus also increased or decreased temperatures of infiltrating surface waters the evaluations carried out were limited to statistical relationships between the projected air and groundwater temperatures and are therefore subject to relatively large uncertainties accordingly the ch2014 impacts 2014 study concluded that further research should focus on suitable groundwater models temperature based field experiments and long term monitoring most research to date has focused on predicting possible impacts on the hydrology of surface waters while large regional and coarse resolution models have been used for groundwater systems to determine their sensitivity to changes in critical input parameters such as precipitation and runoff york et al 2002 yusoff et al 2002 likewise changnon et al 1988 and zektser and loaiciga 1993 showed that one expected consequence will be changes in recharge to regional groundwater aquifers thus causing shifts in groundwater levels with a few exceptions of detailed investigations of very small aquifers e g malcolm and soulsby 2000 most studies concentrate on entire catchment areas and only on changes in percolating precipitation water i e precipitation fed aquifers likewise in a synopsis of cc effects on groundwater recharge smerdon 2017 highlights the importance of understanding groundwater recharge processes including timing and location for the characterization of groundwater resource assessment the author summarizes six review articles crosbie et al 2013 green et al 2011 kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 meixner et al 2016 moeck et al 2016 taylor et al 2013 which illustrate the uncertainty of distribution and trend in future precipitation from general circulation models gcms results in varying predictions of recharge so much so that modelling studies are often not able to predict the magnitude and direction increase or decrease of future recharge conditions of interest are coupled hydrologic systems where changes in surface flow regime and changes in recharge to groundwater interact to affect both groundwater and surface water however only a few studies exist which address groundwater surface water interactions under cc scenarios e g scibek et al 2007 allen et al 2004 investigated variations in recharge to an aquifer in british columbia canada under different cc scenarios and demonstrate the high impact on the groundwater system caused by changes in river stage elevations these interactions are particularly important since in contrast to common assumptions of many groundwater protection concepts groundwater recharge often comprises large fractions of river water infiltration huggenberger and epting 2011 the work presented here originates from the hydro ch2018 project and the add on module called current status and temperature development of swiss unconsolidated rock groundwater resources within the scope of this research project for generally highly productive river valley aquifers we hypothesized that quantitative groundwater recharge and the associated temperature imprinting of aquifers is primarily determined by infiltrating surface waters i e river fed aquifers to support this hypothesis we investigated 38 representative urban and rural swiss porous aquifers from which we derived intrinsic key parameters such as aquifer geometries storage properties groundwater renewal rates residence times and the principal groundwater recharge processes including temperature imprinting subsequently we investigated the effects that seasonal shifts had on the main groundwater recharge components and the sensitivity to future groundwater temperature development for selected climate projections specifically we focused on the aquifers interaction with surface waters and the increased groundwater recharge during high runoff periods which are expected to have a strong influence on groundwater temperatures of river fed aquifers 2 investigation areas fig 1 shows the representative urban and rural swiss porous aquifers unconsolidated sediments mainly coarse fluvial gravel deposits in the river valleys that we selected for the study a urban area and surroundings of canton basel city and the main river valleys of canton basel land b winterthur city and the surrounding areas in canton zurich c biel bienne city and the surrounding areas in canton bern and d the urban area and surroundings of davos in canton grisons 3 concept and methods to derive the intrinsic key parameters of the aquifers that we investigated the aquifer geometries were first delineated this delineation is related to the regional settings of the aquifers according to the river corridor concept stanford and ward 1993 we describe how a hydraulic and thermal current state can be defined for the investigated aquifers which is a prerequisite that allows us to discuss changes subsequently we explain our approach on how to determine groundwater renewal rates and mean residence times as well as how to assess the relevant processes for groundwater recharge and water balances finally the chosen climate projections are introduced 3 1 delineation of aquifer geometries the lower boundary of the studied aquifers is defined by the bedrock surface shaped during the last glaciations to enable a systematic evaluation of intrinsic and extrinsic settings and boundary conditions the aquifers were subdivided to define hydraulic and thermal boundary conditions a definition of boundary conditions for individual aquifers or aquifer subdomains which can be understood as management units makes it possible to quantify inflows outflows and different components of groundwater recharge and thermal influences such a delineation is not only relevant to managing subsurface resources practically manageable aquifer units but also to defining model boundaries or sub boundaries that can be used for mass and heat balance calculations for specific aquifer domains epting et al 2017b having knowledge of aquifer geometries allows us to investigate groundwater resources sensitivity to e g drought events shallow aquifers with relatively small storage volumes and short groundwater residence times empty relatively quickly during drought periods but subsequently can also rapidly be filled up again on the contrary aquifers with large storage volume and long groundwater residence times react in a damped and retarded way to individual drought events subsequently more time and more precipitation are required to re fill these aquifers for example the high yields of the aquifer along the river langete canton bern showed practically no reaction during the great drought of 2003 buwal et al 2004 the aquifer geometries of the unconsolidated rock groundwater resources were derived based on topographic data along the solid rock surface the land surface and the mean groundwater surface with the information of the aquifer geometries the storage properties of the aquifers are qualitatively characterized this information includes 1 the volumes of saturated and unsaturated unconsolidated rock deposits which are stored in individual aquifers during average hydrological boundary conditions 2 groundwater saturated zone thicknesses and 3 depths from the surface to the groundwater table also for individual sites low and high groundwater levels were considered likewise the seasonal dependence of the percolation of precipitation to the groundwater table as well as thermal influences on especially shallow aquifers were qualitatively evaluated 3 2 the river corridor concept for the aquifers we studied we followed the river corridor concept of stanford and ward 1993 which emphasizes exchange processes between surface waters and groundwater systems fig 2 many alluvial rivers in central europe flow in very porous floodplains while the base of aquifers in river valleys is characterized by complex bedrock topography furthermore sequences of aquifers are often observed whereby basins filled with unconsolidated gravel deposits are separated by bedrock steps the bedrock steps knick points stanford and ward 1993 formed as a result of differences in erodibility of the local bedrock or geological formations formed by fluvial or faulting activity huggenberger et al 2013 in river reaches upstream of knick points groundwater is forced out of the aquifer to the surface due to a reduction of the saturated cross sectional area and a subsurface barrier with lower hydraulic conductivity whereas the continuity of the main groundwater flow within the valleys may partially be interrupted by rock steps there still may be a connection between the unconsolidated rock groundwater resources via karst and or fracture systems epting et al 2015 2018a losing and gaining reaches of channels are related to so called knick points or bedrock steps stanford and ward 1993 infiltration of river water into groundwater aquifers structured by fluvial outwash materials can reach specific infiltration rates of up to 1 m3 d 1 per m2 of river bed affolter et al 2010 exchange rates are controlled by the difference between the river stage and groundwater head and the hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed seasonal variation in the height of the water table and channel stage can alter the magnitude location and direction of exchange affolter et al 2010 3 3 hydraulic and thermal current state the hydraulic and thermal current state describes an average situation including seasonal but also event and use related variations in groundwater flow and thermal regimes for a defined groundwater area an inventory of the current state of aquifers or subsurface resources in general involves assessing the geological hydrological and anthropogenic settings mostly stationary character as well as boundary conditions mostly transient character to assess the anthropogenic changes of subsurface resources that have already occurred the current state can be compared with a potential natural state epting et al 2017a a differentiated characterization of the hydraulic and thermal current state of the aquifers could be performed based on existing data sets geographical information systems gis hydraulic and temperature measurements in groundwater and surface waters in canton basel city epting and huggenberger 2013 and in canton basel land epting et al 2015 annex 1 the concept and methodological approaches developed for these aquifers could subsequently be applied to the other selected unconsolidated rock groundwater resources fig 1 having a definition of potentially natural groundwater temperatures allows us to estimate how strongly thermal groundwater regimes have already been affected by cc or other anthropogenic impacts since temporally and spatially high resolution groundwater heat transport models currently only exist for canton basel city for the other investigation areas the warming of the aquifers was evaluated based on long term temperature measurements in groundwater monitoring wells in relation to annual mean atmospheric temperatures 3 4 groundwater renewal rates and mean residence times a derivation of groundwater flow paths times and velocities allowed us to estimate renewal rates and mean residence times these are the basis for assessing aquifer sensitivity to climate and anthropogenic change the residence time calculation was carried out based on the hydrology tool in arcmap and the geotherm tools developed by alcaraz et al 2016 the residence times œÑ can be calculated by using the following formula 1 œÑ f l gw œï v darcy where flgw m is the groundwater flow length ŒΩdarcy m s 1 is the darcy flow velocity and œï is the effective porosity ranging between 0 œï 1 the groundwater flow direction and fl gw can be calculated based on the groundwater head raster data sets annex 1 it is assumed that the calculated fl gw describes the travelled distance of a water particle along a flow path within the aquifer towards a draining feature e g a watercourse or hydraulically lower boundary of the aquifer renewal rates and mean residence times were derived by investigating a range of realistic aquifer properties hydraulic permeability and porosity for the aquifers that we investigated 3 5 groundwater recharge balance contrary to the consideration of entire river catchment areas for which a more or less closed water balance can be calculated additional water components inflows and outflows must be considered for aquifers over different boundaries as an example fig 3 illustrates which water components must be considered for the aquifer of the aesch and reinach municipalities canton basel land table 1 summarizes the main groundwater recharge components natural boundary conditions include percolating precipitation regional groundwater inflow imported groundwater regimes and outflow inflow from the lateral hillslope catchment areas and linear interaction of surface waters with groundwater in addition in the mountainous regions of the jura mountains and the alps we must consider the interaction of unconsolidated rock groundwater resources with regional karst and fissured rock aquifers anthropogenic boundary conditions include groundwater extraction and artificial recharge as well as for thermal issues the subsurface and groundwater use for cooling and heating purposes along with thermal influences of underground structures some of the groundwater recharge components are directly influenced by atmospheric cc via hydrological runoff conditions due to changing precipitation patterns and temperatures furthermore the various groundwater recharge components have no linear relationship with precipitation events likewise groundwater recharge also depends on soil water saturation as well as the duration and intensity of individual precipitation events or vegetation periods changes in the various groundwater recharge processes take place at a time scale which is largely unknown fig 3 also summarizes the different types of river groundwater interaction whereas for our studies the infiltration of surface waters into groundwater represents the most important groundwater recharge component to evaluate the effects that cc has on the interaction of surface waters with groundwater one must consider the following three relationships a climate induced hydraulic change higher lower groundwater and or river levels and the associated changes in interaction type b climate induced temperature change of river water and groundwater and c temperature dependence of viscosity and thus of river bed and aquifer permeability the quantification of river section lengths for the different types of interaction allows us to make a qualitative description of the changes expected by the climate projections likewise in the case of extended drought periods both river and groundwater levels will decrease river sections with interaction types c and d will increase and interaction types a and b will decrease fig 3 accordingly the exfiltration of groundwater to surface waters decreases and the infiltration from surface water into groundwater increases 3 6 climate projections to evaluate climate related changes to the different groundwater recharge components of aquifers 17 climate projections developed within ch2018 2018 have been selected ch project team 2018 ch 2018 feigenwinter et al 2018 based on the description of the climate projection given in ch2018 2018 these scenarios are representative of the whole range of precipitation and temperature output in the future the emission scenarios rcp 2 6 4 scenarios consistent climate protection and limitation of warming to 2 c compared to the pre industrial state rcp 4 5 6 scenarios medium development with limited climate protection and rcp 8 5 7 scenarios no climate protection were studied table a2 1 annex 2 summarizes the 17 selected climate projections these scenarios have already been used in hydrological application such as in brunner et al 2019 as the ch2018 scenarios only provide daily data for the modelling of river runoff and temperatures michel et al 2021 developed a disaggregation method which allows to generate hourly values with a daily cycle this method uses a delta approach similar to bosshard et al 2011 which is widely used see e g ch2011 2011 historical and future daily data are averaged for each day of the year i e all first of january all 2nd of january and so on to obtain a time series length of 365 days these time series are further smoothed by using harmonic functions then the difference between past and future smoothed time series is computed additive difference for temperature multiplicative for other variables to obtain the delta between the two time periods finally the delta is applied to historical hourly data to obtain an hourly time series in the future the main improvement compared to the work of bosshard et al 2011 and what was used in ch2011 is about the choice of the best harmonic to smooth the data to capture the main seasonal signal of the cc projection without adding non natural noise in the data in addition this method allows to correct one of the main limitations of the ch2018 dataset indeed michel et al 2021 show that the missing inter variable and inter station correlation in ch2018 is restored by applying the temporal downscaling algorithm the meteorological data are downscaled to hourly data for the reference periods 1985 2015 2040 2070 and 2070 2100 a benefit of this method is that the time series obtained represent the mean climate of the 30 years future periods with the year to year variability being the same as the historical time series used for the downscaling this method is shown to really capture the monthly or seasonal behavior of the cc scenario however the main drawback is that some information is lost by using this approach in particular regarding extreme events e g for precipitation with this method the frequency of precipitation remains the same in the future as in the past and only the amplitude is modified which is an important simplification the dataset obtained is nevertheless relevant to study the main trends induced by cc and to analyzing the output at monthly to yearly scale but it is not suited to study extreme events or short time variations these time series are then used in the models alpine3d streamflow over 10 year periods i e 10 years in the middle of the 30 year period where downscaling is applied since computational limits forbid running the model over 30 year periods however the delta method is shown to capture the mean behavior of the 30 year time series reducing the error made by using shorter time series in addition while 30 year time series are the standard it is recognized by the wmo that for most applications 10 year time series are perfectly suited wmo 2017 the main concern while using short time series is precipitation which presents oscillations driven by long term oscillations in the climate system by using 30 years to compute the delta between historical and future time series we smooth out most of these oscillations when delta is applied to historical time series some oscillations from the historical hourly time series itself remain and might be present especially when we use only 10 years however the same historical time series serve as basis for all the periods where downscaling is applied so this signal will be exactly the same for all the time periods consequently when comparing model output in the past and in the future we see the impact that the main cc signal has and omit most of the perturbation form large scale atmospheric oscillations an example for the eulach catchment is given in annex 2 figs a2 1 and a2 2 where the difference between the end of the century and the historical period is shown to change by a maximum of 15 for discharge and 8 for temperature when using 10 year instead of 30 year time periods this uncertainty is not negligible however small enough to not impact the analysis presented here 3 7 discharge and water temperature modelling in the framework of the hydro ch2018 project the hourly time series have been used with the alpine3d lehning et al 2006 and streamflow models gallice et al 2016 to simulate water discharge and temperature for the reference periods 1995 2005 2050 2060 and 2080 2090 michel et al 2020 alpine3d is a physically based snow and soil model which provides output on soil temperature and runoff at the bottom of the soil column it is based on the snowpack model lehning et al 2002a 2002b this model is physically based and most processes such as the energy balance of the mass fluxes are computed using state of the art formulations these outputs are then used in streamflow a semi distributed physical hydrological mode to compute the discharge and water temperature models source codes are available at https models slf ch examples of the application of these models are e g brauchli et al 2017 wever et al 2017 or griessinger et al 2016 both models run at 500 m resolution and use as input air temperature precipitation relative humidity and incoming shortwave and longwave radiation from meteoswiss point measurement stations input meteorological data are extrapolated to the grid with algorithms provided by the meteoio library bavay and egger 2014 for the landwasser catchment alpine3d uses glacier maps provided by zekollari et al 2019 for historical and future periods obtained with the same ch2018 scenarios the water residence time in the soil reservoirs and the ground heat flux need to be calibrated in streamflow table a2 2 annex 2 shows the performance of the model over the calibration and verification period along with the meteoswiss stations used in each catchment more discussion about the calibration is given as supplementary information for the rivers birs suze and eulach the kling gupta efficiency kge coefficient gupta et al 2012 that we used to assess discharge performance is above 0 85 which is indeed good results are a bit less good for the river ergolz 0 72 and the river landwasser 0 62 but still acceptable regarding temperature the mean square error mse computed on daily values is between 0 7 and 1 2 c for all catchments except for the river suze where it is 1 75 c the further evaluations cover the future periods 2050 2060 and 2080 2090 which were compared to the reference period 1995 2005 in annex 2 the ability of the model and ch2018 forcing time series to correctly reproduce discharge and water temperature for the historical period 1995 2015 is discussed this discussion shows that the model obtains good performances which are comparable to other results in the literature e g brunner et al 2020 figs a2 5 and a2 6 annex 2 illustrate the simulation results for all projections over the ten year periods 1995 2005 2050 2060 and 2080 2090 it is important to notice that the boxplots show the range between different scenarios but not year to year variability indeed the plots show the seasonal mean averaged over the 11 years of simulation for each scenario this way the main climatic behavior can be observed but not potential extreme years as discussed above the downscaling method used is not suited for extreme event studies explaining why they are not discussed in the analysis future developments of the downscaling method might focus on not losing information about extreme events as their occurrence might also change in the future in contrast for the stream discharge and temperature simulations five meteorological variables were used and only the relative changes of precipitation and temperatures were analyzed to describe the development of the groundwater recharge component by percolating precipitation likewise to derive climate related changes in quantitative groundwater recharge via infiltrating surface waters and associated temperature effects it was important to evaluate changed river runoff and temperatures at selected locations along the rivers within the aquifers that we investigated fig 1 the development of streamflow duration curves streamflow analysis and assessment software metcalfe and schmidt 2016 was investigated annex 3 and we paid attention to the different emission scenarios as well as to the seasonal shift of peak runoff the analysis was possible for all investigation areas except for the groundwater resources in canton basel city this is because no simulations of runoff and temperature development of the rivers rhine and wiese were available from hydro ch2018 4 results table 2 summarizes the main results of the key parameters we evaluated i e aquifer geometries storage properties aquifer connectivity with surface waters and estimated flow paths and times these key parameters are the basis for discussing the principal groundwater recharge processes in the aquifers that we investigated these key parameters allow us to identify parameters that significantly influence the sensitivity to cc that the aquifers we investigated have in the following parts the results presented in table 2 are summarized as are the results from the climate related changes in quantitative groundwater recharge components for the individual aquifers that we investigated figs 4 to 8 generally according to the projections for the annual mean air temperatures ch2014 impacts 2014 annual mean groundwater temperatures will adapt in the long term this temperature response to cc has also been observed for shallow urban groundwater resources e g taylor and stefan 2009 for all the aquifers we investigated the simulations indicate that groundwater recharge by percolating precipitation generally shifts to the winter months which would be accompanied by a tendency to cool down groundwater resources depending on the emission scenario considered and the point in time in the future the ch2018 2018 scenario for the end of the century compared to the period 2005 2015 predicts that air temperatures which can be associated with the temperature imprinting of percolating precipitation will increase by 1 to 3 5 c bas canton basel by 0 9 to 3 8 c rue canton basel land by 1 1 to 3 6 c tae canton thurgau by 1 0 to 3 5 c neu canton neuch√¢tel by 1 1 to 3 9 c cha canton bern by 1 2 to 5 0 c dav canton grisons and by 1 2 to 4 5 c wfj canton grisons in short the increases range from 0 9 to 5 0 c in addition the evaluation of the seasonal runoff duration lines hydrological year show that fewer events with high runoff will occur especially for the months july to september and for all emission scenarios considered fig a3 1 annex 3 if we assume that quantitative groundwater recharge and the associated temperature imprinting of groundwater occurs mainly during characteristic events with high runoff intensity duration a tendency to cool down groundwater resources can be expected 4 1 canton basel city in recent years groundwater temperatures in canton basel city have continuously been higher than annual mean air temperatures which can be regarded as reference temperatures for thermally unaffected groundwater the rise in groundwater temperatures is mainly due to the waste heat introduced by underground structures buildings and infrastructure increasing surface sealing and increased use of groundwater for cooling purposes epting et al 2013 at about half of all groundwater monitoring sites located in urban areas the groundwater temperature was 3 0 0 7 c higher than mean air temperatures mueller et al 2018 an evaluation of the river rhine in the investigated aquifers shows that except during flood events and low groundwater levels the river rhine is largely a receiving watercourse and the process of groundwater exfiltration dominates interaction type b fig 3 accordingly groundwater recharge and temperature imprinting by means of infiltrating surface water plays a minor role and therefore has not been further investigated in the present study nevertheless the river rhine in basel has shown an increase of about 3 c between 1960 and 2010 foen 2012 for the four investigated aquifers in basel city distances from the surface to the groundwater table largely exceed 10 m particularly on the left hand side i e west bank of the river rhine therefore changes in seasonal temperature regimes will affect only part of the aquifers the mean groundwater saturated zone thicknesses are 2 1 to 7 7 m and estimated mean groundwater renewal times range between 42 and 659 days table 2 by means of heat transport modelling in feflow groundwater and energy balances could be investigated mueller et al 2018 for all four aquifers groundwater exfiltration into the river rhine as receiving watercourse dominates see above three exceptions are the infiltration of surface water of the river wiese locally along the river rhine in vicinity of a river dam and the birsfelden hydroelectric power plant furthermore the regional inflows are essential groundwater recharge components whereas the percolation of precipitation plays a negligible role compared to the other boundary conditions given the high degree of sealing in the urban areas of basel and the higher evapotranspiration losses in summer the changes in groundwater recharge and thus the effects on groundwater temperatures will be even smaller compared to rural areas the heat flow over the earth s surface which represents the thermal interaction with the atmosphere is comparatively large but balances out over the year the heat flow associated with the regional groundwater flow and surface waters as well as the heat input of buildings reaching into the groundwater saturated zone are essential for the temperature regime 4 2 canton basel land for the canton basel land 31 aquifers located in the valleys along the main watercourses were evaluated table 2 figs 1 and 4 the groundwater saturated zone thicknesses range between 2 4 and 10 8 m for the aquifers along the rivers birs and birsig distances from the surface to the groundwater table mainly range between 1 and 10 m one exception is the aquifer near the aesch and reinach municipalities where distances range between 10 and 50 m generally for the aquifers along the river ergolz the distances from the surface to the groundwater table as well as the volume of the groundwater saturated zone of the aquifers increase from the headwaters to the confluence with the river rhine estimated mean groundwater renewal times range between 0 6 and 34 9 days in the catchment of the rivers birs and ergolz annual precipitation sums amount to 1 296 and 1 111 mm respectively and evaporation heights are 503 and 557 mm respectively standard period 1981 2010 https hydromaps ch this results in estimates of potential groundwater recharge by means of percolating precipitation of 793 and 554 mm respectively converted to the area of the aquifers we investigated table 2 estimated potential groundwater recharge by means of percolating precipitation ranges between 4 2 and 39 l s 1 aquifers along the river birs and between 2 1 and 33 l s 1 aquifers along the river ergolz excluding surface water runoff for those aquifers for which groundwater flow models exist along the lower valleys of the river birs affolter et al 2010 epting et al 2018b and the rivers ergolz and frenke epting et al 2018b groundwater budgets for different hydrological and operational boundary conditions could be calculated and evaluated annex 4 the evaluations show that except for the aquifer located upstream of the municipality laufen the infiltration of surface water during flood events can increase by orders of magnitude because of changed hydraulics within the rivers and aquifers as well as the transient character of river bed permeability for the different river sections an indirect correlation between groundwater recharge by infiltrating surface water and discharge level in the rivers could be shown epting et al 2018b further relevant boundary conditions are the regional groundwater flow quantitatively the share of the inflow via hillslope areas and if available artificial groundwater recharge and extraction is of varying relevance for the different modelled aquifers interactions with regional karst systems can be important whereas the percolation of precipitation is quantitatively insignificant for the rivers birs and ergolz different locations in the headwaters and near the confluence with the river rhine were evaluated for the rcp 8 5 scenarios and for the reference periods 1995 2005 and 2080 2090 figs 1 and 5 because of decreased runoff during summer jja and autumn son months for all sites it can be expected that groundwater recharge by means of infiltrating surface water also decreases this effect could be associated with a reduction of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively warm surface water infiltration in contrast in winter djf runoff tends to increase but less in spring mam months likewise this effect could be associated with an increase of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively cold surface water infiltration all in all these developments would be accompanied by a tendency to cool down groundwater resources fig a2 5 in annex 2 summarizes the simulation results for all rcps and time periods with respect to rcp 2 6 and 4 5 no major change in mean is expected but it is expected in the variability of river runoff compared to the hypothesized tendency to cool down groundwater for climate projection rcp 8 5 due to the shift of runoff and associated elevated groundwater recharge from summer to winter this effect would not occur for the rcp 2 6 and 4 5 scenarios eventually only the warming effect of raising surface water temperatures would remain 4 3 winterthur canton zurich in recent years groundwater temperatures measured in the city of winterthur and its surroundings were only slightly higher than the annual mean air temperature the groundwater saturated zone thickness can reach up to 105 m whereas distances from the surface to the groundwater table largely exceed 10 m for which neither daily nor seasonal temperature fluctuations play a role estimated mean groundwater residence times range between 17 and 26 days table 2 in the catchment of the river eulach annual precipitation sums amount to 1 178 mm and evaporation height are 497 mm winterthur chzh 009 standard period 1981 2010 https hydromaps ch this results in estimates of potential groundwater recharge by means of percolating precipitation of 681 mm for the area of the investigated aquifer of approx 9 3 km2 table 2 this groundwater recharge component results in 180 l s 1 excluding surface water runoff in addition there is a further reduction of percolating recharge in urbanized areas characterized by surface sealing therefore compared to the regional groundwater inflow and outflow the areal groundwater recharge from percolating precipitation is low this is probably also the case for the not yet quantified interaction with surface waters results of groundwater flow modelling alberich 1997 show that groundwater budgets are mainly characterized by regional groundwater inflow and outflow 920 l s 1 from northeast 2 500 l s 1 from east the influence of the inflow via the lateral hill slope areas approx 22 l s 1 is very low fig 6 shows a cross section of the aquifer along the river eulach over large areas the river is separated from the groundwater table by a thick unsaturated zone however between river lengths 4 8 and 5 2 km the river can be in contact with the groundwater table for the river eulach the results of the simulations for the rcp 8 5 scenarios and for the reference periods 1995 2005 and 2080 2090 show figs 1 and 6 that runoff during summer jja decreases although it is less during the autumn son months in summer this decrease could be associated with a reduction of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively warm surface water infiltration in contrast in winter djf months runoff tends to increase but it is less in spring mam likewise this increase could be associated with an increase of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively cold surface water infiltration all in all these developments would be accompanied by a tendency to cool down groundwater resources fig a2 6 in annex 2 summarizes the simulation results for all rcps and reference periods with respect to rcp 2 6 and 4 5 different behaviors for means are expected and also for the variability of river runoff however for rcp 2 6 river discharge in the winter months djf also is expected to decrease likewise future temperature developments are indistinct for these climate projections and groundwater resource 4 4 biel bienne canton bern in general both groundwater levels and temperatures of most monitoring stations in biel show a high variability and strong trends towards temperature increases https www map apps be ch the aquifer is limited locally and is not in contact with the large aquifer of the river aare fig 7 furthermore deep groundwater recharge through confined artesian aquifers may exist i e karstification of the limestones and dolomites near lake biel at the south western boundary groundwater saturated zone thicknesses can reach up to 167 m whereas distances from the surface to the groundwater table largely range between 1 and 10 m for which daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations play a role estimated mean groundwater recharge times are 61 4 days table 2 in the catchment of the river suze annual precipitation sums amount to 1 411 mm and evaporation height are 497 mm biel 137897 standard period 1981 2010 https hydromaps ch this results in estimates of potential groundwater recharge by means of percolating precipitation of 914 mm for the aquifer we investigated with an area of approx 8 2 km2 table 2 this groundwater recharge component results in 240 l s 1 excluding surface water runoff since most of the slopes around the unconsolidated groundwater near biel are built up most of the slope inflows are captured and an inflow via the lateral slope catchment areas is negligible in the overall water balance therefore the inflow via the lateral hill slope catchments and groundwater recharge from percolating precipitation indicate that these groundwater recharge components play a subordinate role fig 7 also shows a cross section through the aquifer along the river suze the thickness of the unsaturated zone below the river decreases from about 10 to almost 0 m from the inflow into the aquifer to the confluence with lake biel during high runoff there are areas where the river can encounter the groundwater table for the river suze the results for all rcp scenarios figs 1 and 7 fig a2 6 in annex 2 show that runoff during summer jja autumn son and spring mam months decreases particularly for the summer months this decrease could be associated with a reduction of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively warm surface water infiltration in contrast in winter djf months runoff tends to increase likewise this increase could be associated with an increase of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively cold surface water infiltration all in all these developments would be accompanied by a tendency to cool down groundwater resources 4 5 davos canton grisons the groundwater temperatures measured in davos are strongly influenced by the interaction with the river landwasser over large areas of the landwasser valley the groundwater saturated zone thicknesses are comparatively low and on average less than 2 m near the river landwasser and its tributaries distances between the surface and the groundwater table largely range between 1 and 10 m to the hill slopes on the valley margins distances often are above 10 m estimated mean groundwater recharge times are only 7 8 days table 2 results of groundwater modelling performed by geotest ag show that groundwater budgets are characterized mainly by regional groundwater flow approx 30 to 65 l s 1 and inflow from the hill slope catchments approx 132 l s 1 by the interaction with surface waters infiltration 180 l s 1 exfiltration 279 l s 1 but also by groundwater use approx 113 l s 1 in the catchment of the river landwasser annual precipitation sums amount to 1 032 mm and evaporation heights are 328 mm frauenkirch ch 0169 standard period 1981 2010 https hydromaps ch this results in estimates of potential groundwater recharge by means of percolating precipitation of 704 mm for the aquifer we investigated with an area of approx 5 4 km2 table 2 this groundwater recharge component results in 120 l s 1 excluding surface water runoff therefore the estimation of groundwater recharge from percolating precipitation shows that this groundwater recharge component is lower compared to other groundwater recharge components fig 8 also shows a cross section through the aquifer along the river landwasser over large areas the river is separated from the groundwater table by an unsaturated zone however between river lengths 5 5 and 6 km the river can encounter the groundwater table locally and groundwater can exfiltrate into the watercourse the results for all rcp scenarios of the simulations for the river landwasser figs 1 and 8 fig a2 6 in annex 2 show that runoff during summer jja months decreases particularly for the summer months and given the higher evapotranspiration losses in summer this decrease could be associated with a reduction of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively warm surface water infiltration an effect which could be accompanied by a tendency to cool down groundwater resources in contrast in winter djf months runoff tends to increase likewise this effect could be associated with an increase of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively cold surface water infiltration the evaluation of the seasonal runoff duration lines hydrological year for the different emission scenarios shows that tendentially higher runoff for the months october to june can be expected fig a3 1 annex 3 along with the lower runoff for the months july to september seen in all the all aquifers we investigated 5 discussion our evaluation of the aquifers including groundwater saturated and unsaturated zones allowed us to assess their sensitivity to changes in groundwater saturated zone thickness and or the distance from the surface to the groundwater table generally beyond 1 m below the earth s surface temperatures are insensitive to diurnal cycles of air temperature and solar radiation and temperature variations beyond 9 to 12 m below the earth s surface are insensitive to seasonal cycles ashrae 1991 florides and kalogirou 2005 kalogirou and florides 2004 for all aquifers we investigated there are only a few areas where the distance from the surface to the groundwater table is below 1 m penetration depth of daily atmospheric temperature signals with some exceptions distances between the surface and the groundwater table range between 1 and 10 m penetration depth of seasonal atmospheric temperature signals e g epting et al 2013 only some aquifers have average groundwater saturated zone thicknesses below 5 m table 2 the density of watercourses as a measure for interaction of aquifers with surface waters also varies greatly there are very low densities for basel city and in some cases comparatively high densities for individual aquifers in basel land and davos table 2 depending on the distance to watercourses or aquifer outlets estimated groundwater renewal rates range from a few days to more than a year table 2 an evaluation of the surface waters in the aquifers we studied shows that the river rhine in canton basel city is primarily a receiving watercourse and that groundwater exfiltration into the river dominates except during periods of high runoff and low groundwater levels accordingly for most areas in basel water infiltration from the river rhine is a subordinate groundwater recharge component different types of interaction between surface waters and the aquifers can be observed for canton basel land where groundwater flow in the valleys is partially interrupted by rock steps nevertheless there is often a connection between the aquifers via karst and or fracture systems epting et al 2018a the river eulach in winterthur and for the most part the river landwasser in davos are decoupled from the groundwater table even for different hydrological conditions the river suze in biel bienne is also largely decoupled from the groundwater table only at the estuary into lake biel is the river connected to the groundwater table here processes of surface water infiltration into the aquifer dominate which represent temperature imprinting and an important component of groundwater recharge within the scope of the research carried out here the role of regional flood events in connection with increased groundwater recharge could be investigated however the effect that local events such as thunderstorms in summer have on runoff generation and groundwater recharge could not be further investigated even so it is expected that during extreme events especially in the headwaters and middle reaches of watercourses infiltration rates of surface waters will increase in the short term i e local flooding while snow covers plays a minor role in most of the catchments it is an important factor within the landwasser catchment around davos in future the increase of snowmelt and liquid precipitation in winter can come along with an increase of snowmelt and runoff in spring fig a2 6 in annex 2 again more comparatively cold surface water would presumably infiltrate the aquifer in spring months which would tend to cool down groundwater resources 5 1 development of groundwater recharge and groundwater temperatures for the aquifers we investigated it is expected that a change in groundwater recharge through the percolation of precipitation plays a minor role in the overall water balance however a change of inflow via regional groundwater flow components because of changed groundwater recharge in the upstream catchment areas can play a more important role imported groundwater regime in the case of groundwater exfiltrating settings fig 3 larger hydraulic gradients from the groundwater to the surface waters associated with increased groundwater exfiltration would result from more frequent and longer lasting drought periods and lower river stages in alpine regions such as davos a reduced inflow via regional groundwater flow components from the hill slope catchment and changes in snowmelt water contribution may play a more important role see also above fig 9 summarizes the precipitation development and the simulation results for the surface water runoff for the hydrological half year periods and also for the rcp 2 6 and 8 5 emission scenarios for the years 2055 and 2085 in comparison to the reference year 2000 apart from the river landwasser aquifer in davos all the climate projections for the aquifers we investigated show that compared to the reference year 2000 precipitation increases from october to march and decreases from april to september those half year periods roughly coincide with autumn and winter on the one hand and spring and summer on the other hand diverse developments can be observed in the simulation results for surface water runoff for the hydrological half year periods and for the rcp 2 6 and 8 5 emission scenarios for the rivers birs and ergolz in canton basel land and for climate projection rcp 8 5 surface runoff shifts from summer to winter however with respect to the rcp 2 6 and 4 5 scenarios cf fig 2 4 annex 2 no major change in mean is expected although change is expected in the variability of river runoff for the river suze in biel bienne for all rcp scenarios cf fig a2 6 in annex 2 runoff decreases in summer and increases in winter for the river eulach in winterthur and for the river landwasser in davos an overall reduction of future surface water runoff is expected apart from the winter half year period for rcp 8 5 and the year 2085 generally if runoff during summer jja and autumn son months decreases it can be expected that groundwater recharge by means of infiltrating surface water will also decrease this effect as observed could be associated with a reduction of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively warm surface water infiltration furthermore this effect comes along with higher evapotranspiration losses during the vegetation period especially in summer in contrast increased runoff in winter djf and spring mam could be associated with an increase of groundwater recharge by means of comparatively cold surface water infiltration all in all we observed these developments for the rcp 8 5 scenarios and between the periods 1995 2005 and 2080 2090 for the rivers birs and ergolz in canton basel land the river eulach in winterthur and the river suze in biel bienne it is expected that these developments would be accompanied by a tendency to cool down groundwater however with respect to the rcp 2 6 and 4 5 emission scenarios different behaviors are expected for both the mean and also the variability of river runoff whereas decreased discharge in the winter djf months are expected e g for the river eulach in winterthur the hypothesized tendency of groundwater to cool down in the rcp 8 5 scenario is due to the shift in runoff and to the associated elevated groundwater recharge from summer to winter but this effect would not occur for rcp 2 6 and 4 5 eventually only the warming effect caused by rising surface water temperatures would remain 5 2 utilization potentials adaptation strategies many subsurface use interests in urban areas often conflict requiring new use concepts to be developed for a differentiated assessment and sustainable use of groundwater and thermal energy of the shallow subsurface such concepts in energy planning should make it possible to consider thermal use potentials e g for individual districts while at the same time also considering the qualitative aspects of urban aquifers and the legal requirements for groundwater protection the knowledge we now have on the variability of hydraulic and thermal groundwater regimes for representative swiss unconsolidated rock groundwater resources offers a basis to formulate local adaptation strategies likewise waste heat related to elevated groundwater temperatures in urban aquifers could be used in a targeted and efficient manner having optimization strategies for the documentation of long term temperature changes at reference sites would enable researchers to differentiate anthropogenic induced changes from climate induced changes in aquifers the concepts and methodological approaches developed here can enable public authorities to compare characteristic hydraulic and thermal boundary conditions of aquifers and to assess how sensitive the relevant groundwater recharge processes are to cc comparing the hydraulic characteristics e g aquifer properties groundwater recharge interaction with surface waters etc and thermal boundary conditions e g seasonal temperature signals anthropogenic heat input etc in the swiss groundwater resources that we have studied here can serve as a basis to be transferred to groundwater resources in general anthropogenic adaptation strategies e g decreased river and increased groundwater abstraction artificial recharge of river water to replenish groundwater resources could have effects on groundwater resources that could be greater than the effects of cc itself concerning future groundwater use it can be assumed that groundwater extraction and artificial recharge will increase during extended droughts further reduction of residual water flow rates in rivers e g required for ecosystems certainly is a problematic development especially for those with low discharges such as the rivers birs and ergolz in canton basel land since such situations will occur mainly in the summer months and since comparatively warm surface water will be artificially recharged it can be expected that groundwater temperatures will thus rise accordingly for example the high maximum surface water temperatures of the river rhine above 26 c in summer already observed will affect the drinking water supply in the basel region where by means of different systems surface water is artificially recharged to the aquifer likewise it should not be forgotten that extractions of surface water and groundwater can intensify low water runoff situations in rivers in agricultural areas during periods of low precipitation water withdrawals from watercourses are expected to increase reduced quantities of low water runoff would accordingly also reduce groundwater recharge due to reduced infiltration of surface water 5 3 requirements monitoring systems pilot studies for long term monitoring thanks to the increased availability of comparatively inexpensive temperature sensors more and more temperature data have been collected since the 1980s data from observation networks provide valuable information on temperature distributions in groundwater resources and are prerequisites for model calibration and validation however they are inappropriate for studying specific thermal processes such as the heat transport from the surface via the unsaturated zone to the groundwater table the influence of subsurface structures the river groundwater interactions etc for this reason the installation of depth oriented monitoring systems is recommended such systems allow researchers to draw conclusions about vertical temperature distributions in the groundwater or in the unsaturated zone as well as determine the effects that aquifer heterogeneities have on subsurface temperature distributions epting et al 2013 for the aquifers investigated in this study deficits in the available data were shown despite cases of insufficient data this analysis nevertheless allows monitoring concepts to be adjusted and optimized at cantonal level furthermore it is recommended especially in urbanized areas to systematically collect data on thermal groundwater use e g extraction and recharge quantities and temperatures and on the spatial distribution of building structures in the subsurface with such data researchers will be able to quantify the anthropogenic influences on shallow subsurface hydraulic and thermal regimes 5 4 research gaps and open questions it must be noted that future development as well as spatial and temporal dynamics of groundwater temperatures cannot satisfactorily be captured only by statistical evaluations or by spatially interpolated temperature distributions flow and heat transport modelling are required to understand the relevant hydraulic and thermal processes only then can heat balances and thermal utilization potentials be calculated and the thermal effects of future uses of the shallow subsurface be quantified in urbanized areas especially it is expected that an increased thermal use of the subsurface as well as adaptation strategies in connection with global warming positive and negative responses will further impact aquifer temperatures epting and huggenberger 2013 this complex interplay of the various natural and anthropogenic influencing factors can only be adequately analyzed by using flow and heat transport models in addition such models make it possible to quantify the interaction of surface waters with groundwater both spatially and temporally and investigate in greater depth the quantitative and qualitative effects of cc by means of scenario calculations likewise with reasonable effort and further investigations river sections could be evaluated regarding their interaction with groundwater under different hydrological boundary conditions seasonal changes about the occurrence of extreme events could also be studied the possible hydraulic and thermal effects that cc has on surface waters and groundwater could thus be clarified 6 conclusions a significant large scale increase in groundwater temperature as would be expected because of cc has not yet been observed in switzerland although it is clearly observed for surface water temperature bafu 2019 one reason for this observation could be underestimations of quantitative increases of groundwater recharge in the hydrological winter half year which tend to cool down aquifers accordingly for the aquifers we studied both for the business as usual cc scenario and for the end of the century groundwater recharge via percolating precipitation and infiltrating surface waters increasingly will take place in comparatively cold months that change would be accompanied by a tendency to cool down groundwater in addition the quantitative share of groundwater recharge decreases in comparatively warm months a process which is intensified by increased evapotranspiration during the vegetation growth period to understand the future development of groundwater temperatures it is necessary to take a differentiated view of geological site conditions and relevant hydrogeological processes including the processes of groundwater recharge positive and negative responses as well as direct anthropogenic influences these fundamentals are essential for understanding the response of aquifers to anthropogenic and cc impacts within the scope of this research project it was possible to show which basic information is required to characterize hydraulic and thermal current states of aquifers together with the derivation of key parameters such as storage properties water balance dynamics renewal rates and an evaluation of the relevant groundwater recharge processes the tools developed here make it possible to perform an initial assessment on how sensitive aquifers are to the effects of cc for the valley aquifers we investigated the interaction with surface waters and increased groundwater recharge during high runoff might have a strong influence on groundwater temperature likewise the exceedance of characteristic hydraulic threshold values e g relation of river stage to groundwater table along bedrock steps for individual aquifers can be accompanied by increased groundwater recharge for our studies we did not follow the commonly used catchment approach but used the river corridor concept of stanford and ward 1993 and concentrated instead on aquifers located in river valleys such aquifers are most productive not only for water supply but also for agriculture accordingly they are locations where decisions must be taken for groundwater resource management and the development of adaptation strategies the decisive factor for stakeholders is maintaining water supply and quality for different conditions our studies show that by applying relatively simple methods at reasonable costs the sensitivity of aquifers to climate or anthropogenic induced changes can be assessed in general not all aquifers will react in the same way and only appropriate monitoring systems for groundwater and surface waters facilitate to adequately capture the individual relevant hydrological and hydrogeological processes

8576,the operational hydrologists of the united states national weather service nws develop river forecasts as guidance for those at risk of flood damage and update those flood forecasts in real time as more information becomes available to do so they rely on experience and intuition to adjust the inputs state variables and parameters of hydrologic models nws hydrologists use the term modifiers to refer collectively to these adjustments this paper demonstrates the development and application of tools statistical and graphical to aid operational hydrologists in the achievement of accurate flood forecasts analysis of variance anova identifies the relative contribution to forecast uncertainty of each modifier heat map visualizations illustrate for operational hydrologists the basin lead time and season specific effects of their modifiers choices the tools provide operational hydrologists with insight into which of three commonly applied modifiers precipitation soil moisture and unit hydrograph shape are most likely to provide improvement in flood forecast accuracy the tools are demonstrated for a case study of four watersheds within in the ohio river valley using data for flood events sampled from 1990 to 2018 the findings of this research show that operational hydrologists in the ohio river basin would do well apply no modifiers in the winter leaving hydrologic input variables and parameters at baseline values and though the forecast might be improved by real time adjustments to the unit hydrograph in summer months recommendations for particular unit hydrograph modification levels cannot be made with confidence these findings call into question the modifier adjustment program as a standard process in the evaluated cases modifiers do not systematically improve flood forecasts improvement may be more efficiently achieved through better calibration of hydrologic models or techniques for reduction of precipitation uncertainty keywords flood forecast uncertainty operational hydrology anova data visualization heat maps national weather service 1 introduction floods affect more people globally than any other type of natural disaster inflicting devastating damages on human life and property ifrc 2015 in 2016 floods claimed 26 lives in the ohio river valley same year at a national scale flooding caused 126 fatalities and over 10 billion in damages noaa 2016a the emergency management community including federal agencies state organizations and local police fire and rescue coordinate and respond to these natural disasters the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa national weather service nws provides forecasts and warnings before floods start the emergency management community relies on nws flood forecasts when allocating resources and mobilizing response increased accuracy and timeliness of forecasts would allow better targeted more efficient mobilization of preventative measures and emergency response which can be used by stakeholders and decision makers to respond to floods before they occur saving lives and protecting property furthermore investments in improvements to flood forecasts are cost effective and of low socio environmental impact relative to the construction of new water infrastructure for flood protection such as dams or levees or modification of infrastructure operation rules and re issuing of infrastructure control manuals butts et al 2007 the nws provides real time flood forecasts in collaboration with other agencies the united states geological survey usgs us bureau of reclamation usbr us army corps of engineers usace and the environmental protection agency usepa among others thirteen nws river forecast centers rfcs are responsible for providing the 5 day streamflow forecasts for rivers throughout the country the rfcs use the nws community hydrologic prediction system chps adams and pagano 2016 which is based on the flood early warning system fews deltares 2018 fews is a platform for the construction of operational forecasting systems and includes the ability to flexibly integrate third party models and data werner et al 2013 the nws communicates river forecast products including the magnitude and uncertainty of floods or droughts to end users through the noaa nws advanced hydrologic prediction service ahps despite the importance of nws flood forecasts to national interests relatively little progress has been made to systematically verify forecasts and further scientific research is needed to develop standard processes for hydrologic forecast verification welles et al 2007 brown et al 2010 zalenski et al 2017 channeling g p box s 1979 aphorism all models are wrong some are useful nws hydrologists prioritize activities that promote understanding of error sources and adapt model parameters and configurations as those errors arise research regarding nws streamflow forecasts shows room for improvement in forecasts especially at longer lead times defined as the time between flood forecast start time and the time of peak streamflow and with conditions of above flood stage water levels welles et al 2007 welles sorooshian 2009 demonstrated that improved estimates of antecedent hydrologic conditions would be especially useful at shorter lead times and improved precipitation forecasts would have the greatest positive effect on flood forecast accuracy at longer lead times especially above flood stage forecasts post processing is another method to reduce forecast uncertainty yet the literature is scarce kang et al 2010 used two case studies in korea to demonstrate that the use of post processing methods can effectively reduce the forecast uncertainty roulin and vannitsem 2015 found that post processing can largely correct the errors in parameter values better basin specific calibrations of hydrologic and hydraulic routing models would be useful in most cases however calibrations targeting accuracy at high flows tend to sacrifice fidelity during periods of low flow and vice versa because the same hydrologic models are used to answer a number of questions regarding flood and drought calibration target compromises are required operational hydrology standards of practice in the nws encourage forecasters to apply expert judgement to modify streamflow forecasts in real time as new data become available the fews software contains a factors mechanism to adjust forecast models inputs and state variables previous evaluations and verifications of nws short range flood forecasts e g liu gupta 2007 zappa et al 2011 have not systematically evaluated the impact of human decision i e operational hydrologist expert judgement on forecast quality in part to address this concern the nws has identified the need for better visualizations of the tendency of operational hydrologist modifications to improve forecast accuracy across a range of representative conditions the goal of this paper is to evaluate the uncertainty in the nws s forecast model and develop a visualization tool to help operational hydrologists better understand the modifier process of the nws 1 1 operational hydrology in general hydrologic science can be used for long term planning purposes such as water resources infrastructure design and management or short term operational purposes such as the development of real time forecasts excellent texts are available to provide the reader with background on hydrology for planning and management e g viessman and lewis 2003 dingman 2014 and a representative snapshot of hydrologic models available for water systems planning under uncertainty is presented in ray and brown 2015 different from hydrology for planning purposes operational flood forecasting systems are real time and ever evolving the world meteorological organization wmo and global water partnership gwp 2013 explain that under operational conditions e g during flood warning operations the role of a forecast service is to collect and process data run the forecast models and then provide the forecast products to end users under standby conditions the role of a forecast service is to maintain and improve the performance of the modeling system the focus of this paper is on enhancements to operational hydrological procedures there are four main components of operational forecasting zappa et al 2011 1 numerical weather predictions nwp 2 hydrological initial conditions 3 flood prediction systems and 4 warnings for end users pagano et al 2016 investigated 19 forecasting systems and identified three main types first passive systems run automatic simulations without human adjustment second in observant systems humans have little interaction with the model except for considering adjustments in model output when generating public products examples of observant systems include the european flood awareness system efas the fledgling global offshoot glofas and the flood forecasting center ffc in the united kingdom uk which follows the observant paradigm with a higher level of automation third in engaged systems humans use expertise frequently in real time forecasting processes to adjust the model operational forecasting in the nws is most nearly of this type though humans tend to have a pessimistic view of models a tendency to think models are worse than they really are skitka et al 1999 expert forecasters are different they demonstrate the ability to interpret real world problems using forecast models pliske et al 2004 and they make productive use of the information provided nws operational hydrologists actively accommodate model uncertainties instead of narrowly interpreting model results as right or wrong they interpret model results as likely or not to provide actionable information to stakeholders fig 1 modified from pagano et al 2016 shows the typical workflow used by operational hydrologists and the experimental design of this study the modifications to conventional operational hydrologic processes proposed by this study are presented in red font this study supplements the conventional operational hydrologic process by 1 sampling flood events from a database of selected sub watersheds 2 generating forecast ensembles using systematically varied factor levels and 3 performing anova analysis to decompose forecast uncertainty by factor before developing heat maps to visualize forecast uncertainty under a wide range of input conditions 1 2 uncertainty in flood forecasts to ensure the usefulness of flood forecasts in disaster prevention and emergency response accuracy is important and understanding uncertainty is crucial following a process to 1 define the source of uncertainty 2 quantify the uncertainty and 3 evaluate the uncertainty can lead to a reduction of uncertainty butts et al 2007 todini s 2008 definition of predictive uncertainty in flood forecasts as the probability of any future real value conditional upon all the knowledge and information achievable through a learning process up to present is adopted here unfortunately uncertainties in flood forecasts build on each other while each uncertainty may be relatively manageable on its own in a cascade of uncertainty the challenge of producing an accurate flood forecast magnifies fig 2 illustrates this point red boxes identify the uncertainties in fig 2 that are of primary concern to this study 1 precipitation 2 antecedent soil moisture and 3 the shape of the unit hydrograph uncertainty in future precipitation hydrologic model calibration and stage discharge curve relationships are important but not included among the primary modifiers attended to by nws operational hydrologists and therefore are outside of the current scope as shown in fig 2 a reasonable starting point for flood forecasts is the estimate of the amount of precipitation that has occurred in the past five days and which is at some stage in the process of impacting streamflow soon to be observed at the station of interest the precipitation of the past five days is uncertain because each point estimate of precipitation is uncertain measurement uncertainty and methods for interpolating between point observations of precipitation depth are imperfect kitzmiller et al 2013 satellite based remote sensed measurements and ground based radar carry their own uncertainties baeck and smith 1998 kitzmiller et al 2013 klazura et al 1999 smith et al 1996 young et al 1999 the precipitation that will fall in the coming five days is of course not perfectly knowable because 1 it is derived from imperfect models e g global ensemble prediction system geps buizza et al 2005 candille et al 2007 of the meteorological services msc of canada united states national center for atmospheric research ncar whitaker et al 2008 european centre for medium range weather forecasts janiskova et al 2018 and 2 because there is uncertainty in the best way to combine the output of the sampled models habib and qin 2013 antecedent soil moisture is estimated using a continuous soil moisture model calibrated over the course of ten years of observation noaa 2010 the hydrologic model used by the nws sac sma noaa 2016b has uncertainty in its energy balance and water balance najafi et al 2011 and the routing model which is often one size fits all viessman and lewis 2003 estimates the time to peak flow only approximately finally the stage discharge curve which translates flow into depth is subject to imperfect estimates of bathymetry and often is not derived for the particular basin under examination fread 1973 details on each of these factors will be provided in this section below at the time a forecast is made errors are contained in 1 model input 2 model states or 3 model parameterization first uncertain estimates of past precipitation and future precipitation are used as shown at the top of fig 2 uncertainty in past precipitation uncertainty is caused by measurement error and imperfect interpolation procedures for estimates of future precipitation the nws relies on a network of sensors and gauges along with numerical weather modeling to provide the precipitation inputs that drive the hydrologic model nws operational hydrologists are familiar with the error inherent in these inputs kitzmiller et al 2013 and apply expert judgement to adjust for the errors the nws hydrologic model retains a set of state variables through time these variables can be examined in the model at any point in time to understand the simulated conditions most often it is the soil moisture state variables that are examined in the nws continuous soil moisture model the state changes in time in response to precipitation and temperature inputs at rates determined by a set of parameters those parameters are assigned during a model calibration process during which model performance is evaluated against historical data gupta et al 2003 because nws operational hydrologists are also involved in the calibration process as a group they are aware of the errors in model states and capable of applying expert judgement when model states poorly represent the actual conditions of the soil moisture of note because the priority of the nws is accuracy during high flow events the soil moisture model calibration tolerates systematic overestimates of biases in soil moisture so that high flow events would not be underestimated the hydrologic model adds its own uncertainty because of an inability to satisfactorily represent the complexities of a real world watershed nws operational hydrologists are often able to identify when the simplifying assumptions in the hydrologic model may be violated for example the three assumptions inherent in lumped hydrologic modeling are that rainfall occurs 1 for a duration of one complete time step 2 at a steady intensity and 3 uniformly over the full watershed when these idealized assumptions are violated as they nearly always must be nws operational hydrologists apply expert judgement to adjust the model as both precipitation and soil moisture are inputs of the hydrologic model uncertainty in the value of each accumulates in the hydrologic modeling process uncertainty in the rainfall runoff from the hydrologic model then flows into the hydraulic routing process the nws uses a 6 hour unit hydrograph for every basin regardless of size or slope although simple and efficient the assumptions underlying unit hydrographs are often violated adding to total forecast uncertainty in sum after the stage discharge transition the overall uncertainty is embedded in the final flood forecast product there are no well accepted guidelines on quantifying uncertainty within flood forecast systems liu and gupta 2007 for deterministic hydrologic models krzysztofowicz 1999 introduced a bayesian forecasting system that decomposes forecast uncertainty into input uncertainty and hydrologic uncertainty which can then be quantified independently and integrated into a bayesian distribution wani et al 2017 presented a non parametric method to quantify residual uncertainty which acts as a post processor on model forecasts and generates a residual uncertainty distribution boelee et al 2019 identified two methods in general to quantify uncertainty 1 statistical methods which calculate past model errors for specific conditions as an estimation of future model uncertainty and 2 ensemble methods which create ensembles of forecasts to understand forecast spread although in theory either statistical methods or ensemble based methods could be used to estimate uncertainty in flood forecasts it is difficult to identify the method most appropriate in any individual case due to the variety and complexity in flood forecasting and warning systems boelee et al 2019 this paper therefore uses both this paper discusses past precipitation soil moisture and flood routing uncertainty but does not directly deal with uncertainty in future precipitation hydrologic model calibration or stage discharge curves ensemble based methods were used to generate forecast experiments and anova determined the relative sensitivity of the flood forecast to the three considered uncertain factors existing literature demonstrates the effectiveness of analysis of variance anova to decompose aggregate forecast uncertainty into the contributions of model elements bosshard et al 2013 addor et al 2014 antonetti and zappa 2018 heat maps illustrate the response of the generated ensembles to the same three uncertain factors explored using anova techniques and the resulting graphics provide quick references to understand uncertainty in the generated ensembles detailed background on uncertainty in precipitation soil moisture unit hydrograph and hydrologic model calibration can be found in supplemental information section 1 2 general methodology 2 1 analysis of variance anova for flood forecasts experimental design anova is a statistical procedure in which the total variation in a measured response is partitioned into components which can be attributed to recognizable sources of variation milton and arnold 1990 in this study the sources factors for variation between observed and simulated river streamflow are the modifiers of primary concern to nws operational hydrologists precipitation p soil moisture s and unit hydrograph h table 1 summarizes the three factors modifiers and their experimental levels each factor has different predefined levels which represent the conditions for the experiment the factor p is separable into 7 unique levels i 7 representing the percentage increase decrease from the baseline value the factor s ranges from completely dry to wet and has 5 unique levels j 5 factor h represents the shift in ordinates of the unit hydrograph its base line horizontal shift flexibility in horizontal directions and flexibility in vertical direction and are defined by 7 unique levels k 7 details of unit hydrograph levels are provided in table 2 a figure represents different shapes of unit hydrograph is provided in fig s1 the percent error was first computed for each generated ensemble as shown in eq 1 1 e p q sim q obs q obs 100 where ep is the percent error for each forecast ensemble qsim q represents peak flow volume is the simulated flow qobs is the observed flow in order to better satisfy the normality requirement of the anova analysis a box cox transformation was performed on e p a detailed description of the procedure for a box cox transformation can be found in box and cox 1964 then the anova analysis was performed on the transformed data of each flood forecast event at different lead times details on the application of standard anova procedures to this study can be found in supplemental information section 3 1 2 2 visualizing uncertainty hierarchical displays are promising e g dimensional stacking and pixel display keim 2002 ≈æilinskas et al 2013 in which some features in the plot are embedded in other features to present multi dimensional data in a 2d basis heat maps as visualization aids have existed for over a century heat maps are intuitively effective displays of multi dimensional data with the x and y axes representing two dimensions and colored rectangular tiles representing a 3rd dimension corresponding to the values of the data matrix by combining multiple heat maps in a panel matrix plot it is possible to show greater dimensions of data in a limited space in this paper the x axis of a heat map was used to present the seasonality of flood events monthly from january to december and the y axis was used to present model parameter levels because for each event and lead time the precipitation modifier has 7 different levels that can be adjusted the soil moisture modifier has 5 levels and the unit hydrograph modifier has 7 levels there are 245 possible combinations of adjustments in total thus the simulation results for all 245 ensembles combinations were generated using the nws forecast model to identify the best forecasts combinations of parameter and input levels in each reproduced historical case only ensembles with the lowest percent error were displayed in heat map for each event colored tiles were then used to present the percent distribution of factor levels within each factor type among the best forecasts see eq 1 for the percent error calculation for instance in january the distribution of percent of precipitation factor levels is 70 of events used precipitation level 4 20 used level 6 and 10 used level 7 because only forecasts with the lowest error are displayed this result could indicate that in january precipitation level 4 has historically in the limited sample of cases evaluated had the highest probability to result in the lowest forecast error thus the results will provide operational hydrologists with guidance as they aim to produce more accurate forecasts detailed interpretation of heat maps produced as part of this study is provided in the results section below conventional visualizations bar plots were used to show anova analysis results sum square error 3 case study and results the ohio river basin covers over 200 000 square miles across 14 states and is populated by more than 27 million people in more than 2400 municipal jurisdictions as one of the 13 rfcs of the nws the ohio river forecast center ohrfc is responsible for monitoring of more than 900 streamflow points 700 of which have real time flood forecasts the ohrfc makes use of several models within the chps operational environment including the sac sma model burnash and mcguire 1973 burnash 1995 the snow 17 snow accumulation and ablation model anderson 1973 several hydrologic routing models and three reservoir simulation models the ohrfc reviews weather and streamflow data daily at hundreds of locations and updates river forecasts for each fig 3 provides a representative illustration of the ohrfc river forecast hydrograph the forecasting operation uses previously calibrated hydrologic models combined with weather forecasts to estimate flood hazard potential in the near future lead time in this study was defined as the difference between tnow and the time of the observed crest the difference between tnow and t0 is always the same 30 hours 1 day 6 hours the full simulation from t0 to tend is always 102 h 4 days 6 hours that means the forecast period tnow to tend is 72 h 3 days since these are headwater basins that crest within about 30 hours that time frame captured all the relevant lead times six sets of t0 and tnow were created for each crest the first set is for t0 at the synoptic time prior to the observed crest and each subsequent one is six hours earlier the precipitation modifiers were then applied to the model from t0 to tnow and the observed precipitation was applied to the period between tnow and tend while this paper aims to help operational hydrologists better match the magnitude of flood events better through the use of statistical and visualization tools there are other perspectives on the improvement of flood forecast accuracy ehret and zehe 2011 introduced a new metric series distance to quantify the similarity in occurrence magnitude and time of flood events zappa et al 2013 developed a peak box approach providing visual support that envelops all ensemble peak timings and peak discharge from which specific verification metrics are defined 3 1 study area the

operation of locks and dams and to eliminate the complexity of channel routing see table s1 for detailed information on case study basins 3 2 anova 3 2 1 anova application anova analysis partitioned the uncertainty in ohrfc s 5 day flood forecast a total of l 245 ensembles were generated for each evaluated historical flood event and lead time 7 levels for precipitation 5 levels for soil moisture and 7 shapes for unit hydrograph the adjustment to the precipitation is strictly applied for the observed values when the simulated flow fails to match the observed flow the precipitation modifiers adjust the past precipitation either increasing or decreasing it to produce results as close to the observation as possible at any given time t the precipitation modifiers were applied to the model from t0 to tnow see fig 3 and the observed precipitation was applied to the period between tnow and tend the initial selection set the magnitude of the change of factor levels increase decrease as a percentage shifts from baseline levels for precipitation the range of change was 30 for soil moisture the range of change was 0 100 and for the unit hydrograph the levels were right left shift vertical stretch shrink and horizontal stretch shrink the initial trial runs showed flaws in the initial selection that they did not fully capture the magnitude of the flood events for busseron creek in particular thus a slightly modified selection expanded the factor levels to those shown in table 3 the table 3 factor levels provided the necessary resolution for factor adjustments adequately covered extreme events and represented settings frequently chosen by the ohrfc operational hydrologists during their regular forecast adjustment practices 3 2 2 system to apply modifications the objective in this study is to guide forecasters in their application of modifiers to improve forecasts a simple approach to this type of problem is a what if test alberto benitez andrades et al 2018 a what if test evaluates the performance of the forecast with and without a modification one limitation of this method is that the effect of individual modifiers can only be compared to the unmodified case operational forecasters routinely apply multiple modifiers and the modifiers themselves can have a range of values to find the optimum family of modifiers all potential modifiers across all potential values would need to be evaluated car manufacturers will perform car crash tests before launching a new model likewise hydrologic model developers usually perform crash tests to ensure the model is safe for use and≈ïeassian et al 2009 this study applied an expert system approach palmer holmes 1988 which elucidates the likely modifiers and their ranges of values from expert knowledge or judgement a query of the ohrfc database identified the three modifier types most frequently used and the discrete values of each that cover the range of possible values see table 4 this led to 245 combinations of modifiers to apply for each hydrologic event for each basin perrin et al 2008 also described a discrete parameterization method to calibrate parameters of rainfall runoff models which provided a robust parameter set when streamflow time series available for calibration were less than two years ohrfc created a system to execute the model at six different lead times and summarize results under each of the 245 combinations of modifiers and levels the data extracted from the ohrfc was then processed using computer algorithms written in r language the algorithm calculated general indexes based on the data sets such as ensemble identifiers and lead time of flood forecasts percent forecast error etc so that the data sets were ready for anova analysis and heat map application table 4 provides detailed information of selected events for this study only limited data were available for busseron creek and sitlington 3 2 3 anova results precipitation level 7 baseline 500 dominated the anova analysis and provided no decision relevant information it was therefore excluded from anova results figures fig 5 a shows the anova results at 0 lead time and fig 5 b shows the same results at 30 hour lead time anova results shown in fig 5 excluded residuals because their inclusion made the distribution results of selected factors less easily comparable fig s2 supplemental information shows the same results with residuals included for comparison it is clear that a large portion of uncertainty comes from the model itself a histogram of model error ensembles without applying mods of all flood events at 0 hour lead time is also provided in the supplemental information in fig 5 the x axis shows factor type the y axis shows the sum square error of each factor the Œª values chosen for box cox transformation for the four case studies were 1 0 28 for 0 hour lead time 0 2 for 30 h lead time for north fork little beaver creek 2 0 25 0 24 for tygart river valley at daily 3 0 44 0 2 for busseron creek and 4 0 19 0 21 for sitlington creek greenbrier river fig 5 a shows that at 0 hour lead time soil moisture is the dominant uncertainty in north fork little beaver creek and busseron creek basin the physical characteristics see table s1 of these two basins are highly alike and they are of similar size around 600 km2 and landcover type large area covered by cultivated crops in each of these two basins agriculture with direct impact on soil moisture is prominent in tygart valley river however the dominant uncertainty is the precipitation forecast tygart valley river is the smallest in size 479 15 km2 and mainly covered by deciduous forest in sitlington creek greenbrier river the largest uncertainty source is the unit hydrograph this is the largest basin 875 km2 which magnifies the uncertainty in assumptions made regarding the unit hydrograph uniform basin wide precipitation and the occurrence of all precipitation within a pre defined unit of time forecasters should exercise caution in adjusting these factors at short lead times as small adjustments in these factors could rapidly increase or decrease forecast error at 30 hours of lead time fig 5b precipitation becomes the largest source of uncertainty in all studied basins precipitation is well known to be one of the most important inputs to hydrologic models but is very difficult to predict with accuracy the discussion of heat map results in the next section addresses the impact on precipitation uncertainty of seasonality and basin geography because residuals dominate all other sources of uncertainty and make interpretation of the figure difficult they were removed from anova results see supplemental information fig s2 for anova results with residuals 3 3 heatmap results to emphasize those modifiers that work best in each basin and month and avoid clutter in visualizations only combinations of modifiers resulting in the lowest forecast errors are included in heat map results only the single level of each of the three modifiers that provided greatest forecast accuracy was selected for each flood event and lead time 1 precipitation modifier 1 soil moisture modifier and 1 unit hydrograph modifier a description of the procedure for development of the heat maps in this study is provided in the supplemental information fig 6 shows historical discharge from usgs and sampled events selected for this study note that for the purposes of this study we have sampled only large flood events in summer so that in some cases summer values appear higher than winter values that does not mean that floods in summer are larger than winter floods in general for the same reason the number of events in summer is smaller than that in winter the number of events sampled per month is shown at top of fig 6 from fig 6 the selected events for this study are usually at higher river stage and intended to capture the historical extreme events seasonally discharge in streams throughout the ohio river basin is higher in winter november to april and lower in summer may to august the panels of fig 7 show heat map results for north fork little beaver creek at each evaluated lead time a 0 hour b 6 hour c 12 hour d 18 hour e 24 hour and f 30 hour the x axis in each panel represents the month of occurrence for the evaluated historical flood events and the y axis identifies the level of each factor being modified p represents the precipitation modifier and has 7 settings rows s represents the soil moisture modifier 5 settings rows and u represents the unit hydrograph modifier 7 settings rows the baseline of each modifier is outlined by solid black lines the color key on the top left shows the percentage value the redder the color the smaller the percentage of evaluated historical cases in which this particular modifier setting was included in the best performing set bright colors yellows whites indicate that the modifier setting is the level at which greatest flood forecast accuracy is achieved across a large percentage of the evaluated historical cases the lesson from fig 7 north fork little beaver creek is modifications should not be made to the baseline precipitation modifier level in winter however alternative precipitation modifier levels may be useful in summer focusing on fig 7 a which is the result for a 0 hour lead time it is seen that precipitation modifiers have seasonal trends during winter months november to april more than 70 of the best forecast ensembles used baseline precipitation level 4 which indicates that adjustment in precipitation has not in these historical cases increased forecast accuracy during cold seasons and short lead times this corresponds with the anova finding that precipitation is not a dominant uncertainty at short lead times and therefore the potential benefits of adjusting it are small common sense tells us that the shorter the lead time the more accurate the precipitation forecast will be as the lead time increases fig 7b f although results still show seasonality for precipitation the percent distribution among levels of precipitation modifiers spreads out indicating that adjustments to produce better forecasts at longer lead times might be beneficial especially during summer months may august this finding could be explained with reference to synoptic and convective storm types the ohio river watershed tends to receive synoptic precipitation events in winter months and convective events in summer months archambault et al 2008 lombardo colle 2011 synoptic events are easier to forecast while convective events often result in rapid precipitation and flash floods which are highly random and difficult to accurately predict thus the considerations of modifier settings representative of deviations from the baseline precipitation forecast are likely to be more fruitful in summer for soils moisture the lesson is don t touch the baseline soil moisture modifier from baseline except possibly to decrease it to level one in the event that the recent past in the watershed was very dry level 3 is the baseline seasonality in this parameter is seen as well as it is linked to precipitation seasonality thus forecasters should take care when adjusting soil moisture conditions during winter summer however different from precipitation a level of the soil moisture modifier level 1 is a part of the best performing set often enough that it is a viable alternative to leaving the soils moisture modifier at its baseline level this is especially during summer months during hot and dry events common to summer months the soil moisture may be lower than the default thus too much water may have been added to the hydrologic model and decreasing the soil moisture condition is an efficient way to reduce the error in that case level 1 of the soil moisture modifier would beneficially be selected it is very unlikely that departing from baseline soil moisture levels by selecting higher levels of soil moisture would be productive in the summer if any adjustments are needed during winter months the course of action most likely to improve the forecast accuracy is an adjustment to the unit hydrograph modifier for the unit hydrograph level 1 baseline 2 left shift and 7 dispersion 2 are all frequently members of the best performing set for this basin different from precipitation and soil moisture results the unit hydrograph modifier is only weakly responsive to seasonality and lead time this is a meaningful finding because when simply adjusting precipitation and soil moisture does not provide significant improvement in forecast accuracy the unit hydrograph could be the factor to be adjusted forecasters using the unit hydrograph modifier to improve forecast accuracy should consider performing a left shift level 2 to make flood peak sooner or dispersion level 7 to add a 5 ordinate smoothing to better match the flood hydrograph fig 8 shows the heat map results in tygart valley river at dailey the pattern of precipitation and soil moisture is similar to that for north fork little beaver creek except that fewer adjustments to baseline factor levels are constructive across the historical cases evaluated as part of this study this could indicate a higher accuracy of the precipitation forecast product and or a better model calibration for this basin higher accuracy of flood forecasts resulting from modification of precipitation soil moisture or unit hydrograph factor levels is unlikely the best course of action for improvement of forecast accuracy in this basin would be improvement of the model calibration and reduction of residuals see anova fig s2 4 discussion and limitations this paper presents techniques for the efficient reduction of errors in nws flood forecasts anova experiments identified the relative magnitudes of the uncertainty contributed by each uncertain factor heat maps illustrate the uncertainty in flood forecasts by season and lead time for north fork little beaver creek and tygart valley river at daily anova results show that the variation from any individual or combination of modifiers is generally an order of magnitude less than the variation from the residuals indicating the largest source of uncertainty is from the model and its calibration residuals aside anova analysis also shows that soil moisture and unit hydrograph contribute more uncertainty at shorter lead times while precipitation is the largest source of uncertainty at longer lead times heat maps show that at short lead times it is nearly always better to use the baseline level for precipitation even at large lead times changes to the baseline level of the precipitation modifier should not be made in winter however alternative precipitation modifier levels may be useful in summer during localized convective events for which accurate precipitation estimates are elusive for soil moisture changes should not be made to the baseline level except possibly to decrease it to level one in the event that the recent past in the watershed was very dry different from precipitation and soil moisture results the unit hydrograph modifier is only weakly responsive to seasonality and lead time left shifts to modifier level 2 or dispersion level 7 to make flood peak sooner or add a 5 ordinate smoothing respectfully have been productive historically in the evaluated basins generally however none of the changes to modifier values are consistent improvements on baseline levels it therefore appears to be good policy except in a few specific circumstances to leave the modifiers unchanged limitations of this work include scarcity of information available on nws rfc historical and current practice regarding the use of modifiers relatively small study area basins without channel routing and a small number of basins studied thus it is unknown if findings of this study apply to downstream basins with channel routing larger sub basins or other climatologic regions further study of a variety of basins is needed in order to evaluate the general applicability of the findings presented here 5 conclusion and next steps this study shows the performance of ensembles of river flow forecasts generated with different modifier levels anova analysis suggests largest source of uncertainty comes form the model thus better calibration of hydrologic models may reduce overall uncertainty the results also show that soil moisture and unit hydrograph are more dominant uncertainty sources at short lead times while precipitation is the primary source of uncertainty at long lead times heat maps generated as part of this study show that both precipitation and soil moisture behavior have seasonality and that real time modifications made by nws operational hydrologists might be useful in the summer season but are unlikely to be fruitful in the winter operational hydrologists can also refer to the heat map to help decide which modifiers and what level to choose when adjustments are needed under specific month and lead time as mentioned earlier adjustments to precipitation cannot improve forecast accuracy in seasons marked by synoptic precipitation patterns in which precipitation forecast accuracy is already reasonably strong opportunities for reduction of precipitation uncertainty in conditions of convective precipitation is warranted systematic collection and analysis of the patterns of use for most frequently adjusted operational hydrologic modifiers has not been conducted at nws rfc s and that is needed in order to improve the usefulness of these findings as discussed in ray et al 2019 improved operational practices in water systems planning and management hold great promise for improvement to system resilience if floods could be forecasted more accurately what would be the resultant reduction in the burden for climate change adaptation measures involving the construction of new infrastructure or the altering of operating procedures these tradeoffs should be explored finally the heat map results presented in this paper are probability neutral no one combination of uncertain factors is deemed to be more or less likely than another for example the combination of modifications high precipitation low soil moisture is given the same likelihood weight as high precipitation high soil moisture when it is clear that one of those combinations is more likely than another furthermore it has been demonstrated in this paper that calibration biases in both the unit hydrograph and the soil moisture estimator result in non symmetrical probability distributions for each of those inputs to hydrologic forecasts it may therefore be useful to attempt to characterize the multidimensional uncertainty space for all inputs in combination using hierarchical bayesian belief network techniques such as those described in taner et al 2019 declaration of competing interest

8576,the operational hydrologists of the united states national weather service nws develop river forecasts as guidance for those at risk of flood damage and update those flood forecasts in real time as more information becomes available to do so they rely on experience and intuition to adjust the inputs state variables and parameters of hydrologic models nws hydrologists use the term modifiers to refer collectively to these adjustments this paper demonstrates the development and application of tools statistical and graphical to aid operational hydrologists in the achievement of accurate flood forecasts analysis of variance anova identifies the relative contribution to forecast uncertainty of each modifier heat map visualizations illustrate for operational hydrologists the basin lead time and season specific effects of their modifiers choices the tools provide operational hydrologists with insight into which of three commonly applied modifiers precipitation soil moisture and unit hydrograph shape are most likely to provide improvement in flood forecast accuracy the tools are demonstrated for a case study of four watersheds within in the ohio river valley using data for flood events sampled from 1990 to 2018 the findings of this research show that operational hydrologists in the ohio river basin would do well apply no modifiers in the winter leaving hydrologic input variables and parameters at baseline values and though the forecast might be improved by real time adjustments to the unit hydrograph in summer months recommendations for particular unit hydrograph modification levels cannot be made with confidence these findings call into question the modifier adjustment program as a standard process in the evaluated cases modifiers do not systematically improve flood forecasts improvement may be more efficiently achieved through better calibration of hydrologic models or techniques for reduction of precipitation uncertainty keywords flood forecast

devastating damages on human life and property ifrc 2015 in 2016 floods claimed 26 lives in the ohio river valley same year at a national scale flooding caused 126 fatalities and over 10 billion in damages noaa 2016a the emergency management community including federal agencies state organizations and local police fire and rescue coordinate and respond to these natural disasters the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa national weather service nws provides forecasts and warnings before floods start the emergency management community relies on nws flood forecasts when allocating resources and mobilizing response increased accuracy and timeliness of forecasts would allow better targeted more efficient mobilization of preventative measures and emergency response which can be used by stakeholders and decision makers to respond to floods before they occur saving lives and protecting property furthermore investments in improvements to flood forecasts are cost effective and of low socio environmental impact relative to the construction of new water infrastructure for flood protection such as dams or levees or modification of infrastructure operation rules and re issuing of infrastructure control manuals butts et al 2007 the nws provides real time flood forecasts in collaboration with other agencies the united states geological survey usgs us bureau of reclamation usbr us army corps of engineers usace and the environmental protection agency usepa among others thirteen nws river forecast centers rfcs are responsible for providing the 5 day streamflow forecasts for rivers throughout the country the rfcs use the nws community hydrologic prediction system chps adams and pagano 2016 which is based on the flood early warning system fews deltares 2018 fews is a platform for the construction of operational forecasting systems and includes the ability to flexibly integrate third party models and data werner et al 2013 the nws communicates river forecast products including the magnitude and uncertainty of floods or droughts to end users through the noaa nws advanced hydrologic prediction service ahps despite the importance of nws flood forecasts to national interests relatively little progress has been made to systematically verify forecasts and further scientific research is needed to develop standard processes for hydrologic forecast verification welles et al 2007 brown et al 2010 zalenski et al 2017 channeling g p box s 1979 aphorism all models are wrong some are useful nws hydrologists prioritize activities that promote understanding of error sources and adapt model parameters and configurations as those errors arise research regarding nws streamflow forecasts shows room for improvement in forecasts especially at longer lead times defined as the time between flood forecast start time and the time of peak streamflow and with conditions of above flood stage water levels welles et al 2007 welles sorooshian 2009 demonstrated that improved estimates of antecedent hydrologic conditions would be especially useful at shorter lead times and improved precipitation forecasts would have the greatest positive effect on flood forecast accuracy at longer lead times especially above flood stage forecasts post processing is another method to reduce forecast uncertainty yet the literature is scarce kang et al 2010 used two case studies in korea to demonstrate that the use of post processing methods can effectively reduce the forecast uncertainty roulin and vannitsem 2015 found that post processing can largely correct the errors in parameter values better basin specific calibrations of hydrologic and hydraulic routing models would be useful in most cases however calibrations targeting accuracy at high flows tend to sacrifice fidelity during periods of low flow and vice versa because the same hydrologic models are used to answer a number of questions regarding flood and drought calibration target compromises are required operational hydrology standards of practice in the nws encourage forecasters to apply expert judgement to modify streamflow forecasts in real time as new data become available the fews software contains a factors mechanism to adjust forecast models inputs and state variables previous evaluations and verifications of nws short range flood forecasts e g liu gupta 2007 zappa et al 2011 have not systematically evaluated the impact of human decision i e operational hydrologist expert judgement on forecast quality in part to address this concern the nws has identified the need for better visualizations of the tendency of operational hydrologist modifications to improve forecast accuracy across a range of representative conditions the goal of this paper is to evaluate the uncertainty in the nws s forecast model and develop a visualization tool to help operational hydrologists better understand the modifier process of the nws 1 1 operational hydrology in general hydrologic science can be used for long term planning purposes such as water resources infrastructure design and management or short term operational purposes such as the development of real time forecasts excellent texts are available to provide the reader with background on hydrology for planning and management e g viessman and lewis 2003 dingman 2014 and a representative snapshot of hydrologic models available for water systems planning under uncertainty is presented in ray and brown 2015 different from hydrology for planning purposes operational flood forecasting systems are real time and ever evolving the world meteorological organization wmo and global water partnership gwp 2013 explain that under operational conditions e g during flood warning operations the role of a forecast service is to collect and process data run the forecast models and then provide the forecast products to end users under standby conditions the role of a forecast service is to maintain and improve the performance of the modeling system the focus of this paper is on enhancements to operational hydrological procedures there are four main components of operational forecasting zappa et al 2011 1 numerical weather predictions nwp 2 hydrological initial conditions 3 flood prediction systems and 4 warnings for end users pagano et al 2016 investigated 19 forecasting systems and identified three main types first passive systems run automatic simulations without human adjustment second in observant systems humans have little interaction with the model except for considering adjustments in model output when generating public products examples of observant systems include the european flood awareness system efas the fledgling global offshoot glofas and the flood forecasting center ffc in the united kingdom uk which follows the observant paradigm with a higher level of automation third in engaged systems humans use expertise frequently in real time forecasting processes to adjust the model operational forecasting in the nws is most nearly of this type though humans tend to have a pessimistic view of models a tendency to think models are worse than they really are skitka et al 1999 expert forecasters are different they demonstrate the ability to interpret real world problems using forecast models pliske et al 2004 and they make productive use of the information provided nws operational hydrologists actively accommodate model uncertainties instead of narrowly interpreting model results as right or wrong they interpret model results as likely or not to provide actionable information to stakeholders fig 1 modified from pagano et al 2016 shows the typical workflow used by operational hydrologists and the experimental design of this study the modifications to conventional operational hydrologic processes proposed by this study are presented in red font this study supplements the conventional operational hydrologic process by 1 sampling flood events from a database of selected sub watersheds 2 generating forecast ensembles using systematically varied factor levels and 3 performing anova analysis to decompose forecast uncertainty by factor before developing heat maps to visualize forecast uncertainty under a wide range of input conditions 1 2 uncertainty in flood forecasts to ensure the usefulness of flood forecasts in disaster prevention and emergency response accuracy is important and understanding uncertainty is crucial following a process to 1 define the source of uncertainty 2 quantify the uncertainty and 3 evaluate the uncertainty can lead to a reduction of uncertainty butts et al 2007 todini s 2008 definition of predictive uncertainty in flood forecasts as the probability of any future real value conditional upon all the knowledge and information achievable through a learning process up to present is adopted here unfortunately uncertainties in flood forecasts build on each other while each uncertainty may be relatively manageable on its own in a cascade of uncertainty the challenge of producing an accurate flood forecast magnifies fig 2 illustrates this point red boxes identify the uncertainties in fig 2 that are of primary concern to this study 1 precipitation 2 antecedent soil moisture and 3 the shape of the unit hydrograph uncertainty in future precipitation hydrologic model calibration and stage discharge curve relationships are important but not included among the primary modifiers attended to by nws operational hydrologists and therefore are outside of the current scope as shown in fig 2 a reasonable starting point for flood forecasts is the estimate of the amount of precipitation that has occurred in the past five days and which is at some stage in the process of impacting streamflow soon to be observed at the station of interest the precipitation of the past five days is uncertain because each point estimate of precipitation is uncertain measurement uncertainty and methods for interpolating between point observations of precipitation depth are imperfect kitzmiller et al 2013 satellite based remote sensed measurements and ground based radar carry their own uncertainties baeck and smith 1998 kitzmiller et al 2013 klazura et al 1999 smith et al 1996 young et al 1999 the precipitation that will fall in the coming five days is of course not perfectly knowable because 1 it is derived from imperfect models e g global ensemble prediction system geps buizza et al 2005 candille et al 2007 of the meteorological services msc of canada united states national center for atmospheric research ncar whitaker et al 2008 european centre for medium range weather forecasts janiskova et al 2018 and 2 because there is uncertainty in the best way to combine the output of the sampled models habib and qin 2013 antecedent soil moisture is estimated using a continuous soil moisture model calibrated over the course of ten years of observation noaa 2010 the hydrologic model used by the nws sac sma noaa 2016b has uncertainty in its energy balance and water balance najafi et al 2011 and the routing model which is often one size fits all viessman and lewis 2003 estimates the time to peak flow only approximately finally the stage discharge curve which translates flow into depth is subject to imperfect estimates of bathymetry and often is not derived for the particular basin under examination fread 1973 details on each of these factors will be provided in this section below at the time a forecast is made errors are contained in 1 model input 2 model states or 3 model parameterization first uncertain estimates of past precipitation and future precipitation are used as shown at the top of fig 2 uncertainty in past precipitation uncertainty is caused by measurement error and imperfect interpolation procedures for estimates of future precipitation the nws relies on a network of sensors and gauges along with numerical weather modeling to provide the precipitation inputs that drive the hydrologic model nws operational hydrologists are familiar with the error inherent in these inputs kitzmiller et al 2013 and apply expert judgement to adjust for the errors the nws hydrologic model retains a set of state variables through time these variables can be examined in the model at any point in time to understand the simulated conditions most often it is the soil moisture state variables that are examined in the nws continuous soil moisture model the state changes in time in response to precipitation and temperature inputs at rates determined by a set of parameters those parameters are assigned during a model calibration process during which model performance is evaluated against historical data gupta et al 2003 because nws operational hydrologists are also involved in the calibration process as a group they are aware of the errors in model states and capable of applying expert judgement when model states poorly represent the actual conditions of the soil moisture of note because the priority of the nws is accuracy during high flow events the soil moisture model calibration tolerates systematic overestimates of biases in soil moisture so that high flow events would not be underestimated the hydrologic model adds its own uncertainty because of an inability to satisfactorily represent the complexities of a real world watershed nws operational hydrologists are often able to identify when the simplifying assumptions in the hydrologic model may be violated for example the three assumptions inherent in lumped hydrologic modeling are that rainfall occurs 1 for a duration of one complete time step 2 at a steady intensity and 3 uniformly over the full watershed when these idealized assumptions are violated as they nearly always must be nws operational hydrologists apply expert judgement to adjust the model as both precipitation and soil moisture are inputs of the hydrologic model uncertainty in the value of each accumulates in the hydrologic modeling process uncertainty in the rainfall runoff from the hydrologic model then flows into the hydraulic routing process the nws uses a 6 hour unit hydrograph for every basin regardless of size or slope although simple and efficient the assumptions underlying unit hydrographs are often violated adding to total forecast uncertainty in sum after the stage discharge transition the overall uncertainty is embedded in the final flood forecast product there are no well accepted guidelines on quantifying uncertainty within flood forecast systems liu and gupta 2007 for deterministic hydrologic models krzysztofowicz 1999 introduced a bayesian forecasting system that decomposes forecast uncertainty into input uncertainty and hydrologic uncertainty which can then be quantified independently and integrated into a bayesian distribution wani et al 2017 presented a non parametric method to quantify residual uncertainty which acts as a post processor on model forecasts and generates a residual uncertainty distribution boelee et al 2019 identified two methods in general to quantify uncertainty 1 statistical methods which calculate past model errors for specific conditions as an estimation of future model uncertainty and 2 ensemble methods which create ensembles of forecasts to understand forecast spread although in theory either statistical methods or ensemble based methods could be used to estimate uncertainty in flood forecasts it is difficult to identify the method most appropriate in any individual case due to the variety and complexity in flood forecasting and warning systems boelee et al 2019 this paper therefore uses both this paper discusses past precipitation soil moisture and flood routing uncertainty but does not directly deal with uncertainty in future precipitation hydrologic model calibration or stage discharge curves ensemble based methods were used to generate forecast experiments and anova determined the relative sensitivity of the flood forecast to the three considered uncertain factors existing literature demonstrates the effectiveness of analysis of variance anova to decompose aggregate forecast uncertainty into the contributions of model elements bosshard et al 2013 addor et al 2014 antonetti and zappa 2018 heat maps illustrate the response of the generated ensembles to the same three uncertain factors explored using anova techniques and the resulting graphics provide quick references to understand uncertainty in the generated ensembles detailed background on uncertainty in precipitation soil moisture unit hydrograph and hydrologic model calibration can be found in supplemental information section 1 2 general methodology 2 1 analysis of variance anova for flood forecasts experimental design anova is a statistical procedure in which the total variation in a measured response is partitioned into components which can be attributed to recognizable sources of variation milton and arnold 1990 in this study the sources factors for variation between observed and simulated river streamflow are the modifiers of primary concern to nws operational hydrologists precipitation p soil moisture s and unit hydrograph h table 1 summarizes the three factors modifiers and their experimental levels each factor has different predefined levels which represent the conditions for the experiment the factor p is separable into 7 unique levels i 7 representing the percentage increase decrease from the baseline value the factor s ranges from completely dry to wet and has 5 unique levels j 5 factor h represents the shift in ordinates of the unit hydrograph its base line horizontal shift flexibility in horizontal directions and flexibility in vertical direction and are defined by 7 unique levels k 7 details of unit hydrograph levels are provided in table 2 a figure represents different shapes of unit hydrograph is provided in fig s1 the percent error was first computed for each generated ensemble as shown in eq 1 1 e p q sim q obs q obs 100 where ep is the percent error for each forecast ensemble qsim q represents peak flow volume is the simulated flow qobs is the observed flow in order to better satisfy the normality requirement of the anova analysis a box cox transformation was performed on e p a detailed description of the procedure for a box cox transformation can be found in box and cox 1964 then the anova analysis was performed on the transformed data of each flood forecast event at different lead times details on the application of standard anova procedures to this study can be found in supplemental information section 3 1 2 2 visualizing uncertainty hierarchical displays are promising e g dimensional stacking and pixel display keim 2002 ≈æilinskas et al 2013 in which some features in the plot are embedded in other features to present multi dimensional data in a 2d basis heat maps as visualization aids have existed for over a century heat maps are intuitively effective displays of multi dimensional data with the x and y axes representing two dimensions and colored rectangular tiles representing a 3rd dimension corresponding to the values of the data matrix by combining multiple heat maps in a panel matrix plot it is possible to show greater dimensions of data in a limited space in this paper the x axis of a heat map was used to present the seasonality of flood events monthly from january to december and the y axis was used to present model parameter levels because for each event and lead time the precipitation modifier has 7 different levels that can be adjusted the soil moisture modifier has 5 levels and the unit hydrograph modifier has 7 levels there are 245 possible combinations of adjustments in total thus the simulation results for all 245 ensembles combinations were generated using the nws forecast model to identify the best forecasts combinations of parameter and input levels in each reproduced historical case only ensembles with the lowest percent error were displayed in heat map for each event colored tiles were then used to present the percent distribution of factor levels within each factor type among the best forecasts see eq 1 for the percent error calculation for instance in january the distribution of percent of precipitation factor levels is 70 of events used precipitation level 4 20 used level 6 and 10 used level 7 because only forecasts with the lowest error are displayed this result could indicate that in january precipitation level 4 has historically in the limited sample of cases evaluated had the highest probability to result in the lowest forecast error thus the results will provide operational hydrologists with guidance as they aim to produce more accurate forecasts detailed interpretation of heat maps produced as part of this study is provided in the results section below conventional visualizations bar plots were used to show anova analysis results sum square error 3 case study and results the ohio river basin covers over 200 000 square miles across 14 states and is populated by more than 27 million people in more than 2400 municipal jurisdictions as one of the 13 rfcs of the nws the ohio river forecast center ohrfc is responsible for monitoring of more than 900 streamflow points 700 of which have real time flood forecasts the ohrfc makes use of several models within the chps operational environment including the sac sma model burnash and mcguire 1973 burnash 1995 the snow 17 snow accumulation and ablation model anderson 1973 several hydrologic routing models and three reservoir simulation models the ohrfc reviews weather and streamflow data daily at hundreds of locations and updates river forecasts for each fig 3 provides a representative illustration of the ohrfc river forecast hydrograph the forecasting operation uses previously calibrated hydrologic models combined with weather forecasts to estimate flood hazard potential in the near future lead time in this study was defined as the difference between tnow and the time of the observed crest the difference between tnow and t0 is always the same 30 hours 1 day 6 hours the full simulation from t0 to tend is always 102 h 4 days 6 hours that means the forecast period tnow to tend is 72 h 3 days since these are headwater basins that crest within about 30 hours that time frame captured all the relevant lead times six sets of t0 and tnow were created for each crest the first set is for t0 at the synoptic time prior to the observed crest and each subsequent one is six hours earlier the precipitation modifiers were then applied to the model from t0 to tnow and the observed precipitation was applied to the period between tnow and tend while this paper aims to help operational hydrologists better match the magnitude of flood events better through the use of statistical and visualization tools there are other perspectives on the improvement of flood forecast accuracy ehret and zehe 2011 introduced a new metric series distance to quantify the similarity in occurrence magnitude and time of flood events zappa et al 2013 developed a peak box approach providing visual support that envelops all ensemble peak timings and peak discharge from which specific verification metrics are defined 3 1 study area the ohio river basin is region 5 huc 2 among the 21 us hydrologic unit codes it has 14 huc 4 sub regions that stretch over the states of illinois indiana ohio kentucky virginia west virginia pennsylvania maryland tennessee and north carolina four huc 10 watersheds have been selected for case study 1 busseron creek crli3 a watershed in the kentucky indiana area 2 sitlington creek greenbrier river drbw2 a watershed in west virginia 3 north fork little beaver creek esto1 a watershed in the ohio illinois area 4 tygart valley river at dailey dlyw2 a watershed in west virginia fig 4 above shows the location map of the four huc 10 case study watersheds headwaters were selected to minimize the influence of human activities on flood behavior especially agricultural irrigation extractions and usace operation of locks and dams and to eliminate the complexity of channel routing see table s1 for detailed information on case study basins 3 2 anova 3 2 1 anova application anova analysis partitioned the uncertainty in ohrfc s 5 day flood forecast a total of l 245 ensembles were generated for each evaluated historical flood event and lead time 7 levels for precipitation 5 levels for soil moisture and 7 shapes for unit hydrograph the adjustment to the precipitation is strictly applied for the observed values when the simulated flow fails to match the observed flow the precipitation modifiers adjust the past precipitation either increasing or decreasing it to produce results as close to the observation as possible at any given time t the precipitation modifiers were applied to the model from t0 to tnow see fig 3 and the observed precipitation was applied to the period between tnow and tend the initial selection set the magnitude of the change of factor levels increase decrease as a percentage shifts from baseline levels for precipitation the range of change was 30 for soil moisture the range of change was 0 100 and for the unit hydrograph the levels were right left shift vertical stretch shrink and horizontal stretch shrink the initial trial runs showed flaws in the initial selection that they did not fully capture the magnitude of the flood events for busseron creek in particular thus a slightly modified selection expanded the factor levels to those shown in table 3 the table 3 factor levels provided the necessary resolution for factor adjustments adequately covered extreme events and represented settings frequently chosen by the ohrfc operational hydrologists during their regular forecast adjustment practices 3 2 2 system to apply modifications the objective in this study is to guide forecasters in their application of modifiers to improve forecasts a simple approach to this type of problem is a what if test alberto benitez andrades et al 2018 a what if test evaluates the performance of the forecast with and without a modification one limitation of this method is that the effect of individual modifiers can only be compared to the unmodified case operational forecasters routinely apply multiple modifiers and the modifiers themselves can have a range of values to find the optimum family of modifiers all potential modifiers across all potential values would need to be evaluated car manufacturers will perform car crash tests before launching a new model likewise hydrologic model developers usually perform crash tests to ensure the model is safe for use and≈ïeassian et al 2009 this study applied an expert system approach palmer holmes 1988 which elucidates the likely modifiers and their ranges of values from expert knowledge or judgement a query of the ohrfc database identified the three modifier types most frequently used and the discrete values of each that cover the range of possible values see table 4 this led to 245 combinations of modifiers to apply for each hydrologic event for each basin perrin et al 2008 also described a discrete parameterization method to calibrate parameters of rainfall runoff models which provided a robust parameter set when streamflow time series available for calibration were less than two years ohrfc created a system to execute the model at six different lead times and summarize results under each of the 245 combinations of modifiers and levels the data extracted from the ohrfc was then processed using computer algorithms written in r language the algorithm calculated general indexes based on the data sets such as ensemble identifiers and lead time of flood forecasts percent forecast error etc so that the data sets were ready for anova analysis and heat map application table 4 provides detailed information of selected events for this study only limited data were available for busseron creek and sitlington 3 2 3 anova results precipitation level 7 baseline 500 dominated the anova analysis and provided no decision relevant information it was therefore excluded from anova results figures fig 5 a shows the anova results at 0 lead time and fig 5 b shows the same results at 30 hour lead time anova results shown in fig 5 excluded residuals because their inclusion made the distribution results of selected factors less easily comparable fig s2 supplemental information shows the same results with residuals included for comparison it is clear that a large portion of uncertainty comes from the model itself a histogram of model error ensembles without applying mods of all flood events at 0 hour lead time is also provided in the supplemental information in fig 5 the x axis shows factor type the y axis shows the sum square error of each factor the Œª values chosen for box cox transformation for the four case studies were 1 0 28 for 0 hour lead time 0 2 for 30 h lead time for north fork little beaver creek 2 0 25 0 24 for tygart river valley at daily 3 0 44 0 2 for busseron creek and 4 0 19 0 21 for sitlington creek greenbrier river fig 5 a shows that at 0 hour lead time soil moisture is the dominant uncertainty in north fork little beaver creek and busseron creek basin the physical characteristics see table s1 of these two basins are highly alike and they are of similar size around 600 km2 and landcover type large area covered by cultivated crops in each of these two basins agriculture with direct impact on soil moisture is prominent in tygart valley river however the dominant uncertainty is the precipitation forecast tygart valley river is the smallest in size 479 15 km2 and mainly covered by deciduous forest in sitlington creek greenbrier river the largest uncertainty source is the unit hydrograph this is the largest basin 875 km2 which magnifies the uncertainty in assumptions made regarding the unit hydrograph uniform basin wide precipitation and the occurrence of all precipitation within a pre defined unit of time forecasters should exercise caution in adjusting these factors at short lead times as small adjustments in these factors could rapidly increase or decrease forecast error at 30 hours of lead time fig 5b precipitation becomes the largest source of uncertainty in all studied basins precipitation is well known to be one of the most important inputs to hydrologic models but is very difficult to predict with accuracy the discussion of heat map results in the next section addresses the impact on precipitation uncertainty of seasonality and basin geography because residuals dominate all other sources of uncertainty and make interpretation of the figure difficult they were removed from anova results see supplemental information fig s2 for anova results with residuals 3 3 heatmap results to emphasize those modifiers that work best in each basin and month and avoid clutter in visualizations only combinations of modifiers resulting in the lowest forecast errors are included in heat map results only the single level of each of the three modifiers that provided greatest forecast accuracy was selected for each flood event and lead time 1 precipitation modifier 1 soil moisture modifier and 1 unit hydrograph modifier a description of the procedure for development of the heat maps in this study is provided in the supplemental information fig 6 shows historical discharge from usgs and sampled events selected for this study note that for the purposes of this study we have sampled only large flood events in summer so that in some cases summer values appear higher than winter values that does not mean that floods in summer are larger than winter floods in general for the same reason the number of events in summer is smaller than that in winter the number of events sampled per month is shown at top of fig 6 from fig 6 the selected events for this study are usually at higher river stage and intended to capture the historical extreme events seasonally discharge in streams throughout the ohio river basin is higher in winter november to april and lower in summer may to august the panels of fig 7 show heat map results for north fork little beaver creek at each evaluated lead time a 0 hour b 6 hour c 12 hour d 18 hour e 24 hour and f 30 hour the x axis in each panel represents the month of occurrence for the evaluated historical flood events and the y axis identifies the level of each factor being modified p represents the precipitation modifier and has 7 settings rows s represents the soil moisture modifier 5 settings rows and u represents the unit hydrograph modifier 7 settings rows the baseline of each modifier is outlined by solid black lines the color key on the top left shows the percentage value the redder the color the smaller the percentage of evaluated historical cases in which this particular modifier setting was included in the best performing set bright colors yellows whites indicate that the modifier setting is the level at which greatest flood forecast accuracy is achieved across a large percentage of the evaluated historical cases the lesson from fig 7 north fork little beaver creek is modifications should not be made to the baseline precipitation modifier level in winter however alternative precipitation modifier levels may be useful in summer focusing on fig 7 a which is the result for a 0 hour lead time it is seen that precipitation modifiers have seasonal trends during winter months november to april more than 70 of the best forecast ensembles used baseline precipitation level 4 which indicates that adjustment in precipitation has not in these historical cases increased forecast accuracy during cold seasons and short lead times this corresponds with the anova finding that precipitation is not a dominant uncertainty at short lead times and therefore the potential benefits of adjusting it are small common sense tells us that the shorter the lead time the more accurate the precipitation forecast will be as the lead time increases fig 7b f although results still show seasonality for precipitation the percent distribution among levels of precipitation modifiers spreads out indicating that adjustments to produce better forecasts at longer lead times might be beneficial especially during summer months may august this finding could be explained with reference to synoptic and convective storm types the ohio river watershed tends to receive synoptic precipitation events in winter months and convective events in summer months archambault et al 2008 lombardo colle 2011 synoptic events are easier to forecast while convective events often result in rapid precipitation and flash floods which are highly random and difficult to accurately predict thus the considerations of modifier settings representative of deviations from the baseline precipitation forecast are likely to be more fruitful in summer for soils moisture the lesson is don t touch the baseline soil moisture modifier from baseline except possibly to decrease it to level one in the event that the recent past in the watershed was very dry level 3 is the baseline seasonality in this parameter is seen as well as it is linked to precipitation seasonality thus forecasters should take care when adjusting soil moisture conditions during winter summer however different from precipitation a level of the soil moisture modifier level 1 is a part of the best performing set often enough that it is a viable alternative to leaving the soils moisture modifier at its baseline level this is especially during summer months during hot and dry events common to summer months the soil moisture may be lower than the default thus too much water may have been added to the hydrologic model and decreasing the soil moisture condition is an efficient way to reduce the error in that case level 1 of the soil moisture modifier would beneficially be selected it is very unlikely that departing from baseline soil moisture levels by selecting higher levels of soil moisture would be productive in the summer if any adjustments are needed during winter months the course of action most likely to improve the forecast accuracy is an adjustment to the unit hydrograph modifier for the unit hydrograph level 1 baseline 2 left shift and 7 dispersion 2 are all frequently members of the best performing set for this basin different from precipitation and soil moisture results the unit hydrograph modifier is only weakly responsive to seasonality and lead time this is a meaningful finding because when simply adjusting precipitation and soil moisture does not provide significant improvement in forecast accuracy the unit hydrograph could be the factor to be adjusted forecasters using the unit hydrograph modifier to improve forecast accuracy should consider performing a left shift level 2 to make flood peak sooner or dispersion level 7 to add a 5 ordinate smoothing to better match the flood hydrograph fig 8 shows the heat map results in tygart valley river at dailey the pattern of precipitation and soil moisture is similar to that for north fork little beaver creek except that fewer adjustments to baseline factor levels are constructive across the historical cases evaluated as part of this study this could indicate a higher accuracy of the precipitation forecast product and or a better model calibration for this basin higher accuracy of flood forecasts resulting from modification of precipitation soil moisture or unit hydrograph factor levels is unlikely the best course of action for improvement of forecast accuracy in this basin would be improvement of the model calibration and reduction of residuals see anova fig s2 4 discussion and limitations this paper presents techniques for the efficient reduction of errors in nws flood forecasts anova experiments identified the relative magnitudes of the uncertainty contributed by each uncertain factor heat maps illustrate the uncertainty in flood forecasts by season and lead time for north fork little beaver creek and tygart valley river at daily anova results show that the variation from any individual or combination of modifiers is generally an order of magnitude less than the variation from the residuals indicating the largest source of uncertainty is from the model and its calibration residuals aside anova analysis also shows that soil moisture and unit hydrograph contribute more uncertainty at shorter lead times while precipitation is the largest source of uncertainty at longer lead times heat maps show that at short lead times it is nearly always better to use the baseline level for precipitation even at large lead times changes to the baseline level of the precipitation modifier should not be made in winter however alternative precipitation modifier levels may be useful in summer during localized convective events for which accurate precipitation estimates are elusive for soil moisture changes should not be made to the baseline level except possibly to decrease it to level one in the event that the recent past in the watershed was very dry different from precipitation and soil moisture results the unit hydrograph modifier is only weakly responsive to seasonality and lead time left shifts to modifier level 2 or dispersion level 7 to make flood peak sooner or add a 5 ordinate smoothing respectfully have been productive historically in the evaluated basins generally however none of the changes to modifier values are consistent improvements on baseline levels it therefore appears to be good policy except in a few specific circumstances to leave the modifiers unchanged limitations of this work include scarcity of information available on nws rfc historical and current practice regarding the use of modifiers relatively small study area basins without channel routing and a small number of basins studied thus it is unknown if findings of this study apply to downstream basins with channel routing larger sub basins or other climatologic regions further study of a variety of basins is needed in order to evaluate the general applicability of the findings presented here 5 conclusion and next steps this study shows the performance of ensembles of river flow forecasts generated with different modifier levels anova analysis suggests largest source of uncertainty comes form the model thus better calibration of hydrologic models may reduce overall uncertainty the results also show that soil moisture and unit hydrograph are more dominant uncertainty sources at short lead times while precipitation is the primary source of uncertainty at long lead times heat maps generated as part of this study show that both precipitation and soil moisture behavior have seasonality and that real time modifications made by nws operational hydrologists might be useful in the summer season but are unlikely to be fruitful in the winter operational hydrologists can also refer to the heat map to help decide which modifiers and what level to choose when adjustments are needed under specific month and lead time as mentioned earlier adjustments to precipitation cannot improve forecast accuracy in seasons marked by synoptic precipitation patterns in which precipitation forecast accuracy is already reasonably strong opportunities for reduction of precipitation uncertainty in conditions of convective precipitation is warranted systematic collection and analysis of the patterns of use for most frequently adjusted operational hydrologic modifiers has not been conducted at nws rfc s and that is needed in order to improve the usefulness of these findings as discussed in ray et al 2019 improved operational practices in water systems planning and management hold great promise for improvement to system resilience if floods could be forecasted more accurately what would be the resultant reduction in the burden for climate change adaptation measures involving the construction of new infrastructure or the altering of operating procedures these tradeoffs should be explored finally the heat map results presented in this paper are probability neutral no one combination of uncertain factors is deemed to be more or less likely than another for example the combination of modifications high precipitation low soil moisture is given the same likelihood weight as high precipitation high soil moisture when it is clear that one of those combinations is more likely than another furthermore it has been demonstrated in this paper that calibration biases in both the unit hydrograph and the soil moisture estimator result in non symmetrical probability distributions for each of those inputs to hydrologic forecasts it may therefore be useful to attempt to characterize the multidimensional uncertainty space for all inputs in combination using hierarchical bayesian belief network techniques such as those described in taner et al 2019 declaration of competing interest

8577,society and the environment in the arid southwestern united states depend on reliable water availability yet current water use outpaces supply water demand is projected to grow in the future and climate change is expected to reduce supply to adapt water managers need robust estimates of future regional water supply to support management decisions to address this need we estimate future streamflow in seven water resource regions in the southwestern u s using a new spatially referenced regressions on watershed attributes sparrow streamflow model we present streamflow projections corresponding to input data from seven climate models and two greenhouse gas representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and 8 5 for three thirty year intervals centered on the 2030s 2050s and 2080s and for a historical thirty year interval centered on the 1990s across water resource regions about half of the rcp4 5 models 51 and two thirds of the rcp8 5 models 67 indicate decreases in streamflow in the 2080s relative to the historical period models project maximum decreases in streamflow of 36 80 in all water resource regions for all periods and rcps relative to historical streamflow and maximum streamflow decreases of up to 20 45 in the 2080s at sites along the colorado river used for measuring compliance with interstate and international water agreements headwaters are projected to experience the greatest declines with substantial downstream implications among these estimates the streamflows from models forced with rcp8 5 tend to be lower than those forced with rcp4 5 not all climate models times and rcps project widespread streamflow declines the most ubiquitous streamflow increases are projected to occur in the 2030s under rcp4 5 later time periods and enhanced greenhouse gas forcings indicate smaller regions of streamflow increase and lower accumulated streamflows suggesting that limiting or reducing greenhouse gas concentrations could support future water availability although some possible streamflow increases are promising the modest and spatially limited increases in streamflow projected for later time periods are still unlikely to be sufficient to meet the projected water demand these results inform the likelihood of future water agreement compliance and support developing strategies to balance water supply and demand keywords climate change impacts streamflow water supply and demand 1 introduction water resources in the southwestern united states are experiencing high demand to support anthropogenic uses and are some of the most highly regulated globally particularly in the colorado river basin u s bureau of reclamation 2000 christensen et al 2004 rister et al 2011 u s bureau of reclamation 2016a yet sustainable supplies of drinking water and water for agriculture hydroelectric power generation recreation and ecosystem uses depend on adequate water resource availability water shortages currently occur throughout the southwestern united states with demand likely to increase following population growth at the same time future climate change is projected to contribute to decreases in water supply milly et al 2005 mankin et al 2019 milly and dunne 2020 future surface water availability depends on the integration of complex climatic factors including temperature precipitation amount phase and timing integrated through land

and bonfils 2013 globally in the coming century drought which has been exacerbated by anthropogenic warming diffenbaugh et al 2015 williams et al 2020 amplifies the impacts of widespread shortages concern about the combined effects of increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation has led to great concerns about the long term reliability of colorado river basin water supplies lukas and payton 2020 these same concerns apply to other basins in the region because of the state and national concern about reduced water supply in the region water managers like the bureau of reclamation are asking whether water management planning should incorporate the possibility of a hotter drier and more variable future llewellyn et al 2013 understanding the effect of climatic changes on streamflow supports effective water management practices especially in vulnerable arid and mountainous regions where snowmelt fed rivers supply a substantial portion of water to low elevation downstream areas xiao et al 2018 water shortages will affect water users and shortfalls in water supply have interstate and international ramifications for water sharing agreements for example the mexican water treaty of 1944 allocates 1 85 km3yr 1 of colorado river annual discharge about 9 of total flow to mexico annually u s mexico 1944 substantial declines in colorado river streamflow would affect the ability of the u s to provide mexico s water allocation furthermore decreases in colorado river streamflow would affect hydropower generation and the economies and natural resources of 40 million people in the

hydrologic problems sun and scanlon 2019 lange and sippel 2020 bellos and carbajal 2020 shen et al 2020 although these studies have generally not focused on the effects of climate change on future streamflow in the southwestern u s steep computational costs and parameterization difficulties remain challenges for large scale deterministic process based approaches while purely statistical models can suffer from a loss of process understanding that is useful for applied water management the spatially referenced regressions on watershed attributes sparrow streamflow modeling framework used in this study blends statistical and process based approaches to modeling streamflow this approach provides improved model interpretability prediction accuracy and reduced computational cost over deterministic and statistical models alexander et al 2019 specifically sparrow models use nonlinear least squares regression nlls constrained by mass balance to determine the spatial relationships between streamflow and water sources transport and loss both within the stream channel and on land under long term conditions and provides estimates of streamflow in ungaged locations the sparrow model provides estimates of streamflow in unmeasured locations via identification of statistical relationships between streamflow and watershed characteristics as well as routing of streamflow through the stream network sparrow models which are calibrated for specific regions have been widely used in the southwest kenney et al 2009 miller et al 2016 miller et al 2017 the united states alexander et

2019 miller et al 2020 to address the critical impacts water shortages have on people the economy and natural systems and provide information to water managers about future water supply our study brackets future streamflow across the southwest using future climate projections derived from gcm runs conducted under the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 as inputs to a new calibrated sparrow streamflow model wise et al 2019 for the southwestern u s in comparison to many previous studies of basins within the region that used coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 datasets miller et al 2011 llewellyn et al 2013 markstrom et al 2012 u s bureau of reclamation 2012a vano et al 2014 cmip5 datasets include more advanced models often at higher spatial resolution and representative concentration pathways replace the emissions scenarios used in cmip3 nakicenovic and swart 2000 meinshausen et al 2011 taylor et al 2012 the sparrow model uses a fully connected streamflow network that accounts for diversions inflows storage and other human management of the water resources incorporation of such human management is important in the southwestern u s where alterations to the natural stream system are common our approach is also particularly well suited for the southwestern u s because we use variable catchment scales 0 0009 65 014 km2 and fine scale climate data approximately 800 km2 which support improved representation of mountainous terrain a common challenge for climate studies of the region the choice to model streamflow across the entirety of the southwest means that we can provide information for both the critically important colorado river basin as well as areas that have been less heavily studied but that are likely to experience warming drying and water stress in the coming century seager and vecchi 2010 while most other modeling approaches to understand the impacts of climate change on water resources in the region are either global arnell 1999 milly et al 2005 nohara et al 2006 seager et al 2007 national caldwell et al 2012 or smaller basin scale assessments christensen et al 2004 christensen and lettenmaier 2007

of reclamation 2016a udall and overpeck 2017 lehner et al 2019 the sparrow model used here can provide streamflow estimates at a sub continental regional scale a regional scale model is useful because it incorporates area specific characteristics that improve model prediction that can be lost in larger scale models while providing regionally consistent results beyond the basin scale this is particularly important when water resources are regulated on a regional basis and basins cross important boundaries for water management such as state or international boundaries as is the case in the southwestern region there is a need for future water availability estimates at a range of spatial scales u s bureau of reclamation 2011 texas water development board 2017 lukas and payton 2020 to address this concern we provide results across a range of spatial scales including catchment to water resources region our results are presented both as total accumulated streamflow as is commonly reported and as the incremental catchment yield that is delivered to the stream network outlet including the us mexico border the gulf of mexico or internal drainage within closed basins at stream reach to water resource region scales the incremental delivered yield which represents the streamflow generated within a catchment normalized to the catchment area highlights the spatial structure of streamflow change and supports understanding how changes propagate throughout the stream network that is not always clear from total streamflow alone 2 methods 2 1 site description the southwestern

level to mountain peaks over 4400 m the regional climate is variable and is influenced by the region s rugged topography and proximity to the pacific ocean gulf of california and gulf of mexico as well as the mid latitude storm track and the north american monsoon garfin et al 2013 storms originating over the pacific ocean and gulf of mexico generate much of the cool season precipitation while the north american monsoon delivers warm season precipitation to the region particularly in new mexico and arizona garfin et al 2013 runkle et al 2017 observed twentieth century warming is expected to continue through the coming century while projections of future precipitation are move variable garfin et al 2013 u s bureau of reclamation 2011 lukas and payton 2020 much of the region is subject to drought williams et al 2020 which is expected to increase in the future with substantial impacts on water resources cayan et al 2010 woodhouse et al 2010 cook et al 2015 although precipitation is a primary control on runoff mccabe and wolock 2011 there is a growing understanding of the important role temperature via evaporation and plant transpiration plays in regulating streamflow in the region woodhouse et al 2016 udall and overpeck 2017 milly and dunne 2020 streamflow in all water resource regions besides the texas gulf relies primarily on seasonal snowpack for example snowpack in the rocky mountains and san juan mountains is the primary water supply for the colorado river and rio grande respectively rango 2006 wise et al 2019 mccabe and wolock 2020 lukas and payton 2020 in contrast precipitation in the texas gulf region is greater during warm months and a very small proportion of total annual precipitation falls as snow texas water development board 2012 the rio grande and rivers in the texas gulf flow to the gulf of mexico wise et al 2019 in the absence of human water use and management the colorado river flows to the gulf of california witze 2014 throughout this study the colorado river refers to the river that originates in colorado wyoming and utah and flows to the gulf of california not the colorado river that drains central texas to the gulf of mexico because of heavy water use and reservoir operations the colorado river is sometimes dry before reaching the river outlet in the gulf of california witze 2014 similarly the great salt lake in the great basin has shrunk in recent decades wurtsbaugh et al 2017 exposing fine playa sediments and disrupting ecosystem and industrial uses in closed basins like the great basin pacific northwest and california water resources regions streams do not reach the ocean wise et al 2019 instead rivers flow into terminal lakes many of which are saline e g great salt lake salton sea and streams recharge aquifers the rivers in these water resource regions are crucial for agricultural municipal industrial recreational and ecological water uses for example the colorado river supplies water to irrigate 55 million acres of land which produces 15 of the nation s crops u s bureau of reclamation 2012a colorado river water is used by nearly 40 million people for municipal use and its flow generates 4 200 megawatts of hydroelectric power u s bureau of reclamation 2012a likewise the rio grande provides municipal water to 6 million people irrigates 2 million acres of land in the u s and mexico and generates 15 megawatts of hydroelectric power llewellyn et al 2013 u s bureau of reclamation 2016a much of the streamflow in the great basin is allocated to agriculture though the streams also provide municipal water to 3 2 million people u s bureau of reclamation 2016a the great salt lake in the great basin serves as a critical stopover for migratory birds is responsible for a third of the global brine shrimp trade and is a major producer of magnesium water in the region is heavily managed and regulated the seven basins all have reservoirs and diversions constructed along streams to manage water supply and have varied water use allocations including inter state and international water sharing agreements surface water in most western states is governed by the doctrine of prior appropriation the compacts laws judicial decisions and regulatory guidelines that apportion and regulate colorado river water among the seven colorado river basin states and mexico is collectively known as the law of the river sax and abrams 2006 u s bureau of reclamation 2008 both the colorado river and rio grande are managed in compliance with international treaties for delivery of water of

streamflow model for the southwest sw sparrow uses temperature t precipitation p actual evapotranspiration et a and potential evapotranspiration et p as direct inputs climate data were selected to be consistent with climate data used in the sw sparrow model calibration which included parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism and monthly water balance model data as described in section 2 5 we obtained monthly scale gridded future and historical climate t and p data for the western united states from a subset of the 30 global climate models included in the national aeronautics and space administration nasa earth exchange nex downscaled climate projections nex dcp30 thrasher et al 2013 2013 at approximately 800 m2 spatial resolution 30 arc seconds this data set was selected because it provides bias corrected climate change projections at a resolution high enough to evaluate impacts on processes that are sensitive to small scale climate gradients and the effects of local topography thrasher et al 2013 both of which are important in the southwest u s thrasher et al 2013 provide full details on the development of the nex dcp30 data set which can be visualized at the national climate change viewer https www2 usgs gov landresources lcs nccv asp the nex dcp30 data set applies the bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd downscaling method to gcm data derived from the cmip5 taylor et al 2012 the prism daly et al 2008 observational data set is used to bias correct the gcm output thrasher et al 2013 spatial disaggregation improves the representation of climate on a regional scale and translates the variable coarser resolution between 1 and 3 where latitude and longitude differ gcm data to the common high resolution 800 m2 prism grid the bcsd downscaling method uses quantile mapping to bias correct and translate coarse resolution changes from the gcms to the higher resolution grid quantile mapping has known short comings such as a tendency to alter future trends in the gcm time series under represent extreme events and produce frequency dependent model biases theme√ül et al 2011 maraun 2013 pierce et al 2013 alder and hostetler 2019 found the nex dcp30 data set exaggerates future projections of cold season precipitation in the upper colorado river basin relative to the original gcm simulations a wettening phenomena where bias corrected and downscaled bcsd data projected larger increases in precipitation than the corresponding gcm has also been identified lukas et al 2014 lukas and payton 2020 this effect is more pronounced in cmip5 than cmip3 data moreover all forms of statistical downscaling and bias correction rescale precipitation to match observations with no guarantee of conserving mass which can result in decoupling the thermodynamic relationship between temperature and precipitation explicit in the physics of the gcm although shortcomings of bcsd have been identified alder and hostetler 2019 the nex dcp30 data set is the highest spatial resolution downscaled data set we identified high spatial resolution is important given the high resolution of catchments in this study further prism incorporates a spatially and temporally varying lapse rate to account for topographic and geographic effects on climate variables which is important in the southwest given the region s rugged topography and expansive geographical area we used future climate data from a single model experiment ensemble member the first realization r1i1p1 using two representative concentration pathways rcps meinshausen et al 2011 we selected rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 to evaluate the effect on streamflow of two potential greenhouse gas concentration not emissions trajectories resulting in different radiative forcings at 2100 from eachother and from current radiative forcing rcp4 5 represents a scenario where greenhouse gas concentrations peak in the year 2040 then decline resulting in a radiative forcing of 4 5 w m 2 at 2100 whereas rcp8 5 represents a scenario where greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise at an aggressive rate throughout the 21st century resulting in a radiative forcing of 8 5 w m 2 at 2100 in this way rcp4 5 represents the effects of greenhouse gas emissions reductions wheras rcp8 5 represents continued increasing emissions though there have been recent criticisms of rcp8 5 suggesting that it does not represent a likely outcome hausfather and peters 2020 we include rcp8 5 in order to investigate lower probability high risk potential outcomes to estimate actual evapotranspiration et a we employed output data from the physically based computationally efficient monthly water balance model mwbm wolock and mccabe 1999 hostetler and alder 2016 the mwbm apportions water into snowpack evapotranspiration soil water and runoff using parameterizations and rules based on measurement and reanalysis data and has been shown to estimate et a adequately hostetler and alder 2016 the mwbm uses precipitation p from the nex dcp30 data set mwbm calculated available soil moisture dependent on soil type and potential evapotranspiration et p to estimate the actual evapotranspiration et a across the study region potential evapotranspiration et p is calculated from temperature t from the nex dcp30 data set using a method which has been observed to perform well in arid semi arid and temperate climates oudin et al 2005 the mwbm is used to provide sparrow a reasonable range of future changes in annual actual evapotranspiration at the climatological scale on the same 800 m prism grid however these projections are subject to uncertainties along the modeling chain clark et al 2016 where there are often substantial differences among hydrology models in their projections mizukami et al 2016 there is additional projection uncertainty in the choice of et p calculations milly and dunne 2017 which is often limited to temperature based methods due to the general lack of statistically downscaled and bias corrected energy variables needed for more complex et p formulations 2 3 climate data processing we calculated the multidecadal annual average temperature t c precipitation p mm yr 1 potential evapotranspiration et p mm yr 1 and actual evapotranspiration et a mm yr 1 using the iris package in python we first calculated the annual average values from the monthly values then used these annual average gridded timeseries to calculate multidecadal average values for one historical time period 1975 2005 and three future 30 year intervals 2020 2049 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the choice of historical period reflects the cmip5 experimental approach where all historical simulations end in 2005 and the future projection experiments begin in 2006 for all time intervals we note that the multidecadal period averages do not explicitly address seasonality of climate variables which are important aspects of the water supply particularly in snowmelt dominated watersheds we used the gridded multidecadal average values and the approximately 400 000 national hydrography dataset plus version 2 1 catchments brakebill et al 2020 to calculate catchment average values for t p et a and et p for both rcps and all time periods for input into the sparrow model we upsampled the gridded climate data from a resolution of approximately 800 m2 to a resolution of 65 m2 using a nearest neighbor interpolation scheme the nearest neighbor was chosen over a smoothing interpolation scheme to preserve the granularity of climate information available from the original datasets we calculated the catchment average climate data values using the function zonal stats from the python module rasterstats less than 1 of all catchments were too small to contain any raster grid cells at a resolution of 65 m2 for these few cases we assigned the value of the raster cell with the centroid closest to the catchment centroid nearest neighbor 2 4 climate model selection we selected a representative subset of seven climate models models and details listed in table 1 and fig s1 from the 30 nex dcp30 models thrasher et al 2013 understanding both expected average conditions and potential extreme outcomes is important for adaptive planning elias et al 2018 further model weighting or screening methods remain uncertain harding et al 2012 and the effects on the distribution of future climate changes may be limited lukas and payton 2020 therefore we focus on bracketing the expected range of future streamflow in order to help water managers understand the range of changes they may expect and need to plan for six of the climate models were selected to maximize the difference between the average t and p in the rcp8 5 2070 2099 scenario and a historical 1950 2005 time period over the gridded data domain between 24 06 n and 46 30 n and between 92 5 and 122 45 e and the seventh climate model was selected to represent a central tendency t and p difference between the rcp8 5 2070 2099 scenario and the historical 1950 2005 time period we chose the rcp8 5 2070 2099 scenario for model selection because it likely represents the most extreme changes of any of the future climate scenarios relative to the historical interval additionally for comparability with previous studies we chose climate models whose prior versions were used in a study on current and future water supply and demand in the colorado river basins by the u s bureau of reclamation 2012a although models representing reduced changes in temperature and precipitation are available we did not expect them to support understanding the range of future streamflow changes as well at the models representing the greatest changes predictions made with a nonlinear model using forcing data outside the calibration range may produce unreliable results the southwest sw sparrow model was calibrated using climate data for the 2000 2014 period see section 2 5 sw sparrow model for additional details regarding model calibration we ensured that the values of t and p for all scenarios were close to the range of t and p values used to calibrate the sparrow model for the calibration time period for p et a and et p nearly 99 of stream reaches across all time periods and models had values within the calibration minimum and maximum values with fewer than 5 of reaches exceeding the maximum variable value however an average of 23 of reaches exceeded the maximum calibration temperature of 25 2 c on average reaches exceeded the maximum temperature by 9 2 27 c and exceedances were more likely in the 2080s under the rcp8 5 scenario however the temperature exceedances may have little influence on the model results because temperature was multiplied by 10 and log transformed before it was used in the model to eliminate negative numbers and reduce the effects of very low temperatures following methods in wise et al 2019 and to approximate normal distributions schwarz et al 2006 this compresses the differences between higher temperatures for example the difference between the model calibration maximum log 10 t value and the future climate maximum log 10 t value is 0 16 representing at most a 3 6 exceedance of the maximum log 10 t calibration value of 2 40 nonetheless results in areas where future temperatures exceeded model calibration temperatures should be used with caution 2 5 sw sparrow model we used sparrow to model streamflow because it is a hybrid statistical and process based model that estimates water loads streamflow in this study in streams by regressing measurement data e g stream gage monitoring data against watershed characteristics e g climate soil type land use and water sources e g runoff springs the model uses nlls regression with mass balance constraints to characterize the spatial relationship between observed streamflow and 1 sources of water to streams 2 controls on delivery of water to streams and 3 within stream removals in a watershed under long term conditions fig 2 the model uses a fully connected stream network to integrate both catchment conditions and upstream loads to produce spatially explicit streamflow estimates at all stream reaches within a network schwarz et al 2006 the sw sparrow streamflow model used here was calibrated to estimate streamflow for the seven water resource regions shown in fig 1 though wise et al 2019 detail the complete model calibration methods we provide a short summary here for context the model was developed and calibrated to hydrologic conditions of 2012 using long term 2000 2014 mean annual streamflow measurements from monitoring sites and a wide range of data representing watershed characteristics including prism and mwbm climate data processed to nhdplus version 2 1 catchments wieczorek et al 2018 wise et al 2019 a range of different watershed characteristics representing hydrologic topographic geologic climatic including snow and land use and cover characteristics were tested for inclusion in the sw sparrow streamflow model nonlinear least squares methods were used to estimate coefficient values for each of the water sources water delivery terms and within stream removal terms the final coefficient values estimated using nlls methods ensure the most accurate fit of the model to the stream monitoring observations by minimizing average differences between the simulated and observed predictions of the mean annual streamflow at monitoring sites only significant variables were retained in the model and the model was generally successful at matching mean annual streamflow measured at 867 gages throughout the region wise et al 2019 the model explained approximately 89 of the variability in measured water yield wise et al 2019 no significant spatial correlations were identified in model residuals determined as the difference between the log of measured streamflow at calibration sites and the log of predicted accumulated streamflow wise et al 2019 model estimated coefficients were then used within the stream routing constraints to predict long term mean annual streamflow throughout the region in the calibrated streamflow model used in this study four variables represent sources of water to streams runoff p et a municipal wastewater treatment plant discharges spring discharges and inflows inflows include streamflow entering the model domain from mexico inter basin transfers and return flows from irrigated lands which primarily contribute to streamflow in the gila river and lower colorado river subregions of the lower colorado water resources region and the imperial valley subregion of the california water resources region five variables represent conditions that influence the transport of water to streams air temperature t impervious surface area precipitation intensity mean distance to a flowline within a catchment and soil clay content four variables represent streamflow removal processes loss from intermittent streams evapotranspiration and streambed infiltration irrigation withdrawals municipal water supply withdrawals and evaporative loss from impoundments these explanatory variables e g spring discharge soil clay content impervious surface coverage come from national and regional data products while all of the sw sparrow variables e g impervious surface soil clay content vary among reaches only variables that depend on future climate projections vary among the sw sparrow modeling results presented here these variables include runoff air temperature precipitation intensity and evaporative loss from impoundments we calculated runoff from the difference between precipitation and actual evapotranspiration p et a we estimated precipitation intensity by dividing the multidecadal annual average precipitation amount p by the average number of precipitation days in a year from 1961 1990 data wieczorek et al 2018 2018 and applying a log transformation however the actual number of wet days per year may be expected to change with future climate change representing a source of uncertainty in the model finally evaporation from impoundments was calculated as the product of the impoundment wet area and the potential evapotranspiration et p the impoundment wet area does not vary with time representing another source of uncertainty in the model we ran the sw sparrow streamflow model using the calibrated model coefficients wise et al 2019 and future p t et a and et p projections from each of the seven climate models for a 30 year historical time period 1975 2005 as well as the three thirty year projected climate time periods of 2020 2049 2030s 2040 2069 2050s and 2070 2099 2080s under two greenhouse gas concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this interval length results in a ten year overlap for the first two projection periods so we expect more similarity between the 2030s and 2050s streamflows than between the 2050s and 2080s streamflows because sparrow quantifies the long term effects of watershed processes on streamflow and is calibrated with long term average data it is appropriate to project future streamflow over long term average conditions a thirty year interval length of traditional climate normal is long enough to avoid issues of shorter or multidecadal timescale variability e g el ni√±o southern oscillation or pacific decadal oscillation but short enough to detect change over the 21st century each of the seven climate models contains process based biases so we present future climate streamflow projection results as streamflow anomalies relative to the climate model specific historical period the sw sparrow model is a simple empirical watershed modeling tool that quantifies the long term effects of watershed processes on streamflow but does not incorporate watershed processes that occur on shorter less than annual time scales that dynamic mechanistic models can quantify although dynamic mechanistic models quantify fine scale temporally dynamic processes sparrow supports development of large scale regional models constrained by mass balance at the large spatial scale applied in this study where dynamic mechanistic models may be hampered by extensive data and infrastructure needs or subject to overparameterizations that impede process understanding and contribute to large uncertainties in predictions at ungaged locations alexander et al 2019 the sparrow approach is useful in this study we assume that the relationships between explanatory variables and streamflow remain constant over time although this may not be accurate the relative importance and sign of each variable coefficient generally aligns with the conceptual model of streamflow generation in the region wise et al 2019 and so even if the absolute values of coefficients change the relative relationships are retained in the results we discuss sw sparrow projections in terms of total streamflow and delivered incremental yields incremental values refer to the amount of water generated within each catchment whereas total or accumulated values refer to the total water in a reach resulting from both incremental and upstream water contributions streamflow refers to the volume of water moving through the stream per unit time e g km3 yr 1 whereas yield refers to the catchment area normalized streamflow e g mm yr 1 the delivered incremental yield refers to the area normalized streamflow that makes it from a catchment to the stream network outlet this outlet may be the us mx border gulf of mexico or an internal endpoint in the case of endorreic water resource regions like the great basin among these ways of presenting the results accumulated streamflow is the most intuitive as it is an estimate of the actual absolute streamflow for a river or stream in a particular location however incremental delivered yields are useful for understanding the spatial structure of streamflow change in lower order streams and thus the climatic processes that integrate through the stream network to produce changes in higher order reaches 3 results the goals of this study are to bracket the range of future streamflow change due to climate change across the southwest through the 21st century under two rcps identify where and when streamflow changes may occur and evaluate how such changes might affect our ability to meet future water demand and water sharing agreements to that end our results show where when and by how much streamflows across the southwest may change in the future in response to changing climate we describe general spatial and temporal patterns of streamflow changes both by climate model and as multimodel means and compare results for both rcps we then highlight areas of the region that may experience substantial changes including high elevation headwater catchments with important implications for downstream reaches finally we show how streamflow may change at several gages of interest for interstate and international water sharing agreements we address broad questions related to water demand in the discussion the sw sparrow modeling results project overall streamflow decreases in most water resource regions boundaries delineated in fig 1 across the southwestern u s fig 3 tables s1 and s2 compared to the 1975 2005 historical time period some streamflow increases are projected as well in general most of the increases in projected accumulated streamflow occur during the 2030s whereas increases occur over a more limited spatial extent and often have smaller magnitudes during the 2080s fig 4 s2 at that time the projected multimodel mean streamflow increases occur within limited areas in the northern great basin central and southern texas and the central lower colorado river basin fig 4 the projected streamflow changes do not occur linearly and the spatial patterns of streamflow anomalies change over the study period for example the multimodel average streamflow anomaly for rcp4 5 at the subbasin scale shows nearly complete increases in streamflow across the study area in the 2030s followed by greater streamflow decreases in the eastern part of the study area during the 2050s fig s2 than during the 2080s fig 4 the non linear spatially variable response of streamflow reflects projected changes in the spatial structure and magnitude of climate variables figs s3 and s4 to changing climate while the direction of projected changes is often similar with time the magnitude of change is often greater for models forced with rcp8 5 compared to models forced with rcp4 5 in all regions models forced with rcp8 5 project larger changes during the 2080s either increases or decreases than models forced with rcp4 5 for example streamflow is projected to decline in the 2080s relative to the historical period in the upper colorado lower colorado rio grande and texas gulf water resource regions under both rcps for most models however the projected streamflow losses tend to be greater for rcp8 5 multimodel means show decreases between 7 and 20 and individual models project losses as great as 80 table s2 compared with rcp4 5 multimodel means show decreases between 1 and 8 and individual models project losses as great as 59 table s2 about half of models project accumulated streamflow decreases in the great basin and california water resource regions in the 2080s relative to the historical time period the multimodel means for these basins project a modest streamflow increase for california 2 4 with possible changes of nearly 50 table s2 and a modest decrease for the great basin 3 5 with possible increases of up to 30 or possible decreases of as much as 47 table s2 most models project streamflow increases in the pacific northwest for both rcps though the multimodel mean suggests this increase may be modest in the 2080s 3 with projected increases of up to 42 table s2 for similar time periods and water resource regions the variability among climate models is greater than the variability between rcps the multimodel mean accumulated streamflow anomaly varies spatially fig 4 reflecting projected changes in the spatial structure and magnitude of climate variables figs s3 and s4 for some subbasins this means that the direction of accumulated streamflow change is the same for both rcps during the 2080s though the magnitudes differ with rcp for example both rcps indicate accumulated streamflow losses in most subbasins of the rio grande and subbasins of the upper colorado that contain high elevation catchments as well as the eastern most subbasins of the texas gulf water resource region likewise both rcps indicate accumulated streamflow gains in subbasins of the northern great basin and the southernmost subbasins in texas in these cases the magnitude of change tends to be greater under rcp8 5 compared to rcp4 5 for example the multimodel mean projects greater declines in streamflow in subbasins in the southern rocky mountains and eastern sierra nevada for rcp8 5 compared to rcp4 5 and greater increases in the northern great basin for rcp8 5 compared to rcp4 5 the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 projections also indicate changes in the spatial distribution of streamflow gains and losses for example some subbasins in the upper colorado and numerous subbasins in the lower colorado water resource regions switch from moderate streamflow increases rcp4 5 to streamflow decreases rcp8 5 by the 2080s the projected shifts in streamflow patterns may be related to how the climate models balance the thermodynamic and dynamic hydroclimate responses to greenhouse gas forcing to first order thermodynamic changes include increased temperature which drives enhanced evapotranspiration across the landscape hostetler and alder 2016 while dynamic changes like changes to stormtracks e g marvel and bonfils 2013 will shift precipitation patterns and amounts how these two quantities interact p et a will be a primary control on streamflow due to increasing surface net radiation and rising temperatures et a is expected to increase across the study domain absent increases in water use efficiency and changes to vegetation so if p remains constant or decreases we will likely observe streamflow declines however if p increases with magnitudes larger than et a then streamflow increases will be observed both wetting and drying responses have been observed in historical data across the study domain greve et al 2014 consistent with the mixed response we observe in our results the projected accumulated streamflow anomaly at the subbasin scale fig 5 same scale as shown in fig 4 varies among models and the individual model results indicate much larger gains or losses than the multimodel mean projection fig 4 because high flow catchments within a water resource region integrate conditions from upstream catchments we observe the largest range of projected streamflows in the hydrologic units with the highest historical streamflow projections for the 2080s under rcp8 5 shown in fig 5 with the exception of some hydrologic subunits in the lower colorado rio grande and california some of these subbasins may show minimal to no change and minimal to no range among models presumably due to water management practices which remain constant across all models concentration pathways and time periods consistent with the water resource region summary the subbasin scale rcp8 5 climate model data typically project a wider range of streamflow changes compared to those from rcp4 5 fig s5 in all water resource regions at least one model projects that a majority of subbasins could experience 50 or greater losses in accumulated streamflow by the 2080 time period the losses observed at subbasins with higher historical flow fig 5 receive much of their water from the highest elevation headwater catchments wise et al 2019 so changes at high elevations have an outsized effect on streamflows in the mainstem rivers of the water resource regions major accumulated streamflow losses in subbasins containing high elevation catchments are observed in the upper colorado and rio grande for both rcps and the western region of the great basin and parts of the california water resource regions for rcp8 5 fig 4 among three of the most mountainous water resource regions we observe a strong non linear relationship between the change in delivered incremental yield and the mean reach elevation shown for the 2080s rcp8 5 in fig 6 across the three water resource regions all project less change at low elevations and the greatest changes at the highest elevations for almost all models in all water resource regions the losses are moderate 50 100 mm yr 1 to large 300 mm yr 1 decreases in delivered incremental yields relative to the historical period in the great basin water resource region some models project that mid and upper elevation reaches 2000 3000 m will see little change one model mri cgcm3 warmer wetter future suggests moderate increases in delivered incremental yield at these elevations whereas other models e g gfdl cm3 hotter wetter future and miroc esm most hot average wet future project large decreases in delivered incremental yields at these same elevations mri cgcm3 had the smallest temperature increase and high precipitation increase from the historical 1950 2005 to the 2070 2099 time period compared to other climate models in the study fig s1 assuming that a wetter and less warm future allows for greater streamflow these projected changes in temperature and precipitation may account for this finding of moderate delivered incremental yield increases associated with this gcm in the rio grande all models except giss e2 r least warm average wet future project decreases in delivered incremental yield with the greatest decreases occurring at the highest elevation reaches in the upper colorado basin all models project delivered incremental yield decreases at the highest elevation reaches 3500 m but at mid elevations two models mri cgcm3 and miroc esm project small increases in delivered incremental yields the changes projected for high elevation catchments drive the downstream changes observed in the higher order reaches of mainstem rivers the sw sparrow projections indicate changes in streamflow at reaches with gages that are important for interstate and international water sharing agreements fig 7 despite increases in precipitation and streamflow among some climate models e g miroc esm most hot average wet future and mri cgcm3 warmer wetter future the multimodel mean of streamflow tends to decrease over time at these critical sites ipsl cm5a mr the hottest driest model suggests that streamflow could decrease by between 25 and 45 at sites along the colorado river between 6 and 62 at sites on the rio grande and 58 at the san juan river near bluff in the 2080s under rcp8 5 by comparison rcp4 5 for the same model and time period projects streamflow could decrease between 12 and 22 at sites on the colorado river between 5 and 33 at sites on the rio grande and 26 at the san juan river near bluff not only are the projected streamflow declines at these critical sites lower for rcp4 5 compared to rcp8 5 in the 2080s rcp4 5 also indicates a narrower range of projected streamflows as expected for some models e g ipsl cm5a rm at colorado river sites rcp4 5 indicates increases in accumulated streamflow in the 2080s relative to the 2050s potentially corresponding to the decreased greenhouse gasses at later time periods under rcp4 5 combined these results suggest that river flows in the southwestern u s may be responsive to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and thus lower century end radiative forcing 4 discussion most sw sparrow projections at the water resource region scale suggest decreasing streamflow during the latter half of the 21st century fig 3 tables s1 and s2 for a region where surface water is experiencing high demand is heavily regulated and can be in low supply any future streamflow declines will exacerbate existing challenges to meeting water demand however our results are promising in that they suggest that efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and maintain lower greenhouse gas concentrations may have a sizeable effect on streamflow in the 2080s figs 4 and 7 and contribute to streamflows in the 2030s and 2050s that are more similar to historical values despite variability among streamflow projections based on different climate models the similarity in direction of change between projected streamflow from both rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 suggests that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions support maintaining current streamflow further declining greenhouse gas emissions in rcp4 5 in the latter part of the 21st century may correspond to the recovery of streamflow from the 2050s to 2080s most pronounced in comparing fig s2 and fig 4 especially for rcp8 5 we observe a large range in model projections at the sub basin scale fig 5 reflecting differences in projected temperature and precipitation amounts among models figs s2 and s3 the climate model that projects a wetter warm future mri cgcm3 and the climate model that indicates average precipitation and the least warming giss e2 r also project the greatest increases in streamflow across all water resource regions likewise the models that project large temperature increases alongside small precipitation increases or precipitation decreases miroc esm ipsl cm5a mr or moderate temperature change and moderate precipitation decreases inmcm4 project the greatest decreases in streamflow across most water resource regions finally models notably miroc esm most hot average wet future and ipsl cm5a mr hotter drier future project different spatial patterns of streamflow change with miroc esm indicating larger losses for the three westernmost water resource regions and ipsl cm5a mr indicating large streamflow decreases for the rocky mountains and texas though we cannot comment on which model or concentration pathway may indicate the most likely future the hotter drier models and concentration pathways provide a useful upper bound on the extent of possible future streamflow decreases and produce results consistent with current anthropogenically driven drought conditions in the southwest barnett et al 2008 which are projected to continue throughout the 21st century cayan et al 2010 woodhouse et al 2010 cook et al 2015 streamflow increases are projected for some areas although fig 5 suggests that in the 2080s the number of subbasins expected to experience streamflow declines and the magnitude of projected declines is greater than the number of subbasins expected to experience streamflow increases and the magnitude of projected increases this overall decline in streamflow is most apparent in the rio grande region moreover the projected increases often occur at downstream or internally draining parts of water resource regions fig 4 which may not offset expected decreases in major water source regions some of the increases may also be due to the wettening phenomena imparted on cmip5 data through bcsd we project the greatest losses in streamflow in upper elevation snow melt dominated headwater subbasins and reaches figs 4 and 6 in these high mountain primary water supply areas snowpack is implicated as the strongest control on streamflow mccabe and wolock 2011 miller et al 2016 and has cascading downstream effects influencing streamflow in distal low elevation mainstem rivers our results are consistent with the finding that rising temperatures act to decrease streamflow in this study area milly and dunne 2020 streamflow decreases arising from increased temperatures have been attributed to earlier onset and increased magnitude of evapotranspiration mankin et al 2019 milly and dunne 2020 decreased proportion of wintertime precipitation that falls as snow scalzitti et al 2016 and decreased albedo in upper elevation catchments painter et al 2010 increased proportions of rain at mid elevations during the cold season may translate into decreased springtime snowpack and an earlier streamflow center timing hidalgo et al 2009 likewise decreased snow albedo from dust events contributes to earlier more rapid melt and reduced springtime runoff such changes to timing of precipitation and evapotranspiration and precipitation phase contribute to lower overall streamflow during the year due to decreased contributions of snowmelt to groundwater and therefore groundwater discharge as baseflow and evapotranspiration starting earlier in the season painter et al 2010 masbruch et al 2016 although snow variables were considered during sw sparrow model calibration they were not found to be significant at the regional scale and were therefore not retained in the model wise et al 2019 because our sparrow modeling results bypass explicitly modeling snow cover and thus these important processes our results may represent a conservative estimate of future water availability in upper elevation catchments however the impact of seasonal snow on an annual model over a thirty year time period is unknown the magnitudes and spatial structure of the climate variables p et a et p and t shown by model and water resource region in figs s3 and s4 differ among models during the three multidecadal time intervals and two rcps spatial variability in these variables may arise due to differences in each climate model s representation of thermodynamic and dynamic climate changes and is responsible for the spatial variation in streamflow projections observed in study results for example miroc esm most hot average wet future and ipsl cm5a mr hotter drier future both exhibit east west variation in climate variables figs s3 and s4 and streamflow responses fig 3 in general the climate models project pervasive increases in temperature as a thermodynamic climate response to increased greenhouse gas concentrations precipitation changes are also characterized by a thermodynamic climatic response where warmer temperatures allow for higher atmospheric specific humidity and thus increases in precipitation held and soden 2006 however future precipitation patterns including timing and intensity also depend on the patterns of dynamic climate change which are more difficult to predict pfahl et al 2017 thus changes to spatial patterns of precipitation vary among models depending on how they represent dynamic climatic change precipitation phase varies seasonally and both solstitial seasons boreal winter and summer are sensitive to different dynamic changes winter precipitation is typically delivered via frontal systems associated with the mid latitude jet stream marvel and bonfils 2013 have detected poleward shifts in the position of the mid latitude stormtrack and lau and kim 2015 suggest northward shifts of the mid latitude jet stream following hadley cell expansion this change would contribute to a drier southwest during winter summer precipitation arises from the north american monsoon in parts of the southwest and as convective precipitation in other parts of the region in both cases precipitation relies on continentally sourced water vapor primarily from plant transpiration jasechko et al 2013 increases in plant water use efficiency will decrease evapotranspiration fluxes jung et al 2010 keenan et al 2013 frank et al 2015 contributing to higher streamflow in some regions but potentially lower streamflow in places where evapotranspired water vapor supplies precipitation however longer growing seasons may contribute to more total annual evapotranspiration even at lower evapotranspiration rates and thus overall decreases in streamflow mankin et al 2019 it is unclear whether these seasonal dynamic changes will work together to decrease streamflow or if decreases in evapotranspiration flux will buffer against changes to wintertime precipitation in the future a temporally dynamic streamflow model and hierarchical bayesian techniques could be used to explicitly incorporate the strong seasonality of the region including snow processes into the model alexander et al 2019 streamflow changes are comparable to findings of prior studies on the colorado river and rio grande projected streamflow changes at the colorado river at lees ferry by mid 21st century 2050s for all models and rcps increases between 2 and 22 and decreases between 2 and 44 are similar to changes in other studies synthesized in lukas and payton 2020 of declines up to 40 and mid range changes generally between 10 and 20 our 2050s multimodel mean streamflow projections at the colorado river below hoover dam and san juan river near bluff are also comparable to or smaller than ensemble mean changes in mean annual flows reported for 2041 2070 by u s bureau of reclamation u s bureau of reclamation 2012b llewellyn et al 2013 report streamflow decreases of 50 on the rio grande near lobatos by the end of the 21st century this is close to the largest decline projected by one climate model in our study although most other climate models project declines closer to 20 fig 7 4 1 the human component our results indicate a range in streamflow response to a suite of climate futures fig 5 we do not provide guidance about the likelihood of a particular streamflow outcome but emphasize that our results indicate that the greatest streamflow declines arises under the higher greenhouse gas concentration pathway and at higher elevations figs 3 4 and 7 tables s1 and s2 this result underscores the sensitivity of streamflow to greenhouse gas concentrations via changes to the climate system and highlights the importance of national and global emission reduction policies and actions in protecting future water resources there are also opportunities to influence surface water availability by influencing water demand although the sw sparrow projected streamflows presented here do not account for future changes to water demand we know that at the current water use rates water demand outpaces water availability in many areas u s bureau of reclamation 2012a u s bureau of reclamation 2016a this imbalance drives declines in surface water levels like the levels of great salt lake in utah wurtsbaugh et al 2017 in the coming century we expect further increases in water demand due to population increases and associated changes in land and water use even absent the decreases in streamflow projected by this study and others we expect that the anticipated human and environmental changes will stretch already limited water resources and the combined effect of climate driven streamflow decreases and increased water demand could lead to desiccation of surface water levels across the southwestern us in this section we evaluate this risk in two ways the first is by increasing the water use that s already included in the sw sparrow model by 50 and comparing it to the projected streamflows for the 2080s the second is by comparing water use projections from u s bureau of reclamation 2012c for the colorado river basin for 2060 to the streamflows projected for the 2050s 4 1 1 increasing sw sparrow model water use to better understand the water availability risks posed by the combination of changing climate and increased water use we assume all stream removals for irrigation and municipal water supply which are based on current rates of use increase by half 50 increase in withdrawals by the 2080s and compare these removals to accumulated streamflow under rcp8 5 fig 8 the 50 increase is simply a hypothetical example to show the sensitivity of streamflow to changes in both climate and water withdrawls the 50 increase in withdrawals may be reasonable for providing context given that between 1950 and 1980 water withdrawls across california nevada utah arizona and new mexico increased by over 50 from approximately 5000 million m3 to approximately 8000 million m3 macdonald 2010 the results of this model specific experiment are captured by a cumulative distribution function which indicates that the combination of climate change and increased water demand typically reduces accumulated streamflow e g between 80 and 100 of reaches indicate streamflows of 90 or less of historical levels although between 3 and 12 of reaches indicate increases in flow bin 1 due to climate driven wetting depending on the model between 33 and 86 of reaches project streamflow levels less than 50 of historical and between 14 and 70 of stream reaches are expected to dwindle to levels less than 25 of their historical streamflow in the most extreme cases our analysis suggests between 5 and 59 of reaches supplying water will be overdrawn under this scenario bin 5 in this case these reaches would be fully dry and incapable of fulfilling human and environmental water use needs as we have noted the problems are not projected to be as severe under rcp4 5 fig s6 under rcp4 5 in the 2080s 0 to 27 of reaches are projected to be overdrawn bin 5 of historical flow and between 0 and 38 of reaches are projected to be at least 95 of historical streamflow 4 1 2 comparisons with colorado river demand projections a few models project moderate to large streamflow increases during the 2050s in the upper and lower colorado river basins the possibility of streamflow increases is of interest to water managers concerned with meeting future water demand to investigate the balance of future water supply and demand we compared our streamflow results to estimates of water demand in 2060 total colorado river basin upper and lower colorado river basins combined demand is expected to increase by between 1 1 and 6 4 km3 yr 1 by 2060 table c 4 u s bureau of reclamation 2012c among all climate models and all scenarios for the 2050s only one model mri cgcm3 warmer wetter future under one scenario rcp8 5 can meet the upper end of that demand projecting total colorado river basin streamflow increases of 7 1 km3 yr 1 four other model rcp combinations gfdl cm3 hotter wetter future and inmcm4 hottest average wet future under rcp4 5 and giss e2 r least warm average wet future under both rcps project streamflows that could meet water demands at the lower end of the projections 1 6 to 4 5 km3 yr 1 our results suggest that while there is a chance that future streamflow increases could meet rising water demand the majority of models and scenarios suggest that substantial water stresses are likely by 2060 this is consistent with the findings of milly and dunne 2020 suggesting that potential future precipitation increases will be insufficient to offset thermodynamically induced aridification and water shortages in the region furthermore we note that no models under either scenario project 2080s streamflow increases large enough to meet the projected 2060 demands in the likely event that water demand continues to rise with population growth beyond 2060 it is highly unlikely that colorado river basin streamflows will be sufficient to meet colorado river basin water demand further colorado river basin demand varies spatially most of the water supply for the colorado river basin is produced in mountainous sub basins of the upper colorado river basin yet there is greater current demand and larger projected increases in demand in the lower colorado river basin compared to the upper colorado river basin by 2060 the bureau of reclamation table c 11 u s bureau of reclamation 2012c projects water demand increases of 0 6 to 1 9 km3 yr 1 for the upper colorado river basin six models under one or both rcps suggest that the upper colorado river basin may be able to partially or completely meet these increased demands with projected streamflow increases however even in the case of streamflow increases in the upper colorado river basin there will be reduced streamflow to be routed to the lower colorado river basin this presents issues for the lower colorado river basin because based on our projections water demand in the lower colorado river basin in 2060 of 1 5 to 3 1 km3 yr 1 table c 11 u s bureau of reclamation 2012c can only be met by one model mri cgcm3 warmer wetter future under one scenario rcp8 5 this suggests that the greatest water stresses will affect the lower colorado river basin possibly exacerbating inter state and international disputes over water allocations including difficulty reaching compliance with the mexican water treaty of 1944 1 85 km3yr 1 and water insecurity for many water users 5 conclusions this study used the sw sparrow streamflow model calibrated with historical data and forced with future climate data from two representative concentration pathways rcp to project streamflow for catchments across the southwestern u s results of this study indicate widespread changes in streamflow in the coming century with substantial inter model variability in the response although we project some increases in streamflow particularly for the 2030s and more often for the westernmost water resource regions streamflow decreases over the study period in most water resource regions and subbasins increases may be related to specific general circulation models gcm and their sensitivity and response to greenhouse gas changes and we note that increases generally decline with time and may be insufficient to meet growing water demand in the region some models indicate subbasin specific streamflow losses of between 50 and 100 by the 2080s under rcp8 5 these losses are greatest in high elevation subbasins which are sensitive to temperature evapotranspiration precipitation and albedo changes that have historically been key water supply sources and have an outsized effect on the entire downstream watershed decreases in streamflow in key areas for interstate and international water sharing agreements show potential declines up to 62 putting agreement compliance at risk we caution that these study results are conservative in that they do not consider other feedback processes including changes to mountain snowpack future land use changes or increases in plant water use efficiency study results also do not consider any changes to water use or management although use is projected to increase and will exacerbate existing water availability issues future streamflow projections vary by gcm although our goal was to bracket potential streamflow change characterizing the probability of future climate would improve streamflow projections advancements to gcm projections and assessment of their skill at representing regional climate may help with this harding et al 2012 although much of the future of climate change and water use when considering the balance between supply and demand depends more fundamentally on human activities and choices our results would support a more detailed comparison to more sophisticated water demand projections our results suggest a dependence of future streamflow on greenhouse gas concentrations where model projections forced with rcp4 5 suggest less intermodel variability and higher streamflows at the end of the 21st century compared to rcp8 5 our results underscore that greenhouse gas emissions reduction and moderating or decreasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations may be critical to maintaining sufficient streamflow volumes to satisfy current and future water use while also complying with interstate and international water allocation agreements credit authorship

8577,society and the environment in the arid southwestern united states depend on reliable water availability yet current water use outpaces supply water demand is projected to grow in the future and climate change is expected to reduce supply to adapt water managers need robust estimates of future regional water supply to support management decisions to address this need we estimate future streamflow in seven water resource regions in the southwestern u s using a new spatially referenced regressions on watershed attributes sparrow streamflow model we present streamflow projections corresponding to input data from seven climate models and two greenhouse gas representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and 8 5 for three thirty year intervals centered on the 2030s 2050s and 2080s and for a historical thirty year interval centered on the 1990s across water resource regions about half of the rcp4 5 models 51 and two thirds of the rcp8 5 models 67 indicate decreases in streamflow in the 2080s relative to the historical period models project maximum decreases in streamflow of 36 80 in all water resource regions for all periods and rcps relative to historical streamflow and maximum streamflow decreases of up to 20 45 in the 2080s at sites along the colorado river used for measuring compliance with interstate and international water agreements headwaters are projected to experience the greatest declines with substantial downstream implications among these estimates the streamflows from models forced with rcp8 5 tend to be lower than those forced with rcp4 5 not all climate models times and rcps project widespread streamflow declines the most ubiquitous streamflow increases are projected to occur in the 2030s under rcp4 5 later time periods and enhanced greenhouse gas forcings indicate smaller regions of streamflow increase and lower accumulated streamflows suggesting that limiting or reducing greenhouse gas concentrations could support future water availability although some possible streamflow increases are promising the modest and spatially limited increases in streamflow projected for later time periods are still unlikely to be sufficient to meet the projected water demand these results inform the likelihood of future water agreement compliance and support developing strategies to balance water supply and demand keywords climate change impacts streamflow water supply and demand 1 introduction water resources in the southwestern united states are experiencing high demand to support anthropogenic uses and are some of the most highly regulated globally particularly in the colorado river basin u s bureau of reclamation 2000 christensen et al 2004 rister et al 2011 u s bureau of reclamation 2016a yet sustainable supplies of drinking water and water for agriculture hydroelectric power generation recreation and ecosystem uses depend on adequate water resource availability water shortages currently occur throughout the southwestern united states with demand likely to increase following population growth at the same time future climate change is projected to contribute to decreases in water supply milly et al 2005 mankin et al 2019 milly and dunne 2020 future surface water availability depends on the integration of complex climatic factors including temperature precipitation amount phase and timing integrated through land surface processes like infiltration and plant transpiration milly et al 2005 climate models project temperature increases and changes to precipitation patterns and amounts held and soden 2006 marvel and bonfils 2013 globally in the coming century drought which has been exacerbated by anthropogenic warming diffenbaugh et al 2015 williams et al 2020 amplifies the impacts of widespread shortages concern about the combined effects of increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation has led to great concerns about the long term reliability of colorado river basin water supplies lukas and payton 2020 these same concerns apply to other basins in the region because of the state and national concern about reduced water supply in the region water managers like the bureau of reclamation are asking whether water management planning should incorporate the possibility of a hotter drier and more variable future llewellyn et al 2013 understanding the effect of climatic changes on streamflow supports effective water management practices especially in vulnerable arid and mountainous regions where snowmelt fed rivers supply a substantial portion of water to low elevation downstream areas xiao et al 2018 water shortages will affect water users and shortfalls in water supply have interstate and international ramifications for water sharing agreements for example the mexican water treaty of 1944 allocates 1 85 km3yr 1 of colorado river annual discharge about 9 of total flow to mexico annually u s mexico 1944 substantial declines in colorado river streamflow would affect the ability of the u s to provide mexico s water allocation furthermore decreases in colorado river streamflow would affect hydropower generation and the economies and natural resources of 40 million people in the united states including 22 federally designated native american tribes james et al 2014 spurred by concern about streamflow declines and low levels in lake powell and lake mead state and federal agencies passed the 2019 colorado river basin drought contingency plan authorization act colorado river drought contingency plan authorization act 2019 prior efforts to estimate impacts of future climate change on runoff or streamflow in the southwest region have commonly used bias corrected statistically downscaled general circulation model gcm projections of future climate to drive hydrologic models to produce future projections of runoff or streamflow christensen et al 2004 wurbs et al 2005 christensen and lettenmaier 2007 u s bureau of reclamation 2012a harding et al 2012 llewellyn et al 2013 bureau of reclamation 2013 u s bureau of reclamation 2016b mote et al 2019 lehner et al 2019 many previous studies of the impacts of future climate change on runoff or streamflow in the region use process based hydrologic models including the monthly water balance model variable infiltration capacity macroscale hydrologic model and soil and water assessment tool wurbs et al

u s bureau of reclamation 2016b u s bureau of reclamation 2016a other approaches to evaluate the effects of climate change on water resources in the region include using gcm or regional climate model output directly applying generalized gcm temperature change to hydrologic models or estimating runoff sensitivity to temperature change milly et al 2005 seager et al 2007 mccabe and wolock 2007 seager et al 2013 udall and overpeck 2017 milly and dunne 2020 recently researchers have begun to apply statistical approaches including artificial intelligence or machine learning techniques to a range of hydrologic problems sun and scanlon 2019 lange and sippel 2020 bellos and carbajal 2020 shen et al 2020 although these studies have generally not focused on the effects of climate change on future streamflow in the southwestern u s steep computational costs and parameterization difficulties remain challenges for large scale deterministic process based approaches while purely statistical models can suffer from a loss of process understanding that is useful for applied water management the spatially referenced regressions on watershed attributes sparrow streamflow modeling framework used in this study blends statistical and process based approaches to modeling streamflow this approach provides improved model interpretability prediction accuracy and reduced computational cost over deterministic and statistical models alexander et al 2019 specifically sparrow models use nonlinear least squares regression nlls constrained by mass balance to determine the spatial relationships between streamflow and water sources transport and loss both within the stream channel and on land under long term conditions and provides estimates of streamflow in ungaged locations the sparrow model provides estimates of streamflow in unmeasured locations via identification of statistical relationships between streamflow and watershed characteristics as well as routing of streamflow through the stream network sparrow models which are calibrated for specific regions have been widely used in the southwest kenney et al 2009 miller et al 2016 miller et al 2017 the united states alexander et al 2008 preston et al 2011 ator 2019 hoos and roland 2019 robertson and saad 2019 wise 2019 and internationally alexander et al 2002 elliott et al 2005 duan et al 2015 benoy et al 2016 robertson et al 2019 miller et al 2020 to address the critical impacts water shortages have on people the economy and natural systems and provide information to water managers about future water supply our study brackets future streamflow across the southwest using future climate projections derived from gcm runs conducted under the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 as inputs to a new calibrated sparrow streamflow model wise et al 2019 for the southwestern u s in comparison to many previous studies of basins within the region that used coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 datasets miller et al 2011 llewellyn et al 2013 markstrom et al 2012 u s bureau of reclamation 2012a vano et al 2014 cmip5 datasets include more advanced models often at higher spatial resolution and representative concentration pathways replace the emissions scenarios used in cmip3 nakicenovic and swart 2000 meinshausen et al 2011 taylor et al 2012 the sparrow model uses a fully connected streamflow network that accounts for diversions inflows storage and other human management of the water resources incorporation of such human management is important in the southwestern u s where alterations to the natural stream system are common our approach is also particularly well suited for the southwestern u s because we use variable catchment scales 0 0009 65 014 km2 and fine scale climate data approximately 800 km2 which support improved representation of mountainous terrain a common challenge for climate studies of the region the choice to model streamflow across the entirety of the southwest means that we can provide information for both the critically important colorado river basin as well as areas that have been less heavily studied but that are likely to experience warming drying and water stress in the coming century seager and vecchi 2010 while most other modeling approaches to understand the impacts of climate change on water resources in the region are either global arnell 1999 milly et al 2005 nohara et al 2006 seager et al 2007 national caldwell et al 2012 or smaller basin scale assessments christensen et al 2004 christensen and lettenmaier 2007 mccabe and wolock 2007 barnett and pierce 2009 u s bureau of reclamation 2012a harding et al 2012 vano et al 2014 vano and lettenmaier 2014 elias et al 2015 u s bureau of reclamation 2011 u s bureau of reclamation 2016a udall and overpeck 2017 lehner et al 2019 the sparrow model used here can provide streamflow estimates at a sub continental regional scale a regional scale model is useful because it incorporates area specific characteristics that improve model prediction that can be lost in larger scale models while providing regionally consistent results beyond the basin scale this is particularly important when water resources are regulated on a regional basis and basins cross important boundaries for water management such as state or international boundaries as is the case in the southwestern region there is a need for future water availability estimates at a range of spatial scales u s bureau of reclamation 2011 texas water development board 2017 lukas and payton 2020 to address this concern we provide results across a range of spatial scales including catchment to water resources region our results are presented both as total accumulated streamflow as is commonly reported and as the incremental catchment yield that is delivered to the stream network outlet including the us mexico border the gulf of mexico or internal drainage within closed basins at stream reach to water resource region scales the incremental delivered yield which represents the streamflow generated within a catchment normalized to the catchment area highlights the spatial structure of streamflow change and supports understanding how changes propagate throughout the stream network that is not always clear from total streamflow alone 2 methods 2 1 site description the southwestern region of the united states spans 2 100 000 km2 across humid to arid climate patterns and comprises seven water resources regions the pacific northwest great basin california upper colorado lower colorado rio grande and texas gulf regions fig 1 the region is characterized by diverse ecoregions hydroclimatic regimes elevation gradients and water availability elevation ranges from 86 m below sea level to mountain peaks over 4400 m the regional climate is variable and is influenced by the region s rugged topography and proximity to the pacific ocean gulf of california and gulf of mexico as well as the mid latitude storm track and the north american monsoon garfin et al 2013 storms originating over the pacific ocean and gulf of mexico generate much of the cool season precipitation while the north american monsoon delivers warm season precipitation to the region particularly in new mexico and arizona garfin et al 2013 runkle et al 2017 observed twentieth century warming is expected to continue through the coming century while projections of future precipitation are move variable garfin et al 2013 u s bureau of reclamation 2011 lukas and payton 2020 much of the region is subject to drought williams et al 2020 which is expected to increase in the future with substantial impacts on water resources cayan et al 2010 woodhouse et al 2010 cook et al 2015 although precipitation is a primary control on runoff mccabe and wolock 2011 there is a growing understanding of the important role temperature via evaporation and plant transpiration plays in regulating streamflow in the region woodhouse et al 2016 udall and overpeck 2017 milly and dunne 2020 streamflow in all water resource regions besides the texas gulf relies primarily on seasonal snowpack for example snowpack in the rocky mountains and san juan mountains is the primary water supply for the colorado river and rio grande respectively rango 2006 wise et al 2019 mccabe and wolock 2020 lukas and payton 2020 in contrast precipitation in the texas gulf region is greater during warm months and a very small proportion of total annual precipitation falls as snow texas water development board 2012 the rio grande and rivers in the texas gulf flow to the gulf of mexico wise et al 2019 in the absence of human water use and management the colorado river flows to the gulf of california witze 2014 throughout this study the colorado river refers to the river that originates in colorado wyoming and utah and flows to the gulf of california not the colorado river that drains central texas to the gulf of mexico because of heavy water use and reservoir operations the colorado river is sometimes dry before reaching the river outlet in the gulf of california witze 2014 similarly the great salt lake in the great basin has shrunk in recent decades wurtsbaugh et al 2017 exposing fine playa sediments and disrupting ecosystem and industrial uses in closed basins like the great basin pacific northwest and california water resources regions streams do not reach the ocean wise et al 2019 instead rivers flow into terminal lakes many of which are saline e g great salt lake salton sea and streams recharge aquifers the rivers in these water resource regions are crucial for agricultural municipal industrial recreational and ecological water uses for example the colorado river supplies water to irrigate 55 million acres of land which produces 15 of the nation s crops u s bureau of reclamation 2012a colorado river water is used by nearly 40 million people for municipal use and its flow generates 4 200 megawatts of hydroelectric power u s bureau of reclamation 2012a likewise the rio grande provides municipal water to 6 million people irrigates 2 million acres of land in the u s and mexico and generates 15 megawatts of hydroelectric power llewellyn et al 2013 u s bureau of reclamation 2016a much of the streamflow in the great basin is allocated to agriculture though the streams also provide municipal water to 3 2 million people u s bureau of reclamation 2016a the great salt lake in the great basin serves as a critical stopover for migratory birds is responsible for a third of the global brine shrimp trade and is a major producer of magnesium water in the region is heavily managed and regulated the seven basins all have reservoirs and diversions constructed along streams to manage water supply and have varied water use allocations including inter state and international water sharing agreements surface water in most western states is governed by the doctrine of prior appropriation the compacts laws judicial decisions and regulatory guidelines that apportion and regulate colorado river water among the seven colorado river basin states and mexico is collectively known as the law of the river sax and abrams 2006 u s bureau of reclamation 2008 both the colorado river and rio grande are managed in compliance with international treaties for delivery of water of acceptable quality and quantity to mexico u s mexico 1944 mexico 1973 as well as inter state agreements 2 2 climate data description the spatially referenced regressions on watershed attributes

aeronautics and space administration nasa earth exchange nex downscaled climate projections nex dcp30 thrasher et al 2013 2013 at approximately 800 m2 spatial resolution 30 arc seconds this data set was selected because it provides bias corrected climate change projections at a resolution high enough to evaluate impacts on processes that are sensitive to small scale climate gradients and the effects of local topography thrasher et al 2013 both of which are important in the southwest u s thrasher et al 2013 provide full details on the development of the nex dcp30 data set which can be visualized at the national climate change viewer https www2 usgs gov landresources lcs nccv asp the nex dcp30 data set applies the bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd downscaling method to gcm data derived from the cmip5 taylor et al 2012 the prism daly et al 2008 observational data set is used to bias correct the gcm output thrasher et al 2013 spatial disaggregation improves the representation of climate on a regional scale and translates the variable coarser resolution between 1 and 3 where latitude and longitude differ gcm data to the common high resolution 800 m2 prism grid the bcsd downscaling method uses quantile mapping to bias correct and translate coarse resolution changes from the gcms to the higher resolution grid quantile mapping has known short comings such as a tendency to alter future trends in the gcm time series under represent extreme events and produce frequency dependent model biases theme√ül et al 2011 maraun 2013 pierce et al 2013 alder and hostetler 2019 found the nex dcp30 data set exaggerates future projections of cold season precipitation in the upper colorado river basin relative to the original gcm simulations a wettening phenomena where bias corrected and downscaled bcsd data projected larger increases in precipitation than the corresponding gcm has also been identified lukas et al 2014 lukas and payton 2020 this effect is more pronounced in cmip5 than cmip3 data moreover all forms of statistical downscaling and bias correction rescale precipitation to match observations with no guarantee of conserving mass which can result in decoupling the thermodynamic relationship between temperature and precipitation explicit in the physics of the gcm although shortcomings of bcsd have been identified alder and hostetler 2019 the nex dcp30 data set is the highest spatial resolution downscaled data set we identified high spatial resolution is important given the high resolution of catchments in this study further prism incorporates a spatially and temporally varying lapse rate to account for topographic and geographic effects on climate variables which is important in the southwest given the region s rugged topography and expansive geographical area we used future climate data from a single model experiment ensemble member the first realization r1i1p1 using two representative concentration pathways rcps meinshausen et al 2011 we selected rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 to evaluate the effect on streamflow of two potential greenhouse gas concentration not emissions trajectories resulting in different radiative forcings at 2100 from eachother and from current radiative forcing rcp4 5 represents a scenario where greenhouse gas concentrations peak in the year 2040 then decline resulting in a radiative forcing of 4 5 w m 2 at 2100 whereas rcp8 5 represents a scenario where greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise at an aggressive rate throughout the 21st century resulting in a radiative forcing of 8 5 w m 2 at 2100 in this way rcp4 5 represents the effects of greenhouse gas emissions reductions wheras rcp8 5 represents continued increasing emissions though there have been recent criticisms of rcp8 5 suggesting that it does not represent a likely outcome hausfather and peters 2020 we include rcp8 5 in order to investigate lower probability high risk potential outcomes to estimate actual evapotranspiration et a we employed output data from the physically based computationally efficient monthly water balance model mwbm wolock and mccabe 1999 hostetler and alder 2016 the mwbm apportions water into snowpack evapotranspiration soil water and runoff using parameterizations and rules based on measurement and reanalysis data and has been shown to estimate et a adequately hostetler and alder 2016 the mwbm uses precipitation p from the nex dcp30 data set mwbm calculated available soil moisture dependent on soil type and potential evapotranspiration et p to estimate the actual evapotranspiration et a across the study region potential evapotranspiration et p is calculated from temperature t from the nex dcp30 data set using a method which has been observed to perform well in arid semi arid and temperate climates oudin et al 2005 the mwbm is used to provide sparrow a reasonable range of future changes in annual actual evapotranspiration at the climatological scale on the same 800 m prism grid however these projections are subject to uncertainties along the modeling chain clark et al 2016 where there are often substantial differences among hydrology models in their projections mizukami et al 2016 there is additional projection uncertainty in the choice of et p calculations milly and dunne 2017 which is often limited to temperature based methods due to the general lack of statistically downscaled and bias corrected energy variables needed for more complex et p formulations 2 3 climate data processing we calculated the multidecadal annual average temperature t c precipitation p mm yr 1 potential evapotranspiration et p mm yr 1 and actual evapotranspiration et a mm yr 1 using the iris package in python we first calculated the annual average values from the monthly values then used these annual average gridded timeseries to calculate multidecadal average values for one historical time period 1975 2005 and three future 30 year intervals 2020 2049 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the choice of historical period reflects the cmip5 experimental approach where all historical simulations end in 2005 and the future projection experiments begin in 2006 for all time intervals we note that the multidecadal period averages do not explicitly address seasonality of climate variables which are important aspects of the water supply particularly in snowmelt dominated watersheds we used the gridded multidecadal average values and the approximately 400 000 national hydrography dataset plus version 2 1 catchments brakebill et al 2020 to calculate catchment average values for t p et a and et p for both rcps and all time periods for input into the sparrow model we upsampled the gridded climate data from a resolution of approximately 800 m2 to a resolution of 65 m2 using a nearest neighbor interpolation scheme the nearest neighbor was chosen over a smoothing interpolation scheme to preserve the granularity of climate information available from the original datasets we calculated the catchment average climate data values using the function zonal stats from the python module rasterstats less than 1 of all catchments were too small to contain any raster grid cells at a resolution of 65 m2 for these few cases we assigned the value of the raster cell with the centroid closest to the catchment centroid nearest neighbor 2 4 climate model selection we selected a representative subset of seven climate models models and details listed in table 1 and fig s1 from the 30 nex dcp30 models thrasher et al 2013 understanding both expected average conditions and potential extreme outcomes is important for adaptive planning elias et al 2018 further model weighting or screening methods remain uncertain harding et al 2012 and the effects on the distribution of future climate changes may be limited lukas and payton 2020 therefore we focus on bracketing the expected range of future streamflow in order to help water managers understand the range of changes they may expect and need to plan for six of the climate models were selected to maximize the difference between the average t and p in the rcp8 5 2070 2099 scenario and a historical 1950 2005 time period over the gridded data domain between 24 06 n and 46 30 n and between 92 5 and 122 45 e and the seventh climate model was selected to represent a central tendency t and p difference between the rcp8 5 2070 2099 scenario and the historical 1950 2005 time period we chose the rcp8 5 2070 2099 scenario for model selection because it likely represents the most extreme changes of any of the future climate scenarios relative to the historical interval additionally for comparability with previous studies we chose climate models whose prior versions were used in a study on current and future water supply and demand in the colorado river basins by the u s bureau of reclamation 2012a although models representing reduced changes in temperature and precipitation are available we did not expect them to support understanding the range of future streamflow changes as well at the models representing the greatest changes predictions made with a nonlinear model using forcing data outside the calibration range may produce unreliable results the southwest sw sparrow model was calibrated using climate data for the 2000 2014 period see section 2 5 sw sparrow model for additional details regarding model calibration we ensured that the values of t and p for all scenarios were close to the range of t and p values used to calibrate the sparrow model for the calibration time period for p et a and et p nearly 99 of stream reaches across all time periods and models had values within the calibration minimum and maximum values with fewer than 5 of reaches exceeding the maximum variable value however an average of 23 of reaches exceeded the maximum calibration temperature of 25 2 c on average reaches exceeded the maximum temperature by 9 2 27 c and exceedances were more likely in the 2080s under the rcp8 5 scenario however the temperature exceedances may have little influence on the model results because temperature was multiplied by 10 and log transformed before it was used in the model to eliminate negative numbers and reduce the effects of very low temperatures following methods in wise et al 2019 and to approximate normal distributions schwarz et al 2006 this compresses the differences between higher temperatures for example the difference between the model calibration maximum log 10 t value and the future climate maximum log 10 t value is 0 16 representing at most a 3 6 exceedance of the maximum log 10 t calibration value of 2 40 nonetheless results in areas where future temperatures exceeded model calibration temperatures should be used with caution 2 5 sw sparrow model we used sparrow to model streamflow because it is a hybrid statistical and process based model that estimates water loads streamflow in this study in streams by regressing measurement data e g stream gage monitoring data against watershed characteristics e g climate soil type land use and water sources e g runoff springs the model uses nlls regression with mass balance constraints to characterize the spatial relationship between observed streamflow and 1 sources of water to streams 2 controls on delivery of water to streams and 3 within stream removals in a watershed under long term conditions fig 2 the model uses a fully connected stream network to integrate both catchment conditions and upstream loads to produce spatially explicit streamflow estimates at all stream reaches within a network schwarz et al 2006 the sw sparrow streamflow model used here was calibrated to estimate streamflow for the seven water resource regions shown in fig 1 though wise et al 2019 detail the complete model calibration methods we provide a short summary here for context the model was developed and calibrated to hydrologic conditions of 2012 using long term 2000 2014 mean annual streamflow measurements from monitoring sites and a wide range of data representing watershed characteristics including prism and mwbm climate data processed to nhdplus version 2 1 catchments wieczorek et al 2018 wise et al 2019 a range of different watershed characteristics representing hydrologic topographic geologic climatic including snow and land use and cover characteristics were tested for inclusion in the sw sparrow streamflow model nonlinear least squares methods were used to estimate coefficient values for each of the water sources water delivery terms and within stream removal terms the final coefficient values estimated using nlls methods ensure the most accurate fit of the model to the stream monitoring observations by minimizing average differences between the simulated and observed predictions of the mean annual streamflow at monitoring sites only significant variables were retained in the model and the model was generally successful at matching mean annual streamflow measured at 867 gages throughout the region wise et al 2019 the model explained approximately 89 of the variability in measured water yield wise et al 2019 no significant spatial correlations were identified in model residuals determined as the difference between the log of measured streamflow at calibration sites and the log of predicted accumulated streamflow wise et al 2019 model estimated coefficients were then used within the stream routing constraints to predict long term mean annual streamflow throughout the region in the calibrated streamflow model used in this study four variables represent sources of water to streams runoff p et a municipal wastewater treatment plant discharges spring discharges and inflows inflows include streamflow entering the model domain from mexico inter basin transfers and return flows from irrigated lands which primarily contribute to streamflow in the gila river and lower colorado river subregions of the lower colorado water resources region and the imperial valley subregion of the california water resources region five variables represent conditions that influence the transport of water to streams air temperature t impervious surface area precipitation intensity mean distance to a flowline within a catchment and soil clay content four variables represent streamflow removal processes loss from intermittent streams evapotranspiration and streambed infiltration irrigation withdrawals municipal water supply withdrawals and evaporative loss from impoundments these explanatory variables e g spring discharge soil clay content impervious surface coverage come from national and regional data products while all of the sw sparrow variables e g impervious surface soil clay content vary among reaches only variables that depend on future climate projections vary among the sw sparrow modeling results presented here these variables include runoff air temperature precipitation intensity and evaporative loss from impoundments we calculated runoff from the difference between precipitation and actual evapotranspiration p et a we estimated precipitation intensity by dividing the multidecadal annual average precipitation amount p by the average number of precipitation days in a year from 1961 1990 data wieczorek et al 2018 2018 and applying a log transformation however the actual number of wet days per year may be expected to change with future climate change representing a source of uncertainty in the model finally evaporation from impoundments was calculated as the product of the impoundment wet area and the potential evapotranspiration et p the impoundment wet area does not vary with time representing another source of uncertainty in the model we ran the sw sparrow streamflow model using the calibrated model coefficients wise et al 2019 and future p t et a and et p projections from each of the seven climate models for a 30 year historical time period 1975 2005 as well as the three thirty year projected climate time periods of 2020 2049 2030s 2040 2069 2050s and 2070 2099 2080s under two greenhouse gas concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this interval length results in a ten year overlap for the first two projection periods so we expect more similarity between the 2030s and 2050s streamflows than between the 2050s and 2080s streamflows because sparrow quantifies the long term effects of watershed processes on streamflow and is calibrated with long term average data it is appropriate to project future streamflow over long term average conditions a thirty year interval length of traditional climate normal is long enough to avoid issues of shorter or multidecadal timescale variability e g el ni√±o southern oscillation or pacific decadal oscillation but short enough to detect change over the 21st century each of the seven climate models contains process based biases so we present future climate streamflow projection results as streamflow anomalies relative to the climate model specific historical period the sw sparrow model is a simple empirical watershed modeling tool that quantifies the long term effects of watershed processes on streamflow but does not incorporate watershed processes that occur on shorter less than annual time scales that dynamic mechanistic models can quantify although dynamic mechanistic models quantify fine scale temporally dynamic processes sparrow supports development of large scale regional models constrained by mass balance at the large spatial scale applied in this study where dynamic mechanistic models may be hampered by extensive data and infrastructure needs or subject to overparameterizations that impede process understanding and contribute to large uncertainties in predictions at ungaged locations alexander et al 2019 the sparrow approach is useful in this study we assume that the relationships between explanatory variables and streamflow remain constant over time although this may not be accurate the relative importance and sign of each variable coefficient generally aligns with the conceptual model of streamflow generation in the region wise et al 2019 and so even if the absolute values of coefficients change the relative relationships are retained in the results we discuss sw sparrow projections in terms of total streamflow and delivered incremental yields incremental values refer to the amount of water generated within each catchment whereas total or accumulated values refer to the total water in a reach resulting from both incremental and upstream water contributions streamflow refers to the volume of water moving through the stream per unit time e g km3 yr 1 whereas yield refers to the catchment area normalized streamflow e g mm yr 1 the delivered incremental yield refers to the area normalized streamflow that makes it from a catchment to the stream network outlet this outlet may be the us mx border gulf of mexico or an internal endpoint in the case of endorreic water resource regions like the great basin among these ways of presenting the results accumulated streamflow is the most intuitive as it is an estimate of the actual absolute streamflow for a river or stream in a particular location however incremental delivered yields are useful for understanding the spatial structure of streamflow change in lower order streams and thus the climatic processes that integrate through the stream network to produce changes in higher order reaches 3 results the goals of this study are to bracket the range of future streamflow change due to climate change across the southwest through the 21st century under two rcps identify where and when streamflow changes may occur and evaluate how such changes might affect our ability to meet future water demand and water sharing agreements to that end our results show where when and by how much streamflows across the southwest may change in the future in response to changing climate we describe general spatial and temporal patterns of streamflow changes both by climate model and as multimodel means and compare results for both rcps we then highlight areas of the region that may experience substantial changes including high elevation headwater catchments with important implications for downstream reaches finally we show how streamflow may change at several gages of interest for interstate and international water sharing agreements we address broad questions related to water demand in the discussion the sw sparrow modeling results project overall streamflow decreases in most water resource regions boundaries delineated in fig 1 across the southwestern u s fig 3 tables s1 and s2 compared to the 1975 2005 historical time period some streamflow increases are projected as well in general most of the increases in projected accumulated streamflow occur during the 2030s whereas increases occur over a more limited spatial extent and often have smaller magnitudes during the 2080s fig 4 s2 at that time the projected multimodel mean streamflow increases occur within limited areas in the northern great basin central and southern texas and the central lower colorado river basin fig 4 the projected streamflow changes do not occur linearly and the spatial patterns of streamflow anomalies change over the study period for example the multimodel average streamflow anomaly for rcp4 5 at the subbasin scale shows nearly complete increases in streamflow across the study area in the 2030s followed by greater streamflow decreases in the eastern part of the study area during the 2050s fig s2 than during the 2080s fig 4 the non linear spatially variable response of streamflow reflects projected changes in the spatial structure and magnitude of climate variables figs s3 and s4 to changing climate while the direction of projected changes is often similar with time the magnitude of change is often greater for models forced with rcp8 5 compared to models forced with rcp4 5 in all regions models forced with rcp8 5 project larger changes during the 2080s either increases or decreases than models forced with rcp4 5 for example streamflow is projected to decline in the 2080s relative to the historical period in the upper colorado lower colorado rio grande and texas gulf water resource regions under both rcps for most models however the projected streamflow losses tend to be greater for rcp8 5 multimodel means show decreases between 7 and 20 and individual models project losses as great as 80 table s2 compared with rcp4 5 multimodel means show decreases between 1 and 8 and individual models project losses as great as 59 table s2 about half of models project accumulated streamflow decreases in the great basin and california water resource regions in the 2080s relative to the historical time period the multimodel means for these basins project a modest streamflow increase for california 2 4 with possible changes of nearly 50 table s2 and a modest decrease for the great basin 3 5 with possible increases of up to 30 or possible decreases of as much as 47 table s2 most models project streamflow increases in the pacific northwest for both rcps though the multimodel mean suggests this increase may be modest in the 2080s 3 with projected increases of up to 42 table s2 for similar time periods and water resource regions the variability among climate models is greater than the variability between rcps the multimodel mean accumulated streamflow anomaly varies spatially fig 4 reflecting projected changes in the spatial structure and magnitude of climate variables figs s3 and s4 for some subbasins this means that the direction of accumulated streamflow change is the same for both rcps during the 2080s though the magnitudes differ with rcp for example both rcps indicate accumulated streamflow losses in most subbasins of the rio grande and subbasins of the upper colorado that contain high elevation catchments as well as the eastern most subbasins of the texas gulf water resource region likewise both rcps indicate accumulated streamflow gains in subbasins of the northern great basin and the southernmost subbasins in texas in these cases the magnitude of change tends to be greater under rcp8 5 compared to rcp4 5 for example the multimodel mean projects greater declines in streamflow in subbasins in the southern rocky mountains and eastern sierra nevada for rcp8 5 compared to rcp4 5 and greater increases in the northern great basin for rcp8 5 compared to rcp4 5 the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 projections also indicate changes in the spatial distribution of streamflow gains and losses for example some subbasins in the upper colorado and numerous subbasins in the lower colorado water resource regions switch from moderate streamflow increases rcp4 5 to streamflow decreases rcp8 5 by the 2080s the projected shifts in streamflow patterns may be related to how the climate models balance the thermodynamic and dynamic hydroclimate responses to greenhouse gas forcing to first order thermodynamic changes include increased temperature which drives enhanced evapotranspiration across the landscape hostetler and alder 2016 while dynamic changes like changes to stormtracks e g marvel and bonfils 2013 will shift precipitation patterns and amounts how these two quantities interact p et a will be a primary control on streamflow due to increasing surface net radiation and rising temperatures et a is expected to increase across the study domain absent increases in water use efficiency and changes to vegetation so if p remains constant or decreases we will likely observe streamflow declines however if p increases with magnitudes larger than et a then streamflow increases will be observed both wetting and drying responses have been observed in historical data across the study domain greve et al 2014 consistent with the mixed response we observe in our results the projected accumulated streamflow anomaly at the subbasin scale fig 5 same scale as shown in fig 4 varies among models and the individual model results indicate much larger gains or losses than the multimodel mean projection fig 4 because high flow catchments within a water resource region integrate conditions from upstream catchments we observe the largest range of projected streamflows in the hydrologic units with the highest historical streamflow projections for the 2080s under rcp8 5 shown in fig 5 with the exception of some hydrologic subunits in the lower colorado rio grande and california some of these subbasins may show minimal to no change and minimal to no range among models presumably due to water management practices which remain constant across all models concentration pathways and time periods consistent with the water resource region summary the subbasin scale rcp8 5 climate model data typically project a wider range of streamflow changes compared to those from rcp4 5 fig s5 in all water resource regions at least one model projects that a majority of subbasins could experience 50 or greater losses in accumulated streamflow by the 2080 time period the losses observed at subbasins with higher historical flow fig 5 receive much of their water from the highest elevation headwater catchments wise et al 2019 so changes at high elevations have an outsized effect on streamflows in the mainstem rivers of the water resource regions major accumulated streamflow losses in subbasins containing high elevation catchments are observed in the upper colorado and rio grande for both rcps and the western region of the great basin and parts of the california water resource regions for rcp8 5 fig 4 among three of the most mountainous water resource regions we observe a strong non linear relationship between the change in delivered incremental yield and the mean reach elevation shown for the 2080s rcp8 5 in fig 6 across the three water resource regions all project less change at low elevations and the greatest changes at the highest elevations for almost all models in all water resource regions the losses are moderate 50 100 mm yr 1 to large 300 mm yr 1 decreases in delivered incremental yields relative to the historical period in the great basin water resource region some models project that mid and upper elevation reaches 2000 3000 m will see little change one model mri cgcm3 warmer wetter future suggests moderate increases in delivered incremental yield at these elevations whereas other models e g gfdl cm3 hotter wetter future and miroc esm most hot average wet future project large decreases in delivered incremental yields at these same elevations mri cgcm3 had the smallest temperature increase and high precipitation increase from the historical 1950 2005 to the 2070 2099 time period compared to other climate models in the study fig s1 assuming that a wetter and less warm future allows for greater streamflow these projected changes in temperature and precipitation may account for this finding of moderate delivered incremental yield increases associated with this gcm in the rio grande all models except giss e2 r least warm average wet future project decreases in delivered incremental yield with the greatest decreases occurring at the highest elevation reaches in the upper colorado basin all models project delivered incremental yield decreases at the highest elevation reaches 3500 m but at mid elevations two models mri cgcm3 and miroc esm project small increases in delivered incremental yields the changes projected for high elevation catchments drive the downstream changes observed in the higher order reaches of mainstem rivers the sw sparrow projections indicate changes in streamflow at reaches with gages that are important for interstate and international water sharing agreements fig 7 despite increases in precipitation and streamflow among some climate models e g miroc esm most hot average wet future and mri cgcm3 warmer wetter future the multimodel mean of streamflow tends to decrease over time at these critical sites ipsl cm5a mr the hottest driest model suggests that streamflow could decrease by between 25 and 45 at sites along the colorado river between 6 and 62 at sites on the rio grande and 58 at the san juan river near bluff in the 2080s under rcp8 5 by comparison rcp4 5 for the same model and time period projects streamflow could decrease between 12 and 22 at sites on the colorado river between 5 and 33 at sites on the rio grande and 26 at the san juan river near bluff not only are the projected streamflow declines at these critical sites lower for rcp4 5 compared to rcp8 5 in the 2080s rcp4 5 also indicates a narrower range of projected streamflows as expected for some models e g ipsl cm5a rm at colorado river sites rcp4 5 indicates increases in accumulated streamflow in the 2080s relative to the 2050s potentially corresponding to the decreased greenhouse gasses at later time periods under rcp4 5 combined these results suggest that river flows in the southwestern u s may be responsive to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and thus lower century end radiative forcing 4 discussion most sw sparrow projections at the water resource region scale suggest decreasing streamflow during the latter half of the 21st century fig 3 tables s1 and s2 for a region where surface water is experiencing high demand is heavily regulated and can be in low supply any future streamflow declines will exacerbate existing challenges to meeting water demand however our results are promising in that they suggest that efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and maintain lower greenhouse gas concentrations may have a sizeable effect on streamflow in the 2080s figs 4 and 7 and contribute to streamflows in the 2030s and 2050s that are more similar to historical values despite variability among streamflow projections based on different climate models the similarity in direction of change between projected streamflow from both rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 suggests that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions support maintaining current streamflow further declining greenhouse gas emissions in rcp4 5 in the latter part of the 21st century may correspond to the recovery of streamflow from the 2050s to 2080s most pronounced in comparing fig s2 and fig 4 especially for rcp8 5 we observe a large range in model projections at the sub basin scale fig 5 reflecting differences in projected temperature and precipitation amounts among models figs s2 and s3 the climate model that projects a wetter warm future mri cgcm3 and the climate model that indicates average precipitation and the least warming giss e2 r also project the greatest increases in streamflow across all water resource regions likewise the models that project large temperature increases alongside small precipitation increases or precipitation decreases miroc esm ipsl cm5a mr or moderate temperature change and moderate precipitation decreases inmcm4 project the greatest decreases in streamflow across most water resource regions finally models notably miroc esm most hot average wet future and ipsl cm5a mr hotter drier future project different spatial patterns of streamflow change with miroc esm indicating larger losses for the three westernmost water resource regions and ipsl cm5a mr indicating large streamflow decreases for the rocky mountains and texas though we cannot comment on which model or concentration pathway may indicate the most likely future the hotter drier models and concentration pathways provide a useful upper bound on the extent of possible future streamflow decreases and produce results consistent with current anthropogenically driven drought conditions in the southwest barnett et al 2008 which are projected to continue throughout the 21st century cayan et al 2010 woodhouse et al 2010 cook et al 2015 streamflow increases are projected for some areas although fig 5 suggests that in the 2080s the number of subbasins expected to experience streamflow declines and the magnitude of projected declines is greater than the number of subbasins expected to experience streamflow increases and the magnitude of projected increases this overall decline in streamflow is most apparent in the rio grande region moreover the projected increases often occur at downstream or internally draining parts of water resource regions fig 4 which may not offset expected decreases in major water source regions some of the increases may also be due to the wettening phenomena imparted on cmip5 data through bcsd we project the greatest losses in streamflow in upper elevation snow melt dominated headwater subbasins and reaches figs 4 and 6 in these high mountain primary water supply areas snowpack is implicated as the strongest control on streamflow mccabe and wolock 2011 miller et al 2016 and has cascading downstream effects influencing streamflow in distal low elevation mainstem rivers our results are consistent with the finding that rising temperatures act to decrease streamflow in this study area milly and dunne 2020 streamflow decreases arising from increased temperatures have been attributed to earlier onset and increased magnitude of evapotranspiration mankin et al 2019 milly and dunne 2020 decreased proportion of wintertime precipitation that falls as snow scalzitti et al 2016 and decreased albedo in upper elevation catchments painter et al 2010 increased proportions of rain at mid elevations during the cold season may translate into decreased springtime snowpack and an earlier streamflow center timing hidalgo et al 2009 likewise decreased snow albedo from dust events contributes to earlier more rapid melt and reduced springtime runoff such changes to timing of precipitation and evapotranspiration and precipitation phase contribute to lower overall streamflow during the year due to decreased contributions of snowmelt to groundwater and therefore groundwater discharge as baseflow and evapotranspiration starting earlier in the season painter et al 2010 masbruch et al 2016 although snow variables were considered during sw sparrow model calibration they were not found to be significant at the regional scale and were therefore not retained in the model wise et al 2019 because our sparrow modeling results bypass explicitly modeling snow cover and thus these important processes our results may represent a conservative estimate of future water availability in upper elevation catchments however the impact of seasonal snow on an annual model over a thirty year time period is unknown the magnitudes and spatial structure of the climate variables p et a et p and t shown by model and water resource region in figs s3 and s4 differ among models during the three multidecadal time intervals and two rcps spatial variability in these variables may arise due to differences in each climate model s representation of thermodynamic and dynamic climate changes and is responsible for the spatial variation in streamflow projections observed in study results for example miroc esm most hot average wet future and ipsl cm5a mr hotter drier future both exhibit east west variation in climate variables figs s3 and s4 and streamflow responses fig 3 in general the climate models project pervasive increases in temperature as a thermodynamic climate response to increased greenhouse gas concentrations precipitation changes are also characterized by a thermodynamic climatic response where warmer temperatures allow for higher atmospheric specific humidity and thus increases in precipitation held and soden 2006 however future precipitation patterns including timing and intensity also depend on the patterns of dynamic climate change which are more difficult to predict pfahl et al 2017 thus changes to spatial patterns of precipitation vary among models depending on how they represent dynamic climatic change precipitation phase varies seasonally and both solstitial seasons boreal winter and summer are sensitive to different dynamic changes winter precipitation is typically delivered via frontal systems associated with the mid latitude jet stream marvel and bonfils 2013 have detected poleward shifts in the position of the mid latitude stormtrack and lau and kim 2015 suggest northward shifts of the mid latitude jet stream following hadley cell expansion this change would contribute to a drier southwest during winter summer precipitation arises from the north american monsoon in parts of the southwest and as convective precipitation in other parts of the region in both cases precipitation relies on continentally sourced water vapor primarily from plant transpiration jasechko et al 2013 increases in plant water use efficiency will decrease evapotranspiration fluxes jung et al 2010 keenan et al 2013 frank et al 2015 contributing to higher streamflow in some regions but potentially lower streamflow in places where evapotranspired water vapor supplies precipitation however longer growing seasons may contribute to more total annual evapotranspiration even at lower evapotranspiration rates and thus overall decreases in streamflow mankin et al 2019 it is unclear whether these seasonal dynamic changes will work together to decrease streamflow or if decreases in evapotranspiration flux will buffer against changes to wintertime precipitation in the future a temporally dynamic streamflow model and hierarchical bayesian techniques could be used to explicitly incorporate the strong seasonality of the region including snow processes into the model alexander et al 2019 streamflow changes are comparable to findings of prior studies on the colorado river and rio grande projected streamflow changes at the colorado river at lees ferry by mid 21st century 2050s for all models and rcps increases between 2 and 22 and decreases between 2 and 44 are similar to changes in other studies synthesized in lukas and payton 2020 of declines up to 40 and mid range changes generally between 10 and 20 our 2050s multimodel mean streamflow projections at the colorado river below hoover dam and san juan river near bluff are also comparable to or smaller than ensemble mean changes in mean annual flows reported for 2041 2070 by u s bureau of reclamation u s bureau of reclamation 2012b llewellyn et al 2013 report streamflow decreases of 50 on the rio grande near lobatos by the end of the 21st century this is close to the largest decline projected by one climate model in our study although most other climate models project declines closer to 20 fig 7 4 1 the human component our results indicate a range in streamflow response to a suite of climate futures fig 5 we do not provide guidance about the likelihood of a particular streamflow outcome but emphasize that our results indicate that the greatest streamflow declines arises under the higher greenhouse gas concentration pathway and at higher elevations figs 3 4 and 7 tables s1 and s2 this result underscores the sensitivity of streamflow to greenhouse gas concentrations via changes to the climate system and highlights the importance of national and global emission reduction policies and actions in protecting future water resources there are also opportunities to influence surface water availability by influencing water demand although the sw sparrow projected streamflows presented here do not account for future changes to water demand we know that at the current water use rates water demand outpaces water availability in many areas u s bureau of reclamation 2012a u s bureau of reclamation 2016a this imbalance drives declines in surface water levels like the levels of great salt lake in utah wurtsbaugh et al 2017 in the coming century we expect further increases in water demand due to population increases and associated changes in land and water use even absent the decreases in streamflow projected by this study and others we expect that the anticipated human and environmental changes will stretch already limited water resources and the combined effect of climate driven streamflow decreases and increased water demand could lead to desiccation of surface water levels across the southwestern us in this section we evaluate this risk in two ways the first is by increasing the water use that s already included in the sw sparrow model by 50 and comparing it to the projected streamflows for the 2080s the second is by comparing water use projections from u s bureau of reclamation 2012c for the colorado river basin for 2060 to the streamflows projected for the 2050s 4 1 1 increasing sw sparrow model water use to better understand the water availability risks posed by the combination of changing climate and increased water use we assume all stream removals for irrigation and municipal water supply which are based on current rates of use increase by half 50 increase in withdrawals by the 2080s and compare these removals to accumulated streamflow under rcp8 5 fig 8 the 50 increase is simply a hypothetical example to show the sensitivity of streamflow to changes in both climate and water withdrawls the 50 increase in withdrawals may be reasonable for providing context given that between 1950 and 1980 water withdrawls across california nevada utah arizona and new mexico increased by over 50 from approximately 5000 million m3 to approximately 8000 million m3 macdonald 2010 the results of this model specific experiment are captured by a cumulative distribution function which indicates that the combination of climate change and increased water demand typically reduces accumulated streamflow e g between 80 and 100 of reaches indicate streamflows of 90 or less of historical levels although between 3 and 12 of reaches indicate increases in flow bin 1 due to climate driven wetting depending on the model between 33 and 86 of reaches project streamflow levels less than 50 of historical and between 14 and 70 of stream reaches are expected to dwindle to levels less than 25 of their historical streamflow in the most extreme cases our analysis suggests between 5 and 59 of reaches supplying water will be overdrawn under this scenario bin 5 in this case these reaches would be fully dry and incapable of fulfilling human and environmental water use needs as we have noted the problems are not projected to be as severe under rcp4 5 fig s6 under rcp4 5 in the 2080s 0 to 27 of reaches are projected to be overdrawn bin 5 of historical flow and between 0 and 38 of reaches are projected to be at least 95 of historical streamflow 4 1 2 comparisons with colorado river demand projections a few models project moderate to large streamflow increases during the 2050s in the upper and lower colorado river basins the possibility of streamflow increases is of interest to water managers concerned with meeting future water demand to investigate the balance of future water supply and demand we compared our streamflow results to estimates of water demand in 2060 total colorado river basin upper and lower colorado river basins combined demand is expected to increase by between 1 1 and 6 4 km3 yr 1 by 2060 table c 4 u s bureau of reclamation 2012c among all climate models and all scenarios for the 2050s only one model mri cgcm3 warmer wetter future under one scenario rcp8 5 can meet the upper end of that demand projecting total colorado river basin streamflow increases of 7 1 km3 yr 1 four other model rcp combinations gfdl cm3 hotter wetter future and inmcm4 hottest average wet future under rcp4 5 and giss e2 r least warm average wet future under both rcps project streamflows that could meet water demands at the lower end of the projections 1 6 to 4 5 km3 yr 1 our results suggest that while there is a chance that future streamflow increases could meet rising water demand the majority of models and scenarios suggest that substantial water stresses are likely by 2060 this is consistent with the findings of milly and dunne 2020 suggesting that potential future precipitation increases will be insufficient to offset thermodynamically induced aridification and water shortages in the region furthermore we note that no models under either scenario project 2080s streamflow increases large enough to meet the projected 2060 demands in the likely event that water demand continues to rise with population growth beyond 2060 it is highly unlikely that colorado river basin streamflows will be sufficient to meet colorado river basin water demand further colorado river basin demand varies spatially most of the water supply for the colorado river basin is produced in mountainous sub basins of the upper colorado river basin yet there is greater current demand and larger projected increases in demand in the lower colorado river basin compared to the upper colorado river basin by 2060 the bureau of reclamation table c 11 u s bureau of reclamation 2012c projects water demand increases of 0 6 to 1 9 km3 yr 1 for the upper colorado river basin six models under one or both rcps suggest that the upper colorado river basin may be able to partially or completely meet these increased demands with projected streamflow increases however even in the case of streamflow increases in the upper colorado river basin there will be reduced streamflow to be routed to the lower colorado river basin this presents issues for the lower colorado river basin because based on our projections water demand in the lower colorado river basin in 2060 of 1 5 to 3 1 km3 yr 1 table c 11 u s bureau of reclamation 2012c can only be met by one model mri cgcm3 warmer wetter future under one scenario rcp8 5 this suggests that the greatest water stresses will affect the lower colorado river basin possibly exacerbating inter state and international disputes over water allocations including difficulty reaching compliance with the mexican water treaty of 1944 1 85 km3yr 1 and water insecurity for many water users 5 conclusions this study used the sw sparrow streamflow model calibrated with historical data and forced with future climate data from two representative concentration pathways rcp to project streamflow for catchments across the southwestern u s results of this study indicate widespread changes in streamflow in the coming century with substantial inter model variability in the response although we project some increases in streamflow particularly for the 2030s and more often for the westernmost water resource regions streamflow decreases over the study period in most water resource regions and subbasins increases may be related to specific general circulation models gcm and their sensitivity and response to greenhouse gas changes and we note that increases generally decline with time and may be insufficient to meet growing water demand in the region some models indicate subbasin specific streamflow losses of between 50 and 100 by the 2080s under rcp8 5 these losses are greatest in high elevation subbasins which are sensitive to temperature evapotranspiration precipitation and albedo changes that have historically been key water supply sources and have an outsized effect on the entire downstream watershed decreases in streamflow in key areas for interstate and international water sharing agreements show potential declines up to 62 putting agreement compliance at risk we caution that these study results are conservative in that they do not consider other feedback processes including changes to mountain snowpack future land use changes or increases in plant water use efficiency study results also do not consider any changes to water use or management although use is projected to increase and will exacerbate existing water availability issues future streamflow projections vary by gcm although our goal was to bracket potential streamflow change characterizing the probability of future climate would improve streamflow projections advancements to gcm projections and assessment of their skill at representing regional climate may help with this harding et al 2012 although much of the future of climate change and water use when considering the balance between supply and demand depends more fundamentally on human activities and choices our results would support a more detailed comparison to more sophisticated water demand projections our results suggest a dependence of future streamflow on greenhouse gas concentrations where model projections forced with rcp4 5 suggest less intermodel variability and higher streamflows at the end of the 21st century compared to rcp8 5 our results underscore that greenhouse gas emissions reduction and moderating or decreasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations may be critical to maintaining sufficient streamflow volumes to satisfy current and future water use while also complying with interstate and international water allocation agreements credit authorship

8578,krypton 85 and other radioactive noble gases are widely used for groundwater dating purposes 85kr analysis require large volumes of water to reach the analytical requirements conventionally this water is pumped to the surface to be degassed with a gas extraction system the large pumping rate may disturb the natural flow field and requires substantial field logistics hence we propose a new in situ degassing method in which membrane contactors are used to degas the groundwater directly in the well and gas is collected at the surface this way field work is facilitated groundwater system disturbance is minimized and the gas sample is collected at a specific depth we demonstrate the tightness of the system regarding atmospheric air contamination for a collection times of 24 h which is sufficient for both low level counting and laser based counting methods for 85kr the minimal borehole diameter is 7 5 cm for the prototype presented in this research but can easily be reduced to smaller diameters in a case study we compare the results obtained with the new passive method with those from a conventional packer setup sampling additionally 3h 3he samples were collected for both sampling regimes and the dating results were compared with those from 85kr a good agreement between tracer ages is demonstrated and the age stratigraphy is consistent with the expected age distribution for a porous unconfined aquifer in addition our study emphasizes the differences between the age information sampled with various methods in conclusion we demonstrate that the new in situ quasi passive method provides a more representative age stratigraphy with depth in most cases keywords noble gases tracers groundwater dating sampling methodology 1 introduction groundwater is an essential resource for human societies as a source of drinking water but also for agricultural and industrial applications the anthropogenic stress on groundwater is increasing with the population s growth as well as a consequence of climate change the deterioration in quality and quantity arising from these changes can be limited by a comprehensive understanding of underground flow patterns recharge rates and residence time distributions these parameters are crucial to appraise the complexity of groundwater systems especially regarding pollutants transport their assessment leads to more effective strategies for sustainable withdrawal in this context groundwater age information is required for two purposes firstly the age stratigraphy is directly linked to water quality and a key information for the estimation of the young water fraction which is more vulnerable to anthropic contamination bethke and johnson 2008 purtschert 2008 secondly the age information is required for the calibration and validation of numerical hydrodynamic models as well as for groundwater fluxes constrain zuber et al 2011 environmental tracers are used to characterize the groundwater travel time along the flow path because they are inherently more integrative than standard methods i e artificial tracers or darcy law estimations they are largely distributed near the earth s surface and their variations are used to describe environmental processes cook and b√∂hlke 2000 dating tracers can be either event markers cook and solomon 1997 or accumulating in the subsurface darling et al 2012 or decreasing by radioactive decay althaus et al 2009 collon kutschera and lu 2004 lu et al 2014 tomonaga et al 2017 because different tracers behave differently in case of mixing additional information is provided when they are applied simultaneously kagabu et al 2017 mccallum cook and simmons 2015 among environmental tracers noble gas radionuclides are especially interesting because of their inertness and thus their insensitivity to degradation or retardation processes due to chemical reactions however their low abundances in the environment require relatively large volumes of water for analysis for this purpose groundwater degassing in the field is conventionally achieved through either a vacuum extraction chamber or membrane contactors the water is pumped from the well into the apparatus by a submersible pump and discharged after gas extraction gerber 2012 ohta et al 2009 purtschert and yokochi 2013 yokochi 2016 these traditional pumping and degassing setups are logistically challenging and impractical for very low productivity wells with very long sampling times in addition active pumping may induce drawdown that disturbs the natural age stratification and in some cases could even lead to infiltration of gas from the vadose zone as an alternative we propose an approach in which the water is degassed directly in the well for krypton 85 groundwater dating membrane modules are placed at a defined depth in the wellbore and left in place for several hours during which the gas is autonomously extracted transferred to the surface and collected in sampling vessels this method offers several advantages firstly no gas pump or compressor is required in the field if the gas is extracted in pre evacuated gas vessels secondly the risk for atmospheric air contamination during prolonged sampling times is minimal since most connections and the membranes are immersed under water finally several samplers can simultaneously be placed at different depths allowing to establish groundwater age profiles without using expensive packers systems fig 1 this way the sampling procedure is facilitated while the disturbance of the natural flow field is minimized its use is especially interesting in porous aquifers with dominant horizontal flow the application in fractured aquifers is more complex because of localized groundwater inflows that may induce ambient vertical flow in the wellbore however if these fluxes are quantified the method allows for the deconvolution of the activities and the dating of the water inflows meyzonnat et al 2018 2 method 2 1 85kr groundwater dating krypton 85 85kr is a noble gas radionuclide with a half life of 10 74 years used to date young groundwater in the age range from 5 to 50 years purtschert 2008 singh and chen 2014 this radioisotope is naturally produced in the earth atmosphere by cosmic rays 84kr n Œ≥ 85kr and fission reactions in the lithosphere however the major part of 85kr is anthropogenic as it is produced in nuclear reactors by fission of uranium and plutonium and released during reprocessing of nuclear spent fuel ahlswede et al 2013 bollh√∂fer et al 2019 this results in a steadily increasing activity concentration in the atmosphere since 1950 s up to about 80 dpm cckr decay per minute and cm3 stp krypton in 2019 fig 2 in the proximity of re processing plants in europe mainly around la hague in france the atmospheric 85kr activity concentration varies temporally due to pulsed releases bollh√∂fer et al 2019 an interhemispheric exchange time of roughly one year and the fact that all reprocessing plants are located in the northern hemisphere lead to a smoother and 15 lower 85kr activity course in the southern hemisphere ahlswede et al 2013 lu et al 2014 kersting et al 2020 once precipitation reaches the groundwater table gas and 85kr exchange with the atmosphere is blocked the 85kr activity decreases along the groundwater flow path due to radioactive decay mixing at variable scales as well as diffusion dispersion processes lead to a distribution of residence times rather than a single age suckow 2014 the probability distribution of ages g t ma≈Çoszewski and zuber 1982 suckow 2014 is commonly described by simple analytical functions these are combined with the input tracer concentration cin t dpm cckr at recharge time t in the convolution integral equation 1 1 c out t t c in t g t t e Œª 85 t t d t cout t dpm cckr is the concentration at observation time t yr and Œª85 yr 1 is the 85kr decay constant 6 4 10 2 yr the mean residence time œÑ corresponding to the weighted average value of all idealized ages t t is one of the model parameters describing the probability distribution g t œÑ can be determined by an optimisation routine once the functional form of g t has been specified the dating method is based on the measurement of the specific 85kr activity per volume of total krypton the concentration of stable krypton isotopes in the atmosphere remains constant at 1 099 ppm v aoki and makide 2005 transitions between liquid and gas phase i e gas dissolution and degassing fractionates the 85kr kr ratio to 1 for most realistic scenarios purtschert 2008 dating results are therefore not sensitive to recharge temperatures or excess air heaton and vogel 1981 nor to partial degassing prior or during sampling this is a big advantage compared to other tracers based on absolute concentrations of dissolved gasses the composition of gas dissolved in water is determined by solubility which itself depends on temperature and salinity and the partial pressure of the gas in the atmosphere the concentration of krypton in air equilibrated water a e w at sea level and for a recharge temperature of 10 c is 9 2 10 2 ¬µl l of water for these conditions the dissolved gas fraction is 3 93 ppm v the minimal amount of krypton required for 85kr analyses is 1 2 ¬µl for both low level decay counting llc and atom trap trace analysis atta analyses loosli and purtschert 2005 lu et al 2014 zappala et al 2017 considering a degassing efficiency of 50 losses during gas purification and gas transfer into the detection system of another 50 loss leads to a minimal amount of groundwater of 50 200 l that needs to be processed in the field 2 2 experimental setup we present a new sampling system in which small membrane contactors cells are inserted directly in the well and the gas is collected at the surface fig 3 illustrates the setup with one degassing unit composed of a membrane contactor with an internal surface of 2500 cm2 pdmsxa 2500 permselect a water filter a small water pump dm212vs dynamax pump series and a sump the water is locally recirculated through the membrane with a flow rate of 1 l min which brings enough water in contact with the membrane within a sampling time of 24 h while only minimally disturbing the natural flow field quasi passive sampling the 12 v small water pump is powered by a car battery at the surface the module is connected by a ¬º inch copper or plastic pp or pe tubing to a pre evacuated sampling tank 20 l at the surface the volume of the gas line is 30 cm3 m to avoid clogging of the membrane the water is cleaned by a 10 ¬µm filter unit the pressure gradient between both sides of the membrane drives the gas through the membrane and to the sampling bottle the sample pressure in the tank is continuously monitored during the experiment by a pressure gauge at the surface the hydrophobic membrane is permeable to some degree to water vapor and a sump 10 cm3 is included in the setup to avoid clogging of the gas line by water the diameter of our prototype sampler without the plastic inserts is 2 5 cm the whole prototype setup fits in a 7 5 cm borehole but future versions will fit in a 5 cm 2 in wellbore before the sampling starts the gas lines and connections are evacuated to avoid any contamination by atmospheric air this can be done by a second pre evacuated tank e g 10 l connected to the degassing line which has a volume of 0 3 l 10 m another option for flushing the line is to connect a vacuum pump to valve 2 for the determination of age depth profiles several degassing units are aligned in a serial configuration and individually connected to pre evacuated flushing and sampling tanks for a 10 l flushing tank evacuated 0 1 mb and a tube length of 10 m the residual pressure in the line is 30 mb for a 5 l gas sample this residual gas volume of 9 cc 10 m corresponds to 0 2 air contamination or 0 14 dpm cckr fig 4 this is below the analytical uncertainty of 0 2 0 5 dpm cckr and could only become relevant for old waters with 85kr activity levels 2 dpm cckr after closing the flushing tanks the sampling tanks are opened the setup remains in the well for at least 24 h during which about 5 10 l of gas are collected from a e w after gas collection the pressure in the tank is recorded the sample bottle is closed and the line is withdrawn the principle of gas sampling based on permeation through a membrane has been previously described and tested by gardner and solomon 2009 for stable noble gases and 3h 3he dating the required total dissolved gas pressure tdgp at sampling depth is either measured by a separate probe in the borehole or preserved by closing the gas vial in situ and measured afterwards in the laboratory in contrast our sampling method does not require the knowledge of the tdgp because the age is determined by the activity ratio 85kr kr 2 3 degassing principles a gas extraction system for groundwater dating purposes must i be leak tight to avoid sample contamination by modern air fig 4 lu 2014 purtschert and yokochi 2013 ii have a high extraction yield to minimize the volume of water required and the extraction time and iii be sufficiently robust light and portable for field work the concepts of our approach are discussed in detail in the following sections 2 3 1 phase separation by membranes a membrane is a selective layer of material for a substance passing through it the gas permeation process is composed of consecutive gas solution on the high pressure side diffusion through the membrane and evaporation on the low pressure side sanders et al 2013 fig a 1 in appendix the dissolution and evaporation processes conform to henry s law while diffusion follows fick s first law ahsan and hussain 2016 zhang and cloud 2006 the pressure increase on the gas side shell side of the membrane which includes the volume of the gas lines and the sampling container v cm3 fig 3 is linked to the gas flow rate through the membrane i e the degassing yield the resulting pressure increase as function of time p1 t mb is described by equation 2 and derived in equations a 1 a 4 in appendix where p0 mb is the total dissolved gas pressure tdgp k cm2 s is the diffusion coefficient of gas through the membrane l cm is the membrane thickness and a cm2 is the membrane surface area gardner and solomon 2009 note that p 1 t 0 0 m b 2 p 1 t p 0 1 e k a l v t 2 3 2 extraction efficiency the extraction efficiency is defined as the proportion of gas sampled gas yield or flux in relation to the dissolved gas content in water which is maintained constant throughout the experiment thanks to water renewal equation 3 3 e fficiency g as f l u x t h r o u g h t h e m e m b r a n e cc min w ater f l u x l w min g a s c o n t e n t cc l w the efficiency is determined by membrane characteristics surface area thickness material gas dissolution and diffusion coefficients but also by the solubility and diffusivity of the gas in the water it further depends on the partial pressure of the gas in the water and decreases with decreasing contact time with the membrane which is inversely related to the water flow rate the efficiency drops from 80 to 40 if the water flow rate increases from 0 3 l min to 2 l min fig b 1 in appendix if the gas is collected in a pre evacuated container the pressure gradient between both sides of the membrane and thus the efficiency decreases over time 2 3 3 head loss along the gas tube the pressure loss along the gas lines between the membranes in the borehole and the sample container at the surface can be described by the darcy weisbach equation brown 2000 simplified for laminar flow in a circular pipe equation 4 4 Œ¥ p f l 128 œÄ

rate and d m is the tube diameter a typical gas flux qt of 0 4 cc s is calculated assuming a water flowrate of 1 l min a gas content of 23 cc l and a degassing efficiency of 50 for an inner diameter of ¬º inches and a 50 m long tube the pressure loss is in the order of 10 2 mb this is negligible in comparison to the driving pressure difference in the order of several hundreds of mb 2 4 performance and testing 2 4 1 equilibration experiment a water degassing experiment was performed in the laboratory to determine the diffusion coefficient for air through the membrane kair cm2 s for this purpose tap water i e a e w constantly renewed is circulated through the membrane with a flow rate of 1 l min and degassed into a volume of 400 cm3 the pressure increase is recorded as function of time with a pressure gauge fig 5 a these experimental data are then fitted with equation 2 to extrapolate kair the resulting diffusion coefficient for air kair 5 3 10 7 cm2 s is similar to the diffusion coefficient of argon and krypton through silicone concluded by gardner and solomon 2009 therefore we use this value to assess the krypton extraction yield in the following as discussed earlier the targeted amount of krypton that needs to be extracted from the water is 2 4 ¬µl with 50 losses during gas purification and transfers to the counting system assuming a e w at 10 c and thus a krypton concentration of 3 93 ppm v the collection time is 5 h for 4 ¬µl in a 20 l tank equation 2 and fig 5b an equilibration time of 24 h should therefore be sufficient for most scenarios and conditions partly degassed water higher recharge elevation or temperature this degassing experiment allowed to assess the air degassing efficiency of our samplers for this purpose the gas volume sampled is compared with the total gas dissolved in the water circulating around the membrane the median extraction efficiency observed is 21 for a final sample pressure of 500 mb i e 10 l of gas in a 20 l sample bottle and a e w at 10 c circulated at 1 l min 2 4 2 leak test the leak rate in operation mode is evaluated by introducing the sampler in stagnant water and degassing it in a known sampling volume of 25 cm3 the pressure increase is recorded as a function of time by a pressure gauge after a few minutes the water in contact with the membrane is completely degassed and the following pressure increase is interpreted as a maximal leak rate the experiment was carried out for 5 days the average leak rate was 0 27 mb hour corresponding to a gas flux of 1 1 10 4 cc min in comparison with the mean degassing rate of 5 cc min for a e w for a pump rate of 1 l min and a degassing efficiency of 20 this leak rate corresponds to an air contamination of 0 03 what is negligible in relation to the analytical uncertainty of 85kr analyses zappala et al 2017 and the methodological dating errors 2 5 applicability and limitations of the method a constrain of the method arises from the minimum volume of water that needs to be degassed in the borehole and therefore needs to be in contact with the degassing unit within a reasonable sampling time with other words the natural groundwater flow through the borehole within the targeted sampling time ts must reach at least the minimum water sample volume of 100 l vw equation 5 5 t s v w f b h v w v d a r c y a h d v w k d h d x a h d where fbh m 3 d is the water flow rate through the effective borehole cross section ahd m 2 fig 6 a v darcy m d is the darcy velocity in the aquifer as function of the aquifer conductivity k m s and piezometric head gradient dh d x fig 6b raja sekhar and sano 2000 in the case where the natural flowrate is too low to allow water renewal within a reasonable sampling time recirculation of water that was already partly degassed would eventually lead to a standstill of the gas flow harrington cook and robinson 2000 a potentially limiting factor for any passive sampling method are ambient vertical flows avf in presence of a vertical head gradient along the borehole corcho alvarado barbecot and purtschert 2009 mcmillan et al 2014 the acceptable threshold for upwelling flow depends on the context the natural age stratigraphy in the aquifer and the distance that separates the screens or the inflows note that this type of limitation is common to all passive sampling methods and generally it must be clear that almost no vertical flow is acceptable with these methods avf are especially common in fractured rocks because of the natural difference in hydraulic heads in this case a pump might be placed at the top in order to control the flow direction and intensity in the wellbore the intensity and location of water inflows in the borehole need then to be quantified by suitable borehole logging techniques meyzonnat et al 2018 the effect of avf can be reduced by separating depth sections with flow barriers very simple packers or disks that impede water exchange between distinct depth levels special attention must be paid in case of high dissolved gas contents e g co2 ch4 which will result in a faster increase of pressure in the sample tank the size of the tank needs to be adjusted accordingly in addition suspended matter in the water may clog the filter and the membrane in this case a series of filters with increasing mesh should be added 3 case study in the seeland aquifer ch comparison with conventional sampling and 3h 3he ages 3 1 field site the seeland region is situated in the northwestern part of switzerland between the city of bern and the lake biel fig 7 in this area the successive avulsions of meandering aare river led to a variable lithology that range from well sorted gravels to clay our observation well is situated in the area of kappelen where these alluvial gravel deposits are up to 50 m thick the basement rock is the tertiary molasse of the swiss plateau covered by ground moraines and glacio lacustrine clay sediments up to 200 m deep fig 7 until the 19th century this area was a floodplain of the aare river and its exploitation for human activities was limited later the area was drained by a wide series of hydrological undertakings e g channelization of the rivers to lower the water table and to protect the area from flooding nowadays the seeland region is one of the most productive agricultural areas in switzerland baillieux et al 2014 biaggi et al 2004 gobat 2015 kozel 1992 hydrogeological boundaries are delimiting our area fig 7 first the seeland aquifer is separated between the northern and southern part by the hagneck channel which acts as a water divide caused by the strong infiltration of channel water baillieux et al 2014 in this case we are interested in the northern part where the water flows towards the north eastern direction to the nidau b√ºren channel the old aare river is the south eastern hydrogeological barrier the north western boundary is the outcropping of the tertiary molasse cochand et al 2019 gobat 2015 in this area groundwater recharge occurs by two main processes firstly infiltration of local precipitation that percolates through soil and thus drains the minerals and the pesticides applied on the farmlands the recharge elevation is thus 500 550 m and the mean annual air temperature maat is 13 c the second recharge process is infiltration from the hagneck channel as well as the old aare streambed in contrast to recharge from local precipitation this water is less mineralized and depleted in heavy isotopes since the catchment area of the river aare is at higher altitude in the alps these two main recharge components are mixed in the aquifer previous studies suggested a proportion of aare river water of up to 50 at our sampling well gobat 2015 the aquifer conductivity and hydraulic head gradient were estimated to be in the order of 10 2 m s and 2 gobat 2015 kozel 1992 this results in a water flow velocity of 10 m d for a porosity of 20 30 the sampling location in kappelen is a test well with a depth of 25 m and a diameter of 10 cm fig 7 the lithology is mainly composed of permeable sandy gravels aare gravels alternating with an increasing proportion of silty layers with depth gobat 2015 in the borehole casing three screened intervals are located at 7 5 10 5 m 14 17 m and 20 8 23 8 m special attention was paid at the time of drilling to avoid leakage between the screened levels via the borehole filling around the casing 3 2 sampling and analytical methods the field site in kappelen was chosen because of its relatively simple hydrology and the possibility for multi level sampling two field campaigns were conducted in april and december 2019 for 85kr tritium stables isotopes of the water molecule and stable noble gases the main objectives of this case study were i to compare 85kr dating results obtained by passive and active sampling and ii to further assess and interpret these results by means of additional dating tracers such as 3h 3he in april 2019 three passive degassing units were left in the well for 24 h at the center of each screen 9 15 and 22 m the well was undisturbed i e not flushed prior to sampling an active sampling was carried out immediately after removing the passive samplers from the well for this purpose the three screened intervals were successively isolated by packers flushed with a submersible pump mp1 grundfos and sampled for 85kr using a vacuum extraction system purtschert and yokochi 2013 600 l of water from each level were degassed with a flow rate of 24 l min these samples are denoted conventional in the following additional samples for 3h and Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h were collected and stable noble gasses samples were taken in pinched off copper tubes beyerle et al 2000 in december 2019 passive 85kr sampling was repeated at the same three levels directly afterwards without purging the well 3he as well as stable noble gases were collected using the equilibration samplers developed by gardner and solomon 2009 these passive noble gas samples and 3h values from april were used for 3h 3he dating the well was undisturbed for more than 6 months before this sampling campaign the 85kr activities were measured by llc purtschert and yokochi 2013 in the deep laboratory from the university of bern stable isotopes of the water molecule were also measured at the university of bern huber and leuenberger 2005 stable noble gases were measured at the institute of environmental physics of the university of bremen s√ºltenfu√ü roether and rhein 2009 for the conventional samples resp at the department of geology and geophysics of the university of utah for the passive samples https noblegaslab utah edu 3he 4he and ne measurements are used to calculate the 3h 3he ages 3 3 results table 1 shows the 85kr and 3h 3hetrit concentrations with corresponding piston flow ages 85kr activity concentrations decrease with depth from 65 dpm cckr to 50 dpm cckr for conventional sampling fig 8 tritium values range from 11 tu to 8 tu with a decreasing trend with depth 85kr and 3h both suggest the presence of young water 60 years at all depths the samples collected with the new passive samplers for 85kr show a very similar pattern than the conventional samples but with values systematically 10 dpm cckr lower this difference between the passive and the conventional activities is discussed in section 3 4 for the two deeper levels the repeated 85kr measurements in april and december agree the temporal variation observed for the shallow level may indicate changes of the proportion of young water in an active recharge system noble gas samples were collected with pinched off copper tubes in parallel to 85kr sampling april 2019 from intervals separated by packers these samples reveal increasing 3he 4he ratios r expressed as relative to the atmospheric 3he 4he ratio ra table 2 excess air ea denoted as ne excess relative to the solubility equilibrium concentration Œ¥ne is similar for all levels 13 14 in contrast noble gas data collected with the passive samplers in december 2019 just after passive 85kr sampling show larger scatter in r ra ne values and total dissolved gas pressures tdgp with even negative values table 2 these variations are likely related to the passive sampling regime a better understanding of the underlying processes is required before deriving 3h 3he ages from these data this is discussed in the following for the two deeper passive samples tdgp below 1 atm indicates the occurrence of degassing for the calculations of 3h 3he ages a 3he degassing correction was applied for this purpose gas loss was estimated based on the deficit of 4he measured in relation to 4he at solubility equilibrium 4heeq plus 4he from excess air 4heea estimated from ne and assuming an atmospheric ne he ratio unfractionated ea this is a modified version of the correction method proposed by visser broers and bierkens 2007 where ea was neglected 3hetrit is then calculated under the assumptions that i degassing occurred at recharge no loss of 3hetrit and ii degassing occurred shortly prior or during sampling with 3hetrit loss equation 6 6 i 3 h e trit c 3 h e m f he h e atm ii 3 h e trit c 3 h e m f he h e atm fhe is the remaining fraction of he after degassing table 2 3hem is the measured concentration and 3heatm is the atmospheric concentration before degassing 3heeq 3heea since the point in time of degassing is unknown both corrections were applied leading to a narrow range of 3h 3he ages table 1 in addition the slightly depleted 3he 4he ratio r ra 0 97 table 2 of the shallow passive sample could be caused by i non equilibrium diffusive gas loss where the lighter 3he is preferentially lost due to a slightly higher diffusion coefficient compared to 4he nakata et al 2019 or ii a contribution of a significant amount of radiogenic 4he the latter would require either an external influx of he from deeper formations torgersen et al 2013 or outgassing of he from the aquifer solids solomon hunt and poreda 1996 in situ production by the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium naturally present in the aquifer rock would result in a 4he accumulation rate of 2 9 10 12 cc g yr assuming u 2 ppm and th 10 ppm heier 1965 an accumulation time of 3000 years would then be required to explain a r ra of 0 97 this is unlikely regarding the large conductivity and flow velocity of the aquifer gobat and b√∂hi 2016 since the origin of the slightly depleted r ra value remains unclear no correction was applied for the shallow passive sample at 9 m 85kr piston flow model ages were calculated by resolving the convolution integral equation 1 and using the mean annual 85kr input curve for freiburg i b germany fig 2 3h 3he ages were calculated by equation 7 7 œÑ t 1 2 Œª l n 1 3 h e trit 3 h 85kr and 3h 3he ages are plotted in fig 9 as function of depth below the surface a good agreement is observed between 85kr ages and 3h 3he ages sampled with the conventional method for the 9 and 15 m levels while the 3h 3he ages are shifted towards older values for the deepest level the relationship between Œ¥18o and Œ¥ 2h table 3 is shown in fig 10 and compared with local precipitation and aare river values all samples lay on the local precipitation line and are isotopically lighter than the annual mean precipitation value indicating that recharge occurs predominately in the cooler season jasechko et al 2014 the values from different depth intervals agree within uncertainties the april samples have a heavier signature characteristic for warmer temperatures while the december samples are more depleted indicating recharge under cooler conditions 3 4 discussion the age stratigraphy of groundwater in a homogeneous unconfined aquifer with temporally and spatially constant recharge rate is described by the vogel model vogel 1967 equation 8 expresses the age of groundwater at depth z m defined as the time since the parcel entered the saturated zone in an unconfined aquifer with a constant thickness cook and b√∂hlke 2000 e m is the aquifer thickness œÜ is the porosity and r m yr is the recharge rate 8 t z e œÜ r ln e e z assuming realistic values for our study location a 50 m thick aquifer a recharge rate of 400 mm years and a porosity of 20 gobat 2015 results in an age profile which is in reasonable agreement with our tracer ages fig 9 potential river water infiltration from the hagneck channel as suggested by gobat and b√∂hi 2016 and baillieux et al 2014 seems to have only a minor effect on the vertical age distribution at the borehole location however there are differences and deviations between the individual tracers and the calculated profile that deserve further discussion one intriguing observation is the systematic shift of 85kr activities between the passive and the active conventional sampling with lower values for the passive sampling it is very unlikely that this is related to analytical artefacts or contamination since the conventional method is well established and has been proven contamination free the lower 85kr values and thus older ages of the passive samples must therefore have an hydrological meaning which is related to the different sampling regimes possible effects to be considered are listed in the following first active pumping from a borehole section drains preferentially water from the most permeable layers in consequence the age information from a pumped groundwater sample tends to be biased towards the most active or permeable flow compartments flow averaged age in contrast passive sampling leaves more time for equilibration between the active flow zone and less permeable layers passive measurements thus represent the mass or volume averaged age of the entire pore space on a local scale even an aquifer considered as homogenous represents a stochastic distribution of permeable and less permeable zones in our case silty layers proportion is increasing with depth gobat and b√∂hi 2016 and the permeability is consequently decreasing pumping drains preferentially water from shallow depths whereas the passive measurements are closer to an undisturbed system for a polluted aquifer the arrival time of the contaminants would depend on the fast flowing pathways while the equilibrium bulk concentration would be related to the water mass in both the permeable and stagnant zones another process that needs to be considered is ambient vertical flow in the open borehole induced by a small head gradient with depth an upwelling flow of older water would explain why the passive 85kr ages are older than the conventional one however this hypothesis is unlikely as there is no screen bellow the deepest interval and thus there is no possibility for an upwelling flow in the borehole up to this level in addition special care was taken for the positioning of the packers and the samplers in the center of the screen dispersive admixture of water components that recharged during the time of the bomb peak would explain the apparent shift of 3h 3he ages towards old values fig 9 because the age of mixtures is biased towards the components with highest total tritium 3h 3he activity this is evidenced by total tritium values of 25 27 tu at 22 m table 1 which exceeds the input of 6 15 tu from local precipitation affolter et al 2020 gerber et al 2018 at the time of recharge finally a broad distribution of groundwater ages also explains the occurrence of variations in stable isotope composition despite a mean residence time of many years the difference between the values from april and december fig 10 is interpreted as a seasonal signal carried by the youngest fraction of water composing the exponential age distribution vogel 1967 the relative amplitude of the observed variations between both groups compared to the seasonal recharge variability winter summer is 10 for Œ¥18o and 4 for Œ¥2h 4 conclusion in this study we first demonstrate the use of new in situ quasi passive degassing samplers for krypton 85 groundwater dating these membrane contactors allow water degassing directly in the well and gas collection at the surface with minimal logistic facilities in the field the gas diffusion coefficient through the membrane and thus the median degassing efficiency and the minimal equilibration time were assessed by laboratory experiments in the field the gas collection time is about one day in order to provide the 100 200 l of water required for the analysis however it also depends on the natural groundwater flow velocity in the borehole in open boreholes a common limitation to passive or quasi passive sampling methods is ambient vertical flow avf the goal of passive sampling is to obtain groundwater samples with minimal disturbance of the natural flow system in our case study we demonstrated a general consistency of 85kr age profiles obtained by active and passive sampling methods 3h 3he ages depict a similar depth systematics than 85kr but with older ages in the deepest level additionally this study emphasizes the importance of the choice of sampling and dating method in a multi screened open borehole aquifer heterogeneities on various spatial scales affect the sampling and tracer methods differently conventional sampling for radio noble gases 85kr 39ar implies a larger water volume and pump rate and these samples are therefore inherently weighted towards the most permeable parts of the aquifer thus 85kr values collected by the new quasi passive method show slightly older ages compared to samples collected by active pumping from isolated screen intervals completely passive sampling systems such as 3h 3he diffusion samplers have a high spatial resolution and are consequently very sensitive to small scale heterogeneities in the aquifer but also to influences induced by borehole drilling and well construction methods such effects impacted the passive 3h 3he samples collected in our study purely passive methods would benefit of a careful borehole characterization before sampling our new in situ sampler for 85kr represents an intermediate resolution with a mixing length of 1 m that smooths out micro scale variabilities while minimizing flow perturbation and maintaining the age stratigraphy on the meter scale this corresponds to sampling strategies proposed earlier with moderate pump rates i e low flow sampling puls and barcelona 1996 wang et al 2019 the combined use of different sampling and tracer methods that depict the dynamics and age of waters from distinct aquifer compartments with different conductivities are a valuable tool for the calibration of hydrological models that aim to assess and predict for example the vulnerability of a groundwater body to contamination credit authorship contribution statement st√©phanie musy writing original draft conceptualization methodology investigation

85kr dating result because the permeation parameters of 85kr and 84kr are almost identical and thus the 85kr kr ratio is maintained b gas removal efficiency of the membrane contactor used in this study 
8578,krypton 85 and other radioactive noble gases are widely used for groundwater dating purposes 85kr analysis require large volumes of water to reach the analytical requirements conventionally this water is pumped to the surface to be degassed with a gas extraction system the large pumping rate may disturb the natural flow field and requires substantial field logistics hence we propose a new in situ degassing method in which membrane contactors are used to degas the groundwater directly in the well and gas is collected at the surface this way field work is facilitated groundwater system disturbance is minimized and the gas sample is collected at a specific depth we demonstrate the tightness of the system regarding atmospheric air contamination for a collection times of 24 h which is sufficient for both low level counting and laser based counting methods for 85kr the minimal borehole diameter is 7 5 cm for the prototype presented in this research but can easily be reduced to smaller diameters in a case study we compare the results obtained with the new passive method with those from a conventional packer setup sampling additionally 3h 3he samples were collected for both sampling regimes and the dating results were compared with those from 85kr a good agreement between tracer ages is demonstrated and the age stratigraphy is consistent with the expected age distribution for a porous unconfined aquifer in addition our study emphasizes the differences between the age information sampled with various methods in conclusion we demonstrate that the new in situ quasi passive method provides a more representative age stratigraphy with depth in most cases keywords noble gases tracers groundwater dating sampling methodology 1 introduction groundwater is an essential resource for human societies as a source of drinking water but also for agricultural and industrial applications the anthropogenic stress on groundwater is increasing with the population s growth as well as a consequence of climate change the deterioration in quality and quantity arising from these changes can be limited by a comprehensive understanding of underground flow patterns recharge rates and residence time distributions these parameters are crucial to appraise the complexity of groundwater systems especially regarding pollutants transport their assessment leads to more effective strategies for sustainable withdrawal in this context groundwater age information is required for two purposes firstly the age stratigraphy is directly linked to water quality and a key information for the estimation of the young water fraction which is more vulnerable to anthropic contamination bethke and johnson 2008 purtschert 2008 secondly the age information is required for the calibration and validation of numerical hydrodynamic models as well as for groundwater fluxes constrain zuber et al 2011 environmental tracers are used to characterize the groundwater travel time along the flow path because they are inherently more integrative than standard methods i e artificial tracers or darcy law estimations they are largely distributed near the earth s surface and their variations are used to describe environmental processes cook and b√∂hlke 2000 dating tracers can be either event markers cook and solomon 1997 or accumulating in the subsurface darling et al 2012 or decreasing by radioactive decay althaus et al 2009 collon kutschera and lu 2004 lu et al 2014 tomonaga et al 2017 because different tracers behave differently in case of mixing additional information is provided when they are applied simultaneously kagabu et al 2017 mccallum cook and simmons 2015 among environmental tracers noble gas radionuclides are especially interesting because of their inertness and thus their insensitivity to degradation or retardation processes due to chemical reactions however their low abundances in the environment require relatively large volumes of water for analysis for this purpose groundwater degassing in the field is conventionally achieved through either a vacuum extraction chamber or membrane contactors the water is pumped from the well into the apparatus by a submersible pump and discharged after gas extraction gerber 2012 ohta et al 2009 purtschert and yokochi 2013 yokochi 2016 these traditional pumping and degassing setups are logistically challenging and impractical for very low productivity wells with very long sampling times in addition active pumping may induce drawdown that disturbs the natural age stratification and in some cases could even lead to infiltration of gas from the vadose zone as an alternative we propose an approach in which the water is degassed directly in the well for krypton 85 groundwater dating membrane modules are placed at a defined depth in the wellbore and left in place for several hours during which the gas is autonomously extracted transferred to the surface and collected in sampling vessels this method offers several advantages firstly no gas pump or compressor is required in the field if the gas is extracted in pre evacuated gas vessels secondly the risk for atmospheric air contamination during prolonged sampling times is minimal since most connections and the membranes are immersed under water finally several samplers can simultaneously be placed at different depths allowing to establish groundwater age profiles without using expensive packers systems fig 1 this way the sampling procedure is facilitated while the disturbance of the natural flow field is minimized its use is especially interesting in porous aquifers with dominant horizontal flow the application in fractured aquifers is more complex because of localized groundwater inflows that may induce ambient vertical flow in the wellbore however if these fluxes are quantified the method allows for the deconvolution of the activities and the dating of the water inflows meyzonnat et al 2018 2 method 2 1 85kr groundwater dating krypton 85 85kr is a noble gas radionuclide with a half life of 10 74 years used to date young groundwater in the age range from 5 to 50 years purtschert 2008 singh and chen 2014 this radioisotope is naturally produced in the earth atmosphere by cosmic rays 84kr n Œ≥ 85kr and fission reactions in the lithosphere however the major part of 85kr is anthropogenic as it is produced in nuclear reactors by fission of uranium and plutonium and released during reprocessing of nuclear spent fuel ahlswede et al 2013 bollh√∂fer et al 2019 this results in a steadily increasing activity concentration in the atmosphere since 1950 s up to about 80 dpm cckr decay per minute and cm3 stp krypton in 2019 fig 2 in the proximity of re processing plants in europe mainly around la hague in france the atmospheric 85kr activity concentration varies temporally due to pulsed releases bollh√∂fer et al 2019 an interhemispheric exchange time of roughly one year and the fact that all reprocessing plants are located in the northern hemisphere lead to a smoother and 15 lower 85kr activity course in the southern hemisphere ahlswede et al 2013 lu et al 2014 kersting et al 2020 once precipitation reaches the groundwater table gas and 85kr exchange with the atmosphere is blocked the 85kr activity decreases along the groundwater flow path due to radioactive decay mixing at variable scales as well as diffusion dispersion processes lead to a distribution of residence times rather than a single age suckow 2014 the probability distribution of ages g t ma≈Çoszewski and zuber 1982 suckow 2014 is commonly described by simple analytical functions these are combined with the input tracer concentration cin t dpm cckr at recharge time t in the convolution integral

corresponding to the weighted average value of all idealized ages t t is one of the model parameters describing the probability distribution g t œÑ can be determined by an optimisation routine once the functional form of g t has been specified the dating method is based on the measurement of the specific 85kr activity per volume of total krypton the concentration of stable krypton isotopes in the atmosphere remains constant at 1 099 ppm v aoki and makide 2005 transitions between liquid and gas phase i e gas dissolution and degassing fractionates the 85kr kr ratio to 1 for most realistic scenarios purtschert 2008 dating results are therefore not sensitive to recharge temperatures or excess air heaton and vogel 1981 nor to partial degassing prior or during sampling this is a big advantage compared to other tracers based on absolute concentrations of dissolved gasses the composition of gas dissolved in water is determined by solubility which itself depends on temperature and salinity and the partial pressure of the gas in the atmosphere the concentration of krypton in air equilibrated water a e w at sea level and for a recharge temperature of 10 c is 9 2 10 2 ¬µl l of water for these conditions the dissolved gas fraction is 3 93 ppm v the minimal amount of krypton required for 85kr analyses is 1 2 ¬µl for both low level decay counting llc and atom trap trace analysis atta analyses loosli and purtschert 2005 lu et al 2014 zappala et al 2017 considering a degassing efficiency of 50 losses during gas purification and gas transfer into the detection system of another 50 loss leads to a minimal amount of groundwater of 50 200 l that needs to be processed in the field 2 2 experimental setup we present a new sampling system in which small membrane contactors cells are inserted directly in the well and the gas is collected at the surface fig 3 illustrates the setup with one degassing unit composed of a membrane contactor with an internal surface of 2500 cm2 pdmsxa 2500 permselect a water filter a small water pump dm212vs dynamax pump series and a sump the water is locally recirculated through the membrane with a flow rate of 1 l min which brings enough water in contact with the membrane within a sampling time of 24 h while only minimally disturbing the natural flow field quasi passive sampling the 12 v small water pump is powered by a car battery at the surface the module is connected by a ¬º inch copper or plastic pp or pe tubing to a pre evacuated sampling tank 20 l at the surface the volume of the gas line is 30 cm3 m to avoid clogging of the membrane the water is cleaned by a 10 ¬µm filter unit the pressure gradient between both sides of the membrane drives the gas through the membrane and to the sampling bottle the sample pressure in the tank is continuously monitored during the experiment by a pressure gauge at the surface the hydrophobic membrane is permeable to some degree to water vapor and a sump 10 cm3 is included in the setup to avoid clogging of the gas line by water the diameter of our prototype sampler without the plastic inserts is 2 5 cm the whole prototype setup fits in a 7 5 cm borehole but future versions will fit in a 5 cm 2 in wellbore before the sampling starts the gas lines and connections are evacuated to avoid any contamination by atmospheric air this can be done by a second pre evacuated tank e g 10 l connected to the degassing line which has a volume of 0 3 l 10 m another option for flushing the line is to connect a vacuum pump to valve 2 for the determination of age depth profiles several degassing units are aligned in a serial configuration and individually connected to pre evacuated flushing and sampling tanks for a 10 l flushing tank evacuated 0 1 mb and a tube length of 10 m the residual pressure in the line is 30 mb for a 5 l gas sample this residual gas volume of 9 cc 10 m corresponds to 0 2 air contamination or 0 14 dpm cckr fig 4 this is below the analytical uncertainty of 0 2 0 5 dpm cckr and could only become relevant for old waters with 85kr activity levels 2 dpm cckr after closing the flushing tanks the sampling tanks are opened the setup remains in the well for at least 24 h during which about 5 10 l of gas are collected from a e w after gas collection the pressure in the tank is recorded the sample bottle is closed and the line is withdrawn the principle of gas sampling based on permeation through a membrane has been previously described and tested by gardner and solomon 2009 for stable noble gases and 3h 3he dating the required total dissolved gas pressure tdgp at sampling depth is either measured by a separate probe in the borehole or preserved by closing the gas vial in situ and measured afterwards in the laboratory in contrast our sampling method does not require the knowledge of the tdgp because the age is determined by the activity ratio 85kr kr 2 3 degassing principles a gas extraction system for groundwater dating purposes must i be leak tight to avoid sample contamination by modern air fig 4 lu 2014 purtschert and yokochi 2013 ii have a high extraction yield to minimize the volume of water required and the extraction time and iii be sufficiently robust light and portable for field work the concepts of our approach are discussed in detail in the following sections 2 3 1 phase separation by membranes a membrane is a selective layer of material for a substance passing through it the gas permeation process is composed of consecutive gas solution on the high pressure side diffusion through the membrane and evaporation on the low pressure side sanders et al 2013 fig a 1 in appendix the dissolution and evaporation processes conform to henry s law while diffusion follows fick s first law ahsan and hussain 2016 zhang and cloud 2006 the pressure increase on the gas side shell side of the membrane which includes the volume of the gas lines and the sampling container v cm3 fig 3

relation to the dissolved gas content in water which is maintained constant throughout the experiment thanks to water renewal equation 3 3 e fficiency g as f l u x t h r o u g h t h e m e m b r a n e cc min w ater f l u x l w min g a s c o n t e n t cc l w the efficiency is determined by membrane characteristics surface area thickness material gas dissolution and diffusion coefficients but also by the solubility and diffusivity of the gas in the water it further depends on the partial pressure of the gas in the water and decreases with decreasing contact time with the membrane which is inversely related to the water flow rate the efficiency drops from 80 to 40 if the water flow rate increases from 0 3 l min to 2 l min fig b 1 in appendix if the gas is collected in a pre evacuated container the pressure gradient between both sides of the membrane and thus the efficiency decreases over time 2 3 3 head loss along the gas tube the pressure loss along the gas lines between the membranes in the borehole and the sample container at the surface can be described by the darcy weisbach equation brown 2000 simplified for laminar flow in a circular pipe equation 4 4 Œ¥ p f l 128 œÄ

performance and testing 2 4 1 equilibration experiment a water degassing experiment was performed in the laboratory to determine the diffusion coefficient for air through the membrane kair cm2 s for this purpose tap water i e a e w constantly renewed is circulated through the membrane with a flow rate of 1 l min and degassed into a volume of 400 cm3 the pressure increase is recorded as function of time with a pressure gauge fig 5 a these experimental data are then fitted with equation 2 to extrapolate kair the resulting diffusion coefficient for air kair 5 3 10 7 cm2 s is similar to the diffusion coefficient of argon and krypton through silicone concluded by gardner and solomon 2009 therefore we use this value to assess the krypton extraction yield in the following as discussed earlier the targeted amount of krypton that needs to be extracted from the water is 2 4 ¬µl with 50 losses during gas purification and transfers to the counting system assuming a e w at 10 c and thus a krypton concentration of 3 93 ppm v the collection time is 5 h for 4 ¬µl in a 20 l tank equation 2 and fig 5b an equilibration time of 24 h should therefore be sufficient for most scenarios and conditions partly degassed water higher recharge elevation or temperature this degassing experiment allowed to assess the air degassing efficiency of our samplers for this purpose the gas volume sampled is compared with the total gas dissolved in the water circulating around the membrane the median extraction efficiency observed is 21 for a final sample pressure of 500 mb i e 10 l of gas in a 20 l sample bottle and a e w at 10 c circulated at 1 l min 2 4 2 leak test the leak rate in operation mode is evaluated by introducing the sampler in stagnant water and degassing it in a known sampling volume of 25 cm3 the pressure increase is recorded as a function of time by a pressure gauge after a few minutes the water in contact with the membrane is completely degassed and the following pressure increase is interpreted as a maximal leak rate the experiment was carried out for 5 days the average leak rate was 0 27 mb hour corresponding to a gas flux of 1 1 10 4 cc min in comparison with the mean degassing rate of 5 cc min for a e w for a pump rate of 1 l min and a degassing efficiency of 20 this leak rate corresponds to an air contamination of 0 03 what is negligible in relation to the analytical uncertainty of 85kr analyses zappala et al 2017 and the methodological dating errors 2 5 applicability and limitations of the method a constrain of the method arises from the minimum volume of water that needs to be degassed in the borehole and therefore needs to be in contact with the degassing unit within a reasonable sampling time with other words the natural groundwater flow through the borehole within the targeted sampling time ts must reach at least the minimum water sample volume of 100 l vw equation 5 5 t s v w f b h v w v d a r c y a h d v w k d h d

water that was already partly degassed would eventually lead to a standstill of the gas flow harrington cook and robinson 2000 a potentially limiting factor for any passive sampling method are ambient vertical flows avf in presence of a vertical head gradient along the borehole corcho alvarado barbecot and purtschert 2009 mcmillan et al 2014 the acceptable threshold for upwelling flow depends on the context the natural age stratigraphy in the aquifer and the distance that separates the screens or the inflows note that this type of limitation is common to all passive sampling methods and generally it must be clear that almost no vertical flow is acceptable with these methods avf are especially common in fractured rocks because of the natural difference in hydraulic heads in this case a pump might be placed at the top in order to control the flow direction and intensity in the wellbore the intensity and location of water inflows in the borehole need then to be quantified by suitable borehole logging techniques meyzonnat et al 2018 the effect of avf can be reduced by separating depth sections with flow barriers very simple packers or disks that impede water exchange between distinct depth levels special attention must be paid in case of high dissolved gas contents e g co2 ch4 which will result in a faster increase of pressure in the sample tank the size of the tank needs to be adjusted accordingly in addition suspended matter in the water may clog the filter and the membrane in this case a series of filters with increasing mesh should be added 3 case study in the seeland aquifer ch comparison with conventional sampling and 3h 3he ages 3 1 field site the seeland region is situated in the northwestern part of switzerland between the city of bern and the lake biel fig 7 in this area the successive avulsions of meandering aare river led to a variable lithology that range from well sorted gravels to clay our observation well is situated in the area of kappelen where these alluvial gravel deposits are up to 50 m thick the basement rock is the tertiary molasse of the swiss plateau covered by ground moraines and glacio lacustrine clay sediments up to 200 m deep fig 7 until the 19th century this area was a floodplain of the aare river and its exploitation for human activities was limited later the area was drained by a wide series of hydrological undertakings e g channelization of the rivers to lower the water table and to protect the area from flooding nowadays the seeland region is one of the most productive agricultural areas in switzerland baillieux et al 2014 biaggi et al 2004 gobat 2015 kozel 1992 hydrogeological boundaries are delimiting our area fig 7 first the seeland aquifer is separated between the northern and southern part by the hagneck channel which acts as a water divide caused by the strong infiltration of channel water baillieux et al 2014 in this case we are interested in the northern part where the water flows towards the north eastern direction to the nidau b√ºren channel the old aare river is the south eastern hydrogeological barrier the north western boundary is the outcropping of the tertiary molasse cochand et al 2019 gobat 2015 in this area groundwater recharge occurs by two main processes firstly infiltration of local precipitation that percolates through soil and thus drains the minerals and the pesticides applied on the farmlands the recharge elevation is thus 500 550 m and the mean annual air temperature maat is 13 c the second recharge process is infiltration from the hagneck channel as well as the old aare streambed in contrast to recharge from local precipitation this water is less mineralized and depleted in heavy isotopes since the catchment area of the river aare is at higher altitude in the alps these two main recharge components are mixed in the aquifer previous studies suggested a proportion of aare river water of up to 50 at our sampling well gobat 2015 the aquifer conductivity and hydraulic head gradient were estimated to be in the order of 10 2 m s and 2 gobat 2015 kozel 1992 this results in a water flow velocity of 10 m d for a porosity of 20 30 the sampling location in kappelen is a test well with a depth of 25 m and a diameter of 10 cm fig 7 the lithology is mainly composed of permeable sandy gravels aare gravels alternating with an increasing proportion of silty layers with depth gobat 2015 in the borehole casing three screened intervals are located at 7 5 10 5 m 14 17 m and 20 8 23 8 m special attention was paid at the time of drilling to avoid leakage between the screened levels via the borehole filling around the casing 3 2 sampling and analytical methods the field site in kappelen was chosen because of its relatively simple hydrology and the possibility for multi level sampling two field campaigns were conducted in april and december 2019 for 85kr tritium stables isotopes of the water molecule and stable noble gases the main objectives of this case study were i to compare 85kr dating results obtained by passive and active sampling and ii to further assess and interpret these results by means of additional dating tracers such as 3h 3he in april 2019 three passive degassing units were left in the well for 24 h at the center of each screen 9 15 and 22 m the well was undisturbed i e not flushed prior to sampling an active sampling was carried out immediately after removing the passive samplers from the well for this purpose the three screened intervals were successively isolated by packers flushed with a submersible pump mp1 grundfos and sampled for 85kr using a vacuum extraction system purtschert and yokochi 2013 600 l of water from each level were degassed with a flow rate of 24 l min these samples are denoted conventional in the following additional samples for 3h and Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h were collected and stable noble gasses samples were taken in pinched off copper tubes beyerle et al 2000 in december 2019 passive 85kr sampling was repeated at the same three levels directly afterwards without purging the well 3he as well as stable noble gases were collected using the equilibration samplers developed by gardner and solomon 2009 these passive noble gas samples and 3h values from april were used for 3h 3he dating the well was undisturbed for more than 6 months before this sampling campaign the 85kr activities were measured by llc purtschert and yokochi 2013 in the deep laboratory from the university of bern stable isotopes of the water molecule were also measured at the university of bern huber and leuenberger 2005 stable noble gases were measured at the institute of environmental physics of the university of bremen s√ºltenfu√ü roether and rhein 2009 for the conventional samples resp at the department of geology and geophysics of the university of utah for the passive samples https noblegaslab utah edu 3he 4he and ne measurements are used to calculate the 3h 3he ages 3 3 results table 1 shows the 85kr and 3h 3hetrit concentrations with corresponding piston flow ages 85kr activity concentrations decrease with depth from 65 dpm cckr to 50 dpm cckr for conventional sampling fig 8 tritium values range from 11 tu to 8 tu with a decreasing trend with depth 85kr and 3h both suggest the presence of young water 60 years at all depths the samples collected with the new passive samplers for 85kr show a very similar pattern than the conventional samples but with values systematically 10 dpm cckr lower this difference between the passive and the conventional activities is discussed in section 3 4 for the two deeper levels the repeated 85kr measurements in april and december agree the temporal variation observed for the shallow level may indicate changes of the proportion of young water in an active recharge system noble gas samples were collected with pinched off copper tubes in parallel to 85kr sampling april 2019 from intervals separated by packers these samples reveal increasing 3he 4he ratios r expressed as relative to the atmospheric 3he 4he ratio ra table 2 excess air ea denoted as ne excess relative to the solubility equilibrium concentration Œ¥ne is similar for all levels 13 14 in contrast noble gas data collected with the passive samplers in december 2019 just after passive 85kr sampling show larger scatter in r ra ne values and total dissolved gas pressures tdgp with even negative values table 2 these variations are likely related to the passive sampling regime a better understanding of the underlying processes is required before deriving 3h 3he ages from these data this is discussed in the following for the two deeper passive samples tdgp below 1 atm indicates the occurrence of degassing for the calculations of 3h 3he ages a 3he degassing correction was applied for this purpose gas loss was estimated based on the deficit of 4he measured in relation to 4he at solubility equilibrium 4heeq plus 4he from excess air 4heea estimated from ne and assuming an atmospheric ne he ratio unfractionated ea this is a modified version of the correction method proposed by visser broers and bierkens 2007 where ea was neglected 3hetrit is then calculated under the assumptions that i degassing occurred at recharge no loss of 3hetrit and ii degassing occurred shortly prior or during sampling with 3hetrit loss equation 6 6 i 3 h e trit c 3 h e m f he h e atm ii 3 h e trit c 3 h e m f he h e atm fhe is the remaining fraction of he after degassing table 2 3hem is the measured concentration and 3heatm is the atmospheric concentration before degassing 3heeq 3heea since the point in time of degassing is unknown both corrections were applied leading to a narrow range of 3h 3he ages table 1 in addition the slightly depleted 3he 4he ratio r ra 0 97 table 2 of the shallow passive sample could be caused by i non equilibrium diffusive gas loss where the lighter 3he is preferentially lost due to a slightly higher diffusion coefficient compared to 4he nakata et al 2019 or ii a contribution of a significant amount of radiogenic 4he the latter would require either an external influx of he from deeper formations torgersen et al 2013 or outgassing of he from the aquifer solids solomon hunt and poreda 1996 in situ production by the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium naturally present in the aquifer rock would result in a 4he accumulation rate of 2 9 10 12 cc g yr assuming u 2 ppm and th 10 ppm heier 1965 an accumulation time of 3000 years would then be required to explain a r ra of 0 97 this is unlikely regarding the large conductivity and flow velocity of the aquifer gobat and b√∂hi 2016 since the origin of the slightly depleted r ra value remains unclear no correction was applied for the shallow passive sample at 9 m 85kr piston flow model ages were calculated by resolving the convolution integral equation 1 and using the mean annual 85kr input curve for freiburg i b germany fig 2 3h 3he ages were calculated by equation 7 7 œÑ t 1 2 Œª l n 1 3 h e trit 3 h 85kr and 3h 3he ages are plotted in fig 9 as function of depth below the surface a good agreement is observed between 85kr ages and 3h 3he ages sampled with the conventional method for the 9 and 15 m levels while the 3h 3he ages are shifted towards older values for the deepest level the relationship between Œ¥18o and Œ¥ 2h table 3 is shown in fig 10 and compared with local precipitation and aare river values all samples lay on the local precipitation line and are isotopically lighter than the annual mean precipitation value indicating that recharge occurs predominately in the cooler season jasechko et al 2014 the values from different depth intervals agree within uncertainties the april samples have a heavier signature characteristic for warmer temperatures while the december samples are more depleted indicating recharge under cooler conditions 3 4 discussion the age stratigraphy of groundwater in a homogeneous unconfined aquifer with temporally and spatially constant recharge rate is described by the vogel model vogel 1967 equation 8 expresses the age of groundwater at depth z m defined as the time since the parcel entered the saturated zone in an unconfined aquifer with a constant thickness cook and b√∂hlke 2000 e m is the aquifer thickness œÜ is the porosity and r m yr is the recharge rate 8 t z e œÜ r ln e e z assuming realistic values for our study location a 50 m thick aquifer a recharge rate of 400 mm years and a porosity of 20 gobat 2015 results in an age profile which is in reasonable agreement with our tracer ages fig 9 potential river water infiltration from the hagneck channel as suggested by gobat and b√∂hi 2016 and baillieux et al 2014 seems to have only a minor effect on the vertical age distribution at the borehole location however there are differences and deviations between the individual tracers and the calculated profile that deserve further discussion one intriguing observation is the systematic shift of 85kr activities between the passive and the active conventional sampling with lower values for the passive sampling it is very unlikely that this is related to analytical artefacts or contamination since the conventional method is well established and has been proven contamination free the lower 85kr values and thus older ages of the passive samples must therefore have an hydrological meaning which is related to the different sampling regimes possible effects to be considered are listed in the following first active pumping from a borehole section drains preferentially water from the most permeable layers in consequence the age information from a pumped groundwater sample tends to be biased towards the most active or permeable flow compartments flow averaged age in contrast passive sampling leaves more time for equilibration between the active flow zone and less permeable layers passive measurements thus represent the mass or volume averaged age of the entire pore space on a local scale even an aquifer considered as homogenous represents a stochastic distribution of permeable and less permeable zones in our case silty layers proportion is increasing with depth gobat and b√∂hi 2016 and the permeability is consequently decreasing pumping drains preferentially water from shallow depths whereas the passive measurements are closer to an undisturbed system for a polluted aquifer the arrival time of the contaminants would depend on the fast flowing pathways while the equilibrium bulk concentration would be related to the water mass in both the permeable and stagnant zones another process that needs to be considered is ambient vertical flow in the open borehole induced by a small head gradient with depth an upwelling flow of older water would explain why the passive 85kr ages are older than the conventional one however this hypothesis is unlikely as there is no screen bellow the deepest interval and thus there is no possibility for an upwelling flow in the borehole up to this level in addition special care was taken for the positioning of the packers and the samplers in the center of the screen dispersive admixture of water components that recharged during the time of the bomb peak would explain the apparent shift of 3h 3he ages towards old values fig 9 because the age of mixtures is biased towards the components with highest total tritium 3h 3he activity this is evidenced by total tritium values of 25 27 tu at 22 m table 1 which exceeds the input of 6 15 tu from local precipitation affolter et al 2020 gerber et al 2018 at the time of recharge finally a broad distribution of groundwater ages also explains the occurrence of variations in stable isotope composition despite a mean residence time of many years the difference between the values from april and december fig 10 is interpreted as a seasonal signal carried by the youngest fraction of water composing the exponential age distribution vogel 1967 the relative amplitude of the observed variations between both groups compared to the seasonal recharge variability winter summer is 10 for Œ¥18o and 4 for Œ¥2h 4 conclusion in this study we first demonstrate the use of new in situ quasi passive degassing samplers for krypton 85 groundwater dating these membrane contactors allow water degassing directly in the well and gas collection at the surface with minimal logistic facilities in the field the gas diffusion coefficient through the membrane and thus the median degassing efficiency and the minimal equilibration time were assessed by laboratory experiments in the field the gas collection time is about one day in order to provide the 100 200 l of water required for the analysis however it also depends on the natural groundwater flow velocity in the borehole in open boreholes a common limitation to passive or quasi passive sampling methods is ambient vertical flow avf the goal of passive sampling is to obtain groundwater samples with minimal disturbance of the natural flow system in our case study we demonstrated a general consistency of 85kr age profiles obtained by active and passive sampling methods 3h 3he ages depict a similar depth systematics than 85kr but with older ages in the deepest level additionally this study emphasizes the importance of the choice of sampling and dating method in a multi screened open borehole aquifer heterogeneities on various spatial scales affect the sampling and tracer methods differently conventional sampling for radio noble gases 85kr 39ar implies a larger water volume and pump rate and these samples are therefore inherently weighted towards the most permeable parts of the aquifer thus 85kr values collected by the new quasi passive method show slightly older ages compared to samples collected by active pumping from isolated screen intervals completely passive sampling systems such as 3h 3he diffusion samplers have a high spatial resolution and are consequently very sensitive to small scale heterogeneities in the aquifer but also to influences induced by borehole drilling and well construction methods such effects impacted the passive 3h 3he samples collected in our study purely passive methods would benefit of a careful borehole characterization before sampling our new in situ sampler for 85kr represents an intermediate resolution with a mixing length of 1 m that smooths out micro scale variabilities while minimizing flow perturbation and maintaining the age stratigraphy on the meter scale this corresponds to sampling strategies proposed earlier with moderate pump rates i e low flow sampling puls and barcelona 1996 wang et al 2019 the combined use of different sampling and tracer methods that depict the dynamics and age of waters from distinct aquifer compartments with different conductivities are a valuable tool for the calibration of hydrological models that aim to assess and predict for example the vulnerability of a groundwater body to contamination credit authorship contribution statement st√©phanie musy writing original draft conceptualization methodology investigation

8579,stable isotopes of hydrogen Œ¥2h and oxygen Œ¥18o provide important quantitative measures of lake hydrology and water balance particularly in lakes where monitoring of fluxes is incomplete however little is known of the relative effects of seasonal variation in water isotopes on estimates of lake hydrology particularly over decadal scales to address this gap we measured water isotopes bi weekly may september during 2003 2016 in seven riverine lakes within the 52 000 km2 qu appelle river drainage basin of the canadian prairies analyses revealed that within year variation in Œ¥18o values routinely exceeded that among years reflecting rapid changes in water source particularly in lakes with water residence times 1 year isotopic variation was greatest during spring following snowmelt except in large deep lakes which exhibited limited differences among seasons or years in contrast large hydrological events e g 1 in 140 year flood in 2011 homogenized isotopic values even among riverine lakes separated by over 150 km and exerted particularly strong legacy effects on large lakes overall study lakes exhibited a strongly positive moisture balance evaporation inflow despite regional precipitation deficits of 30 cm yr 1 with greater reliance on rainfall vs snow and possibly evaporation in downstream lakes within more humid regions we conclude that seasonal samples of water isotopes are required to characterize the hydrology of shallow lakes or those with unknown reliance on snowmelt waters as well as to better quantify lake susceptibility to climate variability keywords water isotopes hydrology scales of variability high resolution long term monitoring water balance prairie lakes qu appelle 1 introduction better understanding of the vulnerability of surface waters to climate change is necessary to assess how water resources may change in the future with one sixth of the earth s population residing in regions where water supplies are regulated mainly by snowmelt barnett et al 2005 warming winter temperatures that reduce snowfall and its accumulation in cold regions are of particular concern akinremi et al 1999 coles et al 2017 in addition endorheic basins in sub humid regions may exhibit the greatest sensitivity to climate change because they already show pronounced variations in water supply and lake level wang et al 2018 however data on surface water availability and fluxes are limited in many areas across the globe largely due to the predominance of ungauged basins kirchner 2006 wood et al 2011 for example only 12 of terrestrial land in canada has sufficient instrumentation to evaluate lake and river vulnerability to changes in climate coulibaly et al 2013 in areas where instrumental records are insufficient alternative methods are needed to assess the hydrology of surface water bodies with recent advances in analysis and modeling measurements of stable isotopes of water Œ¥18o Œ¥2h provide a promising means to quantify water balance better assess controls of hydrologic variation and evaluate surface water vulnerability to climate change bam and ireson 2019 remmer et al 2018 seibert and mcdonnell 2002

rain snow groundwater in diverse continental surface waters gibson et al 2019 2016b 2016a halder et al 2013 pham et al 2009 rosa et al 2016 for example seasonal variation in river water isotopes has been used to quantify changes in source water through a single season and among years jasechko et al 2017 reckerth et al 2017 welch et al 2018 these studies suggest that water isotopes are capable of detecting hydrological variation associated with source waters on the scale of weeks to months bam and ireson 2019 gibson and reid 2014 the capability of water isotopes to integrate the relative contribution of different inflow sources has been highlighted as their advantage over conventional monitoring approaches particularly in situations where key fluxes are not measured similarly isotopic studies have been successfully used in small wetlands to determine the relative importance of loss pathways such as infiltration and evaporation bam and ireson 2019 however despite these successes there have been few studies that use water isotopes to quantify short term variability in hydrology water source or water balance e i ratio of lake ecosystems cui et al 2018 seasonal records of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h with high temporal resolution are rare for lake ecosystems cui et al 2018 for example gibson and reid 2014 quantified sub monthly changes in Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o isotope values during a 20 year period in five basins to demonstrate that lakes in the canadian tundra exhibit up to 4 variation in Œ¥18o values within a single ice free season in this case isotopic shifts were attributed to changes in evaporative forcing rather than variation in inputs within this dry environment gibson and reid 2014 in contrast tyler et al 2007 analyzed bi weekly samples over a five year period in lake lochnagar scotland and suggested that the observed 2 range in lake water Œ¥18o values mainly reflected changes in quantity and source of water entering the lake similarly jones et al 2016 found that seasonal variability in lake water isotope values can be explained only when models include both evaporation and precipitation sources finally brooks et al 2014 surveyed ca 100 lakes in the continental usa twice during the ice free period and determined that seasonal variation was insignificant relative to among lake variation in isotope values taken together these findings suggest that isotopic variability can exceed 5 within a year in some regions due to a combination of evaporation bam and ireson 2019 steinman et al 2010 altered source waters pham et al 2009 and changes in basin connectivity brooks et al 2014 these findings demonstrate the potential of water isotopes to record variation in lake hydrology on a number of timescales weeks to years but also illustrate the need to quantify how water isotope values vary across diverse temporal and spatial scales within large lake districts the primary goal of this paper was to quantify how temporal variability in water isotopes affects their use as metrics of the water budgets of lakes in a cold sub humid prairie region specifically we used a 14 year record of bi weekly may august Œ¥18o measurements from seven inter connected lakes to quantify how variation in source waters rain vs snow basin properties residence time volume and landscape position affected estimates of water balance e i within each lake comparison among basins that differed by over 100 fold in most hydrological features vogt et al 2011 helped quantify whether regional lakes exhibited common or unique patterns of temporal variation finally this study fills a gap in high resolution lake water isotope research by providing several records for lakes of the northern great plains given the importance of snowmelt to annual hydrological budgets pomeroy et al 2007 pham et al 2009 and the pronounced precipitation deficit 30 cm yr 1 in the study region bonsal et al 2017 we hypothesized that these riverine study lakes would exhibit high seasonal and interannual variation in Œ¥18o values that greatly affect isotope derived estimates of lake hydrology c f gibson and reid 2014 2 methods 2 1 site description study lakes are

canada https climate weather gc ca this weighting allows for more a realistic estimate of lel slope in regions where lakes are ice covered for part of the year due to the inherently high temporal variability of climate in our study region meteorological variables were averaged over an antecedent period equal to the estimated residence time of each lake table 1 the use of such a lake specific time frame uniquely allowed us to relate current lake isotopic values to the appropriate antecedent hydrological and meteorological conditions all lakes are assumed to be in instantaneous isotopic and

the ice free season gao et al 2018 turner et al 2014 recommendations of yi et al 2008 and cui et al 2018 suggest that samples taken late in the ice free period minimize deviations from steady state and are most reliable when the objective of the investigation is to obtain estimates of the long term hydrological status of a system however here we sought to use all sample dates to allow quantification of the evolution of isotopic values through the ice free season and to more objectively assess the validity of steady state assumptions in steady state isotopic values of outflow are the same as that of the lake water Œ¥q Œ¥l therefore to quantify the water balance for each sample eq 5 was rearranged and q 1 e from eq 4 incorporated to obtain an estimate of the ratio of

method was also applied to sites buffalo pound where information on input waters was inadequate to quantify upstream sources briefly this approach uses the intercept between the lmwl and a regression line from sample specific observations of Œ¥e and Œ¥l to estimate Œ¥i and is conservative with respect to both mass and isotopes haig et al 2020 this method was also used for all lake samples collected after 2014 due to absence of inflow data from the wrmm model for those two years second for lakes with inflow sources that have previously undergone evaporation all other basins we assumed that inflow was not solely of meteoric origin but rather was also influenced by surface water flows haig et al 2020 here we sought to directly estimate the isotopic values of input water based on upstream sources to avoid overestimation of the importance of evaporation in the calculation of mass balances in these basins we calculated lake Œ¥i by assuming no change in lake volume over the

Œ¥l 18o and Œ¥i 18o time series this approach is based on generalized additive models gams wood 2011 wood et al 2016 that are an effective approach for estimation of non linear seasonal or interannual trends in environmental time series augustin et al 2013 ferguson et al 2008 orr et al 2015 pedersen et al 2019 in gams penalized splines are used to derive the shapes of intra and interannual trends from the observed time series using a single linear predictor comprising one or more smooth functions f to estimate the change in the mean of the response over time more recently gams have been extended to allow the estimation of additional parameters of the conditional distribution of the response such as the variance these models are known as gams for location scale shape gamlss stasinopoulos et al 2017 however gamlss are univariate and as such do not allow estimation of how the correlation or dependence between two response variables may change through time copula based models joe 2015 nelsen 2006 enable the estimation of dependence structures between two or more response variables genest and favre 2007 recent developments in statistical theory have combined the properties of gamlss and copula based models for the simultaneous estimation of marginal and joint distributions using smooth functions resulting in the bivariate copula additive model used herein marra and radice 2017 in this paper we restricted our choice of copula function to the gaussian copula Œ∏ as it can be interpreted as the correlation between two time series details of the application

values varied substantially among years and study lakes with the lowest variability recorded in the largest lakes figs 2 and 3 table 1 for example lake diefenbaker Œ¥18o range 2 5 and peripheral sub saline last mountain lake Œ¥18o range 3 3 both exhibited a narrow range in Œ¥l values wider Œ¥18o seasonal ranges were observed for buffalo pound 5 9 pasqua 8 6 katepwa 5 3 and crooked lakes 8 6 with Œ¥18o values generally becoming more enriched as a function of distance downstream fig 2 table 1 the most dynamic range of lakewater Œ¥18o was observed in rapidly flushing wascana lake where values ranged from 6 8 to 19 9 over the ice free period fig 2 at most sites the variation in lakewater isotope values lay parallel to the lmwl except for that in last mountain lake where isotopic variation was positioned between the lmwl and the lel suggesting a system more influenced by evaporation fig 2 the longitudinal increase in mean Œ¥l values from west to east in lakes joined by the qu appelle

seasonal variability in lakewater isotope values increases in Œ¥l and Œ¥i values were observed in most lakes as summer progressed however lakewater isotope values also declined mid summer ca doy 175

pattern in Œ∏ values for last mountain lake declined steadily from strong positive to strong negative relationship leading to a mean value that was close to zero despite years of very strong

lakes was regulated mainly by influx of surface water fig 5 a in general only sub saline last mountain lake exhibited elevated e i ratios consistent with the effects of evaporative concentration shallow or small lakes exhibited higher e i values when calculated from samples taken in late summer than from those collected in spring fig 5b whereas there were only minor effects of collection season on inferred water balance in large or deep lakes for example e i of wascana lake ranged from 0 05 in spring to values above 0 2 by fall whereas both lake diefenbaker and last mountain lake showed minimal seasonality in e i estimates despite persistent differences in e i ratios among basins differences in e i values taken in spring and late summer fig 5 were greatest in 2003 Œº 0 07 œÉ 0

threshold fig 5a table 1 3 4 seasonal patterns in isotope variability analysis of bi weekly records of lakewater Œ¥18o demonstrated that sampling at low temporal resolution did not capture the inter

harmonized Œ¥18o among lakes with more depleted values being recorded after inundation in the central lakes linked by the qu appelle river especially in the eastern half of the qu appelle drainage basin fig 3 4 discussion quantification of water isotopes at bi weekly resolution demonstrated that variation in the isotopic composition of lake waters occurred because of both changes in source waters and evaporative forcing jones et al 2016 tyler et al 2007 but that reliance on a specific form of precipitation rain or snow or sensitivity to evaporation varied widely among lakes within a single river basin similarly all lakes were highly reliant on surface inflow low e i figs 3 and 4 supplementary fig 7 unlike previous surveys of large closed basin lakes pham et al 2009 and very small wetlands bam and ireson 2019 as well small and shallow basins exhibited marked isotopic variation among seasons and years fig 3 table 1 supplementary fig 5 6 suggesting that not all fundamental hydrologic properties were constrained by single isotopic measurements landscape patterns of lake hydrology were also impacted by extreme events fig 3 supplementary fig 5 7 such as vernal flooding blais et al 2016 a phenomena which will be more common in the future in this region asong et al 2016 khaliq et al 2015 masud et al 2017 applications of isotopic approaches demonstrated that the importance of seasonal changes in water source varies with both lake size and landscape position and suggested that effects of future climate change will be site specific in lakes of the northern great plains 4 1 isotopic variability among lakes longitudinal variation in Œ¥l among lakes fig 2a b e f g appeared to arise from a combination of basin specific variation in the importance of precipitation and secondarily evaporative forcing during summer for example the high degree of similarity of lakewater Œ¥18o values and modelled Œ¥i fig 3 low estimates of e i median 0 1 fig 5b and seasonal evolution of lakewater isotope values parallel to the lmwl fig 2 suggest that temporal variability in Œ¥l was regulated mainly by site specific differences in delivery of local precipitation to lakes fig 2i however unlike other qu appelle lakes sub saline last mountain lake exhibited the effects of evaporation including generally enriched Œ¥ l values fig 3 with median e i ratios two fold greater than those in other qu appelle lakes fig 5a and isotopic evolution during summer along the lel fig 2c both these patterns are consistent with those seen in closed basin lakes in cold prairie regions e g pham et al 2009 in previous studies where lake water is subject to significant evaporative forcing either within the lake itself pham et al 2009 or before inflow enters the basin gibson and reid 2014 2010 wolfe et al 2007 isotope values usually evolve along the lel and variation among lakes mainly reflects differences in source water rain snow to individual basins yu et al 2002 instead the relatively consistent position of mean annual Œ¥l values of individual lakes along the lmwl in this study fig 2h suggests that qu appelle source waters changed progressively from headwaters to downstream sites as noted in other lake chains yu et al 2002 in particular eastern study lakes appeared to exhibit a greater reliance on summer precipitation fig 2i consistent with the greater cloud cover vogt et al 2011 and precipitation records at those locations over the past 30 years akinremi et al 1999 mccullough et al 2012 taken together these findings suggest that downstream lakes may be particularly sensitive to recently projected changes in the amount intensity and seasonality of precipitation during the 21st century asong et al 2016 bonsal et al 2017 as well as the more commonly expressed concerns about rising temperatures and variation in evaporative forcing dibike et al 2017 gan and tanzeeba 2012 paimazumder et al 2013 evaporative enrichment of lakewater isotope ratios may have contributed to longitudinal gradients of Œ¥l seen across the east west axis of the 52 000 km2 qu appelle river drainage basin fig 2a b e f g for example the observation that mean d excess cui et al 2017 decreased from 1 to values low as 16 5 table 1 while individual e i values ranged up to 0 34 suggested that evaporation also plays a role in shaping the hydrology of downstream sites fig 5 table 1 despite elevated regional precipitation mccullough et al 2012 given these observations we suggest that further modelling research may be needed to refine predictions of the relative importance of changes in evaporation and precipitation as controls of soil and surface water availability asong et al 2016 dibike et al 2017 masud et al 2017 wang et al 2018 4 2 decadal scale patterns of water source analysis of water isotopes since 2003 suggests that the reliance on snowmelt versus rain varies seasonally for many study lakes fig 3 supplementary figs 4 and 5 prior isotopic research suggests that closed basin prairie lakes in canada sampled in mid summer rely mainly on winter precipitation to persist fang et al 2007 pham et al 2009 pomeroy et al 2007 as annual precipitation deficits routinely exceed 30 cm yr 1 supplementary fig 2b in contrast the hydrologically open e i 0 1 and riverine nature of the qu appelle system was characterized by high seasonal variability in Œ¥l during spring in the smallest lakes fig 3 supplementary fig 8 likely reflecting the high variation in quantity and importance of vernal runoff to total lake volume pomeroy et al 2007 in most years the transport of winter precipitation into lakes is determined by a complex interaction between precipitation in the antecedent fall and winter soil moisture in fall and spring drainage basin size and aspect and vernal meteorology temperature wind which regulate the rate of snow melt infiltration and runoff coles et al 2017 coles and mcdonnell 2018 shook and pomeroy 2010 despite the high variation in spring runoff among years the observation that Œ¥i and Œ¥l in headwater lakes diefenbaker and buffalo pound consistently plot below the amount weighted values of precipitation fig 2 Œ¥p Œ¥18o 14 97 Œ¥2h 117 3 whereas eastern lakes katepwa crooked most often plot above Œ¥p demonstrated that there were persistent differences in the relative importance of snow and rain to individual basin hydrology such variation was even evident within a single longitudinal position for example Œ¥l of wascana lake water fig 2d 3 varied from depleted values characteristic of mid winter to those representative of only rain supplementary fig 3 even within a single year fig 3 whereas last mountain lake consistently plotted above local precipitation values a position that would traditionally be interpreted as lower reliance on snowmelt inflow remmer et al 2018 however last mountain lake was also isotopically enriched fig 2 and sub saline 1 3 g tds l 1 relative to other qu appelle lakes vogt et al 2011 2018 resulting in isotopic values evolving along a lake specific trajectory fig 2c the intersection of this basin specific evaporative line and the lmwl at 15 7 suggested that last mountain lake receives considerable inputs from local groundwater Œ¥groundwater 16 4 together these patterns indicate that local hydrologic features e g effective drainage area land use lake morphometry etc interacted with regional gradients of climate drier in west wetter in east to regulate the importance of seasonal precipitation to hydrological budgets of individual lakes the importance of winter precipitation to lake hydrology was especially evident during 2011 when the qu appelle river experienced a 1 in 140 year inundation blais et al 2016 stadnyk et al 2016 during that flood the relationship between Œ¥l and Œ¥i values was strengthened fig 4 and Œ¥i converged to a common value particularly in downstream pasqua katepwa and crooked lakes fig 3 supplementary fig 6 subsequently Œ¥i shifted towards values characteristic of local precipitation Œ¥p supplementary fig 6 a pattern consistent with meteorological records showing above average precipitation in both 2010 and 2011 supplementary fig 2 such elevated precipitation throughout the annual cycle can result in water saturated soils in fall more profound soil freezing in winter enhanced overland flow in spring and higher representation of winter precipitation in the overall hydrological budget of lakes in cold regions coles et al 2017 coles and mcdonnell 2018 shook et al 2015 4 3 seasonal variability in inflow variations in Œ¥i and Œ¥l values among seasons were greater than those among years in small and shallow qu appelle lakes table 1 fig 3 supplementary figs 5 and 6 but contrasted observations from other lake surveys brooks et al 2014 gibson et al 2018 pham et al 2009 for example while large basins such as diefenbaker and last mountain showed a limited deviation from their mean isotopic composition Œ¥Œ¥18o 1 5 smaller lakes were much more variable wascana Œ¥Œ¥18o 8 0 table 1 such a dependence of hydrological variability on lake size is not observed in all isotope studies as large lakes elsewhere e g lake chad qinghai lake exhibit over 3 variation around mean isotopic values bouchez et al 2016 cui et al 2018 wu et al 2015 thus while we infer that large or deep lakes may exhibit more constrained isotopic values due to runoff being a smaller proportion of total lake volume brooks et al 2014 gibson et al 2016b gibson and edwards 2002 further research is needed to develop a hierarchical understanding of the importance of factors other than residence time groundwater infiltration evapo transpiration etc which may influence seasonal variability of water isotopes bam and ireson 2019 observed ranges in Œ¥l values supplementary fig 5 were similar to those recorded from more northern latitudes where seasonal variation in Œ¥l can exceed 4 due to evaporative forcing gibson and reid 2014 or high connectivity of lakes with rivers brooks et al 2014 macdonald et al 2017 remmer et al 2018 wolfe et al 2007 in general small lakes in such cold regions often shift from snowmelt to rainfall dominated inflow during the ice free season reflecting the limited storage capacity of small water bodies low residence time and high seasonality of overland flow mackinnon et al 2016 tondu et al 2013 turner et al 2014 thus while last mountain lake exhibited a sudden change in isotope values associated with the vernal flood of 2011 its Œ¥l values have generally varied little within individual years figs 2 and 3 supplementary fig 5 6 consistent with its 7 year residence time based on instrumental estimates of surface inflow table 1 instead the pronounced co variance of Œ¥i and Œ¥l values in small basins figs 3 and 4 combined with their greater seasonal variation suggests that effects of short term changes in precipitation will have more profound effects on the small lakes that predominate inland waters downing et al 2006 hayashi et al 2016 this effect may be particularly pronounced in lakes of the canadian prairies and other regions of low topographic relief where catchment areas are large relative to lake surface area and effective drainage areas vary greatly with snowpack depth pomeroy et al 2007 shook et al 2015 2013 comparison of variability among months supplementary fig 8 suggests that samples collected during spring may have limited ability to predict the hydrology in shallow lakes later in the ice free period fig 5b in particular spring values were highly variable for shallow wascana and buffalo pound lakes and showed substantial enrichment during summer fig 3 resulting in underestimations of e i based on vernal sampling fig 5b although this observation is well known from rivers cui et al 2017 rosa et al 2016 smith et al 2015 many lake surveys are based on single annual samples yuan et al 2011 and rarely consider possible effects of seasonality or changes in reproducibility among years gibson and reid 2010 pham et al 2009 tyler et al 2007 the occurrence of high seasonal variability and the dependence of that variability on lake size may reduce the effectiveness of comparative studies based on different seasons or between lakes with greatly differing residence times to minimize bias and to better capture the full range of water balance we suggest that lakes with unknown residence be sampled for water isotopes at least twice once immediately after peak spring inflow and again late in summer when inflow is at a minimum 5 conclusions this paper explored a 14 year record of bi weekly water isotope analyses during the ice free period of seven hydrologically diverse lakes to quantify how Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values vary among seasons years and sites in a cold sub humid catchment in central canada seasonal patterns of water isotopes demonstrated that the importance of individual water sources changed substantially during the ice free period and as a function of landscape position with a longitudinal gradient of increasing importance of summer precipitation from west to eastern basins while the mean water balance could be captured by sub annual low resolution sampling of large basins with water residence times 1 year lakes with shorter residence required seasonal sampling to constrain both sources of water and overall water balance despite substantial precipitation deficits bonsal et al 2017 we found that water balances in all lakes were dependent mainly on water inflow during both spring runoff maximum and summer rain long term records also revealed the profound effect of extreme hydrological events spring flood which both homogenized regional Œ¥i and Œ¥l values and introduced long lived legacy effects in large basins such as last mountain lake these findings will be useful to water managers as they illustrate that the importance of future changes in precipitation regimes ahmari et al 2016 blais et

8579,stable isotopes of hydrogen Œ¥2h and oxygen Œ¥18o provide important quantitative measures of lake hydrology and water balance particularly in lakes where monitoring of fluxes is incomplete however little is known of the relative effects of seasonal variation in water isotopes on estimates of lake hydrology particularly over decadal scales to address this gap we measured water isotopes bi weekly may september during 2003 2016 in seven riverine lakes within the 52 000 km2 qu appelle river drainage basin of the canadian prairies analyses revealed that within year variation in Œ¥18o values routinely exceeded that among years reflecting rapid changes in water source particularly in lakes with water residence times 1 year isotopic variation was greatest during spring following snowmelt except in large deep lakes which exhibited limited differences among seasons or years in contrast large hydrological events e g 1 in 140 year flood in 2011 homogenized isotopic values even among riverine lakes separated by over 150 km and exerted particularly strong legacy effects on large lakes overall study lakes exhibited a strongly positive moisture balance evaporation inflow despite regional precipitation deficits of 30 cm yr 1 with greater reliance on rainfall vs snow and possibly evaporation in downstream lakes within more humid regions we conclude that seasonal samples of water isotopes are required to characterize the hydrology of shallow lakes or those with unknown reliance on snowmelt waters as well as to better quantify lake susceptibility to climate variability keywords water isotopes hydrology scales of variability high resolution long term monitoring water balance prairie lakes qu appelle 1 introduction better understanding of the vulnerability of surface waters to climate change is necessary to assess how water resources may change in the future with one sixth of the earth s population residing in regions where water supplies are regulated mainly by snowmelt barnett et al 2005 warming winter temperatures that reduce snowfall and its accumulation in cold regions are of particular concern akinremi et al 1999 coles et al 2017 in addition endorheic basins in sub humid regions may exhibit the greatest sensitivity to climate change because they already show pronounced variations in water supply and lake level wang et al 2018 however data on surface water availability and fluxes are limited in many areas across the globe largely due to the predominance of ungauged basins kirchner 2006 wood et al 2011 for example only 12 of terrestrial land in canada has sufficient instrumentation to evaluate lake and river vulnerability to changes in climate coulibaly et al 2013 in areas where instrumental records are insufficient alternative methods are needed to assess the hydrology of surface water bodies with recent advances in analysis and modeling measurements of stable isotopes of water Œ¥18o Œ¥2h provide a promising means to quantify water balance better assess controls of hydrologic variation and evaluate surface water vulnerability to climate change bam and ireson 2019 remmer et al 2018 seibert and mcdonnell 2002 tunaley et al 2017 in principle Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h of water hereafter water isotopes can be used as natural tracers to infer differences in water balance evaporation to inflow ratios e i and source waters rain snow groundwater in diverse continental surface waters gibson et al 2019 2016b 2016a halder et al 2013 pham et al 2009 rosa et al 2016 for example seasonal variation in river water isotopes has been used to quantify changes in source water through a single season and among years jasechko et al 2017 reckerth et al 2017 welch et al 2018 these studies suggest that water isotopes are capable of detecting hydrological variation associated with source waters on the scale of weeks to months bam and ireson 2019 gibson and reid 2014 the capability of water isotopes to integrate the relative contribution of different inflow sources has been highlighted as their advantage over conventional monitoring approaches particularly in situations where key fluxes are not measured similarly isotopic studies have been successfully used in small wetlands to determine the relative importance of loss pathways such as infiltration and evaporation bam and ireson 2019 however despite these successes there have been few studies that use water isotopes to quantify short term variability in hydrology water source or water balance e i ratio of lake ecosystems cui et al 2018 seasonal records of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h with high temporal resolution are rare for lake ecosystems cui et al 2018 for example gibson and reid 2014 quantified sub monthly changes in Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o isotope values during a 20 year period in five basins to demonstrate that lakes in the canadian tundra exhibit up to 4 variation in Œ¥18o values within a single ice free season in this case isotopic shifts were attributed to changes in evaporative forcing rather than variation in inputs within this dry environment gibson and reid 2014 in contrast tyler et al 2007 analyzed bi weekly samples over a five year period in lake lochnagar scotland and suggested that the observed 2 range in lake water Œ¥18o values mainly reflected changes in quantity and source of water entering the lake similarly jones et al 2016 found that seasonal variability in lake water isotope values can be explained only when models include both evaporation and precipitation sources finally brooks et al 2014 surveyed ca 100 lakes in the continental usa twice during the ice free period and determined that seasonal variation was insignificant relative to among lake variation in isotope values taken together these findings suggest that isotopic variability can exceed 5 within a year in some regions due to a combination of evaporation bam and ireson 2019 steinman et al 2010 altered source waters pham et al 2009 and changes in basin connectivity brooks et al 2014 these findings demonstrate the potential of water isotopes to record variation in lake hydrology on a number of timescales weeks to years but also illustrate the need to quantify how water isotope values vary across diverse temporal and spatial scales within large lake districts the primary goal of this paper was to quantify how temporal variability in water isotopes affects their use as metrics of the water budgets of lakes in a cold sub humid prairie region specifically we used a 14 year record of bi weekly may august Œ¥18o measurements from seven inter connected lakes to quantify how variation in source waters rain vs snow basin properties residence time volume and landscape position affected estimates of water balance e i within each lake comparison among basins that differed by over 100 fold in most hydrological features vogt et al 2011 helped quantify whether regional lakes exhibited common or unique patterns of temporal variation finally this study fills a gap in high resolution lake water isotope research by providing several records for lakes of the northern great plains given the importance of snowmelt to annual hydrological budgets pomeroy et al 2007 pham et al 2009 and the pronounced precipitation deficit 30 cm yr 1 in the study region bonsal et al 2017 we hypothesized that these riverine study lakes would exhibit high seasonal and interannual variation in Œ¥18o values that greatly affect isotope derived estimates of lake hydrology c f gibson and reid 2014 2 methods 2 1 site description study lakes are

depleted than those of summer rain with a mean Œ¥18o value of 21 1 reflecting seasonal changes in atmospheric temperature and the air mass from which source water is derived summer precipitation

canada https climate weather gc ca this weighting allows for more a realistic estimate of lel slope in regions where lakes are ice covered for part of the year due to the inherently high temporal variability of climate in our study region meteorological variables were averaged over an antecedent period equal to the estimated residence time of each lake table 1 the use of such a lake specific time frame uniquely allowed us to relate current lake isotopic values to the appropriate antecedent hydrological and meteorological conditions all lakes are assumed to be in instantaneous isotopic and hydrologic steady state allowing the water balance to be presented as 4 i q e 5 i Œ¥ i q Œ¥ q e Œ¥ e where i q and e are lake inflow outflow and evaporation m3 with associated delta values Œ¥i Œ¥q and Œ¥e in respectively summed over the hydrological year the assumption of steady state is common in isotopic studies despite knowledge that changes in isotopic values or lake volumes are expected during the ice free season gao et al 2018 turner et al 2014 recommendations of yi et al 2008 and cui et al 2018 suggest that samples taken late in the ice free period minimize deviations from steady state and are most reliable when the objective of the investigation is to obtain estimates of the long term hydrological status of a system however here we sought to use all sample dates to allow quantification of the evolution of isotopic values through the ice free season and to more objectively assess the validity of steady state assumptions in steady state isotopic values of outflow are the same as that of the lake water Œ¥q Œ¥l therefore to quantify the water balance for each sample eq 5 was rearranged and q 1 e from eq 4 incorporated to obtain an estimate of the ratio of evaporation to inflow x 6 x e i Œ¥ i Œ¥ l Œ¥ e Œ¥ l two methods were used to calculate the isotopic composition of inflow Œ¥i each with a different assumption specific to lake position within the hydrologic landscape haig 2019 haig et al 2020 first for headwater lakes diefenbaker last mountain and wascana we used the coupled isotope tracer citm method of yi et al 2008 to calculate Œ¥i this method was also applied to sites buffalo pound where information on input waters was inadequate to quantify upstream sources briefly this approach uses the intercept between the lmwl and a regression line from sample specific observations of Œ¥e and Œ¥l to estimate Œ¥i and is conservative with respect to both mass and isotopes haig et al 2020 this method was also used for all lake samples collected after 2014 due to absence of inflow data from the wrmm model for those two years second for lakes with inflow sources that have previously undergone evaporation all other basins we assumed that inflow was not solely of meteoric origin but rather was also influenced by surface water flows haig et al 2020 here we sought to directly estimate the isotopic values of input water based on upstream sources to avoid overestimation of the importance of evaporation in the calculation of mass balances in these basins we calculated lake Œ¥i by assuming no change in lake volume over the sampling period and that this simplified mass balance could be used to estimate inflow i from precipitation p runoff r and upstream flow j all in m3 as 7 i p r j expanding eq 7 to consider the

regions water flux was calculated by rearranging equation 7 and using the water balance from eq 6 9 r e x p j substituting eqs 9 and 6 into eq 8 allowed calculation of Œ¥i for lakes receiving

Œ¥l 18o and Œ¥i 18o time series this approach is based on generalized additive models gams wood 2011 wood et al 2016 that are an effective approach for estimation of non linear seasonal or interannual trends in environmental time series augustin et al 2013 ferguson et al 2008 orr et al 2015 pedersen et al 2019 in gams penalized splines are used to derive the shapes of intra and interannual trends from the observed time series using a single linear predictor comprising one or more smooth functions f to estimate the change in the mean of the response over time more recently gams have been extended to allow the estimation of additional parameters of the conditional distribution of the response such as the variance these models are known as gams for location scale shape gamlss stasinopoulos et al 2017 however gamlss are univariate and as such do not allow estimation of how the correlation or dependence between two response variables may change through time copula based models joe 2015 nelsen 2006 enable the estimation of dependence structures between two or more response variables genest and favre 2007 recent developments in statistical theory have combined the properties of gamlss and copula based models for the simultaneous estimation of marginal and joint distributions using smooth functions resulting in the bivariate copula additive model used herein marra and radice 2017 in this paper we restricted our choice of copula function to the gaussian copula Œ∏ as it can be interpreted as the correlation between two time series details of the application

ranged from 6 8 to 19 9 over the ice free period fig 2 at most sites the variation in lakewater isotope values lay parallel to the lmwl except for that in last mountain lake where isotopic variation was positioned between the lmwl and the lel suggesting a system more influenced by evaporation fig 2 the longitudinal increase in mean Œ¥l values from west to east in lakes joined by the qu appelle

shallow or small lakes exhibited higher e i values when calculated from samples taken in late summer than from those collected in spring fig 5b whereas there were only minor effects of collection season on inferred water balance in large or deep lakes for example e i of wascana lake ranged from 0 05 in spring to values above 0 2 by fall whereas both lake diefenbaker and last mountain lake

basin fig 3 4 discussion quantification of water isotopes at bi weekly resolution demonstrated that variation in the isotopic composition of lake waters occurred because of both changes in source waters and evaporative forcing jones et al 2016 tyler et al 2007 but that reliance on a specific form of precipitation rain or snow or sensitivity to evaporation varied widely among lakes within a single river basin similarly all lakes were highly reliant on surface inflow low e i figs 3 and 4 supplementary fig 7 unlike previous surveys of large closed basin lakes pham et al 2009 and very small wetlands bam and ireson 2019 as well small and shallow basins exhibited marked isotopic variation among seasons and years fig 3 table 1 supplementary fig 5 6 suggesting that not all fundamental hydrologic properties were constrained by single isotopic measurements landscape patterns of lake hydrology were also impacted by extreme events fig 3 supplementary fig 5 7 such as vernal flooding blais et al 2016 a phenomena which will be more common in the future in this region asong et al 2016 khaliq et al 2015 masud et al 2017 applications of isotopic approaches demonstrated that the importance of seasonal changes in water source varies with both lake size and landscape position and suggested that effects of future climate change will be site specific in lakes of the northern great plains 4 1 isotopic variability among lakes longitudinal variation in Œ¥l among lakes fig 2a b e f g appeared to arise from a combination of basin specific variation in the importance of precipitation and secondarily evaporative forcing during summer for example the high degree of similarity of lakewater Œ¥18o values and modelled Œ¥i fig 3 low estimates of e i median 0 1 fig 5b and seasonal evolution of lakewater isotope values parallel to the lmwl fig 2 suggest that temporal variability in Œ¥l was regulated mainly by site specific differences in delivery of local precipitation to lakes fig 2i however unlike other qu appelle lakes sub saline last mountain lake exhibited the effects of evaporation including generally enriched Œ¥ l values fig 3 with median e i ratios two fold greater than those in other qu appelle lakes fig 5a and isotopic evolution during summer along the lel fig 2c both these patterns are consistent with those seen in closed basin lakes in cold prairie regions e g pham et al 2009 in previous studies where lake water is subject to significant evaporative forcing either within the lake itself pham et al 2009 or before inflow enters the basin gibson and reid 2014 2010 wolfe et al 2007 isotope values usually evolve along the lel and variation among lakes mainly reflects differences in source water rain snow to individual basins yu et al 2002 instead the relatively consistent position of mean annual Œ¥l values of individual lakes along the lmwl in this study fig 2h suggests that qu appelle source waters changed progressively from headwaters to downstream sites as noted in other lake chains yu et al 2002 in particular eastern study lakes appeared to exhibit a greater reliance on summer precipitation fig 2i consistent with the greater cloud cover vogt et al 2011 and precipitation records at those locations over the past 30 years akinremi et al 1999 mccullough et al 2012 taken together these findings suggest that downstream lakes may be particularly sensitive to recently projected changes in the amount intensity and seasonality of precipitation during the 21st century asong et al 2016 bonsal et al 2017 as well as the more commonly expressed concerns about rising temperatures and variation in evaporative forcing dibike et al 2017 gan and tanzeeba 2012 paimazumder et al 2013 evaporative enrichment of lakewater isotope ratios may have contributed to longitudinal gradients of Œ¥l seen across the east west axis of the 52 000 km2 qu appelle river drainage basin fig 2a b e f g for example the observation that mean d excess cui et al 2017 decreased from 1 to values low as 16 5 table 1 while individual e i values ranged up to 0 34 suggested that evaporation also plays a role in shaping the hydrology of downstream sites fig 5 table 1 despite elevated regional precipitation mccullough et al 2012 given these observations we suggest that further modelling research may be needed to refine predictions of the relative importance of changes in evaporation and precipitation as controls of soil and surface water availability asong et al 2016 dibike et al 2017 masud et al 2017 wang et al 2018 4 2 decadal scale patterns of water source analysis of water isotopes since 2003 suggests that the reliance on snowmelt versus rain varies seasonally for many study lakes fig 3 supplementary figs 4 and 5 prior isotopic research suggests that closed basin prairie lakes in canada sampled in mid summer rely mainly on winter precipitation to persist fang et al 2007 pham et al 2009 pomeroy et al 2007 as annual precipitation deficits routinely exceed 30 cm yr 1 supplementary fig 2b in contrast the hydrologically open e i 0 1 and riverine nature of the qu appelle system was characterized by high seasonal variability in Œ¥l during spring in the smallest lakes fig 3 supplementary fig 8 likely reflecting the high variation in quantity and importance of vernal runoff to total lake volume pomeroy et al 2007 in most years the transport of winter precipitation into lakes is determined by a complex interaction between precipitation in the antecedent fall and winter soil moisture in fall and spring drainage basin size and aspect and vernal meteorology temperature wind which regulate the rate of snow melt infiltration and runoff coles et al 2017 coles and mcdonnell 2018 shook and pomeroy 2010 despite the high variation in spring runoff among years the observation that Œ¥i and Œ¥l in headwater lakes diefenbaker and buffalo pound consistently plot below the amount weighted values of precipitation fig 2 Œ¥p Œ¥18o 14 97 Œ¥2h 117 3 whereas eastern lakes katepwa crooked most often plot above Œ¥p demonstrated that there were persistent differences in the relative importance of snow and rain to individual basin hydrology such variation was even evident within a single longitudinal position for example Œ¥l of wascana lake water fig 2d 3 varied from depleted values characteristic of mid winter to those representative of only rain supplementary fig 3 even within a single year fig 3 whereas last mountain lake consistently plotted above local precipitation values a position that would traditionally be interpreted as lower reliance on snowmelt inflow remmer et al 2018 however last mountain lake was also isotopically enriched fig 2 and sub saline 1 3 g tds l 1 relative to other qu appelle lakes vogt et al 2011 2018 resulting in isotopic values evolving along a lake specific trajectory fig 2c the intersection of this basin specific evaporative line and the lmwl at 15 7 suggested that last mountain lake receives considerable inputs from local groundwater Œ¥groundwater 16 4 together these patterns indicate that local hydrologic features e g effective drainage area land use lake morphometry etc interacted with regional gradients of climate drier in west wetter in east to regulate the importance of seasonal precipitation to hydrological budgets of individual lakes the importance of winter precipitation to lake hydrology was especially evident during 2011 when the qu appelle river experienced a 1 in 140 year inundation blais et al 2016 stadnyk et al 2016 during that flood the relationship between Œ¥l and Œ¥i values was strengthened fig 4 and Œ¥i converged to a common value particularly in downstream pasqua katepwa and crooked lakes fig 3 supplementary fig 6 subsequently Œ¥i shifted towards values characteristic of local precipitation Œ¥p supplementary fig 6 a pattern consistent with meteorological records showing above average precipitation in both 2010 and 2011 supplementary fig 2 such elevated precipitation throughout the annual cycle can result in water saturated soils in fall more profound soil freezing in winter enhanced overland flow in spring and higher representation of winter precipitation in the overall hydrological budget of lakes in cold regions coles et al 2017 coles and mcdonnell 2018 shook et al 2015 4 3 seasonal variability in inflow variations in Œ¥i and Œ¥l values among seasons were greater than those among years in small and shallow qu appelle lakes table 1 fig 3 supplementary figs 5 and 6 but contrasted observations from other lake surveys brooks et al 2014 gibson et al 2018 pham et al 2009 for example while large basins such as diefenbaker and last mountain showed a limited deviation from their mean isotopic composition Œ¥Œ¥18o 1 5 smaller lakes were much more variable wascana Œ¥Œ¥18o 8 0 table 1 such a dependence of hydrological variability on lake size is not observed in all isotope studies as large lakes elsewhere e g lake chad qinghai lake exhibit over 3 variation around mean isotopic values bouchez et al 2016 cui et al 2018 wu et al 2015 thus while we infer that large or deep lakes may exhibit more constrained isotopic values due to runoff being a smaller proportion of total lake volume brooks et al 2014 gibson et al 2016b gibson and edwards 2002 further research is needed to develop a hierarchical understanding of the importance of factors other than residence time groundwater infiltration evapo transpiration etc which may influence seasonal variability of water isotopes bam and ireson 2019 observed ranges in Œ¥l values supplementary fig 5 were similar to those recorded from more northern latitudes where seasonal variation in Œ¥l can exceed 4 due to evaporative forcing gibson and reid 2014 or high connectivity of lakes with rivers brooks et al 2014 macdonald et al 2017 remmer et al 2018 wolfe et al 2007 in general small lakes in such cold regions often shift from snowmelt to rainfall dominated inflow during the ice free season reflecting the limited storage capacity of small water bodies low residence time and high seasonality of overland flow mackinnon et al 2016 tondu et al 2013 turner et al 2014 thus while last mountain lake exhibited a sudden change in isotope values associated with the vernal flood of 2011 its Œ¥l values have generally varied little within individual years figs 2 and 3 supplementary fig 5 6 consistent with its 7 year residence time based on instrumental estimates of surface inflow table 1 instead the pronounced co variance of Œ¥i and Œ¥l values in small basins figs 3 and 4 combined with their greater seasonal variation suggests that effects of short term changes in precipitation will have more profound effects on the small lakes that predominate inland waters downing et al 2006 hayashi et al 2016 this effect may be particularly pronounced in lakes of the canadian prairies and other regions of low topographic relief where catchment areas are large relative to lake surface area and effective drainage areas vary greatly with snowpack depth pomeroy et al 2007 shook et al 2015 2013 comparison of variability among months supplementary fig 8 suggests that samples collected during spring may have limited ability to predict the hydrology in shallow lakes later in the ice free period fig 5b in particular spring values were highly variable for shallow wascana and buffalo pound lakes and showed substantial enrichment during summer fig 3 resulting in underestimations of e i based on vernal sampling fig 5b although this observation is well known from rivers cui et al 2017 rosa et al 2016 smith et al 2015 many lake surveys are based on single annual samples yuan et al 2011 and rarely consider possible effects of seasonality or changes in reproducibility among years gibson and reid 2010 pham et al 2009 tyler et al 2007 the occurrence of high seasonal variability and the dependence of that variability on lake size may reduce the effectiveness of comparative studies based on different seasons or between lakes with greatly differing residence times to minimize bias and to better capture the full range of water balance we suggest that lakes with unknown residence be sampled for water isotopes at least twice once immediately after peak spring inflow and again late in summer when inflow is at a minimum 5 conclusions this paper explored a 14 year record of bi weekly water isotope analyses during the ice free period of seven hydrologically diverse lakes to quantify how Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values vary among seasons years and sites in a cold sub humid catchment in central canada seasonal patterns of water isotopes demonstrated that the importance of individual water sources changed substantially during the ice free period and as a function of landscape position with a longitudinal gradient of increasing importance of summer precipitation from west to eastern basins while the mean water balance could be captured by sub annual low resolution sampling of large basins with water residence times 1 year lakes with shorter residence required seasonal sampling to constrain both sources of water and overall water balance despite substantial precipitation deficits bonsal et al 2017 we found that water balances in all lakes were dependent mainly on water inflow during both spring runoff maximum and summer rain long term records also revealed the profound effect of extreme hydrological events spring flood which both homogenized regional Œ¥i and Œ¥l values and introduced long lived legacy effects in large basins such as last mountain lake these findings will be useful to water managers as they illustrate that the importance of future changes in precipitation regimes ahmari et al 2016 blais et al 2016 brimelow et al 2014 will be predictable on the basis of lake morphometry and geographic position within the hydrological landscape further because e i values were in the lowest 10th percentile of lakes in the prairies pham et al 2009 or boreal plains wolfe et al 2007 gibson et al 2019 we infer that qu appelle basin lakes which supply water to one third of the provincial population will be particularly sensitive to future changes in conveyance precipitation and runoff lapp et al 2013 sauchyn et al 2016 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
