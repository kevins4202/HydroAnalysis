broad spectrum antibacterial medicine of human and animal diseases 1 3 in terms of the weak metabolism of human and animal and the noneffective treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater the metabolized and original tetracycline of 60 80 are poured into the various environmental media and its detected concentration is above the environmental limits in various water bodies drawing great attention in the safety of ecosystem and human life 3 4 to eliminate tetracycline in wastewater industrial effluents and domestic sewage various techniques have been explored including photo degradation 5 6 adsorption 7 8 plasma 9 electrochemical oxidation 10 flocculation 11 biodegradation 12 and fenton oxidation 13 notably the combined strategies such as photo adsorption 14 15 photo fenton 16 18 bio electro fenton 19 bio fenton 20 and electro fenton 21 are much more efficient than the above routes alone for tetracycline removal from wastewater the key issue of these approaches is to fabricate the novel materials with excellent activity and durability biochar is a well structured carbon matrix with superior adsorption nature strong variability and large surface area serving as absorbent catalyst support and electrode 22 biochar is generally prepared via the thermo chemical synthesis of carbonaceous biomass including gasification pyrolysis hydrothermal carbonization and torrefaction biochar formed from biomass pyrolysis is affected by the type particle size moisture content of biomass reaction temperature time heating rate gas type and flow rate 23 for pyrolysis process the oxygen less or low oxygen environment restrains the generation of air pollutants such as dioxin and furane while the inert atmosphere favors the formation of char residues and liquid and gaseous by products of which the hot sources such as gases and solids and the heat transfer medium provide the heat energy of endothermic reactions 24 26 the feedstocks and synthesis process play the important impact on the quality yield and physico chemical natures of biochar containing c h s o and n elements for comparison to lignocellulosic biomass chitosan with a n rich content of about 7 wt has more functional groups such as oh and nh2 which are easily grafted crosslinked and impregnated with inorganic and organic reagents 27 28 in addition chitosan with n based functional groups such as acetamide and amine is easily converted to porous n doped biochar with abundant functional groups such as nh oh co cn ch and coc bonds the various cn bonding configurations can provide different active sites and electronic structure in catalytic system owing to the excellent ability of electron capturing over n atoms n doping affects the basic nature and electrochemical durability of n doped biochar 29 for instance n doped porous biochar generated from chitosan has sufficient o n based groups with a surface area of 50 m2 g 1 exhibiting the cr vi adsorption capacity of 190 48 mg g 1 30 honeycomb like porous carbon microspheres derived from chitosan have the ultra high surface area of 2463 9 m2 g 1 and the ultra high adsorption capacity of 1599 03 mg g 1 for methylene blue 31 n enriched porous carbon generated from chitosan at 573 k presents excellent catalytic activity for the oxidation of 5 hydroxymethylfurfural hmf to 2 5 furandicarboxylic acid with a yield of 83 32 n doped carbon has also drawn attention in photocatalysis for boosting the visible light response electronical conductivity and mass transfer 33 35 n doped carbon acting as the support of metal nanoparticles with high uniform dispersion can enhance the amounts of active sites via metal carbon bonding meanwhile n interstices and cn defects serve as the local nucleation sites of metal nanoparticles 36 owing to the dual roles of chitosan as the reducing agent for the conversion of ag ions to ag0 nanoparticles and the stabilizing agent for the high resistance to ag0 agglomeration ag agcl over n doped carbon presents the efficient visible light photodegradation of rhb 37 the highly dispersed cufeo2 particles endow the narrower band gap longer photoelectron life and stronger carrier density of cufeo2 biochar in comparison to cufeo2 and its photocatalytic activity for photo fenton degradation of tch is 2 folds than cufeo2 38 in contrast with biochar 127 7 mg g 1 69 8 and bi2moo6 13 3 mg g 1 31 6 bi2moo6 biochar with a bi2moo6 content of 20 has better adsorption capacity 160 6 mg g 1 and removal efficiency of methylene blue 93 3 due to its narrow band gap and efficient charge separation 39 znfe2o4 b n codoped biochar 26 and la2s3 s n codoped biochar 15 also exhibit the better adsorption photocatalytic activity for tch removal hence biochar with nonmetallic doping and semiconductors coupling can enhance the adsorption and visible light photocatalytic activity as a two dimensional layered metal sulfide the photocatalytic activity of mos2 with a narrow band gap 1 9 ev is greatly related with the naked edge sites which is constructed via the enlarging inter layer space and the suppressing layer numbers 40 41 the in situ sulfurization is a useful route to expose the active edge sites for photons capturing and pollutants adsorption due to the high dispersion and abundant edge sites 2d mos2 carbon nanodots have ultrahigh adsorption rate and capacity for methylene blue within 1 min 1136 9 mg g 1 42 mos2 coupling with phytic acid amended biochar heterojunction follows the pseudo second order kinetic and monolayered adsorption for u vi with a capacity of 161 29 mg g 1 which further enlarges to 204 08 mg g 1 via the h2 non thermal plasma due to the sulfur defects as the vacant sites 43 in addition noble metal doped mos2 can enhance the electrical conductivity and adsorption capacity due to the new peaks of fermi level for the efficient migration of electrons from adsorbent to mos2 matrix 44 for pt doped mos2 s defects act as the electron transfer media for breaking the electrons transfer barriers between co2 molecules and bulks surface and pt atoms as the enriched delocalized electrons favor the formation of active sites 45 polydimethylsiloxane modified mos2 carbon has superior oleophilic and hydrophobic natures for boosting the oil absorption capacity and durability of 98 5 v v 1 and the adsorption photocatalysis activity of organic dye 46 due to the excellent thermal and electrical natures of go for the efficient charge separation z scheme go mos2 ag3po4 junction has superior photocatalytic activity of n2 fixation 47 based the discussion about the excellent physicochemical nature of mos2 carbon composites it s essential to evaluate the adsorption photocatalytic behaviors of mos2 s n codoped porous biochar derived from chitosan the aim of this work is to in situ fabricate mos2 sn bc derived from chitosan for improving the adsorption photocatalytic removal of tch mos2 combined with porous biochar with s n codoping can expose abundant edge sites for pollutants adsorption and photons harvesting the tight junction interface between s defected mos2 and s n codoped porous biochar favors the electrons transfer and mobility extending the visible light response the adsorption photocatalytic behaviors and mechanism of mos2 sn bc are investigated 2 experimental 2 1 preparation of biochar based composites mos2 sn bc composites were fabricated via the in situ sulfurization typically 1 0 g chitosan 0 05 g melamine c3h6n6 and 0 03 g sodium molybdate na2moo4 2h2o were dispersed into 100 ml deionized water and then dried at 353 k to remove water after dried at 353 k for 6 h the above precursor and 1 0 g naoh were mixed in a mortar then transferred into a tube furnace and further heated to 873 k with a heating rate of 5 k min 1 and a h2s ar 20 wt flow rate of 30 ml min 1 after treated at 873 k for 3 h the sample was cooled down to room temperature washed with deionized water for three times and dried at 353 k for 6 h to obtain 1 mos2 sn bc x mos2 sn bc x 2 3 4 and 5 composites with various mos2 content were prepared using 0 06 0 12 0 18 and 0 24 g na2moo4 2h2o for the comparative evaluation of adsorption photocatalytic behaviors s bc sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc were also prepared 2 2 adsorption photocatalytic testing the adsorption photocatalytic performances of mos2 sn bc composites in tch removal were carried out 40 mg bulks were dispersed into 100 ml tch solution of 180 mg l 1 and stirred at 298 k to evaluate the adsorption kinetics and dispersed into 110 210 mg l 1 tch solution to analyze the adsorption isotherms s2 supported information in the photocatalytic system 40 mg bulks are added to 100 ml tch solution of 180 mg l 1 then stirred in dark for 1 5 h to reach the balance of adsorption desorption and further irradiated with xe lamp 300 mw cm 2 after irradiated for every 10 min 2 ml solution was sampled filtered detected on an agilent 1260 hplc with an ultraviolet detector of 280 nm and a 5 μm 4 6 250 mm venusil hilic column the obtained sample was transferred to a 50 ml volumetric flsk and then diluted into 50 ml with 0 01 mol l 1 hcl solution for mobile phase the volume ratios of 0 1 mol l 1 ammonium oxalate dimethylformamide and 0 2 mol l 1 ammonium dihydrogen phosphate are 68 27 5 which is adjusted to ph of 8 3 using 25 0 wt ammonia solution 20 μl diluted tch solution was sampled and analyzed with the mobile phase of 1 0 ml min 1 and the column temperature of 308 k the reproducibility of lab scale tests was repeated for three times with

discussion chitosan is easily decomposed into n doped biochar and volatile species including co h2o co2 ch4 ch3cooh pyrazines and nh3 under inert atmosphere 48 49 considering the efficient conversion of h2s into s s2 and hs at high temperature h2s n2 mixture is favorable for the pyrolysis of chitosan to form s n codoped biochar with functional sh nh sc and n c nc groups 15 25 50 with the assistance of melamine n contents of 3 mos2 sn bc and sn bc table s1 are respectively higher than 3 mos2 s bc and s bc na2moo4 2h2o is converted to na2o mos2 and h2o and koh is transferred into k2o and h2o under h2s n2 atmosphere of which na2o and k2o are likely to construct porous structure of biochar however n atoms in chitosan and melamine are seriously consumed by h2o inducing to the less n contents of mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc than s bc and sn bc sem images fig 1 indicate that these bc based samples are porous and amorphous morphology for comparison to s bc fig 1a and b sn bc fig 1c and d has much more porous structure due to the decomposition of melamine into nox and nh3 around the chitosan surface for suppressing the rapid pyrolysis of chitosan tem images further confirm that s bc fig 2a c and sn bc fig 2d f are amorphous structure without lattice fringe there are many nanoparticles loading on the surface and porous channels of 3 mos2 s bc fig 1e and f and 3 mos2 sn bc fig 1g and h which are also confirmed by tem fig 2g l the lattice fringes of 0 62 nm indexed as 002 plane of mos2 phase appear at 3 mos2 s bc fig 2i and 3 mos2 sn bc fig 2l the broad and weak peak ranged from 20 to 30 in xrd patterns of s bc and sn bc fig 3a is assigned to 002 plane of graphitic carbon with low crystalline the peaks of 3 mos2 s bc and 3 mos2 sn bc at 14 31 32 85 39 56 44 05 49 38 58 29 60 23 68 84 and 72 71 are ascribed to 002 100 103 006 105 110 008 201 and 203 facets of hexagonal mos2 phases jcpds 75 1539 respectively the peaks at 39 56 44 05 60 23 68 84 72 71 and 76 38 are indexed as 0210 511 555 717 1713 and 488 planes of orthorhombic sulfur phases jcpds 77 0145 respectively the overlap effects of mos2 and s phases induce to the shift of their diffraction peaks in comparison to the corresponding standard cards 51 52 the broad band of s bc sn bc 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc around 3438 cm 1 fig 3b is the stretching vibration of nh and oh groups the weak peaks at 2923 2857 and 1398 cm 1 are the ch stretching vibration and the peak at 1610 cm 1 is indexed to c o c cn no or co stretching the peaks at 1200 1148 and 1049 cm 1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of cn cs and co groups respectively the peak of s bc and sn bc at 624 cm 1 is ss stretching and that of 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc is assigned to ss or mos bond ft ir spectra of these samples suggest that the abundant o n and s functional groups locate at the surface of bc based composites in form of amine hydroxyl amide and sulfonic groups and even mos bond exists in 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc s bc sn bc 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc fig 3c present the iv type hysteresis loop of physical adsorption generating the micro pore and meso pores owing to the shielding effect of melamine for weakening the pyrolysis rate of chitosan the surface area of s bc 537 44 m2 g 1 is lower than sn bc 545 24 m2 g 1 and the surface area of 3 mos2 s bc 384 71 m2 g 1 is lower than 3 mos2 sn bc 571 18 m2 g 1 table s1 the climbing mos2 content located on the surface and porous channels of s n codoped biochar induces to the decreasing surface area of mos2 sn bc composites from 798 73 to 357 83 m2 g 1 the pore volume values of mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc composites are higher than s bc and sn bc while the pore diameter values of these bc based composites are slightly affected due to the pore forming effect of koh although the large surface area can provide much more vacant sites for pollutants adsorption the adsorption activities of these bc based samples for tch are intensively affected by functional groups and surface charge nature zeta potential curves fig 3d indicate that s bc sn bc 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc are the negative surface charge at ph range of 3 0 10 0 which are prefer to absorb anionic pollutants via the electrostatic attraction s bc sn bc 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc fig 3e exhibit visible light absorption due to the narrow band gap structure for efficient photons capturing the band gap energy eg of is estimated by the plots of αhv 2 versus hv as listed in table s2 eg values of s bc sn bc 3 mos2 s bc and 3 mos2 sn bc are 2 64 2 29 2 47 and 2 38 ev respectively the positive tangent slopes of mott schottky curves fig 3f suggest that these bc based samples are n type semiconductors the conduction band energy ecb is the sum value between flat band potentials efb and 0 197 and the valence band energy evb is the sum value between eg and ecb table s2 for comparison to s bc 2 49 ev 0 15 ev the evb and ecb values of 3 mos2 sn bc shift to 1 60 and 0 78 ev while these corresponding values of sn bc change to 1 59 and 0 70 ev respectively it s indicated that mos2 and n doping can change the band gap structure of s bc the photo current intensity of sn bc is stronger than s bc and further strengthened by mos2 forming the strongest photo current of 3 mos2 sn bc fig 3g it s ascribed to the close knit interface between sn bc and mos2 for rapid charge separation and migration and the capturing effect of sn bc for photo excited electrons in photocatalytic system 53 54 the arc radius of electrochemical impedance spectra fig 3h and pl intensity fig 3i of 3 mos2 sn bc is smaller than 3 mos2 s bc sn bc and s bc meaning its stronger separation efficiency and the higher resistance to the recombination of charge carriers 55 there are c s n and o elements in xps survey spectra of sn bc 3 mos2 s bc and 3 mos2 sn bc fig 4a mo element appears at 3 mos2 s bc and 3 mos2 sn bc further confirming the formation of mos2 s bc and mos2 sn bc composites for mo 3d fig 4b the splitting peaks of 3 mos2 s bc at 231 95 and 228 89 ev respectively correspond to mo 3d3 2 and mo 3d5 2 of mo4 in mos2 and its peak at 226 31 ev is ascribed to the presence of s2 meaning the formation of s defects 56 57 however these mo 3d peaks of 3 mos2 sn bc shift to 232 01 228 89 and 226 50 ev respectively the dissociated c 1s peaks of 3 mos2 s bc and sn bc at 285 19 and 284 14 ev fig 4c are respectively indexed as c n c s c o and co bonds which shift to 258 19 and 284 23 ev in c 1s xps spectrum of 3 mos2 sn bc 58 59 for s 2p fig 4d the divided peaks of sn bc at 164 41 and 163 31 ev are respectively indexed as s 2p1 2 and s 2p3 2 and the corresponding peak at 167 52 ev is due to so bond of so4 2 or so3 2 15 due to the coexistence of s and mos2 s 2p1 2 and s 2p3 2 peaks of mos2 in s 2p xps spectrum of 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 n bc appear at 163 12 and 161 78 ev and the s 2p1 2 and s 2p3 2 peaks of s locate at 164 41 and 163 12 ev 60 61 the peak of 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 n bc belonged to so bond changes to 167 87 and 167 81 ev respectively for n 1s fig 4e the splitting peaks of sn bc at 403 91 400 66 and 398 32 ev are indexed as c nh2 tertiary n c 3 and c n c bonds respectively 62 63 these n 1s peaks of 3 mos2 n bc generated from chitosan shift to 403 90 400 11 and 398 68 ev while the corresponding n 1s peaks of 3 mos2 sn bc migrate to 404 22 399 94 and 398 78 ev respectively for o 1s fig 4f the splitting peaks of sn bc at 531 83 and 530 72 ev are assigned to coh and co bonds respectively 30 these o 1s peaks of 3 mos2 n bc shift to 531 83 and 530 92 ev while the corresponding peaks of 3 mos2 sn bc change to 532 05 and 530 95 ev respectively the difference in valance states of surface compositions induces to the various adsorption and photocatalytic activities of bc based composites for tch removal the adsorption photocatalytic behaviors of bc based samples were performed in the removal tch of 180 mg l 1 owing to the large surface area for providing abundant vacant sites and the functional groups such as so coh and c nh2 for the selective chemisorption sn bc has better adsorption activity in comparison to s bc table s3 the rich edge sites of mos2 can efficiently enlarge the adsorption capacity of mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc composites with an increase in mos2 content the adsorption activity of mos2 sn bc increases from 76 17 to 84 98 and then decreases to 74 77 3 mos2 sn bc with a mo content of 12 69 has the best adsorption capacity 84 98 among these obtained samples for comparison the photocatalytic activity of mos2 sn bc is lower than the corresponding adsorption activity due to the efficient adsorption over active sites hampering the photons capture at active sites and the intermediates diffusion from bulks surface to aqueous solution 64 65 compared with s bc sn bc has higher photocatalytic activity leading to the better removal efficiency of tch fig 5a a similar result is obtained by 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc although the photocatalytic activity of mos2 sn bc climbs with the enlarged amount of edge active sites mos2 clusters generated by excess mo content induce to the inferior active sites for inhibiting the photocatalytic activity fig 5b notably the combined efficient between adsorption and photocatalysis can enhance the removal efficiency of tch fig 5c of which 3 mos2 sn bc can remove 97 99 tch within 150 min under solar light irradiation the removal efficiency of pollutants from real wastewater are generally affected by inorganic salts and organic matters especially high concentration of tch solution the impurities in real water hamper the mass transfer of tch molecules in solid liquid phases and the photons capture of active sites for instance inorganic salts are competitively adsorbed on the active sites and change the ph value affecting the adsorption and photocatalytic performances table s4 nacl mgcl2 and na2so4 slightly reduce the adsorption and photocatalytic activities of 3 mos2 sn bc fig 5d and e due to the existence of fe2 fe3 redox couples in tch solution fecl3 presents the declined adsorption activity and the climbed photocatalytic activity however the hydrolytic conversion of po4 3 into hpo4 2 h2po4 and oh restrains the adsorption photocatalytic activity compared with 3 mos2 sn bc alone for tch removal 97 99 the addition of fecl3 presents the better removal efficiency 99 38 while the presence of na3po4 has the lower removal activity 91 51 considering that tch respectively presents anionic tch and tc2 zwitterionic and cationic tch3 species at ph 7 7 3 3 7 7 and 3 3 the negative surface charge of 3 mos2 sn bc is favorable for tch adsorption at ph 7 7 via the electrostatic attraction while is not suitable for tch adsorption at ph 7 7 due to the electrostatic repulsion 66 67 when ph 7 0 oh ions in liquid solid film around bulk surface hamper the adsorption of tch and tc2 on the active sites table s5 with the climbing ph the photocatalytic activity of 3 mos2 sn bc fig 5f as well as the removal efficiency of tch fig 5g increases and then decreases due to the excess of h and oh for scavenging e and h 68 the quenchers such as kbro3 p bq edta 2na and t buoh are likely to retrain the adsorption and photocatalytic performances of 3 mos2 sn bc in tch removal table s6 in contrast with pure 3 mos2 sn bc kbro3 and p bq fig 5h induce to the worse photocatalytic activity it s suggested that e and o2 are vital for the photocatalytic activity of 3 mos2 sn bc for the cycle testing of 3 mos2 sn bc the used sample was regenerated with 0 05 mol l 1 hcl solution and deionized water for three times and dried at 353 k for 6 h the adsorption efficiency of 3 mos2 sn bc as well as the removal efficiency of tch declines after five cycles fig 5i meaning its excellent adsorption photocatalytic durability s defected mos2 with narrow band gap structure and sufficient edge sites usually acts as the co catalyst for photocatalytic reaction leading to the lower photocatalytic activity than adsorption activity of 3 mos2 sn bc hence it s essential to evaluate the adsorption isotherms and kinetics of 3 mos2 sn bc for tch removal for comparison to temkin and freundlich isotherms langmuir is better to match with the adsorption isotherms of sn bc 3 mos2 s bc 3 mos2 sn bc and s bc fig 6 it s ascribed to the higher determination r2 and the lower average relative error are of langmuir isotherm the lower separation factor rl values table s7 further confirm the excellent description of langmuir for the adsorption isotherms of bc based composites 4 26 tch molecules are adsorbed on the surface and in porous channels of these samples via the mono layered adsorption estimated from langmuir isotherm table s7 qe value of 3 mos2 sn bc 474 76 mg g 1 is higher than s bc 30 83 mg g 1 sn bc 333 98 mg g 1 and 3 mos2 sn bc 400 85 mg g 1 meaning the excellent adsorption capacity of 3 mos2 sn bc hence the combined effect of mos2 and s n codoping is favorable for boosting the adsorption capacity of biochar the adsorption kinetics of s bc and sn bc fig 7 are well matched with second order model instead of first order model due to the lower age and higher r2 values table s8 similar results are obtained by the adsorption kinetics of 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc for tch adsorption the qe values of 3 mos2 sn bc sn bc and s bc calculated from second order model table s8 are respectively 390 27 285 40 and 36 88 mg g 1 which are closer to the corresponding tested values it s further indicated that mos2 coupling with s n codoping can greatly enhance the adsorption activity of biochar considering the curves of infra particle diffusion models without going through the origin the adsorption steps of these samples are determined by the boundary and infra particle diffusion 4 39 the adsorption behaviors of mos2 sn bc sn bc and s bc samples via the boundary and infra particle diffusion are greatly affected by the compositions of adsorbent and experimental parameters such as inorganic salts ph adsorbent content and pollutant concentration generally the high adsorbent content and the low pollutant concentration are favorable for the adsorption due to the sufficient vacant sites and finite pollutant molecules the emulative adsorption of inorganic salts at vacant sites hampers the adsorption process of targeted pollutants adsorbent with optimal compositions can obtain the maximal adsorption capacity and activity under the optimizing conditions leading to the better adsorption capacity for tch removal compared with the previous works table s9 the functional groups over 3 mos2 sn bc fig 8 mainly contain c nh2 sh mos and cooh via the high temperature sulfurization of h2s n2 atmosphere in addition cs cn no so c oh and co bonds exist in 3 mos2 sn bc typically n doped biochar has pyrrolic n graphitic n and pyridinic n types via the covalent bonding between n and c atoms pyrrolic n and pyridinic n atoms are respectively bonded with two c atoms with sp3 and sp2 configuration and graphitic n is bonded with three c atoms with sp2 configuration these groups favor the formation of negative surface charge of 3 mos2 sn bc tch molecules have three species in aqueous at various ph including cation tch3 at ph 3 3 zwitterion at ph of 3 3 7 7 and anion tch and tc2 at ph 7 7 the large surface area and porous structure as well as s defected mos2 can provide sufficient active sites for the adsorption of cationic and zwitterionic species at ph 7 7 especially at ph 3 3 via the electrostatic attraction in addition the hydrogen bond interaction such as nh sh and oh bonds play the important role in the adsorption of tch molecules the efficient adsorption activity promotes the photocatalytic reaction in visible light region ecb values of sn bc and mos2 are respectively 0 70 and 0 42 ev which are more negative than the potential value of o2 o2 0 33 ev 41 51 their corresponding ecb values are respectively 1 59 and 1 10 ev which are smaller than the potential value of oh oh 1 99 ev 41 51 mos2 combined with sn bc can form 3 mos2 sn bc junction with ecb value of 0 78 ev and evb value of 1 60 ev which is not favorable for generating oh but suitable for forming o2 under solar light irradiation it s confirmed by the quenching test fig 5h although oh is difficult to react with h to generate oh o2 in the acidic aqueous solution is converted to ho2 and even h2o2 and o2 by h and h2o2 is further transformed into oh and oh 69 the abundant active sites generated from functional groups and the rich edge sites formed by s defected mos2 favor the photons capture meanwhile the junction interface between mos2 and sn bc enlarge the separation and migration of e h pairs boosting the formation of active species in photocatalytic process 52 57 these active species are likely to decompose tch molecules into small molecules and intermediates the adsorption coupling with photocatalysis over low cost biochar based materials is a potential technology of sewage treatment 4 conclusion in contrast with s bc sn bc and 3 mos2 sn bc 3 mos2 sn bc has the better adsorption capacity 382 43 mg g 1 and removal efficiency 97 99 for tch removal langmuir and second order models well describe the adsorption isotherms and kinetics of bc based composites respectively the enlarged adsorption capacity of mos2 sn bc composites are ascribed to the sufficient vacant sites generated from functional groups rich edge sites of mos2 electrostatic attraction and h bond interaction the excellent photocatalytic activity is attributed to the narrow band gap for efficient visible light response and the tight interface for the rapid separation and migration of charge

the safety of ecosystem and human life 3 4 to eliminate tetracycline in wastewater industrial effluents and domestic sewage various techniques have been explored including photo degradation 5 6 adsorption 7 8 plasma 9 electrochemical oxidation 10 flocculation 11 biodegradation 12 and fenton oxidation 13 notably the combined strategies such as photo adsorption 14 15 photo fenton 16 18 bio electro fenton 19 bio fenton 20 and electro fenton 21 are much more efficient than the above routes alone for tetracycline removal from wastewater the key issue of these approaches is to fabricate the novel materials with excellent activity and durability biochar is a well structured carbon matrix with superior adsorption nature strong variability and large surface area serving as absorbent catalyst support and electrode 22 biochar is generally prepared via the thermo chemical synthesis of carbonaceous biomass including gasification pyrolysis hydrothermal carbonization and torrefaction biochar formed from biomass pyrolysis is affected by the type particle size moisture content of biomass reaction temperature time heating rate gas type and flow rate 23 for pyrolysis process the oxygen less or low oxygen environment restrains the generation of air pollutants such as dioxin and furane while the inert atmosphere favors the formation of char residues and liquid and gaseous by products of which the hot sources such as gases and solids and the heat transfer medium provide the heat energy of endothermic reactions 24 26 the feedstocks and synthesis process play the important impact on the quality yield and physico chemical natures of biochar containing c h s o and n elements for comparison to lignocellulosic biomass chitosan with a n rich content of about 7 wt has more functional groups such as oh and nh2 which are easily grafted crosslinked and impregnated with inorganic and organic reagents 27 28 in addition chitosan with n based functional groups such as acetamide and amine is easily converted to porous n doped biochar with abundant functional groups such as nh oh co cn ch and coc bonds the various cn bonding configurations can provide different active sites and electronic structure in catalytic system owing to the excellent ability of electron capturing over n atoms n doping affects the basic nature and electrochemical durability of n doped biochar 29 for instance n doped porous biochar generated from chitosan has sufficient o n based groups with a surface area of 50 m2 g 1 exhibiting the cr vi adsorption capacity of 190 48 mg g 1 30 honeycomb like porous carbon microspheres derived from chitosan have the ultra high surface area of 2463 9 m2 g 1 and the ultra high adsorption capacity of 1599 03 mg g 1 for methylene blue 31 n enriched porous carbon generated from chitosan at 573 k presents excellent catalytic activity for the oxidation of 5 hydroxymethylfurfural hmf to 2 5 furandicarboxylic acid with a yield of 83 32 n doped carbon has also drawn attention in photocatalysis for boosting the visible light response electronical conductivity and mass transfer 33 35 n doped carbon acting as the support of metal nanoparticles with high uniform dispersion can enhance the amounts of active sites via metal carbon bonding meanwhile n interstices and cn defects serve as the local nucleation sites of metal nanoparticles 36 owing to the dual roles of chitosan as the reducing agent for the conversion of ag ions to ag0 nanoparticles and the stabilizing agent for the high resistance to ag0 agglomeration ag agcl over n doped carbon presents the efficient visible light photodegradation of rhb 37 the highly dispersed cufeo2 particles endow the narrower band gap longer photoelectron life and stronger carrier density of cufeo2 biochar in comparison to cufeo2 and its photocatalytic activity for photo fenton degradation of tch is 2 folds than cufeo2 38 in contrast with biochar 127 7 mg g 1 69 8 and bi2moo6 13 3 mg g 1 31 6 bi2moo6 biochar with a bi2moo6 content of 20 has better adsorption capacity 160 6 mg g 1 and removal efficiency of methylene blue 93 3 due to its narrow band gap and efficient charge separation 39 znfe2o4 b n codoped biochar 26 and la2s3 s n codoped biochar 15 also exhibit the better adsorption photocatalytic activity for tch removal hence biochar with nonmetallic doping and semiconductors coupling can enhance the adsorption and visible light photocatalytic activity as a two dimensional layered metal sulfide the photocatalytic activity of mos2 with a narrow band gap 1 9 ev is greatly related with the naked edge sites which is constructed via the enlarging inter layer space and the suppressing layer numbers 40 41 the in situ sulfurization is a useful route to expose the active edge sites for photons capturing and pollutants adsorption due to the high dispersion and abundant edge sites 2d mos2 carbon nanodots have ultrahigh adsorption rate and capacity for methylene blue within 1 min 1136 9 mg g 1 42 mos2 coupling with phytic acid amended biochar heterojunction follows the pseudo second order kinetic and monolayered adsorption for u vi with a capacity of 161 29 mg g 1 which further enlarges to 204 08 mg g 1 via the h2 non thermal plasma due to the sulfur defects as the vacant sites 43 in addition noble metal doped mos2 can enhance the electrical conductivity and adsorption capacity due to the new peaks of fermi level for the efficient migration of electrons from adsorbent to mos2 matrix 44 for pt doped mos2 s defects act as the electron transfer media for breaking the electrons transfer barriers between co2 molecules and bulks surface and pt atoms as the enriched delocalized electrons favor the formation of active sites 45 polydimethylsiloxane modified mos2 carbon has superior oleophilic and hydrophobic natures for boosting the oil absorption capacity and durability of 98 5 v v 1 and the adsorption photocatalysis activity of organic dye 46 due to the excellent thermal and electrical natures of go for the efficient charge separation z scheme go mos2 ag3po4 junction has superior photocatalytic activity of n2 fixation 47 based the discussion about the excellent physicochemical nature of mos2 carbon composites it s essential to evaluate the adsorption photocatalytic behaviors of mos2 s n codoped porous biochar derived from chitosan the aim of this work is to in situ fabricate mos2 sn bc derived from chitosan for improving the adsorption photocatalytic removal of tch mos2 combined with porous biochar with s n codoping can expose abundant edge sites for pollutants adsorption and photons harvesting the tight junction interface between s defected mos2 and s n codoped porous biochar favors the electrons transfer and mobility extending the visible light response the adsorption photocatalytic behaviors and mechanism of mos2 sn bc are investigated 2 experimental 2 1 preparation of biochar

three times and dried at 353 k for 6 h to obtain 1 mos2 sn bc x mos2 sn bc x 2 3 4 and 5 composites with various mos2 content were prepared using 0 06 0 12 0 18 and 0 24 g na2moo4 2h2o for the comparative evaluation of adsorption photocatalytic behaviors s bc sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc were also prepared 2 2 adsorption photocatalytic testing the adsorption photocatalytic performances of mos2 sn bc composites in tch removal were carried out 40 mg bulks were dispersed into 100 ml tch solution of 180 mg l 1 and stirred at 298 k to evaluate the adsorption kinetics and dispersed into 110 210 mg l 1 tch solution to analyze the adsorption isotherms s2 supported information in the photocatalytic system 40 mg bulks are added to 100 ml tch solution of 180 mg l 1 then stirred in dark for 1 5 h to reach the balance of adsorption desorption and further irradiated with xe lamp 300 mw cm 2 after irradiated for every 10 min 2 ml solution was sampled filtered detected on an agilent 1260 hplc with an ultraviolet detector of 280 nm and a 5 μm 4 6 250 mm venusil hilic column the obtained sample was transferred to a 50 ml volumetric flsk and then diluted into 50 ml with 0 01 mol l 1 hcl solution for

discussion chitosan is easily decomposed into n doped biochar and volatile species including co h2o co2 ch4 ch3cooh pyrazines and nh3 under inert atmosphere 48 49 considering the efficient conversion of h2s into s s2 and hs at high temperature h2s n2 mixture is favorable for the pyrolysis of chitosan to form s n codoped biochar with functional sh nh sc and n c nc groups 15 25 50 with the assistance of melamine n contents of 3 mos2 sn bc and sn bc table s1 are respectively higher than 3 mos2 s bc and s bc na2moo4 2h2o is converted to na2o mos2 and h2o and koh is transferred into k2o and h2o under h2s n2 atmosphere of which na2o and k2o are likely to construct porous structure of biochar however n atoms in chitosan and melamine are seriously consumed by h2o inducing to the less n contents of mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc than s bc and sn bc sem images fig 1 indicate that these bc based samples are porous and amorphous morphology for comparison to s bc fig 1a and b sn bc fig 1c and d has much more porous structure due to the decomposition of melamine into nox and nh3 around the chitosan surface for suppressing the rapid pyrolysis of chitosan tem images further confirm that s bc fig 2a c and sn bc fig 2d f are amorphous structure without lattice fringe there are many nanoparticles loading on the surface and porous channels of 3 mos2 s bc fig 1e and f and 3 mos2 sn bc fig 1g and h which are also confirmed by tem fig 2g l the lattice fringes of 0 62 nm indexed as 002 plane of mos2 phase appear at 3 mos2 s bc fig 2i and 3 mos2 sn bc fig 2l the broad and weak peak ranged from 20 to 30 in xrd patterns of s bc and sn bc fig 3a is assigned to 002 plane of graphitic carbon with low crystalline the peaks of 3 mos2 s bc and 3 mos2 sn bc at 14 31 32 85 39 56 44 05 49 38 58 29 60 23 68 84 and 72 71 are ascribed to 002 100 103 006 105 110 008 201 and 203 facets of hexagonal mos2 phases jcpds 75 1539 respectively the peaks at 39 56 44 05 60 23 68 84 72 71 and 76 38 are indexed as 0210 511 555 717 1713 and 488 planes of orthorhombic sulfur phases jcpds 77 0145 respectively the overlap effects of mos2 and s phases induce to the shift of their diffraction peaks in comparison to the corresponding standard cards 51 52 the broad band of s bc sn bc 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc around 3438 cm 1 fig 3b is the stretching vibration of nh and oh groups the weak peaks at 2923 2857 and 1398 cm 1 are the ch stretching vibration and the peak at 1610 cm 1 is indexed to c o c cn no or co stretching the peaks at 1200 1148 and 1049 cm 1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of cn cs and co groups respectively the peak of s bc and sn bc at 624 cm 1 is ss stretching and that of 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc is assigned to ss or mos bond ft ir spectra of these samples suggest that the abundant o n and s functional groups locate at the surface of bc based composites in form of amine hydroxyl amide and sulfonic groups and even mos bond exists in 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc s bc sn bc 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc fig 3c present the iv type hysteresis loop of physical adsorption generating the micro pore and meso pores owing to the shielding effect of melamine for weakening the pyrolysis rate of chitosan the surface area of s bc 537 44 m2 g 1 is lower than sn bc 545 24 m2 g 1 and the surface area of 3 mos2 s bc 384 71 m2 g 1 is lower than 3 mos2 sn bc 571 18 m2 g 1 table s1 the climbing mos2 content located on the surface and porous channels of s n codoped biochar induces to the decreasing surface area of mos2 sn bc composites from 798 73 to 357 83 m2 g 1 the pore volume values of mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc composites are higher than s bc and sn bc while the pore diameter values of these bc based composites are slightly affected due to the pore forming effect of koh although the large surface area can provide much more vacant sites for pollutants adsorption the adsorption activities of these bc based samples for tch are intensively affected by functional groups and surface charge nature zeta potential curves fig 3d indicate that s bc sn bc 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc are the negative surface charge at ph range of 3 0 10 0 which are prefer to absorb anionic pollutants via the electrostatic attraction s bc sn bc 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc fig 3e exhibit visible light absorption due to the narrow band gap structure for efficient photons capturing the band gap energy eg of is estimated by the plots of αhv 2 versus hv as listed in table s2 eg values of s bc sn bc 3 mos2 s bc and 3 mos2 sn bc are 2 64 2 29 2 47 and 2 38 ev respectively the positive tangent slopes of mott schottky curves fig 3f suggest that these bc based samples are n type semiconductors the conduction band energy ecb is the sum value between flat band potentials efb and 0 197 and the valence band energy evb is the sum value between eg and ecb table s2 for comparison to s bc 2 49 ev 0 15 ev the evb and ecb values of 3 mos2 sn bc shift to 1 60 and 0 78 ev while these corresponding values of sn bc change to 1 59 and 0 70 ev respectively it s indicated that mos2 and n doping can change the band gap structure of s bc the photo current intensity of sn bc is stronger than s bc and further strengthened by mos2 forming the strongest photo current of 3 mos2 sn bc fig 3g it s ascribed to the close knit interface between sn bc and mos2 for rapid charge separation and migration and the capturing effect of sn bc for photo excited electrons in photocatalytic system 53 54 the arc radius of electrochemical impedance spectra fig 3h and pl intensity fig 3i of 3 mos2 sn bc is smaller than 3 mos2 s bc sn bc and s bc meaning its stronger separation efficiency and the higher resistance to the recombination of charge carriers 55 there are c s n and o elements in xps survey spectra of sn bc 3 mos2 s bc and 3 mos2 sn bc fig 4a mo element appears at 3 mos2 s bc and 3 mos2 sn bc further confirming the formation of mos2 s bc and mos2 sn bc composites for mo 3d fig 4b the splitting peaks of 3 mos2 s bc at 231 95 and 228 89 ev respectively correspond to mo 3d3 2 and mo 3d5 2 of mo4 in mos2 and its peak at 226 31 ev is ascribed to the presence of s2 meaning the formation of s defects 56 57 however these mo 3d peaks of 3 mos2 sn bc shift to 232 01 228 89 and 226 50 ev respectively the dissociated c 1s peaks of 3 mos2 s bc and sn bc at 285 19 and 284 14 ev fig 4c are respectively indexed as c n c s c o and co bonds which shift to 258 19 and 284 23 ev in c 1s xps spectrum of 3 mos2 sn bc 58 59 for s 2p fig 4d the divided peaks of sn bc at 164 41 and 163 31 ev are respectively indexed as s 2p1 2 and s 2p3 2 and the corresponding peak at 167 52 ev is due to so bond of so4 2 or so3 2 15 due to the coexistence of s and mos2 s 2p1 2 and s 2p3 2 peaks of mos2 in s 2p xps spectrum of 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 n bc appear at 163 12 and 161 78 ev and the s 2p1 2 and s 2p3 2 peaks of s locate at 164 41 and 163 12 ev 60 61 the peak of 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 n bc belonged to so bond changes to 167 87 and 167 81 ev respectively for n 1s fig 4e the splitting peaks of sn bc at 403 91 400 66 and 398 32 ev are indexed as c nh2 tertiary n c 3 and c n c bonds respectively 62 63 these n 1s peaks of 3 mos2 n bc generated from chitosan shift to 403 90 400 11 and 398 68 ev while the corresponding n 1s peaks of 3 mos2 sn bc migrate to 404 22 399 94 and 398 78 ev respectively for o 1s fig 4f the splitting peaks of sn bc at 531 83 and 530 72 ev are assigned to coh and co bonds respectively 30 these o 1s peaks of 3 mos2 n bc shift to 531 83 and 530 92 ev while the corresponding peaks of 3 mos2 sn bc change to 532 05 and 530 95 ev respectively the difference in valance states of surface compositions induces to the various adsorption and photocatalytic activities of bc based composites for tch removal the adsorption photocatalytic behaviors of bc based samples were performed in the removal tch of 180 mg l 1 owing to the large surface area for providing abundant vacant sites and the functional groups such as so coh and c nh2 for the selective chemisorption sn bc has better adsorption activity in comparison to s bc table s3 the rich edge sites of mos2 can efficiently enlarge the adsorption capacity of mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc composites with an increase in mos2 content the adsorption activity of mos2 sn bc increases from 76 17 to 84 98 and then decreases to 74 77 3 mos2 sn bc with a mo content of 12 69 has the best adsorption capacity 84 98 among these obtained samples for comparison the photocatalytic activity of mos2 sn bc is lower than the corresponding adsorption activity due to the efficient adsorption over active sites hampering the photons capture at active sites and the intermediates diffusion from bulks surface to aqueous solution 64 65 compared with s bc sn bc has higher photocatalytic activity leading to the better removal efficiency of tch fig 5a a similar result is obtained by 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc although the photocatalytic activity of mos2 sn bc climbs with the enlarged amount of edge active sites mos2 clusters generated by excess mo content induce to the inferior active sites for inhibiting the photocatalytic activity fig 5b notably the combined efficient between adsorption and photocatalysis can enhance the removal efficiency of tch fig 5c of which 3 mos2 sn bc can remove 97 99 tch within 150 min under solar light irradiation the removal efficiency of pollutants from real wastewater are generally affected by inorganic salts and organic matters especially high concentration of tch solution the impurities in real water hamper the mass transfer of tch molecules in solid liquid phases and the photons capture of active sites for instance inorganic salts are competitively adsorbed on the active sites and change the ph value affecting the adsorption and photocatalytic performances table s4 nacl mgcl2 and na2so4 slightly reduce the adsorption and photocatalytic activities of 3 mos2 sn bc fig 5d and e due to the existence of fe2 fe3 redox couples in tch solution fecl3 presents the declined adsorption activity and the climbed photocatalytic activity however the hydrolytic conversion of po4 3 into hpo4 2 h2po4 and oh restrains the adsorption photocatalytic activity compared with 3 mos2 sn bc alone for tch removal 97 99 the addition of fecl3 presents the better removal efficiency 99 38 while the presence of na3po4 has the lower removal activity 91 51 considering that tch respectively presents anionic tch and tc2 zwitterionic and cationic tch3 species at ph 7 7 3 3 7 7 and 3 3 the negative surface charge of 3 mos2 sn bc is favorable for tch adsorption at ph 7 7 via the electrostatic attraction while is not suitable for tch adsorption at ph 7 7 due to the electrostatic repulsion 66 67 when ph 7 0 oh ions in liquid solid film around bulk surface hamper the adsorption of tch and tc2 on the active sites table s5 with the climbing ph the photocatalytic activity of 3 mos2 sn bc fig 5f as well as the removal efficiency of tch fig 5g increases and then decreases due to the excess of h and oh for scavenging e and h 68 the quenchers such as kbro3 p bq edta 2na and t buoh are likely to retrain the adsorption and photocatalytic performances of 3 mos2 sn bc in tch removal table s6 in contrast with pure 3 mos2 sn bc kbro3 and p bq fig 5h induce to the worse photocatalytic activity it s suggested that e and o2 are vital for the photocatalytic activity of 3 mos2 sn bc for the cycle testing of 3 mos2 sn bc the used sample was regenerated with 0 05 mol l 1 hcl solution and deionized water for three times and dried at 353 k for 6 h the adsorption efficiency of 3 mos2 sn bc as well as the removal efficiency of tch declines after five cycles fig 5i meaning its excellent adsorption photocatalytic durability s defected mos2 with narrow band gap structure and sufficient edge sites usually acts as the co catalyst for photocatalytic reaction leading to the lower photocatalytic activity than adsorption activity of 3 mos2 sn bc hence it s essential to evaluate the adsorption isotherms and kinetics of 3 mos2 sn bc for tch removal for comparison to temkin and freundlich isotherms langmuir is better to match with the adsorption isotherms of sn bc 3 mos2 s bc 3 mos2 sn bc and s bc fig 6 it s ascribed to the higher determination r2 and the lower average relative error are of langmuir isotherm the lower separation factor rl values table s7 further confirm the excellent description of langmuir for the adsorption isotherms of bc based composites 4 26 tch molecules are adsorbed on the surface and in porous channels of these samples via the mono layered adsorption estimated from langmuir isotherm table s7 qe value of 3 mos2 sn bc 474 76 mg g 1 is higher than s bc 30 83 mg g 1 sn bc 333 98 mg g 1 and 3 mos2 sn bc 400 85 mg g 1 meaning the excellent adsorption capacity of 3 mos2 sn bc hence the combined effect of mos2 and s n codoping is favorable for boosting the adsorption capacity of biochar the adsorption kinetics of s bc and sn bc fig 7 are well matched with second order model instead of first order model due to the lower age and higher r2 values table s8 similar results are obtained by the adsorption kinetics of 3 mos2 sn bc and 3 mos2 s bc for tch adsorption the qe values of 3 mos2 sn bc sn bc and s bc calculated from second order model table s8 are respectively 390 27 285 40 and 36 88 mg g 1 which are closer to the corresponding tested values it s further indicated that mos2 coupling with s n codoping can greatly enhance the adsorption activity of biochar considering the curves of infra particle diffusion models without going through the origin the adsorption steps of these samples are determined by the boundary and infra particle diffusion 4 39 the adsorption behaviors of mos2 sn bc sn bc and s bc samples via the boundary and infra particle diffusion are greatly affected by the compositions of adsorbent and experimental parameters such as inorganic salts ph adsorbent content and pollutant concentration generally the high adsorbent content and the low pollutant concentration are favorable for the adsorption due to the sufficient vacant sites and finite pollutant molecules the emulative adsorption of inorganic salts at vacant sites hampers the adsorption process of targeted pollutants adsorbent with optimal compositions can obtain the maximal adsorption capacity and activity under the optimizing conditions leading to the better adsorption capacity for tch removal compared with the previous works table s9 the functional groups over 3 mos2 sn bc fig 8 mainly contain c nh2 sh mos and cooh via the high temperature sulfurization of h2s n2 atmosphere in addition cs cn no so c oh and co bonds exist in 3 mos2 sn bc typically n doped biochar has pyrrolic n graphitic n and pyridinic n types via the covalent bonding between n and c atoms pyrrolic n and pyridinic n atoms are respectively bonded with two c atoms with sp3 and sp2 configuration and graphitic n is bonded with three c atoms with sp2 configuration these groups favor the formation of negative surface charge of 3 mos2 sn bc tch molecules have three species in aqueous at various ph including cation tch3 at ph 3 3 zwitterion at ph of 3 3 7 7 and anion tch and tc2 at ph 7 7 the large surface area and porous structure as well as s defected mos2 can provide sufficient active sites for the adsorption of cationic and zwitterionic species at ph 7 7 especially at ph 3 3 via the electrostatic attraction in addition the hydrogen bond interaction such as nh sh and oh bonds play the important role in the adsorption of tch molecules the efficient adsorption activity promotes the photocatalytic reaction in visible light region ecb values of sn bc and mos2 are respectively 0 70 and 0 42 ev which are more negative than the potential value of o2 o2 0 33 ev 41 51 their corresponding ecb values are respectively 1 59 and 1 10 ev which are smaller than the potential value of oh oh 1 99 ev 41 51 mos2 combined with sn bc can form 3 mos2 sn bc junction with ecb value of 0 78 ev and evb value of 1 60 ev which is not favorable for generating oh but suitable for forming o2 under solar light irradiation it s confirmed by the quenching test fig 5h although oh is difficult to react with h to generate oh o2 in the acidic aqueous solution is converted to ho2 and even h2o2 and o2 by h and h2o2 is further transformed into oh and oh 69 the abundant active sites generated from functional groups and the rich edge sites formed by s defected mos2 favor the photons capture meanwhile the junction interface between mos2 and sn bc enlarge the separation and migration of e h pairs boosting the formation of active species in photocatalytic process 52 57 these active species are likely to decompose tch molecules into small molecules and intermediates the adsorption coupling with photocatalysis over low cost biochar based materials is a potential technology of sewage treatment 4 conclusion in contrast with s bc sn bc and 3 mos2 sn bc 3 mos2 sn bc has the better adsorption capacity 382 43 mg g 1 and removal efficiency 97 99 for tch removal langmuir and second order models well describe the adsorption isotherms and kinetics of bc based composites respectively the enlarged adsorption capacity of mos2 sn bc composites are ascribed to the sufficient vacant sites generated from functional groups rich edge sites of mos2 electrostatic attraction and h bond interaction the excellent photocatalytic activity is attributed to the narrow band gap for efficient visible light response and the tight interface for the rapid separation and migration of charge

12686,herein we report a new sensitive and selective fluorescent probe of z 4 3 phenylnaphtho 1 2 b furan 5 yl diazenyl benzenesulfonamide pfbs to detect thorium th iv ions in aqueous solution moreover direct grafting mesoporous zirconium oxide zro2 scaffold by pfbs ligand was performed to prepare a hybrid zrpfbs for selective removal of ultra trace th iv ions from aqueous solutions systematic investigations were done to adjust and optimize the factors impacting the th iv detection adsorption process the maximum th iv removal efficiency at ph 4 was 97 5 using zrpfbs adsorbent to describe the th iv adsorption mechanism the isotherm and kinetic investigations of th iv adsorption were studied langmuir and pseudo second order models successfully describe th iv ion adsorption moreover the optimized structure and separation energies of the pfbs and its proposed pfbs th iv complex were investigated using density functional theory dft simulations the results indicated that the proposed adsorption approach retained its ability to adsorb th iv ions even after several reuse periods the zrpfbs adsorbent might be an effective and selective captor for th iv removal from water samples particularly at low levels of thorium concentration keywords thorium iv detection fluorescence mesoporous zro2 nanoparticles thorium iv adsorption dft data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction thorium th iv ion exists in nature as a highly radioactive element and is also broadly dispersed in the earth s outer layer soil rocks and seawater due to the distinguishable properties of the thorium element it has been used in many sectors including geology and medicine 1 in addition the widespread use of thorium in the industry has accumulated large amounts of radioactive and hazardous wastewater 2 3 on account of the high toxicity of th iv ions and the importance of preventing their release into the environment the development of methods for detecting and removing th iv from wastewater is a critical demand 4 even with a slight trace of thorium it can bring about serious illnesses and highly harmful impacts on humans biological functions such as cancer owing to the high radioactivity of th iv ions 5 the world health organization considers an acceptable th iv concentration in drinking water to be 20 μg l 1 6 therefore detecting and eliminating th iv from wastewater samples are significant for human and environmental protection several spectroscopic approaches have been established and developed for determining th iv ions the most common techniques had been used for th iv detection such as inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 7 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 8 chromatography 9 neutron activation analysis 10 gamma ray spectrometry 11 x ray fluorescence 12 flow injection analysis 13 and electrochemistry 14 despite these reported techniques being fast excellent and sensitive enough the high equipment cost makes them uncommonly used therefore there is a need for quick easy and the same time low cost alternative methods 15 16 the fluorescence technique has been extensively utilized to detect and monitor th iv in recent decades and it was found to have great attention 66 this method was widely used because it is distinguishable by high sensitivity high selectivity and meager cost 17 18 even though there are several fluorescent probes for heavy metals only a few sensors have been developed to detect and monitor th iv ions consequently there is a need for a reasonable strategy to design and synthesize a novel fluorescent probe for monitoring th iv ions by high sensitivity various methods were established to get rid of th iv ions from solutions such as ion exchange electrochemical approach chemical physical precipitation membrane filtration solvent extraction and adsorption and so on 19 22 65 adsorption technology has advantages because it is flexible and easy to perform and suitable adsorbent designs can be rapidly developed to improve removal efficiency 23 25 in addition it achieves high practicability low cost consumption low price and fast removal performance 26 28 as a result of high sensitivity even at low levels of thorium concentration high selectivity and high adsorption capacity the adsorption related to fluoro detection has been chosen as one of the best techniques used in th iv detection in the last years the designing of adsorbents mainly depended on the chelating agent material or a holding organic ligand into the porous solid carrier therefore various attempts have been made in this area to build sorbents with improved qualities and inexpensive costs that are also built on a sturdy solid platform these solid platforms are made of metal oxides with hierarchical structures controlled pore particle size a large active surface area and control over the shape and surface activity 64 herein we attempt to develop an effective process to remove th iv ions from water using sensitive and selective chelating probe adsorbent in the current work we have designed a novel fluorescent probe namely z 4 3 phenylnaphtho 1 2 b furan 5 yl diazenyl benzenesulfonamide pfbs for the detection of th iv ions by using the fluorometric method in aqueous solutions in addition a simple synthesis of hybrid zrpfbs was done by direct grafting of mesoporous zro2 nanoparticles by pfbs ligand for trapping ultra trace th iv ions with high selectivity from water samples the intensive grafting of pfbs ligands along zro2 pores and surfaces enhanced the selective behavior of the used adsorption material the variables influencing the th detection adsorption process were examined methodically additionally kinetic and isotherm studies of th iv adsorption and dft calculations were investigated to describe the th iv adsorption mechanism our findings indicated that the mesoporous zrpfbs design showed excellent features in terms of i high sensitive removal toward th iv ions even at low concentrations ii eco friendly removal of th iv ions iii selective th iv trapping among competitive ions and iv the zrpfbs

adsorption conditions the selectivity performance of zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents toward th iv ions was studied in single binary and mixed batch examination systems moreover the reusability of zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents in many cycles of th iv ion trapping was investigated nitric acid was used as an eluent agent for various desorption attempts the desorption releasing process was done by mixing the hno3 solution with th iv zro2 and th iv zrpfbs also different concentrations of an eluent agent were examined methodically the regenerated zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents were employed to remove th iv ions for five cycles under the optimal adsorption desorption requirements notwithstanding the disadvantageous effect of hno3 during the releasing process may diminish the quantity of external active sites and thus lead to minimizing the amount of adsorbed th iv ions the mesoporous zro2 platform was approximately retained with its architectural features 2 7 dft calculations the electronic and geometrical configuration of pfbs ligand and its th iv complex were optimized using the density functional theory becker s three parameterized lee yang par b3lyp exchange functional with b3lyp 6 31g d

characterization of zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents the surface morphology of zro2 was investigated using fe sem and hr tem fig 1a shows the fe sem images of zro2 and observes the formation of nanostructures the low focusing sem image of zro2 illustrates the formation of dense nanostructured particles fig 1a a b the irregular particles are formed from various tetragonal and bipyramidal structures the flake size is in the nanoscale range of 100 200 nm the zro2 nanoparticles surface texture is rough with irregular and weaved ends due to the removal of sds after annealing figure 1 ac in addition the porous structure like a sponge is clearly obtained from the sem image in figure 1 ad the hr tem images observe the irregular nanoflake structure of zro2 of tetragonal and bipyramidal the tetragonal structure of zro2 allows the high annular contact surface from multi faces the multi faces of zro2 nanoparticle with tetragonal orientation enlarge the surface coverage in addition the presence of a bipyramidal nanoflake structure within the tetragonal structure is observed in figure 1 ba the high focusing hr tem image illustrates the porous structure of the prepared zro2 like a sponge figure 1 bb the pore size ranged from 7 to 20 nm in addition the surface texture is rough due to the porous nature and nanosized edges of 100 200 nm therefore the zro2 nanoparticles would be a good candidate for the high loading of organic fluoroprobe and the durable design of a fluorescence sensor the loading of the pfbs probe at the surface of zro2 platform was configured using various analysis techniques such as ftir xps etc in addition these techniques illustrated the characteristic features and composition of zro2 and zrpfbs the fe sem of zrpfbs obtained the loading of pfbs on the surface of zro2 figure s1aa figure s1ab shows the zro2 outer inner surface covered by pfbs ligand in addition the pores are fully loaded and covered by the targeted probe these data outlining of zro2 is a good candidate for loading pfbs molecules the edx sem mapping shows the surface atomic composition of zro2 and zrpfbs for zro2 the zr and o atoms were observed and homogeneously distributed with wt of 79 9 and 19 1 respectively fig s1b a c while the edx sem mapping for zrpfbs shows the presence of c o n and s beside zr and o atoms the wt of zr o c n and s are 47 42 28 22 19 21 3 79 and 1 36 respectively fig s1c a d these data provide the surface composition of zrpfbs indicating the successful loading of pfbs at the surface of zro2 nanoparticles the xrd analysis outlines the material s purity and the crystal structure of the proposed materials 33 fig 2a displays the xrd spectra of a zro2 and b zrpfbs the crystal structure of the prepared zirconia depends on the formulated particle size the various xrd peaks illustrated the presence of two crystal structures of tetragonal and monoclinic structures as reported in the literature the xrd peaks centered at 2θ of 23 98 27 96 31 16 33 95 38 24 40 59 44 89 48 95 55 24 65 45 and 74 73 are corresponding to 110 111 111 002 012 202 211 022 221 331 and 041 as the monoclinic crystal phase jcpds 37 1484 in addition the presence of xrd peaks cantered at 2θ of 30 02 35 02 50 03 53 8 59 88 and 62 62 corresponding to 011 110 112 021 121 and 022 that related the presence of tetragonal zro2 phase jcpds 80 0965 the peak intestates of 111 and 111 are too strong leading to the monoclinic zro2 phase being dominant these data outlined the formation of a stable monoclinic phase at room temperature and without stabilization the crystal size of zro2 was determined using the scherrer equation t 0 91λ bcosθ where the crystallite size equals 17 6 nm the xrd peaks of zrpfbs are the same as the zro2 nanoparticles leading to the successful loading of the organic pfbs molecules at the material surface without any effect on the crystal structure therefore the prepared materials provide the formation of zro2 with a dominant monoclinic phase fig 2b shows the ft ir spectra of zro2 black line and zrpfbs red line and obtains the successful loading of pfbs at the surface of zro2 due to the o surface vacant and oh and h2o surface nature of zro2 ft ir peaks at 3424 and 1636 cm 1 are attributed to oh s stretching and bending forms and adsorbed h2o molecules in addition peaks at 770 and 512 cm 1 are due to the bending of zro these results outline the surface functionality of zro2 of oh and h2o that would be the active functional centers to load pfbs the ft ir spectrum of zrpfbs shows the various functional groups due to the loading of pfbs at the surface of zro2 fig 2b red line the two ir peaks at 3423 and 3210 cm 1 are attributed to the stretching mode of nh2 meanwhile the band at 1614 63 cm 1 is related to the δnh2 vibrations these data support the free nh2 due to the sulfonamide in the pfbs the aromatic and aliphatic stretching of ch sp2 and ch sp3 are according to the peaks at 3220 2506 and 2258 cm 1 in addition the strong stretching bands at 1614 and 1728 cm 1 are assigned to the existence of cc and co bonds the so and cs functional groups are existed in the pfbs structure due to the presence of 1389 and 1198 cm 1 peaks respectively in addition the vibrational bands at 794 7 646 68 and 546 cm 1 are due to vibrational and stretching modes of cs and so respectively moreover the bands in the region of 800 500 cm 1 are also attributed to the meta oxide s bonds of zro the peak shift or the zro peaks and the presence of various bands for pfbs on zrpfbs provide the successful loading of pfbs on the zro2 surface the xps analysis provides the chemical composition and binding of components of the desired materials fig 2c shows the xps spectrum of zro2 and outlines the formation of zro2 molecules the xps peaks of zro2 are observed in fig 2c as follows zr 4s 55 08 ev zr 4p 31 08 ev zr 3p3 2 334 ev zr 3p1 2 347 ev zr 3d 184 95 ev zr 3s 430 1 ev and o 1s 531 1 ev the xps survey of zr 3d shows two peaks centered at 181 85 and 184 24 ev due to zr 3d5 2 and zr 3d3 2 respectively fig 2d the high intensity of the peak at 181 85 ev is due to the significant m zro2 crystal structure formation and some oxygen deficiencies the xps survey of o 1s shows the presence of two peaks at 529 64 and 531 37 ev due to the two types of oxygen species of zr o o and zr oh fig 2e the xps spectrum of zrpfbs shows the presence of the pfbs atomic components of c 1s 285 77 ev n 1s 400 08 ev and s 2p 162 62 ev with the presence of zro2 components of zr 3d 183 55 ev and o 1s 531 1 ev fig s2a fig s2b shows the xps survey of zr and obtains the same peaks at 181 85 and 184 24 ev due to the zr 3d5 3 and zr 3d2 3 the xps survey of c 1s shows the three major peaks for cc 284 61 ev co 288 37 ev and cn and cs 286 46 ev as shown in fig s2c the o 1s survey shows the presence of various o bonding formations zro co and so due to the presence of two peaks at 529 69 and 531 29 ev as shown in fig s2d these peaks are related to the various bonding between c and other heteroatoms of o n and s the xps survey of n 1s illustrates two peaks centered at 399 27 and 401 24 for n functional of n amine and nn respectively fig s2e fig s2f shows the s 2p survey and outlines three peaks centered at 163 57 and 168 52 ev related to the s bonding of c s n s 2p3 2 and so2 while the peak at 166 1 ev may relate to sn bonding these data provide the successful loading of pfbs at the surface of zro2 moreover zrpfbs after adsorption process was analysed using xps as shown in fig s3 figs s3a d show the xps spectrum for zr 3d o 1s c 1s and s 2p elements figs s3a d didn t show a significant difference between the zrpfbs before and after th iv adsorption on the other hand figs s3e of n 1s shows a clear difference after th iv ion adsorption where the binding energy values were shifted to lower values 398 46 and 400 2 ev this behavior is due to the real chemical interaction of th iv ions with n rich active sites fig s3f indicates the xps spectra of th 4f with showing four peaks at 332 6 334 9 345 9 and 346 9 ev therefore the xps data additional describes that th iv may be chelated with the n groups of zrpfbs the finding data suggests that the mechanism of th iv adsorption involves coordination bonds between th iv ions and zrpfbs surface sites based on the ft ir and xps data the hydrogen bonding formation between pfbs and zro2 is the main mechanism due to the various pfbs functional groups i e so2 nh2 co and nn and zro2 i e zr o zr and zr oh the surface nature of porosity and surface area are also indicators for loading pfbs at the surface of zro2 and the formation of zrpfbs fig s4a shows the n adsorption desorption isotherm of zro2 and zrpfbs the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area decreased after pfbs loaded at the surface of zro2 where the bet surface areas were 32 7 and 23 65 m2 g for zro2 and zrpfbs respectively in addition the pore size of zro2 7 2 nm was also changed after the formation of zrpfbs 6 1 nm fig s4b these data support the surface nature change after successfully loading pfbs due to the filling of zro2 s pores by pfbs and the formation of zrpfbs the good surface area and porosity signify the following results i trapping of a large quantities of th iv ions inside the pores of zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents and thus increasing the removal efficiency and capacity and ii smooth diffusion of th iv through pores along the zrpfbs surface 63 figure s5 a b shows the tg dta graph of zro2 and zrpfbs obtaining the prepared materials heat influence and clarifying the materials reproducibility and regeneration fig s5 shows the tg dta thermograph and outlines the one endothermic peak at 98 c due to losing adsorbed water with a stable crystalline structure meanwhile two endothermic peaks at 98 and 380 c are due to the loss of adsorbed water and the degradation of pfbs respectively in addition there is no exothermic peak for zro2 and zrpfbs leading to the stable crystalline formation of zro2 these data support the formation of zrpfbs and the regeneration of the zro2 platform that would be further used in loading the fluoroprobes with high stability 3 2 fluorometric detection of th iv ions using pfbs probe various metal ions were used to test the pfbs probe to verify its performance such as sr2 u6 co2 cd2 pb2 al3 mn2 hg2 ba2 ni2 zn2 th iv at a final concentration of 1 5 ppm the excitation zone of the pfbs probe was adjusted at the wavelength λex 559 nm while the maximum wavelength emission was recorded at λmax 586 nm as exhibited in fig 3a as shown in fig 3b the pfbs probe fluorescence was exceptionally enhanced at the reaction with th iv ions other metals had no discernible influence on the pfbs fluorescence probe s emission peak the acquired selectivity behavior for th iv ions suggests that the pfbs probe can be an efficient and highly choosy fluoro probe for th iv recognition in various water models the ph value of the reaction medium in many analytical experiences is the most influential parameter that positively or negatively affects metal trapping chelating interactions the influence of ph value on pfbs th iv complex production was examined in a wide ph range of 1 0 5 5 the obtained data fig 3c revealed that ph 3 5 is the optimal ph value at which the best fluorescence enhancement was achieved the proposed fluorescent probe has an acidic function and its sensitivity depends on the change in the ph values the significant reduction in pfbs th iv complex formation observed at lower ph may be attributable to the intense contest of h ions with th iv ions at the functional groups of the pfbs probe moreover at ph values above 3 5 the concentration of hydroxyl ions increases significantly resulting in a decrease in th iv concentration reducing the emission peak intensity therefore a ph of 3 5 was concluded to be the optimum ph for subsequent experiments delayed response time is an undesirable feature in metal fluorescence assays as a result the response time toward th iv detection is another critical aspect of the pfbs probe and should be considered therefore the influence of the reaction time on the complex formation between th iv ions and pfbs probe was examined as shown in fig 3d as seen the fluorescence intensity of the pfbs probe increases rapidly within 120 s it then remains almost unchanged from 120 to 300 s quick response time is a crucial feature of our suggested sensor for th iv detection in addition the stability of the complexation process between the pfbs probe and th iv ions was observed over the extended contact time as shown in fig 3d the obtained results proved that pfbs th iv complex has high stability with a slight and imperceptible decrease in the fluorescence intensity after a contact time of 120 s the fluorescence spectra of the pfbs probe after reaction with several th iv concentrations were studied and shown in fig s6a the achieved results indicated that at expanding th iv concentration the peak intensity of the pfbs probe was regularly increased under the optimum conditions of fluorometric detection of th iv ions lower dl has been observed by the designed probe fig s6b exhibits the calibration plot which describes the relationship between th iv concentration with the relative fluorescence intensity of pfbs probe the straight line behavior was undoubtedly shown with a high correlation coefficient r2 0 98 accordingly the pfbs probe can monitor th iv ions concentrations in an aqueous solution at ultra trace levels up to 0 19 ppm these results referred to the high sensitivity of the pfbs probe as a sensor for the quantitative and qualitative detection of th iv ions as a result it might provide a promising ligand for removing th iv ions even at low level concentrations from contaminated water samples to explain the binding features of pfbs ligand toward th iv ions job s method was utilized to describe the mole ratio of th iv ion and pfbs ligand a similar concentration of pfbs ligand and th iv ions were prepared in ethanol and water respectively eleven experiments were conducted using 10 ml mixed from the ligand and th iv ions the addition was performed by mixing up volumes of pfbs ligand gradually increased from 0 to 10 ml with volumes of th iv ion decreasing from 10 to 0 ml after 2 min of mixing the fluoro measurements were performed and peak intensity was recorded at λmax 586 nm job s figure can be obtained by plotting the peak intensity as opposed to the th iv pfbs ligand th iv molar fraction as shown in fig s6c according to the obtained data from job s curve the highest intensity occurs at the mole fraction of 0 5 so the optimal molar ratio between th iv ions and the pfbs sensor equals 1 1 3 3 th iv removal using zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents 3 3 1 effect of the initial ph the initial ph of the feed solution considers a key variable affecting the trapping of th iv ions on zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents as it affects the behaviors of th iv ions in the bulk solution 34 since ph considerably influences the protonation of external active sites choosiness rate of removal and adsorption efficiency it must be considered in the adsorption studies the influence of the initial ph solution on the adsorption efficiency of th iv using zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents was performed within ph values ranging from 1 to 6 and the other factors were kept constant initial th iv concentration of 10 ppm stirring time of 60 min sorbent dosage of 50 mg room temperature as shown in fig 4a gradually increasing ph values from 1 to 4 leads to increasing adsorption efficiency of th iv ions using zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents from 55 and 97 5 respectively the highest adsorption efficiency was achieved at ph 4 after that adsorption efficiency became constant in the ph range from 4 to 6 in highly acidic solutions a high reduction in the adsorption efficiency of th iv ions occurs this behavior may be attributable to the presence of h leading to intense competition between protons and th iv ions on the surface active sites of sorbents furthermore at the ph values of solutions 4 thorium ions may be precipitated as thorium hydroxides such as th oh 3 th oh 2 2 and th2 oh 2 6 leading to fake adsorption or significant adsorption errors 35 hence we chose ph 4 as the optimal ph condition to complete the current experimental study and avoid trapping other metals or precipitation of th iv ions the excellent removal of the zrpfbs sorbent can be ascribed to the subsequent factors i the nature of the sorbent as it has an abundance of exterior interior active sites along the surface and pores of the zrpfbs sorbent and ii the fast th iv transfer with easy diffusion through the cavities grooves on the surface matrix of the mesoporous zrpfbs sorbent 3 3 2 effect of stirring time to assess the impact of stirring time 50 mg of zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents were mixed up with 50 ml of th iv ions solution for 2 5 120 min with th iv concentration of 10 ppm at ph 4 and ambient temperature the influence of stirring time on the th iv adsorption using zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents is shown in fig 4b where the rate of adsorption begins to increase very rapidly the results show that the best th iv adsorption efficiency was achieved within 30 min after that it gradually increases until the adsorption process reaches equilibrium within 30 45 min this behavior occurs because adsorbents reach the saturation state where th iv ions occupy all sorbents active sites with growing stirring time the adsorption of th iv remained approximately fixed no significant increase in the adsorption was found by increasing the stirring time therefore the optimum stirring time was set to be 30 min for the subsequent experiments 3 3 3 effect of sorbent dose the sorbent amount is another vital index for the th iv adsorption efficiency batch trials were set up with various amounts of zro2 and zrpfbs from 25 to 100 mg where the th iv solution 50 ml 10 ppm was stirred for 30min at ph 4 the effect of zro2 and zrpfbs dose on th iv adsorption is displayed in fig 4c the th iv adsorption efficiency using zro2 and zrpfbs was improved with sorbent dose growth this outcome may be attributed to the increasing active sites of designed sorbents the removal of th iv ions was close to equilibrium 98 at a dosage of zrpfbs 50 mg due to the existence of pfbs probe along the surface and pores of zrpfbs considering the high adsorption and reasonable economic aspects an adsorption dosage of 50 mg was selected for the following experiments 3 3 4 effect of interfering cations the impact of interfering cations on the zro2 and zrpfbs selectivity for th iv adsorption was examined at specific ph 4 selective th iv trapping using the designed adsorbents was carried out experimentally in the existence of equivalent concentrations i e 10 ppm of different cations separately such as al3 fe3 cu2 cr3 zn2 ni2 co2 mg2 ca2 k and na fig 4d shows the direct adsorption of zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents to all competitive cations indicating weak cation to sorbent binding events fig 4d suggested that the zrpfbs is more selective than the zro2 adsorbent toward th iv ions owing to the existence of pfbs ligand which tends to bind selectively to th iv ions furthermore the selectivity behavior of zro2 and zrpfbs toward th iv ion was examined intensively in binary approaches under applying optimal ph circumstances with equal concentrations of the interfering cations the achieved outcomes in fig s7a demonstrated that the interfering cations didn t influence the th iv adsorption efficiency particularly in the case of the zrpfbs sorbent hence the zrpfbs adsorbent has a strong anti ion interfering ability with high selectivity toward th iv ions adsorption to investigate the influence of mixed cations on the th iv removal performance we used a mixture of th iv ions and at least two competing cations with similar concentrations g1 g5 as displayed in fig s7 caption the outcomes in fig s7b confirmed that zrpfbs adsorbents outperformed zro2 adsorbents in selectively th iv ions trapping removal among other competitive ions this performance was because the designed pfbs ligand has selectively functional groups therefore zrpfbs is considered an excellent model for removing th iv from different water samples 3 4 isotherm study of th iv removal the adsorption isotherm model assumes that all adsorption positions are identical and that their states depend on whether nearby sites are busy the relation between the th iv content and the quantity of sorbed th iv ions on the surface of used adsorbents can be determined by isotherm models 36 fig 5a displays the th iv adsorption capacities of both designed sorbents zro2 and zrpfbs versus the initial th iv concentrations 0 001 250 ppm the outcomes demonstrated that the quantity of th iv ions mg g adsorbed on the designed zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents reached the maximum equilibrium capacity under optimal conditions with values of 49 5 and 137 mg g for zro2 and zrpfbs respectively the langmuir model assumes homogeneous adsorption on the outer surface of used sorbents therefore the langmuir model describes the adsorption mechanism of monolayer adsorption which occurs at specific active sites where no further adsorption can occur after sites are occupied the linear langmuir model is given by the following relation 37 38 4 c e q e 1 k l q o 1 q o c e qo mg g is the highest adsorption capability and kl l mg is the langmuir constant fig 5b c and table 1 show the results of graphing ce qe vs ce to determine qo and kl values the theoretical maximum saturation capacities for each zro2 and zrpfbs were 53 7 and 142 86 mg g respectively these values correspond to the realistic saturation capacity it is worth noticing that the r2 values are very high which were 0 96 and 0 994 for both zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents respectively the results showed that after anchoring pfbs ligands on the zro2 mesoporous platform the zrpfbs adsorbent has a uniform surface and its interaction with th iv ions was chemical the separation factor rl is a dimensionless constant that may represent the langmuir model s essential properties rl value considers a more reliable indicator of the adsorption process rl value is described as follows 39 5 r l 1 1 k l c o co ppm represents the initial th iv concentration and rl provides info about the adsorption mechanism the type of the isotherm depends on the value of rl it is either favorable 0 rl 1 unfavorable rl 1 linear rl 1 or irreversible rl 0 the rl values of zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents are displayed in table 1 values of rl showed favorable th iv adsorption onto zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents the freundlich model presumes that adsorption on the surface of zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents happens heterogeneously this model explains the multi site intermolecular interactions between ions adsorbed to the adjacent active sites in a multilayer the linear shape of the freundlich model is presented by the next relationship 40 41 6 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e kf represents the adsorption capability of zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents while n represents the sorption strength for used adsorbents kf and n were estimated from the ln qe graphing against ln ce as shown in fig s8a b and table 1 the heterogeneity degree depends on the 1 n factor decreasing the 1 n value refers to a higher heterogeneity grade a standard adsorption behavior occurs at 1 n is 1 herein values of 1 n are 1 for both used adsorbents representing that the adsorption process of the th iv removal using zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents is favorable and chemisorption the achieved r2 values confirmed that the freundlich model does not suit the practical results especially using the zrpfbs sorbent here the temkin isotherm paradigm was further explored the temkin isotherm assumes that the heat of th iv adsorption decreases with the coverage of adsorbent surface active sites by target adsorbate the linear equation of the temkin isotherm model can be written as follows 42 7 q e bln k t bln c e 8 b rt b the b constant is related to th iv adsorption heat t is the absolute temperature k r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k b is the temkin constant j mol and kt is the temkin isotherm constant l g according to r2 values the temkin model is more fitted than the freundlich model clarifying the applicability of the temkin prototype to describe the th iv adsorption onto zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents which proved that the th iv adsorption using zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents was undoubtedly a chemical process fig s9a b and table 1 the dubinin radushkevich dr isotherm model was also studied to explain the characteristics of th iv adsorption associated with the porous feature for both zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents the dr model can be clarified through the following linear equation 43 9 ln q e ln q o δ ɛ 2 10 ɛ rtln 1 1 c e ε is polanyi potential and ce and qo are in mol l and mol g units δ constant mol2 j2 is related to the energy of th iv ions adsorption the average th iv ion adsorption energy e j mol can offer a hint about the nature of th iv adsorbent interaction physisorption e 8 kj mol chemisorption e 8 16 kj mol where the e value can be defined via the next equation 11 e 1 2 δ in the current study the e values of zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents were about 14 and 13 8 kj mol respectively therefore the th iv adsorption process is chemisorption fig s9c d and table 1 3 5 kinetic study of th iv removal kinetic studies provide enough information about the target adsorption mechanism which is essential for process efficiency chemical or physical processes that occur during the adsorption process can be represented mathematically through the kinetic model the adsorption mechanism occurs at different rates beginning from very fast to very slow 44 two kinetic models were utilized to assess the strength and nature of th iv adsorption as a function of stirring time these models included pseudo first order pfo and the second model called pseudo second order pso the pfo model describes the physisorption process as a rate determining step while the pso model assumes that chemisorption involves valence forces associated with electrons sharing or exchanging 45 the linearized structures of the pfo and pso versions are represented in the following equations 46 47 12 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t 13 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t qt and qe mg g are the quantities of adsorbed th iv ions onto zro2 and zrpfbs at a time t and equilibrium k1 and k2 are the rates constant for pfo min 1 and pso g mg min initially the pfo version was employed to evaluate the practical information that had been obtained the plotting of log qe qt versus t was displayed in figs s10a b qe and k1 values were estimated from the straight line and listed in table 2 the findings revealed that the theoretical qe values are very close to the practical qe values with acceptable r2 values values of pso parameters qe and k2 were evaluated from the graphing of t qt against t as demonstrated in figs s10c d and table 2 the calculated and experimental qe values had been obtained using 10 ppm of th iv ions and were observed to be approximately similar the r2 values of the pso version are better than the pfo version indicating that the pso version is an appropriate kinetic model for illustrating the th iv adsorption process using zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents moreover the high linearity of fig s10d indicates that the pso kinetic model perfectly suits the chemisorption nature the elovich model was investigated to describe the chemisorption kinetic of th iv ions using adsorbents it can be typed in a linear form as follow 48 14 q t 1 β ln αβ 1 β ln t α mg g min is the initial rate of th iv adsorption and β g mg is a constant according to r2 values the elovich model successfully describes the th iv adsorption process the larger α value of zrpfbs may assign to the abundance of active sites along the surface of the zrpfbs adsorbent the β value was enhanced from 0 625 g mg to 0 649 g mg due to the growing surface active sites after modification using pfbs ligand to get zrpfbs adsorbent fig s11a b and table 2 the intra particle diffusion ipd model was also examined to explain the rate controlling phase of the th iv adsorption process the ipd model is defined by the later linear balance 49 15 q t k id t 0 5 i the kid is the ipd rate constant mg g min0 5 i is a constant related to the outer layer intensity the plotting of qt versus t0 5 for zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents are described in fig s11c d while the obtained values of r2 and other constants are recorded in table 2 the kid value of zrpfbs is lesser than the zro2 adsorbent suggesting that the diffusion of th iv ions into the zrpfbs pores is slower than zro2 adsorbent due to the existence of dense grafted pfbs ligand 3 6 computational studies of th iv trapping mechanism the 3d initial optimized structure for both pfbs and different possible structures of the thorium complex of pfbs th4 was determined using the semi empirical pm6 theory however the selected structures were reoptimized and electronic properties were studied using the higher level of dft methods of b3lyp 6 31g d for pfbs and using a split basis set of b3lyp 6 31g d sdd for pfbs th4 as shown in fig 6a b fig 6c of the electrostatic surface potential esp for pfbs in the ground state indicates that the more negative the atomic partial charges were located on nitrogen atoms and its neighbor of benzene rings 50 thus the nitrogen atoms have the most probability of donating their electrons to the thorium ion and chelation easily occurs the complex of pfbs th4 thorium ion shows distorted octahedral binding sites and is connected by the high electron density of nitrogen atoms of pfbs and completes its coordination with nitrate ions furthermore the dft method suggests the possibility of charge transfer between the chemo sensor of pfbs and th4 ions which resulted in a 0 31 ev decrease in the band gap upon complexation as presented in fig 7 17 51 52 in addition the pfbs permitted excitation of the homo to lumo state singlet 388 66 nm 3 19 ev homo 1 to lumo 1 singlet 244 06 nm 5 08 ev homo to lumo 1 singlet 257 76 nm 4 81 ev and homo 1 to lumo states singlet 358 33 nm 43 46 ev these homo level results align with those obtained from the pfbs th complex which refers to the pfbs being considered the source of the ground state electrons even upon complexation with th iv and as expected it was also observed that the lumo levels of the pfbs th complex were scattered over the unoccupied states of th iv ions these findings suggest that the nitrogen atom was the best location for building complexes with the th iv ion further the density of state dos of the pfbs th complex shows an increasing number of unoccupied states with lower energy compared to pfbs as shown in fig s12 this finding confirms the ability of thorium ions to share the unoccupied orbitals with pfbs and boost the possibility of the energy transfer from pfbs to thorium ions 3 7 reusability of zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents the elution and subsequent materials regeneration without reducing efficiency are critical factors in choosing materials to use in industrial applications and decreasing their cost this trend has the attention of many peoples due to the cost effectiveness of using the adsorbent materials for several cycles 53 many adsorbent materials with high adsorption capacity have also been reported for th iv removal but they can only be used once or cannot be reused therefore it is preferable to desorb th iv ions from zro2 and zrpfbs and regenerate them in multiple cycles without losing their original function the elution desorption efficacy of trapped th iv ions from th iv zro2 zrpfbs solid was determined using the desorption equation cd ca x100 where ca and cd are the concentration of adsorbed and desorbed th iv ions to desorb the trapped th iv ions and regenerate used adsorbents numerous elution trials were conducted using hno3 after treating zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents with nitric acid they were filtered dried and then reused for th iv adsorption the batch examination method was used for desorbing th iv ions by stirring 0 05 g of the th iv zro2 zrpfbs solid with 20 ml of hno3 at various concentrations for 30 min as appeared in fig s13a the desorption of the th iv ions enhanced with increasing hno3 concentration the electrostatic repulsion between th iv ions and the positive active sites of zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents may be occurred by increasing hno3 concentration leading to an increase in the desorption efficiency based on desorption studies of th iv ions by hno3 0 1 mol l of hno3 was found to be the optimal concentration to desorb 99 5 of the trapped th iv ions the generated adsorbents were reused five times as shown in fig s13b th iv ions adsorption efficiencies in the first cycle were 55 and 97 5 t for zro2 and zrpfbs respectively on the other hand the adsorption efficiencies after five reuse cycles were reduced to 41 and 89 for both zro2 and zrpfbs respectively the reduced efficiency may be due to the decreased surface active centers for them by the repeated adsorption desorption cycles table 3 compares our proposed material zro2 zrpfbs and other different adsorbents regarding ph removal effectiveness and capacity the achieved assessment indicated that zrpfbs has a high removal efficacy and capacity for th iv ions due to its high surface area and porosity 4 conclusion in the current manuscript fluorometric investigations were performed for selective and sensitive determination and detection of th iv ions using a novel pfbs ligand zrpfbs adsorbent was fabricated by functionalizing mesoporous zro2 nanoparticles using the synthesized pfbs ligand different features of zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents were investigated via sem tem edx xrd xps ftir tga and n2 adsorption desorption isotherm zrpfbs was used efficiently to remove and adsorb th iv ions from an aqueous solution even at low th iv concentration the mesoporous zrpfbs adsorbent offers a rapid th iv diffusion along apertures high removal efficiency and a cost efficient process the key investigational factors such as ph solution contact time etc are significant for detecting and adsorbing th iv ions therefore they were systematically studied our outcomes confirm that the detection and removal method of th iv ions is a ph dependent method the zrpfbs adsorbent shown as high th iv removal efficiency of 97 5 with an adsorption capacity of 137 mg g at ph 4 langmuir and pso models are the best appropriate models to explain the th iv removal mechanism additionally the spent zrpfbs can be reused for five cycles where hno3 0 1 mol l was used as an eluent agent to recover 99 5 of adsorbed th iv ions and generate zrpfbs free with maintaining high performance the results suggested that the zrpfbs sorbent can act as a candidate sorbent to remove th iv ions from actual water

12686,herein we report a new sensitive and selective fluorescent probe of z 4 3 phenylnaphtho 1 2 b furan 5 yl diazenyl benzenesulfonamide pfbs to detect thorium th iv ions in aqueous solution moreover direct grafting mesoporous zirconium oxide zro2 scaffold by pfbs ligand was performed to prepare a hybrid zrpfbs for selective removal of ultra trace th iv ions from aqueous solutions systematic investigations were done to adjust and optimize the factors impacting the th iv detection adsorption process the maximum th iv removal efficiency at ph 4 was 97 5 using zrpfbs adsorbent to describe the th iv adsorption mechanism the isotherm and kinetic investigations of th iv adsorption were studied langmuir and pseudo second order models successfully describe th iv ion adsorption moreover the optimized structure and separation energies of the pfbs and its proposed pfbs th iv complex were investigated using density functional theory dft simulations the results indicated that the proposed adsorption approach retained its ability to adsorb th iv ions even after several reuse periods the zrpfbs adsorbent might be an effective and selective captor for th iv removal from water samples particularly at low levels of thorium concentration keywords thorium iv detection fluorescence mesoporous zro2 nanoparticles thorium iv adsorption dft data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction thorium th iv ion exists in nature as a highly radioactive element and is also broadly dispersed in the earth s outer layer soil rocks and seawater due to the distinguishable properties of the thorium element it has been used in many sectors including geology and medicine 1 in addition the widespread use of thorium in the industry has accumulated large amounts of radioactive and hazardous wastewater 2 3 on account of the high toxicity of th iv ions and the importance of preventing their release into the environment the development of methods for detecting and removing th iv from wastewater is a critical demand 4 even with a slight trace of thorium it can bring about serious illnesses and highly harmful impacts on humans biological functions such as cancer owing to the high radioactivity of th iv ions 5 the world health organization considers an acceptable th iv concentration in drinking water to be 20 μg l 1 6 therefore detecting and eliminating th iv from wastewater samples are significant for human and environmental protection several spectroscopic approaches have been established and developed for determining th iv ions the most common techniques had been used for th iv detection such as inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 7 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 8 chromatography 9 neutron activation analysis 10 gamma ray spectrometry 11 x ray fluorescence 12 flow injection analysis 13 and electrochemistry 14 despite these reported techniques being fast excellent and sensitive enough the high equipment cost makes them uncommonly used therefore there is a need for quick easy and the same time low cost alternative methods 15 16 the fluorescence technique has been extensively utilized to detect and monitor th iv in recent decades and it was found to have great attention 66 this method was widely used because it is distinguishable by high sensitivity high selectivity and meager cost 17 18 even though there are several fluorescent probes for heavy metals only a few sensors have been developed to detect and monitor th iv ions consequently there is a need for a reasonable strategy to design and synthesize a novel fluorescent probe for monitoring th iv ions by high sensitivity various methods were established to get rid of th iv ions from solutions such as ion exchange electrochemical approach chemical physical precipitation membrane filtration solvent extraction and adsorption and so on 19 22 65 adsorption technology has advantages because it is flexible and easy to perform and suitable adsorbent designs can be rapidly developed to improve removal efficiency 23 25 in addition it achieves high practicability low cost consumption low price and fast removal performance 26 28 as a result of high sensitivity even at low levels of thorium concentration high selectivity and high adsorption capacity the adsorption related to fluoro detection has been chosen as one of the best techniques used in th iv detection in the last years the designing of adsorbents mainly depended on the chelating agent material or a holding organic ligand into the porous solid carrier therefore various attempts have been made in this area to build sorbents with improved qualities and inexpensive costs that are also built on a sturdy solid platform these solid platforms are made of metal oxides with hierarchical structures controlled pore particle size a large active surface area and control over the shape and surface activity 64 herein we attempt to develop an effective process to remove th iv ions from water using sensitive and selective chelating probe adsorbent in the current work we have designed a novel fluorescent probe namely z 4 3 phenylnaphtho 1 2 b furan 5 yl diazenyl benzenesulfonamide pfbs for the detection of th iv ions by using the fluorometric method in aqueous solutions in addition a simple synthesis of hybrid zrpfbs was done by direct grafting of mesoporous zro2 nanoparticles by pfbs ligand for trapping ultra trace th iv ions with high selectivity from water samples the intensive grafting of pfbs ligands along zro2 pores and surfaces enhanced the selective behavior of the used adsorption material the variables influencing the th detection adsorption process were examined methodically additionally kinetic and isotherm studies of th iv adsorption and dft calculations were investigated to describe the th iv adsorption mechanism our findings indicated that the mesoporous zrpfbs design showed excellent features in terms of i high sensitive removal toward th iv ions even at low concentrations ii eco friendly removal of th iv ions iii selective th iv trapping among competitive ions and iv the zrpfbs structural function is preserved for multiple reuse cycles providing an inexpensive and superior removal capture method 2 experimental part 2 1 utilized chemicals the consumed substances were of high

differential thermal analysis tg dta a shimadzu dtg60h a synchronized 2 3 synthesis of z 4 3 phenylnaphtho 1 2 b furan 5yl diazenyl benzene sulfonamide pfbs synthesis of pfbs includes two main steps as shown in scheme 1 in the initial step the formation of the azo dye compound was done in three stages the first stage includes a diazotization reaction which was performed by i 10 ml of concentrated

nanoparticles was performed by dissolving 2 5 g of zrocl2 8h2o in deionized water 100 ml with continuous stirring for 2 h then 1 g of urea was added with stirring for 1 h after that 1 5 g of sds was added to the earlier solution with stirring for more 2 h the resultant mixture was transferred into an autoclave hydrothermal 150 c 15 h the obtained product was filtered and rinsed numerous times using ethanol and deionized water to eliminate the unreacted reactants the formed zr oh 4 was maintained at 80 c for 12 h the mesoporous zro2 was obtained by calcinating the precipitated zr oh 4 at 550 c under an air atmosphere for 6 h see scheme 2 then the mesoporous zro2 was milled and stocked to utilize as platform support for fabricating the zrpfbs adsorbent the mesoporous zrpfbs adsorbent was fabricated by simply incorporating and accommodating the synthesized chelation agent pfbs into the designed zro2 nanoparticles mesoporous zrpfbs nanoparticles were manufactured by mixing pfbs 100 ml 0 1mg ml ethanol solvent with 1 g of zro2 powder under constant stirring for 24 h using a rotary evaporator the mixture was gently processed at 37 2 c followed by washing several times with deionized water until the non binding pfbs was eliminated to produce zrpfbs in pure form the solid was dehydrated at 50 c overnight and then the final product was milled to get a superfine powder of zrpfbs sorbent see scheme 2 2 5 fluorometric detection of th iv ion the fluorometric detection method was performed on the designed probe in ethanol stock solution 0 1 mg ml of pfbs ligand in a volumetric flask 6 ml of pfbs ligand solution was added followed by 1 ml of buffer solution a fixed quantity of th iv ions was also included in the earlier solution then diluted with deionized water to the mark in the 10 ml volumetric flask the resultant solution was fully mixed and their fluoro measurements were performed after 2 min the fluoro trials were performed at room temperature with an excitation wavelength of 559 nm with a slit width was 5 nm the emission wavelength was recorded at 586 nm rate of scan 600 nm min the fluorometric measurements were repeated three times to avoid errors as much as possible the detection limit dl of the pfbs sensor for th iv detection was defined as follows 29 1 dl 3 3 s d s s and sd are the slope of the calibration curve and the standard deviation respectively the parameters impacting the fluorescence detection process such as reaction time ph and interfering ions were explored job s method was observed by applying fluorescence spectra to obtain the binding stoichiometry of the pfbs sensor with th iv ion 2 6 bench top th iv adsorption releasing trials the current manuscript suggested removing th iv ions from water samples via an economical approach using mesoporous zrpfbs adsorbent the zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents 20 mg were stirred with 20 ml of th iv solution the effect of ph agitation time adsorbent dosage initial th iv concentration and interfering ions were considered to estimate the efficacy of mesoporous zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents to adsorb trap th iv ions and establish the optimum conditions of the removal process after the adsorption procedure icp ms was used to determine th iv concentration in the effluent solution the removal efficiency and capacity of the zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents were calculated according to the next equations 30 67 2 adsorption c o c e c o 100 3 q e mg g c o c e v w co and ce are the initiatory and equilibrium concentration of th iv ions while qe is the quantity of adsorbed th iv ions by mg g loaded on zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents at equilibrium w is the dose by grams of zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents and v is the volume in a liter of th iv ions solution under the ideal th iv adsorption conditions the selectivity performance of zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents toward th iv ions was studied in single binary and mixed batch examination systems moreover the reusability of zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents in many cycles of th iv ion trapping was investigated nitric acid was used as an eluent agent for various desorption attempts the desorption releasing process was done by mixing the hno3 solution with th iv zro2 and th iv zrpfbs also different concentrations of an eluent agent were examined methodically the regenerated zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents were employed to remove th iv ions for five cycles under the optimal adsorption desorption requirements notwithstanding the disadvantageous effect of hno3 during the releasing process may diminish the quantity of external active sites and thus lead to minimizing the amount of adsorbed th iv ions the mesoporous zro2 platform was approximately retained with its architectural features 2 7 dft calculations the electronic and geometrical configuration of pfbs ligand and its th iv complex were optimized using the density functional theory becker s three parameterized lee yang par b3lyp exchange functional with b3lyp 6 31g d for pfbs and using a split basis set of b3lyp 6 31g d sdd for pfbs th4 basis sets the application package of gaussian 09 was used for all calculations 31 32 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents the surface morphology of zro2 was investigated using fe sem and hr tem fig 1a shows the fe sem images of zro2 and observes the formation of nanostructures the low focusing sem image of zro2 illustrates the formation of dense nanostructured particles fig 1a a b the irregular particles are formed from various tetragonal and bipyramidal structures the flake size is in the nanoscale range of 100 200 nm the zro2 nanoparticles surface texture is rough with irregular and weaved ends due to the removal of sds after annealing figure 1 ac in addition the porous structure like a sponge is clearly obtained from the sem image in figure 1 ad the hr tem images observe the irregular nanoflake structure of zro2 of tetragonal and bipyramidal the tetragonal structure of zro2 allows the high annular contact surface from multi faces the multi faces of zro2 nanoparticle with tetragonal orientation enlarge the surface coverage in addition the presence of a bipyramidal nanoflake structure within the tetragonal structure is observed in figure 1 ba the high focusing hr tem image illustrates the porous structure of the prepared zro2 like a sponge figure 1 bb the pore size ranged from 7 to 20 nm in addition the surface texture is rough due to the porous nature and nanosized edges of 100 200 nm therefore the zro2 nanoparticles would be a good candidate for the high loading of organic fluoroprobe and the durable design of a fluorescence sensor the loading of the pfbs probe at the surface of zro2 platform was configured using various analysis techniques such as ftir xps etc in addition these techniques illustrated the characteristic features and composition of zro2 and zrpfbs the fe sem of zrpfbs obtained the loading of pfbs on the surface of zro2 figure s1aa figure s1ab shows the zro2 outer inner surface covered by pfbs ligand in addition the pores are fully loaded and covered by the targeted probe these data outlining of zro2 is a good candidate for loading pfbs molecules the edx sem mapping shows the surface atomic composition of zro2 and zrpfbs for zro2 the zr and o atoms were observed and homogeneously distributed with wt of

respectively fig s1c a d these data provide the surface composition of zrpfbs indicating the successful loading of pfbs at the surface of zro2 nanoparticles the xrd analysis outlines the material s purity and the crystal structure of the proposed materials 33 fig 2a displays the xrd spectra of a zro2 and b zrpfbs the crystal structure of the prepared zirconia depends on the formulated particle size the various xrd peaks illustrated the presence of two crystal structures of tetragonal and monoclinic structures as reported in the literature the xrd peaks centered at 2θ of 23 98 27 96 31 16 33 95 38 24 40 59 44 89 48 95 55 24 65 45 and 74 73 are corresponding to 110 111 111 002 012 202 211 022 221 331 and 041 as the monoclinic crystal phase jcpds 37 1484 in addition the presence of xrd peaks cantered at 2θ of 30 02 35 02 50 03 53 8 59 88 and 62 62 corresponding to 011 110 112 021 121 and 022 that related the presence of tetragonal zro2 phase jcpds 80 0965 the peak intestates of 111 and 111 are too strong leading to the monoclinic zro2 phase being dominant these data outlined the formation of a stable monoclinic phase at room temperature and without stabilization the crystal size of zro2 was determined using the scherrer equation t 0 91λ bcosθ where the crystallite size equals 17 6 nm the xrd peaks of zrpfbs are the same as the zro2 nanoparticles leading to the successful loading of the organic pfbs molecules at the material surface without any effect on the crystal structure therefore the prepared materials provide the formation of zro2 with a dominant monoclinic phase fig 2b shows the ft ir spectra of zro2 black line and zrpfbs red line and obtains the successful loading of pfbs at the surface of zro2 due to the o surface vacant and oh and h2o surface nature of zro2 ft ir peaks at 3424 and 1636 cm 1 are attributed to oh s stretching and bending forms and adsorbed h2o molecules in addition peaks at 770 and 512 cm 1 are due to the bending of zro these results outline the surface functionality of zro2 of oh and h2o that would be the active functional centers to load pfbs the ft ir spectrum of zrpfbs shows the various functional groups due to the loading of pfbs at the surface of zro2 fig 2b red line the two ir peaks at 3423 and 3210 cm 1 are attributed to the stretching mode of nh2 meanwhile the band at 1614 63 cm 1 is related to the δnh2 vibrations these data support the free nh2 due to the sulfonamide in the pfbs the aromatic and aliphatic stretching of ch sp2 and ch sp3 are according to the peaks at 3220 2506 and 2258 cm 1 in addition the strong stretching bands at 1614 and 1728 cm 1 are assigned to the existence of cc and co bonds the so and cs functional groups are existed in the pfbs structure due to the presence of 1389 and 1198 cm 1 peaks respectively in addition the vibrational bands at 794 7 646 68 and 546 cm 1 are due to vibrational and stretching modes of cs and so respectively moreover the bands in the region of 800 500 cm 1 are also attributed to the meta oxide s bonds of zro the peak shift or the zro peaks and the presence of various bands for pfbs on zrpfbs provide the successful loading of pfbs on the zro2 surface the xps analysis provides the chemical composition and binding of components of the desired materials fig 2c shows the xps spectrum of zro2 and outlines the formation of zro2 molecules the xps peaks of zro2 are observed in fig 2c as follows zr 4s 55 08 ev zr 4p 31 08 ev zr 3p3 2 334 ev zr 3p1 2 347 ev zr 3d 184 95 ev zr 3s 430 1 ev and o 1s 531 1 ev the xps survey of zr 3d shows two peaks centered at 181 85 and 184 24 ev due to zr 3d5 2 and zr 3d3 2 respectively fig 2d the high intensity of the peak at 181 85 ev is due to the significant m zro2 crystal structure formation and some oxygen deficiencies the xps survey of o 1s shows the presence of two peaks at 529 64 and 531 37 ev due to the two types of oxygen species of zr o o and zr oh fig 2e the xps spectrum of zrpfbs shows the presence of the pfbs atomic components of c 1s 285 77 ev n 1s 400 08 ev and s 2p 162 62 ev with the presence of zro2 components of zr 3d 183 55 ev and o 1s 531 1 ev fig s2a fig s2b shows the xps survey of zr and obtains the same peaks at 181 85 and 184 24 ev due to the zr 3d5 3 and zr 3d2 3 the xps survey of c 1s shows the three major peaks for cc 284 61 ev co 288 37 ev and cn and cs 286 46 ev as shown in fig s2c the o 1s survey shows the presence of various o bonding formations zro co and so due to the presence of two peaks at 529 69 and 531 29 ev as shown in fig s2d these peaks are related to the various bonding between c and other heteroatoms of o n and s the xps survey of n 1s illustrates two peaks centered at 399 27 and 401 24 for n functional of n amine and nn respectively fig s2e fig s2f shows the s 2p survey and outlines three peaks centered at 163 57 and 168 52 ev related to the s bonding of c s n s 2p3 2 and so2 while the peak at 166 1 ev may relate to sn bonding these data provide the successful loading of pfbs at the surface of zro2 moreover zrpfbs after adsorption process was analysed using xps as shown in fig s3 figs s3a d show the xps spectrum for zr 3d o 1s c 1s and s 2p elements figs s3a d didn t show a significant difference between the zrpfbs before and after th iv adsorption on the other hand figs s3e of n 1s shows a clear difference after th iv ion adsorption where the binding energy values were shifted to lower values 398 46 and 400 2 ev this behavior is due to the real chemical interaction of th iv ions with n rich active sites fig s3f indicates the xps spectra of th 4f with showing four peaks at 332 6 334 9 345 9 and 346 9 ev therefore the xps data additional describes that th iv may be chelated with the n groups of zrpfbs the finding data suggests that the mechanism of th iv adsorption involves coordination bonds between th iv ions and zrpfbs surface sites based on the ft ir and xps data the hydrogen bonding formation between pfbs and zro2 is the main mechanism due to the various pfbs functional groups i e so2 nh2 co and nn and zro2 i e zr o zr and zr oh the surface nature of porosity and surface area are also indicators for loading pfbs at the surface of zro2 and the formation of zrpfbs fig s4a shows the n adsorption desorption isotherm of zro2 and zrpfbs the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area decreased after pfbs loaded at the surface of zro2 where the bet surface areas were 32 7 and 23 65 m2 g for zro2 and zrpfbs respectively in addition the pore size of zro2 7 2 nm was also changed after the formation of zrpfbs 6 1 nm fig s4b these data support the surface nature change after successfully loading pfbs due to the filling of zro2 s pores by pfbs and the formation of zrpfbs the good surface area and porosity signify the following results i trapping of a large quantities of th iv ions inside the pores of zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents and thus increasing the removal efficiency and capacity and ii smooth diffusion of th iv through pores along the zrpfbs surface 63 figure s5 a b shows the tg dta graph of zro2 and zrpfbs obtaining the prepared materials heat influence and clarifying the materials reproducibility and regeneration fig s5 shows the tg dta thermograph and outlines the one endothermic peak at 98 c due to losing adsorbed water with a stable crystalline structure meanwhile two endothermic peaks at 98 and 380 c are due to the loss of adsorbed water and the degradation of pfbs respectively in addition there is no exothermic peak for zro2 and zrpfbs leading to the stable crystalline formation of zro2 these data support the formation of zrpfbs and the regeneration of the zro2 platform that would be further used in loading the fluoroprobes with high stability 3 2 fluorometric detection of th iv ions using pfbs probe various metal ions were used to test the pfbs probe to verify its performance such as sr2 u6 co2 cd2 pb2 al3 mn2 hg2 ba2 ni2 zn2 th iv at a final concentration of 1 5 ppm the excitation zone of the pfbs probe was adjusted at the wavelength λex 559 nm while the maximum wavelength emission was recorded at λmax 586 nm as exhibited in fig 3a as shown in fig 3b the pfbs probe fluorescence was exceptionally enhanced at the reaction with th iv ions other metals had no discernible influence on the pfbs fluorescence probe s emission peak the acquired selectivity behavior for th iv ions suggests that the pfbs probe can be an efficient and highly choosy fluoro probe for th iv recognition in various water models the ph value of the reaction medium in many analytical experiences is the most influential parameter that positively or negatively affects metal trapping chelating interactions the influence of ph value on pfbs th iv complex production was examined in a wide ph range of 1 0 5 5 the obtained data fig 3c revealed that ph 3 5 is the optimal ph value at which the best fluorescence enhancement was achieved the proposed fluorescent probe has an acidic function and its sensitivity depends on the change in the ph values the significant reduction in pfbs th iv complex formation observed at lower ph may be attributable to the intense contest of h ions with th iv ions at the functional groups of the pfbs probe moreover at ph values above 3 5 the concentration of hydroxyl ions increases significantly resulting in a decrease in th iv concentration reducing the emission peak intensity therefore a ph of 3 5 was concluded to be the optimum ph for subsequent experiments delayed response time is an undesirable feature in metal fluorescence assays as a result the response time toward th iv detection is another critical aspect of the pfbs probe and should be considered therefore the influence of the reaction time on the complex formation between th iv ions and pfbs probe was examined as shown in fig 3d as seen the fluorescence intensity of the pfbs probe increases rapidly within 120 s it then remains almost unchanged from 120 to 300 s quick response time is a crucial feature of our suggested sensor for th iv detection in addition the stability of the complexation process between the pfbs probe and th iv ions was observed over the extended contact time as shown in fig 3d the obtained results proved that pfbs th iv complex has high stability with a slight and imperceptible decrease in the fluorescence intensity after a contact time of 120 s the fluorescence spectra of the pfbs probe after reaction with several th iv concentrations were studied and shown in fig s6a the achieved results indicated that at expanding th iv concentration the peak intensity of the pfbs probe was regularly increased under the optimum conditions of fluorometric detection of th iv ions lower dl has been observed by the designed probe fig s6b exhibits the calibration plot which describes the relationship between th iv concentration with the relative fluorescence intensity of pfbs probe the straight line behavior was undoubtedly shown with a high correlation coefficient r2 0 98 accordingly the pfbs probe can monitor th iv ions concentrations in an aqueous solution at ultra trace levels up to 0 19 ppm these results referred to the high sensitivity of the pfbs probe as a sensor for the quantitative and qualitative detection of th iv ions as a result it might provide a promising ligand for removing th iv ions even at low level concentrations from contaminated water samples to explain the binding features of pfbs ligand toward th iv ions job s method was utilized to describe the mole ratio of th iv ion and pfbs ligand a similar concentration of pfbs ligand and th iv ions were prepared in ethanol and water respectively eleven experiments were conducted using 10 ml mixed from the ligand and th iv ions the addition was performed by mixing up volumes of pfbs ligand gradually increased from 0 to 10 ml with volumes of th iv ion decreasing from 10 to 0 ml after 2 min of mixing the fluoro measurements were performed and peak intensity was recorded at λmax 586 nm job s figure can be obtained by plotting the peak intensity as opposed to the th iv pfbs ligand th iv molar fraction as shown in fig s6c according to the obtained data from job s curve the highest intensity occurs at the mole fraction of 0 5 so the optimal molar ratio between th iv ions and the pfbs sensor equals 1 1 3 3 th iv removal using zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents 3 3 1 effect of the initial ph the initial ph of the feed solution considers a key variable affecting the trapping of th iv ions on zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents as it affects the behaviors of th iv ions in the bulk solution 34 since ph considerably influences the protonation of external active sites choosiness rate of removal and adsorption efficiency it must be considered in the adsorption studies the influence of the initial ph solution on the adsorption efficiency of th iv using zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents was performed within ph values ranging from 1 to 6 and the other factors were kept constant initial th iv concentration of 10 ppm stirring time of 60 min sorbent dosage of 50 mg room temperature as shown in fig 4a gradually increasing ph values from 1 to 4 leads to increasing adsorption efficiency of th iv ions using zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents from 55 and 97 5 respectively the highest adsorption efficiency was achieved at ph 4 after that adsorption efficiency became constant in the ph range from 4 to 6 in highly acidic solutions a high reduction in the adsorption efficiency of th iv ions occurs this behavior may be attributable to the presence of h leading to intense competition between protons and th iv ions on the surface active sites of sorbents furthermore at the ph values of solutions 4 thorium ions may be precipitated as thorium hydroxides such as th oh 3 th oh 2 2 and th2 oh 2 6 leading to fake adsorption or significant adsorption errors 35 hence we chose ph 4 as the optimal ph condition to complete the current experimental study and avoid trapping other metals or precipitation of th iv ions the excellent removal of the zrpfbs sorbent can be ascribed to the subsequent factors i the nature of the sorbent as it has an abundance of exterior interior active sites along the surface and pores of the zrpfbs sorbent and ii the fast th iv transfer with easy diffusion through the cavities grooves on the surface matrix of the mesoporous zrpfbs sorbent 3 3 2 effect of stirring time to assess the impact of stirring time 50 mg of zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents were mixed up with 50 ml of th iv ions solution for 2 5 120 min with th iv concentration of 10 ppm at ph 4 and ambient temperature the influence of stirring time on the th iv adsorption using zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents is shown in fig 4b where the rate of adsorption begins to increase very rapidly the results show that the best th iv adsorption efficiency was achieved within 30 min after that it gradually increases until the adsorption process reaches equilibrium within 30 45 min this behavior occurs because adsorbents reach the saturation state where th iv ions occupy all sorbents active sites with growing stirring time the adsorption of th iv remained approximately fixed no significant increase in the adsorption was found by increasing the stirring time therefore the optimum stirring time was set to be 30 min for the subsequent experiments 3 3 3 effect of sorbent dose the sorbent amount is another vital index for the th iv adsorption efficiency batch trials were set up with various amounts of zro2 and zrpfbs from 25 to 100 mg where the th iv solution 50 ml 10 ppm was stirred for 30min at ph 4 the effect of zro2 and zrpfbs dose on th iv adsorption is displayed in fig 4c the th iv adsorption efficiency using zro2 and zrpfbs was improved with sorbent dose growth this outcome may be attributed to the increasing active sites of designed sorbents the removal of th iv ions was close to equilibrium 98 at a dosage of zrpfbs 50 mg due to the existence of pfbs probe along the surface and pores of zrpfbs considering the high adsorption and reasonable economic aspects an adsorption dosage of 50 mg was selected for the following experiments 3 3 4 effect of interfering cations the impact of interfering cations on the zro2 and zrpfbs selectivity for th iv adsorption was examined at specific ph 4 selective th iv trapping using the designed adsorbents was carried out experimentally in the existence of equivalent concentrations i e 10 ppm of different cations separately such as al3 fe3 cu2 cr3 zn2 ni2 co2 mg2 ca2 k and na fig 4d shows the direct adsorption of zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents to all competitive cations indicating weak cation to sorbent binding events fig 4d suggested that the zrpfbs is more selective than the zro2 adsorbent toward th iv ions owing to the existence of pfbs ligand which tends to bind selectively to th iv ions furthermore the selectivity behavior of zro2 and zrpfbs toward th iv ion was examined intensively in binary approaches under applying optimal ph circumstances with equal concentrations of the interfering cations the achieved outcomes in fig s7a demonstrated that the interfering cations didn t influence the th iv adsorption efficiency particularly in the case of the zrpfbs sorbent hence the zrpfbs adsorbent has a strong anti ion interfering ability with high selectivity toward th iv ions adsorption to investigate the influence of mixed cations on the th iv removal performance we used a mixture of th iv ions and at least two competing cations with similar concentrations g1 g5 as displayed in fig s7 caption the outcomes in fig s7b confirmed that zrpfbs adsorbents outperformed zro2 adsorbents in selectively th iv ions trapping removal among other competitive ions this performance was because the designed pfbs ligand has selectively functional groups therefore zrpfbs is considered an excellent model for removing th iv from different water samples 3 4 isotherm study of th iv removal the adsorption isotherm model assumes that all adsorption positions are identical and that their states depend on whether nearby sites are busy the relation between the th iv content and the quantity of sorbed th iv ions on the surface of used adsorbents can be determined by isotherm models 36 fig 5a displays the th iv adsorption capacities of both designed sorbents zro2 and zrpfbs versus the initial th iv concentrations 0 001 250 ppm the outcomes demonstrated that the quantity of th iv ions mg g adsorbed on the designed zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents reached the maximum equilibrium capacity under optimal conditions with values of 49 5 and 137 mg g for zro2 and zrpfbs respectively the langmuir model assumes homogeneous adsorption on the outer surface of used sorbents therefore the langmuir model describes the adsorption mechanism of monolayer adsorption which occurs at specific active sites where no further adsorption can occur after sites are occupied the linear langmuir model is given by the following relation 37 38 4 c e q e 1 k l q o 1 q o c e qo mg g is the highest adsorption capability and kl l mg is the langmuir constant fig 5b c and table 1 show the results of graphing ce qe vs ce to determine qo and kl values the theoretical maximum saturation capacities for each zro2 and zrpfbs were 53 7 and 142 86 mg g respectively these values correspond to the realistic saturation capacity it is worth noticing that the r2 values are very high which were 0 96 and 0 994 for both zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents respectively the results showed that after anchoring pfbs ligands on the zro2 mesoporous platform the zrpfbs adsorbent has a uniform surface and its interaction with th iv ions was chemical the separation factor rl is a dimensionless constant that may represent the langmuir model s essential properties rl value considers a more reliable indicator of the adsorption process rl value is described as follows 39 5 r l 1 1 k l c o co ppm represents the initial th iv concentration and rl provides info about the adsorption mechanism the type of the isotherm depends on the value of rl it is either favorable 0 rl 1 unfavorable rl 1 linear rl 1 or irreversible rl 0 the rl values of zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents are displayed in table 1 values of rl showed favorable th iv adsorption onto zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents the freundlich model presumes that adsorption on the surface of zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents happens heterogeneously this model explains the multi site intermolecular interactions between ions adsorbed to the adjacent active sites in a multilayer the linear shape of the freundlich model is presented by the next relationship 40 41 6 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e kf represents the adsorption capability of zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents while n represents the sorption strength for used adsorbents kf and n were estimated from the ln qe graphing against ln ce as shown in fig s8a b and table 1 the heterogeneity degree depends on the 1 n factor decreasing the 1 n value refers to a higher heterogeneity grade a standard adsorption behavior occurs at 1 n is 1 herein values of 1 n are 1 for both used adsorbents representing that the adsorption process of the th iv removal using zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents is favorable and chemisorption the achieved r2 values confirmed that the freundlich model does not suit the practical results especially using the zrpfbs sorbent here the temkin isotherm paradigm was further explored the temkin isotherm assumes that the heat of th iv adsorption decreases with the coverage of adsorbent surface active sites by target adsorbate the linear equation of the temkin isotherm model can be written as follows 42 7 q e bln k t bln c e 8 b rt b the b constant is related to th iv adsorption heat t is the absolute temperature k r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k b is the temkin constant j mol and kt is the temkin isotherm constant l g according to r2 values the temkin model is more fitted than the freundlich model clarifying the applicability of the temkin prototype to describe the th iv adsorption onto zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents which proved that the th iv adsorption using zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents was undoubtedly a chemical process fig s9a b and table 1 the dubinin radushkevich dr isotherm model was also studied to explain the characteristics of th iv adsorption associated with the porous feature for both zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents the dr model can be clarified through the following linear equation 43 9 ln q e ln q o δ ɛ 2 10 ɛ rtln 1 1 c e ε is polanyi potential and ce and qo are in mol l and mol g units δ constant mol2 j2 is related to the energy of th iv ions adsorption the average th iv ion adsorption energy e j mol can offer a hint about the nature of th iv adsorbent interaction physisorption e 8 kj mol chemisorption e 8 16 kj mol where the e value can be defined via the next equation 11 e 1 2 δ in the current study the e values of zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents were about 14 and 13 8 kj mol respectively therefore the th iv adsorption process is chemisorption fig s9c d and table 1 3 5 kinetic study of th iv removal kinetic studies provide enough information about the target adsorption mechanism which is essential for process efficiency chemical or physical processes that occur during the adsorption process can be represented mathematically through the kinetic model the adsorption mechanism occurs at different rates beginning from very fast to very slow 44 two kinetic models were utilized to assess the strength and nature of th iv adsorption as a function of stirring time these models included pseudo first order pfo and the second model called pseudo second order pso the pfo model describes the physisorption process as a rate determining step while the pso model assumes that chemisorption involves valence forces associated with electrons sharing or exchanging 45 the linearized structures of the pfo and pso versions are represented in the following equations 46 47 12 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t 13 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t qt and qe mg g are the quantities of adsorbed th iv ions onto zro2 and zrpfbs at a time t and equilibrium k1 and k2 are the rates constant for pfo min 1 and pso g mg min initially the pfo version was employed to evaluate the practical information that had been obtained the plotting of log qe qt versus t was displayed in figs s10a b qe and k1 values were estimated from the straight line and listed in table 2 the findings revealed that the theoretical qe values are very close to the practical qe values with acceptable r2 values values of pso parameters qe and k2 were evaluated from the graphing of t qt against t as demonstrated in figs s10c d and table 2 the calculated and experimental qe values had been obtained using 10 ppm of th iv ions and were observed to be approximately similar the r2 values of the pso version are better than the pfo version indicating that the pso version is an appropriate kinetic model for illustrating the th iv adsorption process using zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents moreover the high linearity of fig s10d indicates that the pso kinetic model perfectly suits the chemisorption nature the elovich model was investigated to describe the chemisorption kinetic of th iv ions using adsorbents it can be typed in a linear form as follow 48 14 q t 1 β ln αβ 1 β ln t α mg g min is the initial rate of th iv adsorption and β g mg is a constant according to r2 values the elovich model successfully describes the th iv adsorption process the larger α value of zrpfbs may assign to the abundance of active sites along the surface of the zrpfbs adsorbent the β value was enhanced from 0 625 g mg to 0 649 g mg due to the growing surface active sites after modification using pfbs ligand to get zrpfbs adsorbent fig s11a b and table 2 the intra particle diffusion ipd model was also examined to explain the rate controlling phase of the th iv adsorption process the ipd model is defined by the later linear balance 49 15 q t k id t 0 5 i the kid is the ipd rate constant mg g min0 5 i is a constant related to the outer layer intensity the plotting of qt versus t0 5 for zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents are described in fig s11c d while the obtained values of r2 and other constants are recorded in table 2 the kid value of zrpfbs is lesser than the zro2 adsorbent suggesting that the diffusion of th iv ions into the zrpfbs pores is slower than zro2 adsorbent due to the existence of dense grafted pfbs ligand 3 6 computational studies of th iv trapping mechanism the 3d initial optimized structure for both pfbs and different possible structures of the thorium complex of pfbs th4 was determined using the semi empirical pm6 theory however the selected structures were reoptimized and electronic properties were studied using the higher level of dft methods of b3lyp 6 31g d for pfbs and using a split basis set of b3lyp 6 31g d sdd for pfbs th4 as shown in fig 6a b fig 6c of the electrostatic surface potential esp for pfbs in the ground state indicates that the more negative the atomic partial charges were located on nitrogen atoms and its neighbor of benzene rings 50 thus the nitrogen atoms have the most probability of donating their electrons to the thorium ion and chelation easily occurs the complex of pfbs th4 thorium ion shows distorted octahedral binding sites and is connected by the high electron density of nitrogen atoms of pfbs and completes its coordination with nitrate ions furthermore the dft method suggests the possibility of charge transfer between the chemo sensor of pfbs and th4 ions which resulted in a 0 31 ev decrease in the band gap upon complexation as presented in fig 7 17 51 52 in addition the pfbs permitted excitation of the homo to lumo state singlet 388 66 nm 3 19 ev homo 1 to lumo 1 singlet 244 06 nm 5 08 ev homo to lumo 1 singlet 257 76 nm 4 81 ev and homo 1 to lumo states singlet 358 33 nm 43 46 ev these homo level results align with those obtained from the pfbs th complex which refers to the pfbs being considered the source of the ground state electrons even upon complexation with th iv and as expected it was also observed that the lumo levels of the pfbs th complex were scattered over the unoccupied states of th iv ions these findings suggest that the nitrogen atom was the best location for building complexes with the th iv ion further the density of state dos of the pfbs th complex shows an increasing number of unoccupied states with lower energy compared to pfbs as shown in fig s12 this finding confirms the ability of thorium ions to share the unoccupied orbitals with pfbs and boost the possibility of the energy transfer from pfbs to thorium ions 3 7 reusability of zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents the elution and subsequent materials regeneration without reducing efficiency are critical factors in choosing materials to use in industrial applications and decreasing their cost this trend has the attention of many peoples due to the cost effectiveness of using the adsorbent materials for several cycles 53 many adsorbent materials with high adsorption capacity have also been reported for th iv removal but they can only be used once or cannot be reused therefore it is preferable to desorb th iv ions from zro2 and zrpfbs and regenerate them in multiple cycles without losing their original function the elution desorption efficacy of trapped th iv ions from th iv zro2 zrpfbs solid was determined using the desorption equation cd ca x100 where ca and cd are the concentration of adsorbed and desorbed th iv ions to desorb the trapped th iv ions and regenerate used adsorbents numerous elution trials were conducted using hno3 after treating zro2 and zrpfbs adsorbents with nitric acid they were filtered dried and then reused for th iv adsorption the batch examination method was used for desorbing th iv ions by stirring 0 05 g of the th iv zro2 zrpfbs solid with 20 ml of hno3 at various concentrations for 30 min as appeared in fig s13a the desorption of the th iv ions enhanced with increasing hno3 concentration the electrostatic repulsion between th iv ions and the positive active sites of zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents may be occurred by increasing hno3 concentration leading to an increase in the desorption efficiency based on desorption studies of th iv ions by hno3 0 1 mol l of hno3 was found to be the optimal concentration to desorb 99 5 of the trapped th iv ions the generated adsorbents were reused five times as shown in fig s13b th iv ions adsorption efficiencies in the first cycle were 55 and 97 5 t for zro2 and zrpfbs respectively on the other hand the adsorption efficiencies after five reuse cycles were reduced to 41 and 89 for both zro2 and zrpfbs respectively the reduced efficiency may be due to the decreased surface active centers for them by the repeated adsorption desorption cycles table 3 compares our proposed material zro2 zrpfbs and other different adsorbents regarding ph removal effectiveness and capacity the achieved assessment indicated that zrpfbs has a high removal efficacy and capacity for th iv ions due to its high surface area and porosity 4 conclusion in the current manuscript fluorometric investigations were performed for selective and sensitive determination and detection of th iv ions using a novel pfbs ligand zrpfbs adsorbent was fabricated by functionalizing mesoporous zro2 nanoparticles using the synthesized pfbs ligand different features of zro2 and zrpfbs sorbents were investigated via sem tem edx xrd xps ftir tga and n2 adsorption desorption isotherm zrpfbs was used efficiently to remove and adsorb th iv ions from an aqueous solution even at low th iv concentration the mesoporous zrpfbs adsorbent offers a rapid th iv diffusion along apertures high removal efficiency and a cost efficient process the key investigational factors such as ph solution contact time etc are significant for detecting and adsorbing th iv ions therefore they were systematically studied our outcomes confirm that the detection and removal method of th iv ions is a ph dependent method the zrpfbs adsorbent shown as high th iv removal efficiency of 97 5 with an adsorption capacity of 137 mg g at ph 4 langmuir and pso models are the best appropriate models to explain the th iv removal mechanism additionally the spent zrpfbs can be reused for five cycles where hno3 0 1 mol l was used as an eluent agent to recover 99 5 of adsorbed th iv ions and generate zrpfbs free with maintaining high performance the results suggested that the zrpfbs sorbent can act as a candidate sorbent to remove th iv ions from actual water

depth this study examined the responses of biofilm exposure to different doses of sdz 0 1 3 5 7 and 10 mg l in the pure mbbr under continuous flow conditions pure mbbr held a high sdz removal rate but sdz significantly inhibited cod and tn removal however 1 3 mg l sdz could enhance nh4 n and tp removal and these observations were confirmed by biomass analysis and multi omics sequencing data sdz accelerated the sloughing and renewal of aerobic biofilm thus shortening the solids residence time the biofilm communities were strongly shifted by sdz and the activity of autotrophs was less inhibited by sdz than that of heterotrophs meanwhile sdz did not alter the biofilm s primary nitrogen metabolism mechanism while disrupting the ratio of denitrification genes to nitrification genes sdz effectively promoted the gene expression of amocab and hao but restrained norbc the increased abundance of resistance genes sul1 3 was a major reason for the biofilm could adapt to the high concentration of sdz overall the pure mbbr could operate well when sdz was below 3 mg l this study provided new insight into antibiotic wastewater treatment through pure mbbr graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pure mbbr sulfadiazine nitrogen removal biofilm microbial community multi omics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since the 21st century contaminants of emerging concern cecs in particular pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps have gained increasing concerns due to their potential impacts on human health 1 2 among them sulfadiazine sdz is a broad spectrum bacteriostatic antibiotic that has found wide applications in aquaculture veterinary and human medication 3 due to the poor absorbability and degradability of sdz in the guts of humans and animals a considerable proportion was directly discharged into the ecosystem unchanged through feces and urine 4 meanwhile sdz is stable in the typical aqueous environment and intractable for complete removal by traditional wastewater treatment plants wwtps 5 6 therefore sdz is ubiquitous in wastewater and aquatic ecosystems 7 8 recently moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr has attracted attention as an option to improve the removal of cecs 9 10 in mbbr biomass grows on suspended plastic or sponge carriers with a dramatic extension of solids residence time srt compared to activated sludge systems falas et al 2012 11 reported that biofilm carriers demonstrated considerably higher removal rates per unit biomass of several pharmaceuticals compared to the sludges i e attached growth biomass agbs for the carriers was better than mixed liquor suspended solids mlss for the sludges abtahi et al 2018 12 examined the contribution of the biofilm agbs and suspended biomass mlss in micropollutants removal and the former showed approximately two times the diclofenac reduction rate than mlss which is due to that the diverse microbial community would possibly enable the agbs to outperform the mlss for removal of bio refractory cecs 13 thus for the pure mbbr technology with agbs as biomass core and without mlss return system biofilm has higher organic matter and nitrogen removal efficiency than suspended biomass and is viable in the removal of pharmaceuticals including antibiotics 13 14 as the majority of studies have focused on hybrid biofilm and activated sludge systems targeting pharmaceuticals 9 15 little is known about pure mbbr especially with no detailed information for microbial responses and pollutant removal performance of pure mbrr to the successional exposure of sdz in this study we investigated the elimination of sdz in a single pure mbbr configuration and the influences of sdz dose variation on the operational performance of biofilm for artificial wastewater treatment the main objectives of our investigation were i to assess and compare the effects of various sdz concentrations on the treatment performance of pure mbbr process ii to evaluate the influences of biofilm continuous exposure to different sdz loading on its biomass and morphological characteristics and iii to eventually investigate the association between reactor performance pollutants removal and biomass change microbial community structure abundance and nitrogen metabolism function pathways gene expression 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge inoculation and experiment strategy the initial sludge is used for bioreactor activation was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank at futian wwtp shenzhen china with 10 63 0 38 g l mlss after acclimatization the is was diluted to 3 0 g l mlss and then seeded into the mbbr reactor the continuous flow experiment was lasted 180 days and the whole process was divided into six stages according to different influent concentrations of sdz and the detailed dosing strategies were shown in table 1 while the trace nutrients used in the synthetic wastewater were listed in supplementary materials sm an investigation showed that the concentration of antibiotics in pharmaceutical wastewater could reach 5 06 mg l 16 and in a reported study using biological process the dosage of sulfonamide antibiotics had been considered up to 25 mg l 17 therefore this research selected an intermediate value of 10 mg l as the maximum tested concentration of sdz in stage sdz0 days 1 30 no sdz was added in stage sdz1 days 30 60 the dosage of sdz added into the pure mbbr was 1 mg l similarly the concentrations of sdz were 3 mg l 5 mg l 7 mg l and 10 mg l in stage sdz3 days 60 90 stage sdz5 days 90 120 stage sdz7 days 120 150 and stage sdz10 days 150 180 respectively 2 2 construction and operation conditions of pure mbbr one single laboratory scale pure mbbr system china pat no cn216918752u filled with porous polymer carriers ppc was used in this study the shape and properties of ppc were detailed in table s1 the configuration of mbbr fig 1 mainly included a cylindrical reaction area ra d 40 cm h 60 cm with working volume of 60 l and a conical sedimentation area sa d 40 cm h 34 cm of 14 l a support plate with evenly distributed 20 mm pores was positioned at the junction of ra and sa the detailed strategies of bioreactor start up were described in sm in which the emergence and diversification of protozoa fig s1 and the stability of effluent quality indicated the successful domestication of mbbr at the end of the start up period the pure mbbr could effectively remove about 91 0 of chemical oxygen demand cod 84 8 of ammonia nitrogen 79 4 of total nitrogen and 44 6 of total phosphorous during the experimental period the system did not hold and return activated sludge in the reaction area and the attached biofilms were the main form of the microorganisms the operating conditions of each stage were entirely consistent as listing in table 1 2 3 effluent sampling and chemical analysis after each stage had stabilized influent and effluent water samples were taken consecutively for the final five days to characterize the treatment performance of the pure mbbr all the effluent samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm pore size triplicate analyses were conducted to ensure accuracy measurements for the concentrations of cod total phosphorous tp and nitrogen in forms of ammonium nh4 n nitrite no2 n nitrate no3 n and total nitrogen tn were performed according to standard methods for the analysis of water and wastewater 18 besides the ph temperature and do were monitored using wtw ph 3210 and oxi3210 probes wtw company germany for sdz measurement solid phase extraction spe and high performance liquid chromatography hplc were served in the quantitative analysis the detailed procedures were described in sm 2 4 biomass analysis the biomass was measured on the last day of each stage the mlss was measured by standard methods 18 the agbs was determined by the gravimetric method 9 the morphological structure of the biocarriers with agbs was observed using sem as for the fixation and dehydration process the initial carrier without microorganisms and all sdz stage carriers were first fixed using glutaraldehyde 5 at 4 c for about 12 h next all samples were dehydrated by graded series of ethanol of different concentrations 30 50 70 80 95 and 100 for 15 min at each step and then dried 12 h by freeze dryers scientz 18 n china finally the prepared samples were coated with gold in ion sputter for 4 5 min and analyzed by sem tescan mira4 czech 2 5 sequencing of dna and rna metagenomic sequencing was performed to track the changes in community structure and nitrogen metabolism genes in biofilms metatranscriptomic sequencing was also used in this study given the limitations of dna sequencing 19 and the potentially significant impact of sdz on the expression of active microorganisms and genes 20 approximately 100 biocarriers were taken randomly on the last day of each stage for microbial community analysis and immediately after biocarrier collection equal amounts of clean carriers without biofilm are replenished to the mbbr to ensure that all reaction stages hold the same filling ratio the sample collection of biomass refers to the study previously published by zhu et al 2022 21 in the end a total of seven groups of biomass including the is were collected the sequencing was using an illumina novaseq 6000 platform and all raw reads were processed for quality control genome assembly and gene prediction finally non redundant gene catalog was constructed for species taxonomy ncbi nr database functional annotation kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database antibiotic resistance genes annotation card database and abundance calculation meanwhile in order to eliminate errors in comparing the relative abundance of genes between samples which with varies in absolute content of total microorganisms 22 and for better dissect the intrinsic link between functional genes of nitrogen metabolism pathway ko00910 nitrogen metabolism https www genome jp pathway and snd performance in biofilms then the relative abundance ratio between total denitrification genes total dngs and total nitrification genes total ngs was calculated for each stage 1 total dngs total ngs narghi napab nirk nirs norbc nosz sum of the abundance nxrab amocab hao sum of the abundance in addition more details of the sequencing process and bioinformatics analysis could be obtained from the previous reports 19 21 2 6 calculations and statistical analysis the ammonia oxidation performance was expressed as the surface area nh4 n removal rate sarr mg n m2 d 23 2 sarr q nh 4 n inf nh 4 n eff v w a s f where q is the flow rate of feed 120 l day nh 4 n inf is ammonia concentrations in the influent mg l nh 4 n eff is ammonia concentration in the effluent mg l v w is the working volume of the reactor 0 06 m3 a s is biocarrier specific surface area 4000 m2 m3 and f is the filling ratio of biocarrier 25 similarly denitrification performance the accumulation of no2 n no3 n and no x n were calculated as the surface area nox n removal rate snrr mg n m2 d the accumulation rate of no2 n sno2ar mg n m2 d no3 n sno3ar mg n m2 d and no x n snar mg n m2 d respectively the computational method is consistent with eq 1 and therefore not listed in detail here based on these the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd rate was calculated using eq 3 3 snd snrr sarr 100 for the results all physicochemical data were presented in mean sd ibm spss software was used for linear regression analysis and difference analysis by one way anova among the six treatments analysis of similarities anosim and principal co ordinates analysis pcoa were performed to detect the differences in microbial community structure in different sample groups diagrams were visualized by origin pro and graphpad prism a significance level of 95 p 0 05 was selected in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 organic pollutants removal performance the results showed a significant reduction in cod removal efficiencies of sdz1 sdz3 sdz5 sdz7 and sdz10 compared with sdz0 p 0 05 and a negative linear correlation between cod removal and sdz concentration r 2 0 692 p 0 001 fig 2a in sdz0 the cod removal rate was stable at 93 21 0 87 and the corresponding effluent cod was 27 15 3 49 mg l which indicated the pure mbbr could perform effectively for cod treatment subsequently the sdz caused approximately 15 decreasing in cod removal stage by stage and the effluent cod raise to 86 42 0 64 mg l in sdz10 illustrating an effective restrain to the cod removal of pure mbbr by sdz du et al 2019 24 found an increased tendency of sludge bulking and more filamentous bacteria under long term exposure to 5 mg l tetracycline and 1 mg l sulfamethoxazole smx which in turn led to mlss loss and suppressed cod removal in an anoxic aerobic system surprisingly wan et al 2018 25 tracked that sdz could cause an adverse effect for cod removal of aerobic granular sludge even at low pressure 0 10 100 and 1000 μg l and the inhibition effect was related to the concentration of sdz implying that heterotrophic microorganisms may be more sensitive to sdz exposure in addition details of the experimental conditions and parameters in comparison with similar research were listed in table 2 the pure mbbr held a high antibiotic removal rate under 1 10 mg l sdz fig 2b in sdz1 the removal rate of sdz was 95 88 0 91 and the effluent sdz was 0 044 0 009 mg l when the sdz dose was increased to 3 mg l about 99 19 0 26 sdz could be removed in the remaining stages sdz5 sdz10 the average removal performance and effluent concentration of sdz were 99 64 and 0 025 mg l respectively illustrating a strong ability of the pure mbbr to remove sdz even though in high influent sdz concentration torresi et al 2017 26 used the post denitrifying mbbr to treat micropollutants and 35 removal of smx was observed gallardo altamirano et al 2021 27 investigated the performance of a2o ifas system treating municipal wastewater and the results showed that the average removal rate value for smx was 63 in contrast the pure mbbr maintained a removal rate of 95 for all sdz doses from 1 to 10 mg l in this study which may be related to the stronger biotransformation ability of biofilms than suspended biomass for recalcitrant organic pollutants 12 on the other hand the ppc sponge could increase the porosity and adsorbable surface area of the biofilms 28 thus improving the diffusion and adsorption of sdz in the biofilms 3 2 nitrogen removal performance 3 2 1 evaluation of nitrification and denitrification 3 2 1 1 the nitrification performance of pure mbbr the nh4 n removal displayed a rising first and then declining trend fig 2c compared with sdz0 each sdz dosage remarkably enhanced the nh4 n treatment efficiencies p 0 05 but the rise of sdz concentration led to a reduction trend in the nh4 n removal rate in sdz0 the pure mbbr kept 94 67 0 22 removal rate for nh4 n and the effluent nh4 n was 1 60 0 07 mg l demonstrating a highly efficient nitrification process in pure mbbr system amazingly in sdz1 the nh4 n removal rate climbed to the maximum of 99 38 0 32 and the effluent nh4 n arrived the minimum of only 0 19 0 10 mg l with a great improvement in nitrification compared to sdz1 the nh4 n removal rate declined significantly p 0 05 when the influent sdz gradually ascended to 3 10 mg l the descending trend of nh4 n removal rate slowed down from stage sdz5 sdz10 and there was no statistical difference in nitrification between sdz5 and sdz7 sdz7 and sdz10 p 0 05 finally the nh4 n removal rate of sdz10 was 97 22 0 20 it was still significantly higher than the sdz0 existing research showed that 1000 μg l sdz did not affect the nitrification performance of aerobic granular sludge 25 and unlike zhang et al 2016 29 who indicated that 10 mg l smx dramatically reduced the nh4 n removal in the activated sludge system p 0 05 our results found that the 1 3 mg l of sdz could well promote the nitrification of the pure mbbr and 10 mg l sdz still enhanced the ammonia oxidation 3 2 1 2 the no2 n accumulation performance of pure mbbr the response of sno2ar fig 2d was roughly the same as that of nh4 n removal efficiency with an overall trend of increase followed by a decrease compared with the sdz0 the sno2ar of sdz1 to sdz10 showed a remarkable elevation p 0 05 after the influx of sdz nevertheless the increment role of sno2ar by 3 10 mg l sdz on the pure mbbr was significantly diminished compared with 1 mg l sdz p 0 05 in sdz0 the sno2ar stabilized at 0 028 0 007 mg n m2 d and the effluent no2 n concentration retained at 0 082 0 003 mg l which was far below 0 1 mg l and the accumulation of no2 n was extremely low however in sdz1 the effluent no2 n concentration rose to 0 803 0 023 mg l the sno2ar was 54 14 times higher than that in the sdz0 and reached the maximum of 1 516 0 038 mg n m2 d among the six stages the accumulation of no2 n then gradually dropped from stage sdz3 to sdz7 while no significant difference was observed in sno2ar between sdz3 and sdz5 p 0 05 the mean values of sno2ar in sdz3 sdz7 were 14 54 14 46 and 11 75 times of sdz0 respectively and the overall effluent no2 n in these three stages was 0 239 0 009 mg l however in sdz10 the effluent no2 n accumulation climbed again and increased to 0 593 0 002 mg l and the sno2ar rose to 1 086 0 010 mg n m2 d which was 38 79 times of sdz0 early study has observed that the 6 10 mg l pharmaceuticals including smx could significantly inhibit bacterial nitrite oxidation 30 therefore the accumulation of no2 n may be attributed to the promotion of nh4 n removal by sdz leading to an increase in no2 n production while the 10 mg l sdz had an inhibitory effect on nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 3 2 1 3 the denitrification performance of pure mbbr the results suggested that sno3ar fig 2e was on a steady increase with the rise of sdz pressure compared to sno2ar in comparison to sdz0 the sno3ar of sdz1 to sdz10 presented a remarkable boost p 0 05 after sdz exposure and a significant positive linear relationship existed between sno3ar and influent sdz concentration r 2 0 872 p 0 001 in sdz0 the effluent no3 n maintained at 4 277 0 103 mg l and the sno3ar was 7 470 0 190 mg n m2 d in sdz1 sdz10 the no3 n concentrations in the effluent rose to 6 931 0 104 8 624 0 066 11 327 0 055 12 025 0 045 and 12 588 0 130 mg l respectively while the matching sno3ar were 12 596 0 202 15 952 0 132 21 428 0 121 22 747 0 090 and 23 811 0 234 mg n m2 d which were 1 69 2 14 2 87 3 05 and 3 19 times of that in sdz0 respectively the striking increase in sno3ar illustrated that sdz strongly interfered with the denitrification process of the biofilm and had a notable acceleration on the no3 n accumulation some studies have reported on the inhibition of denitrification by antibiotics gui and co workers 31 presented that 20 μg l smx severely repressed no3 n reduction denitrifying genes expression electron transport activity and the growth of denitrifier strain li et al 2021 32 showed that 10 100 mg l antibiotics including smx decreased no3 n removal efficiencies of the egsb reactor by 7 98 26 80 accompanied by the significant decrease in the expressed narg nirs and nosz genes with a higher antibiotic concentration showing stronger inhibitory effect therefore it could also be speculated that sdz had a compulsive suppression effect on the metabolic activity and gene expression of biofilm denitrifying bacteria dnb 3 2 2 snd performance and total nitrogen removal from the formula 3 it could be seen that snd was determined by combined snrr and sarr since the nh4 n removal efficiencies were able to reach above 95 in sdz1 sdz10 so each stage could be considered as sarr equal to sarr100 i e 60 mg n m2 d sarr100 refers to 100 nh4 n removal this represented that the snd of the pure mbbr in this experiment was no longer restricted on sarr but on the strength of denitrification fig 2f the conclusions of chu and wang 2011 33 showed that even though the average nh4 n removal of 90 was achieved the accumulation of nitrate indicates that snd was finally limited by the rate of denitrification in the mbbr and ultimately only gained the average tn removal of about 75 in our research the denitrification was intensely bounded due to the severe accumulation of no3 n and the snd thereby decreased under the environmental pressure of sdz consistent with sno3ar there was a linear connection between snd performance and sdz concentration r 2 0 881 p 0 001 in sdz0 the sarr snrr and snd were 56 774 0 252 mg n m2 d 49 277 0 233 mg n m2 d and 86 79 0 31 respectively after sdz exposure the biofilm sarr was promoted while snrr was strongly inhibited compared with sdz0 1 10 mg l sdz caused in stage by stage reduction of snd by 10 48 14 51 24 04 26 26 and 29 40 the results revealed that the inhibition of denitrification by sdz eventually brought about a significant p 0 05 suppression of the snd even though the sarr was maintained at a high level of each stage similar to snd total inorganic nitrogen tin removal was limited by denitrification and had a negative correlation with sdz r 2 0 919 p 0 001 fig 2g as tin accounting for 99 94 92 86 of tn during the experiment the variation trend of tn remained similar to tin therefore the tn removal performance fig 2h also had a negative linear relationship with the sdz r 2 0 892 p 0 001 briefly the tn removal rate of sdz0 stayed at 80 53 0 30 while that of sdz1 sdz10 were cut by 6 19 10 39 19 23 20 93 and 22 84 respectively the results showed that sdz significantly inhibited the tin and tn removal p 0 05 as it essentially weakened of denitrification performance 3 3 phosphorus removal performance the tp removal described a trend of decreasing after increasing under 0 10 mg l influent sdz fig 2i the tp removal rate only reached 45 95 0 49 in sdz0 and the effluent tp kept at 2 74 0 03 mg l the uncoupling of srt for ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and phosphorus accumulating organisms paos and the necessity of periodic aerobic anaerobic alternating microenvironment for paos made the pure mbbr system not easy to achieve a high tp removal rate by biological method 34 amazingly the tp removal performance could be significantly improved by 1 3 mg l sdz and reached the maximum of 59 72 0 18 in sdz3 as sdz rise to 5 7 mg l the tp removal was obviously decreased compared with that of sdz3 p 0 05 while the further elevation of sdz showed no difference for sdz5 and sdz7 p 0 05 but still higher than that of sdz0 p 0 05 in sdz10 the tp removal was further suppressed to 43 12 0 44 and lower than sdz0 liu et al 2016 35 analyzed the p removal performance of shewanella strain under antibiotics exposure and found a biphasic response to different concentrations of sulfonamides i e stimulation at low concentrations and inhibition at high concentrations and 1 mg l of smx and sdz enhanced the p removal rate by 13 4 and18 5 respectively previous studies have discovered that antibiotics at low concentrations activated transcription from quorum sensing promoters and acted as surrogate autoinducers 36 which might be one of the variables that low concentrations of antibiotics could fundamentally advance p removal 3 4 effect of sulfadiazine on biomass in the pure mbbr 3 4 1 characteristics and forms of agbs fig 3 presented the sem images on the morphology of agbs under different sdz concentrations both of surface and interior of ppc sponge carriers were taken and the initial carrier without biofilm was used as a control the control a showed no morphological difference between its surface and interior and the interlaced gel skeletons a 1 a 4 could be observed dense gel through holes a 2 located in the carrier skeletons without any exogenetic matter attached a 3 the changes of characteristics and forms of agbs in each stage were as following sdz0 in the central section of the carrier only a small amount of biomass was found b 4 b 5 apparently the biofilm mainly adhered to the surface layer of the carrier b 1 b 2 including mycelium 2 μm diameter oval shaped 0 5 μm 1 μm and rod shaped bacteria 2 μm length b 3 sdz1 a large amount of biomass was still attached to the surface layer of the carrier c 1 c 2 but agbs began to disintegrate in the stimulation of sdz c 3 in contrast the agbs in the internal central section of the carrier started to thicken compared to sdz0 c 4 c 5 indicating that the agbs could extend from the surface layer to the interior of the carrier and weaken the environmental stress of sdz through the physical barrier of the gel skeleton and through holes sdz3 the agbs of the carrier surface tended to thin out d 1 d 3 while the interior center continued to increase d 4 d 5 sdz5 the agbs of the carrier surface continued to be shed e 1 e 2 at the same time the agbs of the interior center began to decrease e 3 e 4 but the microbial morphology could still be clearly observed e 5 including rod shaped 1 1 5 μm 4 5 μm and oval shaped bacteria 0 5 μm 1 μm sdz7 the agbs of the carrier surface increased again f 1 f 2 laterally indicating that aerobic microorganisms tolerant to high sdz concentrations had emerged after prolonged environmental stress selection by the antibiotic on the contrary the agbs of the interior center seemed to appear a disintegration phenomenon f 3 f 5 sdz10 a large number of protozoa could be observed on the surface layer of the carrier and epistylis sp was predominated among them g 1 meanwhile the gel skeletons were covered with an abundance of rod shaped bacteria 0 5 μm 2 μm g 2 a quantity of oval shaped 0 5 μm 1 μm and rod shaped bacteria 0 5 μm 2 μm could be found in and around the gel orifices g 3 indicated that the porous structure of the ppc could provide shelter for tiny microorganisms in the biomass however the agbs in the central section was consistently destroyed and no microbial morphology was observed g 4 g 5 suggesting that high concentrations of sdz could diffuse into the interior of the ppc and had a lethal effect on anoxic or anaerobic microorganisms however due to the physical barrier between the gel skeletons and the superficially agbs the shearing effect of air and water currents inside the carrier was relatively small which in turn leaded to the fact that the dead biomass did not fall off in time and remained attached to the carrier skeletons 3 4 2 biomass change in reaction area agbs is the primary biomass in the pure mbbr system fig s2 when the biofilm matured it reached an equilibrium state between sloughing and updating 37 agbs will detach from the mature biofilm to form the mlss through four main ways carrier collision water shear natural shedding of biofilm and planktonic of protozoa 38 at the same time because the diffusion of dissolved oxygen in the biofilm will be restricted 39 eventually a gradual microstructure of flowing water layer attached water layer aerobic layer anoxic layer anaerobic layer and attached medium will be formed from outside the biofilm to inside the biofilm in order which provides the conditions for the occurrence of snd 40 based on the above analysis the changes of agbs and mlss in the ra were monitored for each stage fig 4a b in sdz0 the agbs of ppc and the mlss in the ra stable at 294 35 27 03 mg g carrier and 135 63 5 52 mg l respectively indicating the attached biofilm being the main form of microbial presented in the ra and the mlss mainly originated from the sloughing of agbs compared with sdz0 the agbs of ppc did not change significantly p 0 05 after the addition of 1 7 mg l sdz and the agbs of sdz1 sdz7 were 268 15 23 28 260 74 20 19 274 87 20 06 272 56 25 14 mg g carrier respectively but the agbs increased to 373 91 29 53 mg g carrier in sdz10 dramatically higher than that in sdz0 sdz7 p 0 05 according to the sem the surge of monitored data in sdz10 mainly attributed to the failure to shed the dead biomass inside the carrier unlike agbs the mlss in the ra increased significantly with the addition of 1 10 mg l sdz compared to the sdz0 and showed an overall increasing trend with the mlss in the ra from sdz1 to sdz10 of 166 25 5 21 273 50 5 02 262 88 5 20 288 33 4 97 and 311 67 7 79 mg l respectively p 0 05 this meant that sdz accelerated the sloughing and updating of agbs on the carrier outside which considerably shortened the srt of the aerobic layer and this may be one of the main reasons for the inhibition of cod removal after sdz exposure 24 3 5 microbial responses to the sdz pressures 3 5 1 evolution of microbial community 3 5 1 1 the distribution of community after metagenomic sequencing seven sample groups 21 samples yielded a total of 242 phyla the top 10 phyla were given in fig s3a including 37 515 species fig 5a showed the top 20 predominant species of biofilms sphaerotilus natans was the first principal species in the biofilms and it belongs to phylum proteobacteria sphaerotilus natans is a strictly aerobic bacterium that can degrade various organic carbon molecules such as alcohols organic acids sugars etc growing better on organic nitrogen sources than using inorganic ones and its genus sphaerotilus was reported to have aerobic denitrification function 41 more importantly sphaerotilus natans is a common filamentous bacterium in wastewater treatment systems 42 it is beneficial to form tightly fibrous structures 37 which are essential for biofilm stability therefore the relative abundance of sphaerotilus natans in sdz0 was as high as 5 16 fully 258 times higher than that of the initial activated sludge 0 02 in is but in sdz1 sdz10 the abundance of sphaerotilus natans was 2 96 6 04 4 97 5 42 and 3 87 respectively displayed a dynamic tendency such data suggested that sdz had a disturbing force on the reproduction of sphaerotilus natans which may be the main reason caused to speed the sloughing and updating of agbs and the second dominant species in the biofilms was acidobacteria bacterium an acidophilic bacterium from phylum acidobacteria the abundance of acidobacteria bacterium also showed a varying trend with the lowest of 2 21 in sdz1 and the highest of 3 73 in sdz3 the third abundant species was chloroflexi bacterium belonging to an ecologically and physiologically diverse group of bacteria the phylum chloroflexi noteworthily the chloroflexi is a vital participant in the elemental cycle of c n s etc which played a crucial fermentative role as well as contributed to sludge granulation 43 chloroflexi bacterium showed the highest relative abundance of 3 33 in sdz0 but represented different degrees of reduction under 1 10 mg l sdz exposure bacteroidetes bacterium from phylum bacteroidetes was the fourth dominant species with an increased abundance step by step from sdz3 and a maximum of 2 91 in sdz10 furthermore a typical nob nitrospira sp was the fifth dominant species and its abundance showed the highest of 2 42 and the lowest of 1 57 in sdz5 and sdz7 respectively furtherly the sequencing results revealed that the abundance of three bacteria from the order rhodocyclales belonging to phylum proteobacteria namely rhodocyclales bacterium rhodocyclaceae bacterium and rhodocyclaceae bacterium utpro2 strongly increased with the elevation of sdz concentration in sdz10 these three rhodocyclales bacteria were as high as 2 70 1 88 and 1 88 but they were only 0 19 0 76 and 0 13 in sdz0 respectively previous studies have shown that the rhodococcus rhodochrous 44 and rhodococcus equi 45 from phylum actinobacteria are able to effectively degrade smx therefore it could be speculated that rhodocyclales may also be capable to decompose sulfonamides notably verrucomicrobia bacterium could reach the highest abundance of 3 10 in sdz1 at the same time it was found that casimicrobium huifangae the first bacterial strain of the novel family casimicrobiaceae isolated from the wwtps in china 46 could also grow effectively in sdz1 with the highest abundance of 3 08 casimicrobium huifangae a novel cluster within phylum proteobacteria is ubiquitously distributed and metabolically versatile including carbon mineralization nitrate reduction and phosphorus accumulation ultimately the predominant species of biofilms in the pure mbbr remained steadfast under the environmental pressure of sdz but the abundance fluctuated drastically and the most species could not be restored to the initial level and the sample clustering tree showed that the six groups of biofilm samples could be classified into two broad categories where sdz0 and sdz1 had more similar biofilm community structure and were clustered into one category while sdz3 sdz5 sdz7 and sdz10 were clustered into another one category 3 5 1 2 the shift of community the differences in biofilm community structure were analyzed in depth on the species level for each stage firstly the result of anosim r 1 p 0 01 pointed out that the difference between sample groups was greater than within groups and the experimental groupings were statistically significant pcoa was then performed to assess the degree of microbial community distribution as depicted in fig 5b the is was negatively correlated with sdz0 in the second principal co ordinate their point distance was far away revealing that the microbial community structure in biofilm and activated sludge differed more at the species level sdz0 and sdz1 showed a positive correlation at the second principal co ordinate with a closer point distance the community structure differed less between the two on the species level indicating a minor effect of 1 mg l sdz on biofilm community structure in contrast sdz3 sdz5 sdz7 and sdz10 were negatively correlated with sdz0 in both the first and the second principal co ordinate with a far point distance which meant that 3 10 mg l sdz has a significant impact on the biofilm community structure meanwhile sdz3 sdz5 sdz7 and sdz10 all displayed positive correlations in the first and the second principal co ordinate and were in the same fourth quadrant with a closer point distance suggesting that the differences in biofilm community structure among these four were smaller to summarize the community difference analysis based on the bray curtis distance matrix was consistent with the results of the community hierarchical clustering these consequences revealed that 1 10 mg l sdz caused effective migration of biofilm communities on the species level 3 5 2 expression differences of microbial community seven sample groups 7 samples were obtained with a total of 179 phyla the top 10 phyla were given in fig s3b containing 1448 families from metatranscriptomic sequencing the families with the top 10 expression abundance included four bacteria five microfauna and one plant fig 5c among the bacteria heterotrophic non motile chitinophagaceae could utilize glucose lactose etc chitinophagaceae were expressed with the abundance of 9 18 in sdz0 but strongly suppressed under sdz exposure with decreased abundance of 4 66 in sdz1 then further dropped to 0 62 in sdz3 and only 0 58 in sdz10 a similar situation occurred in both norank o burkholderiales and norank o sphingobacteriales strictly aerobic chemoheterotrophic bacteria in which the expression abundance of the two was 9 09 and 3 01 in sdz0 subsequently the addition of sdz effectively limited their expression reduced to 2 63 and 0 21 in sdz10 respectively these results demonstrated that 1 10 mg l sdz could strongly inhibit the activity of aerobic heterotrophic microorganisms in the biofilms and cut down their expression abundance which could be the main reason why sdz could significantly block cod removal furthermore it was noteworthy that nitrosomonadaceae a typical class of aob could express well in the biofilms which proved from the transcriptomic perspective that nitrosomonadaceae was the dominator for ammonia oxidation function in the pure mbbr 47 although the expression abundance of nitrosomonadaceae e was differentially reduced by 1 10 mg l sdz but it was much less inhibited compared to heterotrophic bacteria for the eukaryotes in the biofilms poaceae norank o hymenostomatida tetrahymenidae parameciidae philodinidae and daphniidae all showed fluctuations of expression after 1 10 mg l sdz exposure and could not recover to the initial abundance at the end in summary 1 10 mg l sdz strongly influenced the activity of aerobic heterotrophic microorganisms which could be the essential reason for the reduction in cod removal the activity of autotrophic bacteria nitrosomonadaceae was less inhibited by sdz than heterotrophic bacteria 3 6 pathways of nitrogen metabolism in the pure mbbr 3 6 1 variations in nitrogen metabolism under sdz stress 3 6 1 1 analysis of nitrogen metabolic pathways the core nitrogen metabolic pathways that biofilm can perform generally involved six processes and covered mainly 17 functional genes fig 6a including nitrification amocab hao nxrab denitrification narghi napab nirk nirs norbc nosz assimilation narb nasab nira dissimilation narghi napab nirbd nrfah anammox hzs hdh and nitrogen fixation nifdkh the kegg pathway characterized anammox genes hzs hdh were absent in the seven sample groups while the remaining 15 genes were all annotated this confirmed that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd was the primary nitrogen metabolism pathway in pure mbbr biofilms under aerobic circumstances the addition of sdz did not change this metabolism of nitrogen removal 3 6 1 2 distribution of functional genes the abundance of nitrification and denitrification functional genes in each stage was focused on in fig 6b except for amocab the relative abundance of nitrification genes hao and nxrab showed an upward trend with the increase of sdz dosing the relative abundances of amocab hao and nxrab were 2 45 10 3 1 37 10 3 and 8 10 10 2 in sdz0 respectively while were 1 49 10 3 3 01 10 3 and 1 17 10 1 in sdz10 respectively except for norbc the relative abundance of the major denitrification genes groups including narghi napab nirk nirs and nosz rose with the increase of sdz the abundances of the four clusters narghi napab nirk nirs norbc and nosz were 1 28 10 1 4 49 10 2 4 65 10 2 and 3 10 10 2 in sdz0 respectively while were 1 76 10 1 5 10 10 2 4 11 10 2 and 4 16 10 2 in sdz10 respectively the abundance of nifdkh a nitrogen fixation gene showed a fluctuating trend with the increase of sdz between 6 57 10 3 and 1 26 10 2 in addition the gene group encoding dissimilation nirbd nrfah also showed an indefinite trend while the two genomes encoding assimilation narb nasab and nira decreased with sdz addition 3 6 1 3 association of snd with genes abundance the magnitude of the relative abundance ratio between total dngs and total ngs was reduced from 2 96 to 2 54 for each reaction stage of sdz0 sdz10 the relative abundance ratio could be interpreted as the abundance of total dngs for each 1 abundance of total ngs e g in sdz0 each 1 of nitrification genes corresponds to 2 96 of denitrification genes similar to the macroscopic expression snrr sarr of snd total dngs total ngs could be understood as the expression of snd at the gene level snrr sarr reflected the balance of reaction rate while total dngs total ngs reflected the balance of gene abundance in this research the consistency between total dngs total ngs and snrr sarr further indicated that the imbalance between denitrification and nitrification caused the reduction of snd this suggested that the interference of sdz with the functional genes ratio of denitrification to nitrification is the main mechanism of its suppressive effect on the snd and thus decreased the tn removal 3 6 2 expression differences of key genes the expression abundance of nitrogen metabolism functional genes was calculated using the sum of gene abundance corresponding to the ec enzyme commission number in the kegg functional annotation and the results were given in fig 6c the data showed that the narb nasab and nira are related to assimilation and the napab in denitrification had no expression in the is and each biofilms sample the nitrogen fixation genes nifdkh and nirbd in dissimilation were expressed only in sdz3 sdz5 and sdz7 for amocab and hao in nitrification the expression abundance of the two was 0 109 and 0 100 in sdz0 respectively while both reached the highest of 0 129 and 0 133 in sdz1 respectively which was consistent with the biofilm holding the highest nh4 n removal efficiency in sdz1 from sdz3 to sdz10 the expression of the two fluctuated and reached the lowest level of 0 056 and 0 051 in sdz5 respectively and restored to near the initial level with the further increase of sdz concentration in sdz10 these results indicated that 1 mg l sdz could dramatically stimulate the expression of ammonia oxidation genes amocab and hao the sdz was the principal external reason for the promotion of nh4 n removal since nitrite oxidoreductase is bidirectional the expression products of the nitrification gene nxrab and the denitrification gene narghi were both nitrite oxidoreductase with ec of 1 7 5 1 and 1 7 99 4 respectively when calculating the expression abundance using the sum of gene abundance corresponding to the ec number it was impossible to distinguish the expression abundance of the two genes thus ec numbering was used here to discuss the transcriptome abundance for the enzyme with ec of 1 7 5 1 its transcriptome abundance in sdz0 sdz10 was 0 569 1 806 1 110 1 129 0 788 and 0 795 respectively indicating that 1 10 mg l of sdz did not limit its transcription in contrast for the enzyme with ec of 1 7 99 4 its transcription was inhibited by high concentrations of sdz 7 10 mg l due to the significantly curbed denitrification it could be speculated that the sdz strongly hindered the enzyme s activity with ec of 1 7 5 1 and 1 7 99 4 for the nirk nirs and nosz genes in denitrification the expression abundance of the two gene sets was not constricted by 1 10 mg l sdz on the contrary the expression of norbc genes in denitrification was strongly inhibited indicating that sdz negatively affects the reduction of nitric oxide no 3 7 changes of sulfonamide resistance genes in general widespread resistance to sulfadiazine in pathogenic bacteria is associated with antibiotic resistance genes args corresponding to sulfonamide i e sul1 sul2 sul3 and sul4 among them sul1 is linked to other resistance genes of class 1 integrons sul2 is often found on small plasmids sul3 is similar to sul1 and sul2 and sul4 is a newly identified resistance gene 48 the relative abundance of these four resistance genes in each stage was showed in fig 7 compared to the initial sludge the abundance of sul1 4 genes in the biofilm had reduced in sdz0 the high abundance of sul1 4 in the is may be related to the enrichment of antibiotics in the wastewater treatment plant 49 and the feed water did not contain antibiotics in sdz0 so the abundance of sul1 4 in the biofilm was decreased but compared with sdz0 the experiment revealed that sulfadiazine exposure significantly increased the abundance of sul1 3 p 0 05 the relative abundance of the three was elevated by 7 9 2 5 and 4 6 fold in sdz10 respectively the abundance of sul1 reached a maximum of 0 192 in sdz1 and with the increase of sdz concentration its abundance reduced to 0 155 in sdz10 but still significantly higher than 0 019 in sdz0 p 0 05 in contrast the abundance of sul2 was 0 098 in sdz1 followed by a maximum of 0 112 in sdz7 and 0 097 in sdz10 for sul3 there was a positive linear relationship between its abundance and sdz concentration r 2 0 972 p 0 001 and it reached the maximum abundance of 0 107 in sdz10 as for sul4 even though its abundance was higher than that of sul1 3 in all samples but was not significantly different between is and sdz0 to sdz3 p 0 05 meanwhile a decrease of sul4 was observed in sdz5 to sdz10 the experiment suggested that sul1 3 were the main sulfonamide args propagated in the biofilm and efficiently enriched after pure mbbr system was exposed to sulfadiazine guo et al 2020 50 found the absolute abundance of most args in biofilms was significantly higher than that in sediment and water indicating that biofilms on plastic carriers could act as a reservoir for args and promote microbial tolerance to antibiotics in conclusion the abundance up regulation of sul1 3 in the microbial community was an important mechanism for the biofilms of pure mbbr could adapt to the high concentration of sdz 4 conclusions the performance of pollutant removal and microbial responses under successional sulfadiazine exposure in a pure moving bed biofilm reactor was investigated although sdz inhibited cod removal the average sdz removal rate of pure mbbr was 98 80 1 54 at all conditions the low concentration of sdz dramatically enhanced nh4 n and p removal but strongly interfered with denitrification sdz exposure promoted the migration of agbs from surface to interior of the sponge carrier as well as the sloughing and updating of agbs snd was proven as the primary nitrogen metabolism pathway in biofilm regardless of sdz concentration the negative effect of sdz on the gene ratio of denitrification to nitrification was the main mechanism that coerced the snd rate and tn removal sdz strongly inhibited the expression abundance of aerobic heterotrophic microorganisms leading to a reduction in cod removal the promoted amocab and hao expression enhanced ammonia removal while inhibited norbc expression led to an impeded nitrate reduction meanwhile sdz effectively enriched sulfonamide args in biofilm the relative abundance of sul1 sul2 and sul3 eventually increased by 7 9 2 5 and 4 6 fold respectively to summarize the pure mbbr could successfully treat sdz wastewater below 3 mg l with a high cod and tn removal rate proven to be a feasible

12687,pure moving bed biofilm reactor pure mbbr with biofilm as biomass core is a viable process for treating antibiotics the influences of sulfadiazine sdz on pure mbbr have yet to be investigated in depth this study examined the responses of biofilm exposure to different doses of sdz 0 1 3 5 7 and 10 mg l in the pure mbbr under continuous flow conditions pure mbbr held a high sdz removal rate but sdz significantly inhibited cod and tn removal however 1 3 mg l sdz could enhance nh4 n and tp removal and these observations were confirmed by biomass analysis and multi omics sequencing data sdz accelerated the sloughing and renewal of aerobic biofilm thus shortening the solids residence time the biofilm communities were strongly shifted by sdz and the activity of autotrophs was less inhibited by sdz than that of heterotrophs meanwhile sdz did not alter the biofilm s primary nitrogen metabolism mechanism while disrupting the ratio of denitrification genes to nitrification genes sdz effectively promoted the gene expression of amocab and hao but restrained norbc the increased abundance of resistance genes sul1 3 was a major reason for the biofilm could adapt to the high concentration of sdz overall the pure mbbr could operate well when sdz was below 3 mg l this study provided new insight into antibiotic wastewater treatment through pure mbbr graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pure mbbr sulfadiazine nitrogen removal biofilm microbial community multi omics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since the 21st century contaminants of emerging concern cecs in particular pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps have gained increasing concerns due to their potential impacts on human health 1 2 among them sulfadiazine sdz is a broad spectrum bacteriostatic antibiotic that has found wide applications in aquaculture veterinary and human medication 3 due to the poor absorbability and degradability of sdz in the guts of humans and animals a considerable proportion was directly discharged into the ecosystem unchanged through feces and urine 4 meanwhile sdz is stable in the typical aqueous environment and intractable for complete removal by traditional wastewater treatment plants wwtps 5 6 therefore sdz is ubiquitous in wastewater and aquatic ecosystems 7 8 recently moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr has attracted attention as an option to improve the removal of cecs 9 10 in mbbr biomass grows on suspended plastic or sponge carriers with a dramatic extension of solids residence time srt compared to activated sludge systems falas et al 2012 11 reported that biofilm carriers demonstrated considerably higher removal rates per unit biomass of several pharmaceuticals compared to the sludges i e attached growth biomass agbs for the carriers was better than mixed liquor suspended solids mlss for the sludges abtahi et al 2018 12 examined the contribution of the biofilm agbs and suspended biomass mlss in micropollutants removal and the former showed approximately two times the diclofenac reduction rate than mlss which is due to that the diverse microbial community would possibly enable the agbs to outperform the mlss for removal of bio refractory cecs 13 thus for the pure mbbr technology with agbs as biomass core and without mlss return system biofilm has higher organic matter and nitrogen removal efficiency than suspended biomass and is viable in the removal of pharmaceuticals including antibiotics 13 14 as the majority of studies have focused on hybrid biofilm and activated sludge systems targeting pharmaceuticals 9 15 little is known about pure mbbr especially with no detailed information for microbial responses and pollutant removal performance of pure mbrr to the successional exposure of sdz in this study we investigated the elimination of sdz in a single pure mbbr configuration and the influences of sdz dose variation on the operational performance of biofilm for artificial wastewater treatment the main objectives of our investigation were i to assess and compare the effects of various sdz concentrations on the treatment performance of pure mbbr process ii to evaluate the influences of biofilm continuous exposure to different sdz loading on its biomass and morphological characteristics and iii to eventually investigate the association between reactor performance pollutants removal and biomass change microbial community structure abundance and nitrogen metabolism function pathways gene expression 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge inoculation and experiment strategy the initial sludge is used for bioreactor activation was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank at futian wwtp shenzhen china with 10 63 0 38 g l mlss after acclimatization the is was diluted to 3 0 g l mlss and then seeded into the mbbr reactor the continuous flow experiment was lasted 180 days and the whole process was divided into six stages according to different influent concentrations of sdz and the detailed dosing strategies were shown in table 1 while the trace nutrients used in the synthetic wastewater were listed in supplementary materials sm an investigation showed that the concentration of antibiotics in pharmaceutical wastewater could reach 5 06 mg l 16 and in a reported study using biological process the dosage of sulfonamide antibiotics had been considered up to 25 mg l 17 therefore this research selected an intermediate value of 10 mg l as the maximum tested concentration of sdz in stage sdz0 days 1 30 no sdz was added in stage sdz1 days 30 60 the dosage of sdz added into the pure mbbr was 1 mg l similarly the concentrations of sdz were 3 mg l 5 mg l 7 mg l and 10 mg l in stage sdz3 days 60 90 stage sdz5 days 90 120 stage sdz7 days 120 150 and stage sdz10 days 150 180 respectively 2 2 construction and operation conditions of pure mbbr one single laboratory scale pure mbbr system china pat no cn216918752u filled with porous polymer carriers ppc was used in this study the shape and properties of ppc were detailed in table s1 the configuration of mbbr fig 1 mainly included a cylindrical reaction area ra d 40 cm h 60 cm with working volume of 60 l and a conical sedimentation area sa d 40 cm h 34 cm of 14 l a support plate with evenly distributed 20 mm pores was positioned at the junction of ra and sa the detailed strategies of bioreactor start up were described in sm in which the emergence and diversification of protozoa fig s1 and the stability of effluent quality indicated the successful domestication of mbbr at the end of the start up period the pure mbbr could effectively remove about 91 0 of chemical oxygen demand cod 84 8 of ammonia nitrogen 79 4 of total nitrogen and 44 6 of total phosphorous during the experimental period the system did not hold and return activated sludge in the reaction area and the attached biofilms were the main form of the microorganisms the operating conditions of each stage were entirely consistent as listing in table 1 2 3 effluent sampling and chemical analysis after each stage had stabilized influent and effluent water samples were taken consecutively for the final five days to characterize the treatment performance of the pure mbbr all the effluent samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm pore size triplicate analyses were conducted to ensure accuracy measurements for the concentrations of cod total phosphorous tp and nitrogen in forms of ammonium nh4 n nitrite no2 n nitrate no3 n and total nitrogen tn were performed according to standard methods for the analysis of water and wastewater 18 besides the ph temperature and do were monitored using wtw ph 3210 and oxi3210 probes wtw company germany for sdz measurement solid phase extraction spe and high performance liquid chromatography hplc were served in the quantitative analysis the detailed procedures were described in sm 2 4 biomass analysis the biomass was measured on the last day of each stage the mlss was measured by standard methods 18 the agbs was determined by the gravimetric method 9 the morphological structure of the biocarriers with agbs was observed using sem as for the fixation and dehydration process the initial carrier without microorganisms and all sdz stage carriers were first fixed using glutaraldehyde 5 at 4 c for about 12 h next all samples were dehydrated by graded series of ethanol of different concentrations 30 50 70 80 95 and 100 for 15 min at each step and then dried 12 h by freeze dryers scientz 18 n china finally the prepared samples were coated with gold in ion sputter for 4 5 min and analyzed by sem tescan mira4 czech 2 5 sequencing of dna and rna metagenomic sequencing was performed to track the changes in community structure and nitrogen metabolism genes in biofilms metatranscriptomic sequencing was also used in this study given the limitations of dna sequencing 19 and the potentially significant impact of sdz on the expression of active microorganisms and genes 20 approximately 100 biocarriers were taken randomly on the last day of each stage for microbial community analysis and immediately after biocarrier collection equal amounts of clean carriers without biofilm are replenished to the mbbr to ensure that all reaction stages hold the same filling ratio the sample collection of biomass refers to the study previously published by zhu et al 2022 21 in the end a total of seven groups of biomass including the is were collected the sequencing was using an illumina novaseq 6000 platform and all raw reads were processed for quality control genome assembly and gene prediction finally non redundant gene catalog was constructed for species taxonomy ncbi nr database functional annotation kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database antibiotic resistance genes annotation card database and abundance calculation meanwhile in order to eliminate errors in comparing the relative abundance of genes between samples which with varies in absolute content of total microorganisms 22 and for better dissect the intrinsic link between functional genes of nitrogen metabolism pathway ko00910 nitrogen metabolism https www genome jp pathway and snd performance in biofilms then the relative abundance ratio between total denitrification genes total dngs and total nitrification genes total ngs was calculated for each stage 1 total dngs total ngs narghi napab nirk nirs norbc nosz sum of the abundance nxrab amocab hao sum of the abundance in addition more details of the sequencing process and bioinformatics analysis could be obtained from the previous reports 19 21 2 6 calculations and statistical analysis the ammonia oxidation performance was expressed as the surface area nh4 n removal rate sarr mg n m2 d 23 2 sarr q nh 4 n inf nh 4 n eff v w a s f where q is the flow rate of feed 120 l day nh 4 n inf is ammonia concentrations in the influent mg l nh 4 n eff is ammonia concentration in the effluent mg l v w is the working volume of the reactor 0 06 m3 a s is biocarrier specific surface area 4000 m2 m3 and f is the filling ratio of biocarrier 25 similarly denitrification performance the accumulation of no2 n no3 n and no x n were calculated as the surface area nox n removal rate snrr mg n m2 d the accumulation rate of no2 n sno2ar mg n m2 d no3 n sno3ar mg n m2 d and no x n snar mg n m2 d respectively the computational method is consistent with eq 1 and therefore not listed in detail here based on these the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd rate was calculated using eq 3 3 snd snrr sarr 100 for the results all physicochemical data were presented in mean sd ibm spss software was used for linear regression analysis and difference analysis by one way anova among the six treatments analysis of similarities anosim and principal co ordinates analysis pcoa were performed to detect the differences in microbial community structure in different sample groups diagrams were visualized by origin pro and graphpad prism a significance level of 95 p 0 05 was selected in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 organic pollutants removal performance the results showed a significant reduction in cod removal efficiencies of sdz1 sdz3 sdz5 sdz7 and sdz10 compared with sdz0 p 0 05 and a negative linear correlation between cod removal and sdz concentration r 2 0 692 p 0 001 fig 2a in sdz0 the cod removal rate was stable at 93 21 0 87 and the corresponding effluent cod was 27 15 3 49 mg l which indicated the pure mbbr could perform effectively for cod treatment subsequently the sdz caused approximately 15 decreasing in cod removal stage by stage and the effluent cod raise to 86 42 0 64 mg l in sdz10 illustrating an effective restrain to the cod removal of pure mbbr by sdz du et al 2019 24 found an increased tendency of sludge bulking and more filamentous bacteria under long term exposure to 5 mg l tetracycline and 1 mg l sulfamethoxazole smx which in turn led to mlss loss and suppressed cod removal in an anoxic aerobic system surprisingly wan et al 2018 25 tracked that sdz could cause an adverse effect for cod removal of aerobic granular sludge even at low pressure 0 10 100 and 1000 μg l and the inhibition effect was related to the concentration of sdz implying that heterotrophic microorganisms may be more sensitive to sdz exposure in addition details of the experimental conditions and parameters in comparison with similar research were listed in table 2 the pure mbbr held a high antibiotic removal rate under 1 10 mg l sdz fig 2b in sdz1 the removal rate of sdz was 95 88 0 91 and the effluent sdz was 0 044 0 009 mg l when the sdz dose was increased to 3 mg l about 99 19 0 26 sdz could be removed in the remaining stages sdz5 sdz10 the average removal performance and effluent concentration of sdz were 99 64 and 0 025 mg l respectively illustrating a strong ability of the pure mbbr to remove sdz even though in high influent sdz concentration torresi et al 2017 26 used the post denitrifying mbbr to treat micropollutants and 35 removal of smx was observed gallardo altamirano et al 2021 27 investigated the performance of a2o ifas system treating municipal wastewater and the results showed that the average removal rate value for smx was 63 in contrast the pure mbbr maintained a removal rate of 95 for all sdz doses from 1 to 10 mg l in this study which may be related to the stronger biotransformation ability of biofilms than suspended biomass for recalcitrant organic pollutants 12 on the other hand the ppc sponge could increase the porosity and adsorbable surface area of the biofilms 28 thus improving the diffusion and adsorption of sdz in the biofilms 3 2 nitrogen removal performance 3 2 1 evaluation of nitrification and denitrification 3 2 1 1 the nitrification performance of pure mbbr the nh4 n removal displayed a rising first and then declining trend fig 2c compared with sdz0 each sdz dosage remarkably enhanced the nh4 n treatment efficiencies p 0 05 but the rise of sdz concentration led to a reduction trend in the nh4 n removal rate in sdz0 the pure mbbr kept 94 67 0 22 removal rate for nh4 n and the effluent nh4 n was 1 60 0 07 mg l demonstrating a highly efficient nitrification process in pure mbbr system amazingly in sdz1 the nh4 n removal rate climbed to the maximum of 99 38 0 32 and the effluent nh4 n arrived the minimum of only 0 19 0 10 mg l with a great improvement in nitrification compared to sdz1 the nh4 n removal rate declined significantly p 0 05 when the influent sdz gradually ascended to 3 10 mg l the descending trend of nh4 n removal rate slowed down from stage sdz5 sdz10 and there was no statistical difference in nitrification between sdz5 and sdz7 sdz7 and sdz10 p 0 05 finally the nh4 n removal rate of sdz10 was 97 22 0 20 it was still significantly higher than the sdz0 existing research showed that 1000 μg l sdz did not affect the nitrification performance of aerobic granular sludge 25 and unlike zhang et al 2016 29 who indicated that 10 mg l smx dramatically reduced the nh4 n removal in the activated sludge system p 0 05 our results found that the 1 3 mg l of sdz could well promote the nitrification of the pure mbbr and 10 mg l sdz still enhanced the ammonia oxidation 3 2 1 2 the no2 n accumulation performance of pure mbbr the response of sno2ar fig 2d was roughly the same as that of nh4 n removal efficiency with an overall trend of increase followed by a decrease compared with the sdz0 the sno2ar of sdz1 to sdz10 showed a remarkable elevation p 0 05 after the influx of sdz nevertheless the increment role of sno2ar by 3 10 mg l sdz on the pure mbbr was significantly diminished compared with 1 mg l sdz p 0 05 in sdz0 the sno2ar stabilized at 0 028 0 007 mg n m2 d and the effluent no2 n concentration retained at 0 082 0 003 mg l which was far below 0 1 mg l and the accumulation of no2 n was extremely low however in sdz1 the effluent no2 n concentration rose to 0 803 0 023 mg l the sno2ar was 54 14 times higher than that in the sdz0 and reached the maximum of 1 516 0 038 mg n m2 d among the six stages the accumulation of no2 n then gradually dropped from stage sdz3 to sdz7 while no significant difference was observed in sno2ar between sdz3 and sdz5 p 0 05 the mean values of sno2ar in sdz3 sdz7 were 14 54 14 46 and 11 75 times of sdz0 respectively and the overall effluent no2 n in these three stages was 0 239 0 009 mg l however in sdz10 the effluent no2 n accumulation climbed again and increased to 0 593 0 002 mg l and the sno2ar rose to 1 086 0 010 mg n m2 d which was 38 79 times of sdz0 early study has observed that the 6 10 mg l pharmaceuticals including smx could significantly inhibit bacterial nitrite oxidation 30 therefore the accumulation of no2 n may be attributed to the promotion of nh4 n removal by sdz leading to an increase in no2 n production while the 10 mg l sdz had an inhibitory effect on nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 3 2 1 3 the denitrification performance of pure mbbr the results suggested that sno3ar fig 2e was on a steady increase with the rise of sdz pressure compared to sno2ar in comparison to sdz0 the sno3ar of sdz1 to sdz10 presented a remarkable boost p 0 05 after sdz exposure and a significant positive linear relationship existed between sno3ar and influent sdz concentration r 2 0 872 p 0 001 in sdz0 the effluent no3 n maintained at 4 277 0 103 mg l and the sno3ar was 7 470 0 190 mg n m2 d in sdz1 sdz10 the no3 n concentrations in the effluent rose to 6 931 0 104 8 624 0 066 11 327 0 055 12 025 0 045 and 12 588 0 130 mg l respectively while the matching sno3ar were 12 596 0 202 15 952 0 132 21 428 0 121 22 747 0 090 and 23 811 0 234 mg n m2 d which were 1 69 2 14 2 87 3 05 and 3 19 times of that in sdz0 respectively the striking increase in sno3ar illustrated that sdz strongly interfered with the denitrification process of the biofilm and had a notable acceleration on the no3 n accumulation some studies have reported on the inhibition of denitrification by antibiotics gui and co workers 31 presented that 20 μg l smx severely repressed no3 n reduction denitrifying genes expression electron transport activity and the growth of denitrifier strain li et al 2021 32 showed that 10 100 mg l antibiotics including smx decreased no3 n removal efficiencies of the egsb reactor by 7 98 26 80 accompanied by the significant decrease in the expressed narg nirs and nosz genes with a higher antibiotic concentration showing stronger inhibitory effect therefore it could also be speculated that sdz had a compulsive suppression effect on the metabolic activity and gene expression of biofilm denitrifying bacteria dnb 3 2 2 snd performance and total nitrogen removal from the formula 3 it could be seen that snd was determined by combined snrr and sarr since the nh4 n removal efficiencies were able to reach above 95 in sdz1 sdz10 so each stage could be considered as sarr equal to sarr100 i e 60 mg n m2 d sarr100 refers to 100 nh4 n removal this represented that the snd of the pure mbbr in this experiment was no longer restricted on sarr but on the strength of denitrification fig 2f the conclusions of chu and wang 2011 33 showed that even though the average nh4 n removal of 90 was achieved the accumulation of nitrate indicates that snd was finally limited by the rate of denitrification in the mbbr and ultimately only gained the average tn removal of about 75 in our research the denitrification was intensely bounded due to the severe accumulation of no3 n and the snd thereby decreased under the environmental pressure of sdz consistent with sno3ar there was a linear connection between snd performance and sdz concentration r 2 0 881 p 0 001 in sdz0 the sarr snrr and snd were 56 774 0 252 mg n m2 d 49 277 0 233 mg n m2 d and 86 79 0 31 respectively after sdz exposure the biofilm sarr was promoted while snrr was strongly inhibited compared with sdz0 1 10 mg l sdz caused in stage by stage reduction of snd by 10 48 14 51 24 04 26 26 and 29 40 the results revealed that the inhibition of denitrification by sdz eventually brought about a significant p 0 05 suppression of the snd even though the sarr was maintained at a high level of each stage similar to snd total inorganic nitrogen tin removal was limited by denitrification and had a negative correlation with sdz r 2 0 919 p 0 001 fig 2g as tin accounting for 99 94 92 86 of tn during the experiment the variation trend of tn remained similar to tin therefore the tn removal performance fig 2h also had a negative linear relationship with the sdz r 2 0 892 p 0 001 briefly the tn removal rate of sdz0 stayed at 80 53 0 30 while that of sdz1 sdz10 were cut by 6 19 10 39 19 23 20 93 and 22 84 respectively the results showed that sdz significantly inhibited the tin and tn removal p 0 05 as it essentially weakened of denitrification performance 3 3 phosphorus removal performance the tp removal described a trend of decreasing after increasing under 0 10 mg l influent sdz fig 2i the tp removal rate only reached 45 95 0 49 in sdz0 and the effluent tp kept at 2 74 0 03 mg l the uncoupling of srt for ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and phosphorus accumulating organisms paos and the necessity of periodic aerobic anaerobic alternating microenvironment for paos made the pure mbbr system not easy to achieve a high tp removal rate by biological method 34 amazingly the tp removal performance could be significantly improved by 1 3 mg l sdz and reached the maximum of 59 72 0 18 in sdz3 as sdz rise to 5 7 mg l the tp removal was obviously decreased compared with that of sdz3 p 0 05 while the further elevation of sdz showed no difference for sdz5 and sdz7 p 0 05 but still higher than that of sdz0 p 0 05 in sdz10 the tp removal was further suppressed to 43 12 0 44 and lower than sdz0 liu et al 2016 35 analyzed the p removal performance of shewanella strain under antibiotics exposure and found a biphasic response to different concentrations of sulfonamides i e stimulation at low concentrations and inhibition at high concentrations and 1 mg l of smx and sdz enhanced the p removal rate by 13 4 and18 5 respectively previous studies have discovered that antibiotics at low concentrations activated transcription from quorum sensing promoters and acted as surrogate autoinducers 36 which might be one of the variables that low concentrations of antibiotics could fundamentally advance p removal 3 4 effect of sulfadiazine on biomass in the pure mbbr 3 4 1 characteristics and forms of agbs fig 3 presented the sem images on the morphology of agbs under different sdz concentrations both of surface and interior of ppc sponge carriers were taken and the initial carrier without biofilm was used as a control the control a showed no morphological difference between its surface and interior and the interlaced gel skeletons a 1 a 4 could be observed dense gel through holes a 2 located in the carrier skeletons without any exogenetic matter attached a 3 the changes of characteristics and forms of agbs in each stage were as following sdz0 in the central section of the carrier only a small amount of biomass was found b 4 b 5 apparently the biofilm mainly adhered to the surface layer of the carrier b 1 b 2 including mycelium 2 μm diameter oval shaped 0 5 μm 1 μm and rod shaped bacteria 2 μm length b 3 sdz1 a large amount of biomass was still attached to the surface layer of the carrier c 1 c 2 but agbs began to disintegrate in the stimulation of sdz c 3 in contrast the agbs in the internal central section of the carrier started to thicken compared to sdz0 c 4 c 5 indicating that the agbs could extend from the surface layer to the interior of the carrier and weaken the environmental stress of sdz through the physical barrier of the gel skeleton and through holes sdz3 the agbs of the carrier surface tended to thin out d 1 d 3 while the interior center continued to increase d 4 d 5 sdz5 the agbs of the carrier surface continued to be shed e 1 e 2 at the same time the agbs of the interior center began to decrease e 3 e 4 but the microbial morphology could still be clearly observed e 5 including rod shaped 1 1 5 μm 4 5 μm and oval shaped bacteria 0 5 μm 1 μm sdz7 the agbs of the carrier surface increased again f 1 f 2 laterally indicating that aerobic microorganisms tolerant to high sdz concentrations had emerged after prolonged environmental stress selection by the antibiotic on the contrary the agbs of the interior center seemed to appear a disintegration phenomenon f 3 f 5 sdz10 a large number of protozoa could be observed on the surface layer of the carrier and epistylis sp was predominated among them g 1 meanwhile the gel skeletons were covered with an abundance of rod shaped bacteria 0 5 μm 2 μm g 2 a quantity of oval shaped 0 5 μm 1 μm and rod shaped bacteria 0 5 μm 2 μm could be found in and around the gel orifices g 3 indicated that the porous structure of the ppc could provide shelter for tiny microorganisms in the biomass however the agbs in the central section was consistently destroyed and no microbial morphology was observed g 4 g 5 suggesting that high concentrations of sdz could diffuse into the interior of the ppc and had a lethal effect on anoxic or anaerobic microorganisms however due to the physical barrier between the gel skeletons and the superficially agbs the shearing effect of air and water currents inside the carrier was relatively small which in turn leaded to the fact that the dead biomass did not fall off in time and remained attached to the carrier skeletons 3 4 2 biomass change in reaction area agbs is the primary biomass in the pure mbbr system fig s2 when the biofilm matured it reached an equilibrium state between sloughing and updating 37 agbs will detach from the mature biofilm to form the mlss through four main ways carrier collision water shear natural shedding of biofilm and planktonic of protozoa 38 at the same time because the diffusion of dissolved oxygen in the biofilm will be restricted 39 eventually a gradual microstructure of flowing water layer attached water layer aerobic layer anoxic layer anaerobic layer and attached medium will be formed from outside the biofilm to inside the biofilm in order which provides the conditions for the occurrence of snd 40 based on the above analysis the changes of agbs and mlss in the ra were monitored for each stage fig 4a b in sdz0 the agbs of ppc and the mlss in the ra stable at 294 35 27 03 mg g carrier and 135 63 5 52 mg l respectively indicating the attached biofilm being the main form of microbial presented in the ra and the mlss mainly originated from the sloughing of agbs compared with sdz0 the agbs of ppc did not change significantly p 0 05 after the addition of 1 7 mg l sdz and the agbs of sdz1 sdz7 were 268 15 23 28 260 74 20 19 274 87 20 06 272 56 25 14 mg g carrier respectively but the agbs increased to 373 91 29 53 mg g carrier in sdz10 dramatically higher than that in sdz0 sdz7 p 0 05 according to the sem the surge of monitored data in sdz10 mainly attributed to the failure to shed the dead biomass inside the carrier unlike agbs the mlss in the ra increased significantly with the addition of 1 10 mg l sdz compared to the sdz0 and showed an overall increasing trend with the mlss in the ra from sdz1 to sdz10 of 166 25 5 21 273 50 5 02 262 88 5 20 288 33 4 97 and 311 67 7 79 mg l respectively p 0 05 this meant that sdz accelerated the sloughing and updating of agbs on the carrier outside which considerably shortened the srt of the aerobic layer and this may be one of the main reasons for the inhibition of cod removal after sdz exposure 24 3 5 microbial responses to the sdz pressures 3 5 1 evolution of microbial community 3 5 1 1 the distribution of community after metagenomic sequencing seven sample groups 21 samples yielded a total of 242 phyla the top 10 phyla were given in fig s3a including 37 515 species fig 5a showed the top 20 predominant species of biofilms sphaerotilus natans was the first principal species in the biofilms and it belongs to phylum proteobacteria sphaerotilus natans is a strictly aerobic bacterium that can degrade various organic carbon molecules such as alcohols organic acids sugars etc growing better on organic nitrogen sources than using inorganic ones and its genus sphaerotilus was reported to have aerobic denitrification function 41 more importantly sphaerotilus natans is a common filamentous bacterium in wastewater treatment systems 42 it is beneficial to form tightly fibrous structures 37 which are essential for biofilm stability therefore the relative abundance of sphaerotilus natans in sdz0 was as high as 5 16 fully 258 times higher than that of the initial activated sludge 0 02 in is but in sdz1 sdz10 the abundance of sphaerotilus natans was 2 96 6 04 4 97 5 42 and 3 87 respectively displayed a dynamic tendency such data suggested that sdz had a disturbing force on the reproduction of sphaerotilus natans which may be the main reason caused to speed the sloughing and updating of agbs and the second dominant species in the biofilms was acidobacteria bacterium an acidophilic bacterium from phylum acidobacteria the abundance of acidobacteria bacterium also showed a varying trend with the lowest of 2 21 in sdz1 and the highest of 3 73 in sdz3 the third abundant species was chloroflexi bacterium belonging to an ecologically and physiologically diverse group of bacteria the phylum chloroflexi noteworthily the chloroflexi is a vital participant in the elemental cycle of c n s etc which played a crucial fermentative role as well as contributed to sludge granulation 43 chloroflexi bacterium showed the highest relative abundance of 3 33 in sdz0 but represented different degrees of reduction under 1 10 mg l sdz exposure bacteroidetes bacterium from phylum bacteroidetes was the fourth dominant species with an increased abundance step by step from sdz3 and a maximum of 2 91 in sdz10 furthermore a typical nob nitrospira sp was the fifth dominant species and its abundance showed the highest of 2 42 and the lowest of 1 57 in sdz5 and sdz7 respectively furtherly the sequencing results revealed that the abundance of three bacteria from the order rhodocyclales belonging to phylum proteobacteria namely rhodocyclales bacterium rhodocyclaceae bacterium and rhodocyclaceae bacterium utpro2 strongly increased with the elevation of sdz concentration in sdz10 these three rhodocyclales bacteria were as high as 2 70 1 88 and 1 88 but they were only 0 19 0 76 and 0 13 in sdz0 respectively previous studies have shown that the rhodococcus rhodochrous 44 and rhodococcus equi 45 from phylum actinobacteria are able to effectively degrade smx therefore it could be speculated that rhodocyclales may also be capable to decompose sulfonamides notably verrucomicrobia bacterium could reach the highest abundance of 3 10 in sdz1 at the same time it was found that casimicrobium huifangae the first bacterial strain of the novel family casimicrobiaceae isolated from the wwtps in china 46 could also grow effectively in sdz1 with the highest abundance of 3 08 casimicrobium huifangae a novel cluster within phylum proteobacteria is ubiquitously distributed and metabolically versatile including carbon mineralization nitrate reduction and phosphorus accumulation ultimately the predominant species of biofilms in the pure mbbr remained steadfast under the environmental pressure of sdz but the abundance fluctuated drastically and the most species could not be restored to the initial level and the sample clustering tree showed that the six groups of biofilm samples could be classified into two broad categories where sdz0 and sdz1 had more similar biofilm community structure and were clustered into one category while sdz3 sdz5 sdz7 and sdz10 were clustered into another one category 3 5 1 2 the shift of community the differences in biofilm community structure were analyzed in depth on the species level for each stage firstly the result of anosim r 1 p 0 01 pointed out that the difference between sample groups was greater than within groups and the experimental groupings were statistically significant pcoa was then performed to assess the degree of microbial community distribution as depicted in fig 5b the is was negatively correlated with sdz0 in the second principal co ordinate their point distance was far away revealing that the microbial community structure in biofilm and activated sludge differed more at the species level sdz0 and sdz1 showed a positive correlation at the second principal co ordinate with a closer point distance the community structure differed less between the two on the species level indicating a minor effect of 1 mg l sdz on biofilm community structure in contrast sdz3 sdz5 sdz7 and sdz10 were negatively correlated with sdz0 in both the first and the second principal co ordinate with a far point distance which meant that 3 10 mg l sdz has a significant impact on the biofilm community structure meanwhile sdz3 sdz5 sdz7 and sdz10 all displayed positive correlations in the first and the second principal co ordinate and were in the same fourth quadrant with a closer point distance suggesting that the differences in biofilm community structure among these four were smaller to summarize the community difference analysis based on the bray curtis distance matrix was consistent with the results of the community hierarchical clustering these consequences revealed that 1 10 mg l sdz caused effective migration of biofilm communities on the species level 3 5 2 expression differences of microbial community seven sample groups 7 samples were obtained with a total of 179 phyla the top 10 phyla were given in fig s3b containing 1448 families from metatranscriptomic sequencing the families with the top 10 expression abundance included four bacteria five microfauna and one plant fig 5c among the bacteria heterotrophic non motile chitinophagaceae could utilize glucose lactose etc chitinophagaceae were expressed with the abundance of 9 18 in sdz0 but strongly suppressed under sdz exposure with decreased abundance of 4 66 in sdz1 then further dropped to 0 62 in sdz3 and only 0 58 in sdz10 a similar situation occurred in both norank o burkholderiales and norank o sphingobacteriales strictly aerobic chemoheterotrophic bacteria in which the expression abundance of the two was 9 09 and 3 01 in sdz0 subsequently the addition of sdz effectively limited their expression reduced to 2 63 and 0 21 in sdz10 respectively these results demonstrated that 1 10 mg l sdz could strongly inhibit the activity of aerobic heterotrophic microorganisms in the biofilms and cut down their expression abundance which could be the main reason why sdz could significantly block cod removal furthermore it was noteworthy that nitrosomonadaceae a typical class of aob could express well in the biofilms which proved from the transcriptomic perspective that nitrosomonadaceae was the dominator for ammonia oxidation function in the pure mbbr 47 although the expression abundance of nitrosomonadaceae e was differentially reduced by 1 10 mg l sdz but it was much less inhibited compared to heterotrophic bacteria for the eukaryotes in the biofilms poaceae norank o hymenostomatida tetrahymenidae parameciidae philodinidae and daphniidae all showed fluctuations of expression after 1 10 mg l sdz exposure and could not recover to the initial abundance at the end in summary 1 10 mg l sdz strongly influenced the activity of aerobic heterotrophic microorganisms which could be the essential reason for the reduction in cod removal the activity of autotrophic bacteria nitrosomonadaceae was less inhibited by sdz than heterotrophic bacteria 3 6 pathways of nitrogen metabolism in the pure mbbr 3 6 1 variations in nitrogen metabolism under sdz stress 3 6 1 1 analysis of nitrogen metabolic pathways the core nitrogen metabolic pathways that biofilm can perform generally involved six processes and covered mainly 17 functional genes fig 6a including nitrification amocab hao nxrab denitrification narghi napab nirk nirs norbc nosz assimilation narb nasab nira dissimilation narghi napab nirbd nrfah anammox hzs hdh and nitrogen fixation nifdkh the kegg pathway characterized anammox genes hzs hdh were absent in the seven sample groups while the remaining 15 genes were all annotated this confirmed that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd was the primary nitrogen metabolism pathway in pure mbbr biofilms under aerobic circumstances the addition of sdz did not change this metabolism of nitrogen removal 3 6 1 2 distribution of functional genes the abundance of nitrification and denitrification functional genes in each stage was focused on in fig 6b except for amocab the relative abundance of nitrification genes hao and nxrab showed an upward trend with the increase of sdz dosing the relative abundances of amocab hao and nxrab were 2 45 10 3 1 37 10 3 and 8 10 10 2 in sdz0 respectively while were 1 49 10 3 3 01 10 3 and 1 17 10 1 in sdz10 respectively except for norbc the relative abundance of the major denitrification genes groups including narghi napab nirk nirs and nosz rose with the increase of sdz the abundances of the four clusters narghi napab nirk nirs norbc and nosz were 1 28 10 1 4 49 10 2 4 65 10 2 and 3 10 10 2 in sdz0 respectively while were 1 76 10 1 5 10 10 2 4 11 10 2 and 4 16 10 2 in sdz10 respectively the abundance of nifdkh a nitrogen fixation gene showed a fluctuating trend with the increase of sdz between 6 57 10 3 and 1 26 10 2 in addition the gene group encoding dissimilation nirbd nrfah also showed an indefinite trend while the two genomes encoding assimilation narb nasab and nira decreased with sdz addition 3 6 1 3 association of snd with genes abundance the magnitude of the relative abundance ratio between total dngs and total ngs was reduced from 2 96 to 2 54 for each reaction stage of sdz0 sdz10 the relative abundance ratio could be interpreted as the abundance of total dngs for each 1 abundance of total ngs e g in sdz0 each 1 of nitrification genes corresponds to 2 96 of denitrification genes similar to the macroscopic expression snrr sarr of snd total dngs total ngs could be understood as the expression of snd at the gene level snrr sarr reflected the balance of reaction rate while total dngs total ngs reflected the balance of gene abundance in this research the consistency between total dngs total ngs and snrr sarr further indicated that the imbalance between denitrification and nitrification caused the reduction of snd this suggested that the interference of sdz with the functional genes ratio of denitrification to nitrification is the main mechanism of its suppressive effect on the snd and thus decreased the tn removal 3 6 2 expression differences of key genes the expression abundance of nitrogen metabolism functional genes was calculated using the sum of gene abundance corresponding to the ec enzyme commission number in the kegg functional annotation and the results were given in fig 6c the data showed that the narb nasab and nira are related to assimilation and the napab in denitrification had no expression in the is and each biofilms sample the nitrogen fixation genes nifdkh and nirbd in dissimilation were expressed only in sdz3 sdz5 and sdz7 for amocab and hao in nitrification the expression abundance of the two was 0 109 and 0 100 in sdz0 respectively while both reached the highest of 0 129 and 0 133 in sdz1 respectively which was consistent with the biofilm holding the highest nh4 n removal efficiency in sdz1 from sdz3 to sdz10 the expression of the two fluctuated and reached the lowest level of 0 056 and 0 051 in sdz5 respectively and restored to near the initial level with the further increase of sdz concentration in sdz10 these results indicated that 1 mg l sdz could dramatically stimulate the expression of ammonia oxidation genes amocab and hao the sdz was the principal external reason for the promotion of nh4 n removal since nitrite oxidoreductase is bidirectional the expression products of the nitrification gene nxrab and the denitrification gene narghi were both nitrite oxidoreductase with ec of 1 7 5 1 and 1 7 99 4 respectively when calculating the expression abundance using the sum of gene abundance corresponding to the ec number it was impossible to distinguish the expression abundance of the two genes thus ec numbering was used here to discuss the transcriptome abundance for the enzyme with ec of 1 7 5 1 its transcriptome abundance in sdz0 sdz10 was 0 569 1 806 1 110 1 129 0 788 and 0 795 respectively indicating that 1 10 mg l of sdz did not limit its transcription in contrast for the enzyme with ec of 1 7 99 4 its transcription was inhibited by high concentrations of sdz 7 10 mg l due to the significantly curbed denitrification it could be speculated that the sdz strongly hindered the enzyme s activity with ec of 1 7 5 1 and 1 7 99 4 for the nirk nirs and nosz genes in denitrification the expression abundance of the two gene sets was not constricted by 1 10 mg l sdz on the contrary the expression of norbc genes in denitrification was strongly inhibited indicating that sdz negatively affects the reduction of nitric oxide no 3 7 changes of sulfonamide resistance genes in general widespread resistance to sulfadiazine in pathogenic bacteria is associated with antibiotic resistance genes args corresponding to sulfonamide i e sul1 sul2 sul3 and sul4 among them sul1 is linked to other resistance genes of class 1 integrons sul2 is often found on small plasmids sul3 is similar to sul1 and sul2 and sul4 is a newly identified resistance gene 48 the relative abundance of these four resistance genes in each stage was showed in fig 7 compared to the initial sludge the abundance of sul1 4 genes in the biofilm had reduced in sdz0 the high abundance of sul1 4 in the is may be related to the enrichment of antibiotics in the wastewater treatment plant 49 and the feed water did not contain antibiotics in sdz0 so the abundance of sul1 4 in the biofilm was decreased but compared with sdz0 the experiment revealed that sulfadiazine exposure significantly increased the abundance of sul1 3 p 0 05 the relative abundance of the three was elevated by 7 9 2 5 and 4 6 fold in sdz10 respectively the abundance of sul1 reached a maximum of 0 192 in sdz1 and with the increase of sdz concentration its abundance reduced to 0 155 in sdz10 but still significantly higher than 0 019 in sdz0 p 0 05 in contrast the abundance of sul2 was 0 098 in sdz1 followed by a maximum of 0 112 in sdz7 and 0 097 in sdz10 for sul3 there was a positive linear relationship between its abundance and sdz concentration r 2 0 972 p 0 001 and it reached the maximum abundance of 0 107 in sdz10 as for sul4 even though its abundance was higher than that of sul1 3 in all samples but was not significantly different between is and sdz0 to sdz3 p 0 05 meanwhile a decrease of sul4 was observed in sdz5 to sdz10 the experiment suggested that sul1 3 were the main sulfonamide args propagated in the biofilm and efficiently enriched after pure mbbr system was exposed to sulfadiazine guo et al 2020 50 found the absolute abundance of most args in biofilms was significantly higher than that in sediment and water indicating that biofilms on plastic carriers could act as a reservoir for args and promote microbial tolerance to antibiotics in conclusion the abundance up regulation of sul1 3 in the microbial community was an important mechanism for the biofilms of pure mbbr could adapt to the high concentration of sdz 4 conclusions the performance of pollutant removal and microbial responses under successional sulfadiazine exposure in a pure moving bed biofilm reactor was investigated although sdz inhibited cod removal the average sdz removal rate of pure mbbr was 98 80 1 54 at all conditions the low concentration of sdz dramatically enhanced nh4 n and p removal but strongly interfered with denitrification sdz exposure promoted the migration of agbs from surface to interior of the sponge carrier as well as the sloughing and updating of agbs snd was proven as the primary nitrogen metabolism pathway in biofilm regardless of sdz concentration the negative effect of sdz on the gene ratio of denitrification to nitrification was the main mechanism that coerced the snd rate and tn removal sdz strongly inhibited the expression abundance of aerobic heterotrophic microorganisms leading to a reduction in cod removal the promoted amocab and hao expression enhanced ammonia removal while inhibited norbc expression led to an impeded nitrate reduction meanwhile sdz effectively enriched sulfonamide args in biofilm the relative abundance of sul1 sul2 and sul3 eventually increased by 7 9 2 5 and 4 6 fold respectively to summarize the pure mbbr could successfully treat sdz wastewater below 3 mg l with a high cod and tn removal rate proven to be a feasible process to deal with antibiotic wastewater credit authorship contribution statement liang zhu formal analysis software visualization writing original draft preparation huizhou yuan methodology

12688,the use of herbal medicine has a long history herbal tablets and extracts play an important role in modern medicine radix aconiti is one of the most commonly used herbal medicine and its medicinal component alkaloids are extremely toxic so radix aconiti needs to be processed before using accordingly radix aconiti processing wastewater exhibits high toxicity due to the presence of alkaloids this wastewater if not effectively treated will be a huge threat to human and environmental safety herein we used fenton to treat radix aconiti processing wastewater to explore the effectiveness of advanced oxidation process aop in alkaloids control the radix aconiti processing wastewater was collected as soaking and cooking wastewater whose toc concentration was 261 and 2950 mg l respectively the effects of initial ph h2o2 and fe2 dosages were investigated and the parameters were optimized by response surface method rsm the toc removal was 66 9 and 70 3 for the soaking and cooking wastewater the concentration of alkaloids was tested by hplc and no alkaloid was detected in the effluent of soaking wastewater or cooking wastewater our study illustrates that the fenton can effectively remove toxic substances from radix aconiti processing wastewater the study also proves that aop has great potential in the treatment of toxic herbal wastewater keywords herbal wastewater radix aconiti processing toxic wastewater fenton rsm data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction herbal medicine is becoming more widespread 1 and the output value of herbal medicine has increased significantly since the late 1990s in china the output value reached 317 2 billion yuan in 2010 and it is expected to reach 962 billion yuan in 2025 2 with the development of herbal medicine large amounts of wastewater are discharged 3 the wastewater had the characteristics of biodegradability high chemical oxygen demand cod high chroma and biotoxicity the discharge of the wastewater without treatment will seriously pollute the environment 4 wastewater with different properties can be treated by different ways biological methods were often used in the treatment of organic wastewater with high biodegradability 5 8 however the efficiency of biological treatment is unstable for toxic wastewater chemical treatment can be used for the wastewater which contains refractory compounds or high toxicity 9 10 fenton as a typical advanced oxidation process has been widely used in industrial wastewater treatment 11 anotai et al compared the treatment effects of fenton electro fenton and photoelectro fenton on o toluidine where electro fenton and photoelectro fenton could achieve 91 and 43 removal of cod and o toluidine respectively 12 su et al used heterogeneous fenton as a pretreatment before anaerobic biological process the toxicity of rhein acid decreased and the cod removal and methane production rate increased greatly 13 a new abr bioelectricity fenton coupling reactor was applied to the treatment of tcm wastewater containing catechol and the cod removal was 97 1 14 espinoza quiñones et al treated brewery wastewater by the electro fenton hybrid process the toc removal reached 90 with high toxicity reduction was attained at the optimal condition 15 fenton is a good advanced oxidation process aop combined with other methods to treat wastewater and it has detoxification effect on wastewater 16 18 radix aconiti processing wastewater is a typical highly toxic wastewater radix aconiti belonging to the ranunculaceae family has been used for more than two thousand years in the treatment of diseases such as inflammation and anti arrhythmias 19 20 the pharmacological components of radix aconiti also known as the toxic component are alkaloids 21 the right concentration of alkaloids can cure diseases while too much can be toxic it was reported 22 that the ld50 of mice were 0 12 0 10 and 0 47 mg kg after intravenous injection of aconitine meoaconitine and hypaconitine respectively the ld50 of mice were 23 21 and 23 mg kg after intravenous injection of benzoylaconine benzoylmesaconine and benzoylhypacoitine respectively 23 24 the enrichment of excessive alkaloids in water causes water pollution according to the pharmacopoeia of the people s republic of china 2015 edition radix aconiti is generally used after processing the processing reduces the toxicity of radix aconiti and the product is radix aconiti preparata in the process lots of alkaloids enter water and the obtained wastewater shows high toxicity according to the preparation process the wastewater can be classified into the soaking wastewater and the cooking wastewater the characteristics of the two types of wastewaters and the way of reducing toxicity are worth exploring many scholars study herbal wastewater treatment such as tang et al 25 and su et al 26 but few studies focus on the treatment of toxic herbal wastewater radix aconiti is a widely used toxic herbal medicine and the wastewater obtained from the processing is a typical toxic herbal wastewater containing high toxicity it is unknown whether the aop can effectively treat the wastewater therefore we studied the treatment of radix aconiti processing wastewater by fenton process in this research fenton was used to treat the soaking wastewater and cooking wastewater from radix aconiti preparata the optimal conditions ph h2o2 dosage fe2 dosage were determined by single factor test and box behnken design bbd response surface method rsm toc removal was maximized under the optimal conditions and the concentrations of alkaloids the main toxic constituents in the wastewater were determined by hplc before and after the reaction 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater and chemicals radix aconiti were purchased from bozhou caoshengcaozhang pharmaceutical co ltd anhui china the processing of radix aconiti refers to the requirements of the pharmacopoeia of the people s republic of china 2015 edition 27 every 100 g of radix aconiti was put in the beaker and soaked with 1 l of water the soaking water was changed every 12 h for a total of 48 h the soaking wastewater was collected and mixed after soaking 0 5 l water was added to cook the radix aconiti the cooking wastewater was collected after boiling for 4 h the morphology of radix aconiti and radix aconiti preparata were showed in fig 1 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 was obtained from jinfeng chemical co ltd tianjin china ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o

tetrahydrofuran c4h8o 99 9 were of grade and purchased from shandong yuwang material co ltd china 2 2 the parameters of fenton initial ph h2o2 and fe2 dosages are the major parameters of fenton that affect the treatment efficiency firstly the effective range of initial ph h2o2 and fe2 dosages were identified through one factor at a time ofat method the dosages of h2o2 for soaking and cooking wastewater ranged from 12 5 mmol l to 125 mmol l and 200 mmol l to 1000 mmol l respectively the dosages of fe2 for soaking and cooking wastewater were in the range between 2 5 and 12 5 mmol l and 5 15 mmol l respectively the range of ph for soaking and cooking wastewater were 2 7 and 2 6 respectively the study was conducted in 1 l beaker which equipped with mechanical agitator with wastewater size 1 l at room temperatures 20 25 c with continuous mixing of 400 rpm the initial ph was adjusted by adding 1 mol l naoh or 2 mol l hcl then the designed dosages of h2o2 and fe2 were added and fenton s reaction was initiated after the reaction mno2 of 0 5 g was added to beaker to remove the excess h2o2 the iron sludge collected and treated as dangerous experimental waste after the experiment the treated water sample was filtered with a 0 22 m filter and then its total organic carbon toc value was measured 2 3 response surface optimization the reaction conditions for the treatment of radix aconiti processing wastewater by the fenton were optimized by rsm in this research the response surface was developed by design expert 8 0 6 software toc removal was selected as a dependent variable three independent variables were h2o2 and fe2 dosages and initial ph the levels and range of independent variables were showed in table 1 after the optimization of rsm the water sample under the best conditions was extracted and filtered and the concentration of alkaloids was determined by hplc 2 4 analytical methods a toc analyzer shimadzu toc l cpn japan was used to measure the value of toc a ph meter sartorius pb 10 germany was employed to adjust the ph the degradation of alkaloids was measured with shimadzu lc 20 at liquid chromatography tandem fld 20 at fluorescence detector shimadzu japan with a kromasil 100 5 c18 analytical column 250 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm the flow rate was at 1 ml min the mobile phase constituted of 0 1 m ammonium acetate solution 0 5 ml glacial acetic acid and 0 4 ml triethylamine were added to every 1000 ml solution and acetonitrile tetrahydrofuran 25 15 the injection volume was 20 μl and the column temperature was kept at 30 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of h2o2 dosage the mechanism of fenton is to oxidize organic substances by hydroxyl radicals produced by the reaction between h2o2 and fe2 therefore the dosages of h2o2 and fe2 are important for fenton 28 29 it was clear in fig 2 that the toc removal was improved by the higher h2o2 dosage which generated more hydroxyl radicals the toc concentration of the raw soaking and cooking wastewater was 261 and 2950 mg l respectively in the treatment of soaking wastewater fig 2 a the toc concentration decreased to 203 mg l when the h2o2 dosage was 12 5 mmol l at ph 5 and fe2 dosage of 5 mmol l then the toc concentration decreased from 203 to 109 mg l and the toc removal increased from 24 3 to 59 2 with the h2o2 dosage increasing from 12 5 to 75 mmol l toc removal did not increase when the h2o2 dosage was 75 mmol l because the excessive h2o2 promoted the conversion of hydroxyl radicals to other forms through a scavenging effect 30 31 the same trend was shown in the cooking wastewater treatment fig 2 b toc concentration decreased from 2217 to 979 mg l while the toc removal increased from 24 8 to 66 8 with the h2o2 dosage increasing from 200 to 700 mmol l at ph 5 and fe2 dosage of 10 mmol l 3 2 effect of fe2 dosage the fe2 in the fenton performed as a catalyst for the decomposition of h2o2 to generate free hydroxyl radicals 32 the effect of fe2 was investigated in this research when the fe2 dosage increased from 2 5 to 5 mmol l toc concentration decreased from 184 to 110 mg l and the corresponding toc removal increased from 31 4 to 59 1 for the soaking wastewater fig 3 a however toc removal decreased when the dosage of fe2 was higher than 5 mmol l although the fe2 was enough the hydroxyl radical cannot continue to be produced without adequate h2o2 moreover more sludge containing iron was produced by excessive fe2 30 33 for the cooking wastewater when the fe2 dosage increased from 5 to 10 mmol l toc concentration decreased from 2496 to 979 mg l and the corresponding toc removal increased from 15 4 to 66 8 fig 3 b the toc removal did not change significantly with the further increasing of fe2 dosage the optimum molar ratio of h2o2 fe2 was 15 and 70 for the soaking and cooking wastewater respectively in previous studies the molar ratio of h2o2 fe2 was between 30 and 40 34 38 anirudh gupta et al 39 obtained a h2o2 fe2 molar ratio of 10 in the degradation of ciprofloxacin huseyin tekin et al 40 concluded that the molar ratio of h2o2 fe2 between 150 and 250 was more effective in the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater huseyin tekin speculated that the optimal molar ratio of h2o2 fe2 is greatly affected by the type of waste in water 3 3 effect of initial ph ph is a significant parameter for fenton as described by huseyin tekin 40 the optimal ph of fenton was at around 3 5 for wastewater when ph is 3 h2o2 is consumed by the reaction with protons in the solution the oxidative capacity of the fenton is also decreased due to the lack of h2o2 32 when the ph is 5 h2o2 is unstable and the produce of hydroxyl radicals is affected 41 in this study toc removal increased first and then decreased with the increasing of ph the lowest toc concentration for the soaking wastewater was 87 mg l and the corresponding toc removal was 66 0 at the condition of ph 4 h2o2 dosage 75 mmol l and fe2 dosage 5 mmol l fig 4 a the h2o2 dosage was maintained at 700 mmol l and fe2 dosage was 10 mmol l in the treatment of cooking wastewater the lowest toc concentration was 979 mg l and the corresponding toc removal was 66 8 at ph 5 fig 4 b 3 4 response surface model analysis table 2 showed the bbd with three factors in three levels and the results of toc removal the range of factors has been derived from preliminary ofat experiments the anova results of the response surface quadratic models were showed in table 3 and table s1 it can be seen from table s1 that c ab ac a2 b2 c2 had highly significant impact on toc removal in the treatment of soaking wastewater while a b bc had significant impact in the treatment of cooking wastewater a b a2 b2 had highly significant impact on toc removal and c ab c2 had significant impact 32 the independent variables were fitted with toc removal and the fitted model was evaluated by correlation coefficient the quadratic polynomial regression eqs 1 and 2 were obtained by comparing the goodness of fit of each fitted equation the f test of the regression model produced a p value of 0 0001 which indicated that both models were of high significance 42 the determination coefficients r2 of the models were 0 9975 and 0 9953 respectively indicating that the compatibility of the model is on a high level 32 43 in addition the mismatch term p 0 0693 and 0 0579 was 0 05 which was not significant indicating that the fitting degree and reliability of the model were effective and the test error was small the predictive ability of the regression model at various response values was illustrated by evaluating the actual plot vs predicted plot fig s1 the predicted value and the actual data points were located near the regression line of the model indicating that the model fitted well 44 so these models could be used to analyze and predict the effect of fenton in treating soaking and cooking wastewater 1 toc removal efficiency 67 20 2 88 a 3 38 b 4 25 c 7 00 ab 6 75 ac 12 60 a

ellipse indicated the interaction between ph h2o2 and fe2 dosages and was an indicator of the effect of the independent variables on toc removal 45 the slope of the response surface changes slowly fig s2 a indicating that the interaction between h2o2 and ph has little influence on the toc removal during the treatment of soaking wastewater the slope of the response surface changes rapidly fig s2 b c indicating that the dosage of fe2 and ph and the interaction between fe2 and h2o2 have a greater impact on the removal of toc in a similar way the dosage of h2o2 and ph fig s3 a and the interaction between fe2 and ph fig s3 b have little influence on toc removal in the treatment of cooking wastewater while the interaction between fe2 and h2o2 has a greater impact on the removal of toc the optimal conditions were derived from the center point of a concentric ellipse projected in a horizontal plane from the 3d surface plot fig s4 and fig s5 46 the optimum condition for the soaking wastewater was of ph 4 h2o2 dosage 89 mmol l fe2 dosage 5 5 mmol l and the predicted toc removal was 68 0 in the treatment of cooking wastewater the optimum condition was of ph 5 h2o2 dosage 829 mmol l fe2 dosage 11 mmol l and the predicted toc removal was 73 1 the actual toc removal was 66 9 and 70 3 respectively and the relative deviations from the predicted values were 0 82 and 2 0 anirudh gupta et al 39 achieved 55 toc removal in the degradation of ciprofloxacin by fenton frade et al 47 found 58 toc removal in the degradation of enrofloxacin by fenton 3 5 change of alkaloid content the main active ingredient that is also the toxic ingredient in radix aconiti is alkaloids 48 51 gao et al 52 reported that water and heat can cause the hydrolysis of alkaloids when the alkaloids in water were heated the acetyl fragment of the diterpenoid alkaloids are easily hydrolyzed by heating these acetyl fragments condense with the o hydroxyl group to produce pyroaconitrile alkaloids which in turn generate monoester diterpenoid alkaloids or amino alcohol aconitine fig 5 53 57 mesaconitine hypaconitine and aconitine belong to diterpenoid alkaloids and benzoylmesaconine benzoylaconine benzoylhypacoitione belong to monoester diterpenoid alkaloids the 6 alkaloids were detected in the raw and treated water to show the toxicity benzoylmesaconine mesaconitine hypaconitine and aconitine were detected in soaking wastewater with a content of 1 05 0 007 6 65 0 31 2 74 0 89 and 0 63 0 02 mg l respectively fig 6 a and table 4 the benzoylmesaconine mesaconitine and hypaconitine was detected in cooking wastewater with a content of 4 25 0 19 0 65 0 44 1 38 0 09 mg l respectively fig 6 b and table 4 it could be seen from the results that diterpenoid alkaloids were mainly present in soaking wastewater and monoester diterpenoid alkaloids were mainly present in cooking wastewater the concentration of alkaloids detected in soaking wastewater was higher than that in cooking wastewater after fenton process no alkaloid was detected in the effluent of soaking or cooking wastewater fig 6 and table 4 in the treatment of aconite wastewater with non thermal plasma wen et al 58 achieved a removal of 99 59 of the main aconitum alkaloids the principle is also the oxidative degradation of alkaloids by generating hydroxyl radicals the chemical sludge produced from fenton may also have the effect of adsorption and net capture on the alkaloids 59 60 according to the literature the toxicity of monoester diterpenoid alkaloids is 1 500 1 200 times of diterpenoid alkaloids and the toxicity of non esterified diterpenoid alkaloids such as amino alcohol aconitine is 1 4000 1 2000 times of monoester diterpenoid alkaloids 19 therefore the absence of detectable diterpenoid alkaloids and monoester diterpenoid alkaloids in the effluent means that the toxicity of the effluent was greatly reduced compared to the influent the results showed that the fenton was effective in removing alkaloids from the soaking and cooking wastewater and reducing the toxicity of the influent 4 conclusion in this research fenton was employed to treat the soaking and cooking wastewater form the radix aconiti processing after the fenton reaction the toc removal of the soaking wastewater could reach 66 9 at the h2o2 dosage of 89 mmol l fe2 dosage of 5 5 mmol l and ph 4 for the cooking wastewater the toc removal could reach 70 3 when the h2o2 dosage fe2 dosage and ph were 829 mmol l 11 mmol l and 5 respectively no alkaloid was detected in the effluent of the soaking wastewater or cooking wastewater the results showed that fenton could remove alkaloids from the wastewater therefore it was appropriate to apply fenton in the treatment of radix aconiti processing wastewater

herbal wastewater radix aconiti is a widely used toxic herbal medicine and the wastewater obtained from the processing is a typical toxic herbal wastewater containing high toxicity it is unknown

affect the treatment efficiency firstly the effective range of initial ph h2o2 and fe2 dosages were identified through one factor at a time ofat method the dosages of h2o2 for soaking and cooking wastewater ranged from 12 5 mmol l to 125 mmol l and 200 mmol l to 1000 mmol l respectively the dosages of fe2 for soaking and cooking wastewater were in the range between 2 5 and 12 5 mmol l and 5 15 mmol l respectively the range of ph for soaking and cooking wastewater were 2 7 and 2 6 respectively the study was conducted in 1 l beaker which equipped with mechanical agitator with wastewater size 1 l at room temperatures 20 25 c with continuous mixing of 400 rpm the initial ph was adjusted by adding 1 mol l naoh or 2 mol l hcl then the designed dosages of h2o2 and fe2 were added and fenton s reaction was initiated after the reaction mno2 of 0 5 g was added to beaker to remove the excess h2o2 the iron sludge collected and treated as dangerous experimental waste after the experiment the

of h2o2 dosage the mechanism of fenton is to oxidize organic substances by hydroxyl radicals produced by the reaction between h2o2 and fe2 therefore the dosages of h2o2 and fe2 are important for fenton 28 29 it was clear in fig 2 that the toc removal was improved by the higher h2o2 dosage which generated more hydroxyl radicals the toc concentration of the raw soaking and cooking wastewater was 261 and 2950 mg l respectively in the treatment of soaking wastewater fig 2 a the toc concentration decreased to 203 mg l when the h2o2 dosage was 12 5 mmol l at ph 5 and fe2 dosage of 5 mmol l then the toc concentration decreased from 203 to 109 mg l and the toc removal increased from 24 3 to 59 2 with the h2o2 dosage increasing from 12 5 to 75 mmol l toc removal did not increase when the h2o2 dosage was 75 mmol l because the excessive h2o2 promoted the conversion of hydroxyl radicals to other forms through a scavenging effect 30 31 the same trend was shown in the cooking wastewater treatment fig 2 b toc concentration decreased from 2217 to 979 mg l while the toc removal increased from 24 8 to 66 8 with the h2o2 dosage increasing from 200 to 700 mmol l at ph 5 and fe2 dosage of 10 mmol l 3 2 effect of fe2 dosage the fe2 in the fenton performed as a catalyst for the decomposition of h2o2 to generate free hydroxyl radicals 32 the effect of fe2 was investigated in this research when the fe2 dosage increased from 2 5 to 5 mmol l toc concentration decreased from 184 to 110 mg l and the corresponding toc removal increased from 31 4 to 59 1 for the soaking wastewater fig 3 a however toc removal decreased when the dosage of fe2 was higher than 5 mmol l although the fe2 was enough the hydroxyl radical cannot continue to be produced without adequate h2o2 moreover more sludge containing iron was produced by excessive fe2 30 33 for the cooking wastewater when the fe2 dosage increased from 5 to 10 mmol l toc concentration decreased from 2496 to 979 mg l and the corresponding toc removal increased from 15 4 to 66 8 fig 3 b the toc removal did not change significantly with the further increasing of fe2 dosage the optimum molar ratio of h2o2 fe2 was 15 and 70 for the soaking

ciprofloxacin huseyin tekin et al 40 concluded that the molar ratio of h2o2 fe2 between 150 and 250 was more effective in the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater huseyin tekin speculated that the optimal molar ratio of h2o2 fe2 is greatly affected by the type of waste in water 3 3 effect of initial ph ph is a significant parameter for fenton as described by huseyin tekin 40 the optimal ph of fenton was at around 3 5 for wastewater when ph is 3 h2o2 is consumed by the reaction with protons in the solution the oxidative capacity of the fenton is also decreased due to the lack of h2o2 32 when the ph is 5 h2o2 is unstable and the produce of hydroxyl radicals is affected 41 in this study toc removal increased first and then decreased with the increasing of ph the lowest toc

between fe2 and ph fig s3 b have little influence on toc removal in the treatment of cooking wastewater while the interaction between fe2 and h2o2 has a greater impact on the removal of toc the optimal conditions were derived from the center point of a concentric ellipse projected in a horizontal plane from the 3d surface plot fig s4 and fig s5 46 the optimum condition for the soaking wastewater was of ph 4 h2o2 dosage 89 mmol l fe2 dosage 5 5 mmol l and the predicted toc removal was 68 0 in the treatment of cooking wastewater the optimum condition was of ph 5 h2o2 dosage 829 mmol l fe2 dosage 11 mmol l and the predicted toc removal was 73 1 the actual toc removal was 66 9 and 70 3 respectively and the relative deviations from the predicted values were 0 82 and 2 0 anirudh gupta et al 39 achieved 55 toc removal in the degradation of ciprofloxacin by fenton frade et al 47 found 58 toc removal in the degradation of enrofloxacin by fenton 3 5 change of alkaloid content the main active ingredient that is also the toxic ingredient in radix aconiti is alkaloids 48 51 gao et al 52 reported that water and heat can cause the hydrolysis of alkaloids when the alkaloids in water were heated the acetyl fragment of the diterpenoid alkaloids are easily hydrolyzed by heating these acetyl fragments condense with the o hydroxyl group to produce pyroaconitrile alkaloids which in turn generate monoester diterpenoid alkaloids or amino alcohol aconitine fig 5 53 57 mesaconitine hypaconitine and aconitine belong to diterpenoid alkaloids and benzoylmesaconine benzoylaconine benzoylhypacoitione belong to monoester diterpenoid alkaloids the 6 alkaloids were detected in the raw and treated water to show the toxicity benzoylmesaconine mesaconitine hypaconitine and aconitine were detected in soaking wastewater with a content of 1 05 0 007 6 65 0 31 2 74 0 89 and 0 63 0 02 mg l respectively fig 6 a and table 4 the benzoylmesaconine mesaconitine and hypaconitine was detected in cooking wastewater with a content of 4 25 0 19 0 65 0 44 1 38 0 09 mg l respectively fig 6 b and table 4 it could be seen from the results that diterpenoid alkaloids were mainly present in soaking wastewater and monoester diterpenoid alkaloids were mainly present in cooking wastewater the concentration of alkaloids detected in soaking wastewater was higher than that in cooking wastewater after fenton process no alkaloid was detected in the effluent of soaking or cooking wastewater fig 6 and table 4 in the treatment of aconite wastewater with non thermal plasma wen et al 58 achieved a removal of 99 59 of the main aconitum alkaloids the principle is also the oxidative degradation of alkaloids by generating hydroxyl radicals the chemical sludge produced from fenton may also have the effect of adsorption and net capture on the alkaloids 59 60 according to the literature the toxicity of monoester diterpenoid alkaloids is 1 500 1 200 times of diterpenoid alkaloids and the toxicity of non esterified diterpenoid alkaloids such as amino alcohol aconitine is 1 4000 1 2000 times of monoester diterpenoid alkaloids 19 therefore the absence of detectable diterpenoid alkaloids and monoester diterpenoid alkaloids in the effluent means that the toxicity of the effluent was greatly reduced compared to the influent the results showed that the fenton was effective in removing alkaloids from the soaking and cooking wastewater and reducing the toxicity of the influent 4 conclusion in this research fenton was employed to treat the soaking and cooking wastewater form the radix aconiti processing after the fenton reaction the toc removal of the soaking wastewater could reach 66 9 at the h2o2 dosage of 89 mmol l fe2 dosage of 5 5 mmol l and ph 4 for the cooking wastewater the toc removal could reach 70 3 when the h2o2 dosage fe2 dosage and ph were 829 mmol l 11 mmol l and 5 respectively no alkaloid was detected in the effluent of the soaking wastewater or cooking wastewater the results showed that fenton could remove alkaloids from the wastewater therefore it was appropriate to apply fenton in the treatment of radix aconiti processing wastewater

12689,in this study nano zero valent iron reduced graphene oxide nzvi rgo was successfully synthesized and applied for 2 4 dcp and cr vi removal characterization results show that nzvi particles were successfully loaded on rgo nanosheets increasing the dispersibility of particles removal experiments indicate that the existence of rgo significantly enhanced the removal efficiency of 2 4 dcp and cr vi compared with bare nano zero valent iron the removal rate of 2 4 dcp and cr vi increased from 33 24 and 63 14 to 100 and 98 40 respectively pseudo second order model and langmuir isotherm model could better explain the 2 4 dcp removal process the removal mechanism of 2 4 dcp in the process of simultaneous removal is adsorption including π π interaction hydrogen bonding and n π eda interaction between cr vi and 2 4 dcp cr vi is firstly fixed on the surface of nzvi rgo by electrostatic interaction the electrostatic interaction between γ feooh and cr vi and the strong connection formed by n π eda interaction between cr vi and 2 4 dcp promote the adsorption of cr vi in coexisting system subsequently cr vi is reduced to cr iii by accepting the electrons donated by nzvi and cr iii interacts with oh in the solution to generate cr oh 3 precipitate the existence of rgo accelerates the rate of electron transfer to cr vi in nzvi this study provides theoretical support for remediation of combined pollution of chlorinated organics and heavy metals keywords reduced graphene oxide nanometer zero valent iron 2 4 dichlorophenols chromium vi simultaneous removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the water pollution caused by organic contaminant is becoming one of a great threat to environment and human health at a global scale as hazardous intermediates various chlorophenols cps have been widely used in chemical industries such as paper making petroleum refineries herbicides phenolic resins and wood preservation 1 2 at the same time widespread use and improper disposal have led to an excessive accumulation of cps and made it become a priority pollutant of major environmental concern 3 cps with inherent high toxicity and carcinogenicity can easily be a threat to human health even at low concentration the fat solubility persistence difficult degradation of cps can also increase the difficulty of removal 4 therefore these pollutants must be removed before discharging into aqueous environment to avoid health and ecological problems nanometer zero valent iron nzvi a typical nanometer metal material was applied to remove heavy metals 5 6 organic pollutants 7 and dye 8 due to its large surface area and abundant active sites 8 however the largescale application of nzvi is limited by some defects including the aggregation caused by the magnetic attraction between particles 9 and the formation of oxide shell preventing the subsequent reactions 10 these negative impacts are usually meliorated by adopting these approaches 1 using polymer surfactant and other organic coatings for surface properties modification to improve the dispersion stability of nzvi in water 11 12 2 adding a secondary metal to form a bimetallic system to improve the reactivity of nzvi for organic pollutant degradation 13 3 applying inorganic material to support nanoparticles preventing aggregation 14 the last method not only retains the reactivity of nanoparticles but also taking advantages of the supporting materials thus optimizing the composite system to remove pollutants 15 in recent years graphene g and its derivatives including graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo have attracted extensive attention of scientists due to their unique physicochemical properties such as high surface area abundant oxygen containing functional groups 16 and exceptional electron transport characteristics 17 compared with other materials graphene and its derivatives exhibit more excellent adsorption property for water purification owing to their high theoretical specific surface area surface chemistry adjustability and diversity of used in various forms powder film suspension hydrogel or sponge 18 as a highly toxic metal pollutant chromium is commonly in the form of hexavalent chromium cr vi and trivalent chromium cr iii of which cr vi has been shown to be a serious hazard to human health and the environment 19 21 in addition the co existence of cr vi and 2 4 dcp are also found in tanning wastewater 22 23 and actual polluted sites 24 25 so it is necessary to concern the coexistent pollution of 2 4 dcp and cr vi in water in recent years some researchers used advanced oxidation technology to remove cr vi and 2 4 dcp in wastewater 26 27 however due to the strong quantum confinement effects qce the greatly increased band gap severely limits the practical application of photocatalysis 28 in order to improve the removal technology of cr vi and 2 4 dcp composite pollutants we used nzvi with high reactivity as reducing agent and rgo with rich oxygen containing functional groups and excellent electron transport ability as carrier of nzvi to construct nzvi rgo system it is expected that the agglomeration and passivation of nzvi can be effectively improved the conduction rate of electrons can be increased and the removal of cr vi and 2 4 dcp composite pollutants can be enhanced through adsorption and reduction in this study nzvi rgo was successfully synthesized by liquid phase reduction method and it was used to remove 2 4 dcp and cr vi from aqueous solution simultaneously the aims of this work are to 1 investigate 2 4 dcp removal behavior by nzvi rgo under various conditions mass ratio dosage 2 4 dcp concentration ph 2 evaluate the kinetics equilibrium isotherms and thermodynamics 3 explore the mechanism of 2 4 dcp and cr vi simultaneous removal 2 materials and method 2 1 materials and instruments all chemicals used in this

nanobrook 90plus brookhaven usa at different ph values 2 4 removal experiments all the removal experiments were carried out in 250 ml conical flask equipped with glass bottle stopper the conical flasks were placed in a thermostatic shaker bath with a rotation speed of 200 rpm at 298 k thermodynamic studies temperature is different to compare the removal performance of bare nzvi particles rgo and nzvi rgo 0 1 g sample was added into 100 ml of 2 4 dcp aqueous solution with a concentration of 10 0 mg l batch experiments analyze the effect of mass ratios of nzvi to rgo 2 1 1 1 1 2 nzvi rgo

for the 2 4 dcp concentration determined using hplc simultaneous removal test adopts the same method except that 10 mg l of 2 4dcp and 20 mg l cr vi are added to the solution at the same time the concentrations of cr vi were determined by a unico 2802s uv vis spectrophotometer using the diphenyl carbazide dpc method three parallel experiments were conducted in all removal experiments and the results were the average of three data the standard error of the mean value is represented by the error bar 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterizations 3 1 1 morphology characterizations the morphologies and nanoparticles distribution of the nzvi rgo and nzvi rgo with different ratios were characterized by using sem fig 1a shows that the bared nzvi nanoparticles were mostly spherical and concentrated together tightly into larger aggregates the wrinkled layers of rgo sheets could be easily observed in fig 1b which were associated with the huge specific surface area and abundant loading sites 33 according to fig 1c e with the increase of nzvi mass ratio the dispersion degree of nanoparticles gradually decreases due to the stronger van der waals attractive force and magnetic interaction between nanoparticles 34 this phenomenon is manifested in the specific surface area of table s1 the material as the mass ratio of nzvi decreases the specific surface area of the material gradually increases reaching 52 922 m2 g at nzvi rgo 1 2 as we know uniform dispersion is a key factor to improve the activity of nzvi 35 the corresponding results were obtained that the optimal mass ratio of nzvi to rgo is 1 2 where nzvi particles can be loaded in the interlayers of rgo sheets without aggregation the energy dispersive x ray edx elemental mapping in fig 1f was employed to explore the elemental distributions of the composite before reaction it can be clearly seen that graphene as a background material is uniformly covered by element fe which is in good agreement with the results of sem fig 1e in addition the element o mapping for nzvi rgo confirms that the existence of residual oxygen containing functional groups 3 1 2 analyses of crystalline structure fig 2 shows the xrd patterns of go rgo nzvi and nzvi rgo 1 2 the intense peak at 10 5 of go pattern was attributed to the 001 crystalline plane of go corresponding to an interlayer spacing of 0 84 nm 36 after reduction this peak became invisible and a new broad diffraction peak appeared at 24 0 relating to the 0 37 nm interlayer spacing which is lesser than that of go due to the removal of most oxygen containing functional groups during reduction process the presence of diffraction peaks at 2θ of 35 4 and 57 2 with weak intensity in the xrd patterns of nzvi was corresponded to the planes of 311 and 511 fe3o4 which due to the surface slight oxidation for the nzvi rgo composites there were two apparent peaks at 24 0 and 44 7 attributed to the 110 plane of fe0 and 002 plane of rgo 37 38 respectively this phenomenon confirmed that nzvi nanoparticles were successfully loaded at rgo nanosheets and no obvious reflection peaks of iron oxide observed proving that rgo could avoid nzvi particles from rapid surface oxidation 3 1 3 functional groups and chemical bonds fig 3 shows the ftir spectra of go rgo and nzvi rgo 1 2 for go the broad band between 3000 and 3600 cm 1 represented oh stretching modes 36 and other bands at 1731 1634 1400 and 1119 cm 1 illustrate the presence of co stretching vibration aromatic cc skeletal vibration 39 carboxyl o c o bonds 36 and oh deformation vibrations 40 respectively in the rgo spectrum the intensity of above mentioned bands had been weakened to an extent confirming that the oxygen containing functional groups in the go were effectively reduced while the remain oxygen containing groups on nzvi rgo perhaps are in favor of the hydrogen bond interaction 41 compared with go the band at 483 and 621 cm 1 of nzvi rgo 1 2 assigned to the appearance of feo bond generated by the weak surface oxidation of nzvi indicating that nzvi particles successfully embedded in the reduced graphene oxide 39 42 3 2 investigation of 2 4 dcp removal 3 2 1 removal efficiency of 2 4 dcp using various materials and effects of nzvi rgo dosage fig 4a shows the removal efficiency of 2 4 dcp by rgo nzvi and nzvi rgo at different mass ratios of nzvi to rgo including 2 1 1 1 1 2 as a function of contact time the removal rate order for 2 4 dcp was nzvi rgo 1 2 nzvi rgo 1 1 nzvi rgo 2 1 nzvi rgo it is worth noting that no degradation products of 2 4 dcp detected during the removal process such as 2 chlorophenol 2 cp 4 chlorophenol 4 cp and phenol p which were detected in our previous research 43 desorption experiment was conducted in 0 1 mol l naoh solution for 120 min to analyze the composition of composites surface after reaction the result is only 2 4 dcp was detected proving that there was no degradation process the rapid removal rate also indicates that adsorption play a dominant role rather than the dechlorination reaction since the latter would take much longer time therefore adsorption is particularly important in the removal of 2 4 dcp by nzvi rgo compared with rgo nzvi rgo has a better specific surface area table s1 and can provide more adsorption sites for 2 4 dcp the processes involved in 2 4 dcp removal by bare nzvi were a combination of adsorption and reduction as its agglomeration and passivation as well as its low specific surface area limit its efficient reduction and strong adsorption of 2 4 dcp in particular the nzvi rgo 1 2 can completely remove 2 4 dcp within 10 min due to its maximum specific surface area therefore the best sample nzvi rgo 1 2 is selected for further adsorption experiments hereinafter referred to as nzvi rgo the 2 4 dcp removal performance of nzvi rgo for different dosages in the range of 0 25 1 50 g l is described in fig 4b and it is obvious that the removal rate of 2 4 dcp increases and the equilibrium removal time shortens with the rise of nzvi rgo dosage the removal rate reached 78 after 4 h when the nzvi rgo dosage was 0 25 g l and 2 4 dcp could be completely removed in 3 h when the dosage of nzvi rgo is 0 50 g l when the nzvi rgo dosage increased to 1 00 g l 2 4 dcp could be completely removed within 10 min this is because with the rise of nzvi rgo dosage the number of adsorption sites increases and the contact probability between the composite and 2 4 dcp becomes larger thus greatly improving the 2 4 dcp removal efficiency 3 2 2 effect of solution ph and analysis of zeta potential solution ph is recognized as an important controlling factor which affects the adsorption behavior by changing the surface charge of composites 44 the effect of solution ph on 2 4 dcp adsorption was assessed and the results were illustrated in fig 5a from ph 3 to 11 the removal rate decreased with the increasing ph which indicated an acidic environment favored 2 4 dcp removal by the nzvi rgo zeta potential as a physical parameter showing the surface charge of solid particles is measured to further explore the adsorption process 45 it can be seen from fig 5b that nzvi altered the surface charge property of rgo the point of the zero potential of nzvi rgo is approximately ph 9 01 which means that when the ph exceeds this value the surface of the material is converted into electronegativity this phenomenon is highly consistent with the results of removal experiments when ph is from 3 to 9 the 2 4 dcp can be completely removed within 20 min while the time was greatly prolonged under the condition that the ph is 11 several reasons can be suggested for the higher removal efficiency one is that the acidic conditions accelerate the corrosion of iron oxides precipitates 46 whereas under alkaline condition the passivating film of nzvi is easily formed inhibiting contacts between the target contaminant and the reactive sites of composites 47 another possible reason is that the negative surface charge of nzvi rgo leads to the electrostatic repulsion with the anionic forms of 2 4 dcp which would be mainly exist in anionic forms when the solution ph exceeds pka 7 83 48 however the removal rate of 2 4 dcp can reach 100 at any ph as shown in fig 4a because the target pollutant content is low so it can be completely removed by prolonging the reaction time under unfavorable conditions 3 2 3 adsorption kinetics study fig 6a depicts the changes of adsorption rate with contact time at different 2 4 dcp initial concentrations when the adsorbent is 1 0 g l it can be observed that the removal process could be completed during the first 10 min when the 2 4 dcp concentration is lower than 10 mg l when the 2 4 dcp initial concentration was increased to 20 mg l the reaction time was extended to 3 h and when the 2 4 dcp initial concentration was further promotion to 40 mg l the removal efficiency is decreased to 90 the insufficient adsorption sites are the major reason leading to a slow adsorption rate in the latter stage 49 adsorption kinetics can describe the adsorption process and provide information on the adsorption mechanism 50 in this study pseudo first order and pseudo second order were applied to evaluate the 2 4 dcp adsorption kinetics by nzvi rgo the fitting results of each model are shown in fig 6 and the kinetic parameters for adsorption are listed in table 1 it is apparent in fig 6 that the pseudo second order kinetic model can better coincide with the experimental data which can also be confirmed by the higher determination r2 0 9988 moreover the equilibrium adsorption capability qe calculated by the pseudo second order model is closer to the experimental data providing further evidence for the above conclusion this result indicates that the adsorption of 2 4 dcp onto nzvi rgo was dominated by chemical adsorption it is similar to some previous reports about the removal of 2 4 dcp using activated carbon fiber 51 and the adsorption of cps onto graphene 52 3 2 4 adsorption isotherms study the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe of nzvi rgo shows an upward tendency with the increase of the 2 4 dcp initial concentration 20 120 mg l at different temperature is exhibited in fig 7a it is due to the driving force for transportation from solution to the adsorbents increases with the increase of contaminant concentration thus promoting the adsorption of more 2 4 dcp 53 qe were calculated by using the following equation 1 q e c 0 c e v m where c0 and ce mg l are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of 2 4 dcp respectively v l is the total volume of the reaction solution and m g the weight of the composites the adsorption isotherm data obtained at 288 298 and 308 k were fitted to the langmuir and freundlich models the langmuir theory assumes that adsorption takes place at specific homogeneous sites on the surface of the adsorbent and once adsorbate molecule occupies a site no further adsorption can take place at that site while the freundlich isotherm model is generally describes the adsorption on the surface of the heterogeneous medium 53 the non linear langmuir and freundlich equation are represented as follows 2 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m 3 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where qe is the adsorption amount mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbates mg l kl ml mg is the constant qm is the saturation capacity mg g kf is freundlich adsorption rate constant mg g 1 l mg 1 1 n n is a constant related to adsorption intensity the fitted line in fig 7b and c and the higher value of r2 in table 2 suggest that the data were better fitted in the langmuir isotherm model confirming the single molecular layer adsorption value of qm was calculated as 40 49 mg g at 308 k to further understand the interaction between 2 4 dichlorophenol and nzvi rgo the thermodynamic parameters are calculated text s1 and summarized in table 3 for further analysis the negative δg value at each temperature suggests that the adsorption process is spontaneous the positive δh and δs values indicate that the adsorption process is endothermic and in the direction of increasing degrees of freedom 54 moreover the δg decreases with the increase of temperature indicating that high temperature is more beneficial to the adsorption of 2 4 dcp which consistent with the adsorption results in fig 7a 3 2 5 reusability of nzvi rgo recyclability is of great significance for its application in practical engineering which not only reduces the cost but also is its environmental friendliness according to section 3 2 2 the adsorption efficiency of 2 4 dcp on nzvi rgo decreased significantly when the solution is alkaline thus we using 0 1 mol l naoh as the eluent it can be observed in fig 8 that the removal rate of 2 4 dcp slightly descend in the cycling the main reasons include the residue of pollutants on the surface of composites and the inevitable loss of composites in the process of reuse but the removal rate could still be maintained 83 65 even after five cycles 3 2 6 possible removal mechanism of 2 4 dcp the possible removal mechanisms of organic pollutants by either nzvi or nzvi based composites from aqueous solutions include adsorption reduction and active oxidation 55 according to the desorption experiment adsorption is considered as the main removal mechanism to further explore the removal mechanisms of 2 4 dcp by nzvi rgo sem xrd and ftir were used to analyses nzvi rgo 1 2 after reaction edx mapping exhibits the distribution of cl element in fig s1e confirming that 2 4 dcp molecules were adsorbed on the composites the spherical morphology of nzvi particles become blurred fig s1a due to the formation of oxidation shell and the adhesion of 2 4 dcp on the surface the xrd pattern of nzvi rgo 1 2 after reaction displayed in fig 9a determines the solid product phase formed in the process of removing 2 4 dcp the new diffraction peaks appear at 14 2 27 0 36 3 46 8 and 52 7 were attributed to the planes of 020 120 031 020 and 151 of iron oxyhydroxide γ feooh 56 and the diffraction peak at 62 6 corresponds to the 440 plane of fe3o4 which were demonstrate that the main aging product of nzvi is hydroxides instead of iron oxides in the ftir spectrum shown in fig 9b the peak of cc at 1617 cm 1 is obviously weakened indicating that it participates in the adsorption process which is probably related to the π π interaction between 2 4 dcp and the rgo surface 57 as previous researchers have proved that graphene based materials with rich π electrons have good adsorption effect on aromatic compounds through π π interaction 58 moreover the deformation of oh stretching vibration between 3000 and 3500 cm 1 after reaction could be assigned to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between 2 4 dcp molecule and the residual oxygen containing functional groups of rgo in conclusion the adsorption of 2 4 dcp by nzvi rgo is a single layer adsorption process dominated by chemical adsorption under the combined action of π π interaction and hydrogen bonding in addition there are two possible reasons for the absence of degradation products in the whole experiment 1 the ccl covalent bond on benzene ring is fully stable leading to it difficult to break 12 2 the crystalline iron oxide layer composed of γ feooh significantly limits the direct interaction between nzvi and pollutants 59 3 3 investigation of 2 4 dcp and cr vi simultaneous removal 3 3 1 simultaneous removal efficiency of 2 4 dcp and cr vi considering the occurrence of co contamination of organic and inorganic in actual situations the simultaneous removal behavior of 2 4 dcp and cr vi by nzvi rgo is further explored and illustrated in fig 10 in this study the time required for complete adsorption of 2 4 dcp has been extended to 20 min which is due to the competition of cr vi for adsorption sites but the removal efficiency of cr vi was significantly enhanced the results show that the removal efficiency of cr vi in the coexisting system is enhanced and the removal rate is close to 100 within 5 min this is because the electron deficient benzene ring and the electron rich chlorine group in 2 4 dcp structure can form a strong connection with cr vi through the n π electron donor acceptor n π eda interaction which well explains the higher removal efficiency of cr vi in the presence of 2 4 dcp and the absence of a separate removal process of cr vi additionally compared with the obvious fluctuation of the individual removal of cr vi the addition of 2 4 dcp in the coexistence system significantly enhanced the removal rate of cr vi without showing an intense adsorption desorption process which was due to the n π eda interaction between cr vi in the form of cro4 2 and the electron deficient benzene ring in 2 4 dcp and complexation between cationic cr iii and the electron rich chlorine group in 2 4 dcp on the other hand the main oxidation product in the process of adsorption of 2 4 dcp by nzvi rgo is γ feooh fig 9a and the functional group oh2 on the surface of γ feooh has been proved to have strong electrostatic attraction to cr vi 60 so it is speculated that the existence of γ feooh also promotes the adsorption of cr vi by nzvi rgo in the process of simultaneous removal subsequently cr vi accepts the electrons of nzvi are reduced to cr iii which is then adsorbed by negatively charged oxygen containing functional groups on rgo and cr oh 3 precipitate is generated through interaction with oh in the solution the desorption experiment of nzvi rgo after simultaneous removal showed that there is no degradation product of 2 4 dcp proving that the removal mechanism of 2 4 dcp in the process of simultaneous removal is still adsorption compared with the single pollution system the removal efficiency of 2 4 dcp in the coexisting pollution system was improved before 7 5 min which was due to the n π eda interaction between cr vi and 2 4 dcp also promoted the adsorption of 2 4 dcp with the accumulation of pollutants on the surface of composite materials the number of adsorption sites available for 2 4 dcp molecules decreased and the contact probability between 2 4 dcp and adsorption sites decreased resulting the reduced of removal efficiency so the time required for completely removing 2 4 dcp was extended to 20 min 3 3 2 characterization of nzvi rgo after simultaneous removal in order to further investigate another way xps and electrochemical experiment were used to analyze the composite after reaction in fig 11a the new peak of cl and cr appeared in the full scan after reaction meaning attachment of 2 4 dcp and cr vi with composites the high resolution xps spectra of fe 2p before and after reaction were shown in fig 11b the peak at 705 6 ev providing evidence that nzvi was successfully load in rgo nanosheets after reaction the iron state changes from fe 0 fe2 to fe3 demonstrating that iron species are greatly oxidized in the reaction process in the meantime the fe0 core was covered by oxide layer resulting the decrease of fe 0 binding energy as shown in fig 11c the peaks at binding energies of 586 3 and 576 6 ev are corresponded to the cr 2p3 2 and cr 2p1 2 orbits of cr iii revealing that cr vi was partially reduced to the less toxic cr iii by nzvi particles 61 thus we confirmed that cr vi was successfully reduced by nzvi particles the electron transfer capacity of nzvi and nzvi rgo was investigated by the analyses of tafel and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis on the electrochemical workstation chi 660e ch instruments usa the tafel polarization curves for nzvi and nzvi rgo 1 2 shown in fig 12a indicate that the corrosive potential of nzvi rgo 1 2 is more negative than bared nzvi nanoparticles meaning that the former has faster electron transfer rates 62 in the eis a larger diameter of the extrapolated semicircle in the high frequency represented a higher charge transfer resistance rct as shown in fig 12b the arc radius of nzvi rgo 1 2 was obviously smaller than nzvi indicating that the rct of nzvi rgo 1 2 was smaller which led to a higher transfer efficiency of electron 11 the results of eis are consistent with tafel analysis which suggests that rgo could enhance the rate of electrons transfer from nzvi electron donor to cr vi electron acceptor 3 3 3 mechanisms of simultaneous removal of 2 4 dcp and cr vi based on the above analysis the mechanism of simultaneous removal of 2 4 dcp and cr vi by nzvi rgo was shown in fig 13 the mechanism of 2 4 dcp in the process of simultaneous removal is still adsorption besides π π interaction and hydrogen bonding mentioned in section 3 2 6 n π eda interaction between cr vi and 2 4 dcp also promotes the removal of 2 4 dcp through the analysis of cr vi removal by different materials fig s2 and text s2 it can be concluded that the efficient removal of cr vi by nzvi rgo is the result of the synergy between rgo adsorption and nzvi adsorption reduction action in the coexisting system cr vi is quickly adsorbed on the surface of positively charged composite by electrostatic action the electrostatic attraction between γ feooh and cr vi and the strong connection formed by n π eda interaction between 2 4 dcp and cr vi further promote the adsorption of cr vi in the composite pollution system then cr vi is reduced to cr iii by accepting the electrons donated by nzvi and the presence of rgo accelerates the rate of electron transfer to cr vi in nzvi finally cr iii is adsorbed by negatively charged oxygen containing functional groups on rgo and cr oh 3 is generated through interaction with oh in the solution as shown in eq 4 4 cr 3 3 oh cr oh 3 4 conclusion in this work nzvi rgo was successfully synthesized via the liquid phase reduction method compared with pristine nzvi and rgo surface analyses show that the presence of rgo facilitates disperse of nzvi particles and prevent the rapid oxidation of nzvi kinetic and thermodynamic study showed that the removal process of 2 4 dcp by nzvi rgo is in good agreement with pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir models respectively recycle test results show that 2 4 dcp removal rate could be maintained 83 65 even after five cycles the removing experimental and characterization results of 2 4 dcp adsorption onto nzvi rgo display that the mechanism is contributed to the π π interaction and hydrogen bonding in the coexisting system the adsorption of 2 4 dcp was slightly suppressed while the removal of cr vi was significantly enhanced the mechanism of 2 4 dcp in the process of simultaneous removal is still adsorption including π π interaction hydrogen bonding and n π eda interaction between cr vi and 2 4 dcp cr vi was firstly fixed on the surface of nzvi rgo through electrostatic interaction the electrostatic attraction between γ feooh and cr vi and the strong connection formed by n π eda interaction between cr vi and 2 4 dcp promoted the adsorption of cr vi by the combined pollution system this study provides some valuable data for the practical application of nzvi rgo and indicates that this promising composite is worth exploring for compound pollution treatment in future work credit authorship contribution statement qi jing conceptualization methodology resources supervision writing

12689,in this study nano zero valent iron reduced graphene oxide nzvi rgo was successfully synthesized and applied for 2 4 dcp and cr vi removal characterization results show that nzvi particles were successfully loaded on rgo nanosheets increasing the dispersibility of particles removal experiments indicate that the existence of rgo significantly enhanced the removal efficiency of 2 4 dcp and cr vi compared with bare nano zero valent iron the removal rate of 2 4 dcp and cr vi increased from 33 24 and 63 14 to 100 and 98 40 respectively pseudo second order model and langmuir isotherm model could better explain the 2 4 dcp removal process the removal mechanism of 2 4 dcp in the process of simultaneous removal is adsorption including π π interaction hydrogen bonding and n π eda interaction between cr vi and 2 4 dcp cr vi is firstly fixed on the surface of nzvi rgo by electrostatic interaction the electrostatic interaction between γ feooh and cr vi and the strong connection formed by n π eda interaction between cr vi and 2 4 dcp promote the adsorption of cr vi in coexisting system subsequently cr vi is reduced to cr iii by accepting the electrons donated by nzvi and cr iii interacts with oh in the solution to generate cr oh 3 precipitate the existence of rgo accelerates the rate of electron transfer to cr vi in nzvi this study provides theoretical support for remediation of combined pollution of chlorinated organics and heavy metals keywords reduced graphene oxide nanometer zero valent iron 2 4 dichlorophenols chromium vi simultaneous removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the water pollution caused by organic contaminant is becoming one of a great threat to environment and human health at a global scale as hazardous intermediates various chlorophenols cps have been widely used in chemical industries such as paper making petroleum refineries herbicides phenolic resins and wood preservation 1 2 at the same time widespread use and improper disposal have led to an excessive accumulation of cps and made it become a priority pollutant of major environmental concern 3 cps with inherent high toxicity and carcinogenicity can easily be a threat to human health even at low concentration the fat solubility persistence difficult degradation of cps can also increase the difficulty of removal 4 therefore these pollutants must be removed before discharging into aqueous environment to avoid health and ecological problems nanometer zero valent iron nzvi a typical nanometer metal material was applied to remove heavy metals 5 6 organic pollutants 7 and dye 8 due to its large surface area and abundant active sites 8 however the largescale application of nzvi is limited by some defects including the aggregation caused by the magnetic attraction between particles 9 and the formation of oxide shell preventing the subsequent reactions 10 these negative impacts are usually meliorated by adopting these approaches 1 using polymer surfactant and other organic coatings for surface properties modification to improve the dispersion stability of nzvi in water 11 12 2 adding a secondary metal to form a bimetallic system to improve the reactivity of nzvi for organic pollutant degradation 13 3 applying inorganic material to support nanoparticles preventing aggregation 14 the last method not only retains the reactivity of nanoparticles but also taking advantages of the supporting materials thus optimizing the composite system to remove pollutants 15 in recent years graphene g and its derivatives including graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo have attracted extensive attention of scientists due to their unique physicochemical properties such as high surface area abundant oxygen containing functional groups 16 and exceptional electron transport characteristics 17 compared with other materials graphene and its derivatives exhibit more excellent adsorption property for water purification owing to their high theoretical specific surface area surface chemistry adjustability and diversity of used in various forms powder film suspension hydrogel or sponge 18 as a highly toxic metal pollutant chromium is commonly in the form of hexavalent chromium cr vi and trivalent chromium cr iii of which cr vi has been shown to be a serious hazard to human health and the environment 19 21 in addition the co existence of cr vi and 2 4 dcp are also found in tanning wastewater 22 23 and actual polluted sites 24 25 so it is necessary to concern the coexistent pollution of 2 4 dcp and cr vi in water in recent years some researchers used advanced oxidation technology to remove cr vi and 2 4 dcp in wastewater 26 27 however due to the strong quantum confinement effects qce the greatly increased band gap severely limits the practical application of photocatalysis 28 in order to improve the removal technology of cr vi and 2 4 dcp composite pollutants we used nzvi with high reactivity as reducing agent and rgo with rich oxygen containing functional groups and excellent electron transport ability as carrier of nzvi to construct nzvi rgo system it is expected that the agglomeration and passivation of nzvi can be effectively improved the conduction rate of electrons can be increased and the removal of cr vi and 2 4 dcp composite pollutants can be enhanced through adsorption and reduction in this study nzvi rgo was successfully synthesized by liquid phase reduction method and it was used to remove 2 4 dcp and cr vi from aqueous solution simultaneously the aims of this work are to 1 investigate 2 4 dcp removal behavior by nzvi rgo under various conditions mass ratio dosage 2 4 dcp concentration ph 2 evaluate the kinetics equilibrium isotherms and thermodynamics 3 explore the mechanism of 2 4 dcp and cr vi simultaneous removal 2 materials and method 2 1 materials and instruments all chemicals used in this

nanobrook 90plus brookhaven usa at different ph values 2 4 removal experiments all the removal experiments were carried out in 250 ml conical flask equipped with glass bottle stopper the conical flasks were placed in a thermostatic shaker bath with a rotation speed of 200 rpm at 298 k thermodynamic studies temperature is different to compare the removal performance of bare nzvi particles rgo and nzvi rgo 0 1 g sample was added into 100 ml of 2 4 dcp aqueous solution with a concentration of 10 0 mg l batch experiments analyze the effect of mass ratios of nzvi to rgo 2 1 1 1 1 2 nzvi rgo

for the 2 4 dcp concentration determined using hplc simultaneous removal test adopts the same method except that 10 mg l of 2 4dcp and 20 mg l cr vi are added to the solution at the same time the concentrations of cr vi were determined by a unico 2802s uv vis spectrophotometer using the diphenyl carbazide dpc method three parallel experiments were conducted in all removal experiments and the results were the average of three data the standard error of the mean value is represented by the error bar 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterizations 3 1 1 morphology characterizations the morphologies and nanoparticles distribution of the nzvi rgo and nzvi rgo with different ratios were characterized by using sem fig 1a shows that the bared nzvi nanoparticles were mostly spherical and concentrated together tightly into larger aggregates the wrinkled layers of rgo sheets could be easily observed in fig 1b which were associated with the huge specific surface area and abundant loading sites 33 according to fig 1c e with the increase of nzvi mass ratio the dispersion degree of nanoparticles gradually decreases due to the stronger van der waals attractive force and magnetic interaction between nanoparticles 34 this phenomenon is manifested in the specific surface area of table s1 the material as the mass ratio of nzvi decreases the specific surface area of the material gradually increases reaching 52 922 m2 g at nzvi rgo 1 2 as we know uniform dispersion is a key factor to improve the activity of nzvi 35 the corresponding results were obtained that the optimal mass ratio of nzvi to rgo is 1 2 where nzvi particles can be loaded in the interlayers of rgo sheets without aggregation the energy dispersive x ray edx elemental mapping in fig 1f was employed to explore the elemental distributions of the composite before reaction it can be clearly seen that graphene as a background material is uniformly covered by element fe which is in good agreement with the results of sem fig 1e in addition the element o mapping for nzvi rgo confirms that the existence of residual oxygen containing functional groups 3 1 2 analyses of crystalline structure fig 2 shows the xrd patterns of go rgo nzvi and nzvi rgo 1 2 the intense peak at 10 5 of go pattern was attributed to the 001 crystalline plane of go corresponding to an interlayer spacing of 0 84 nm 36 after reduction this peak became invisible and a new broad diffraction peak appeared at 24 0 relating to the 0 37 nm interlayer spacing which is lesser than that of go due to the removal of most oxygen containing functional groups during reduction process the presence of diffraction peaks at 2θ of 35 4 and 57 2 with weak intensity in the xrd patterns of nzvi was corresponded to the planes of 311 and 511 fe3o4 which due to the surface slight oxidation for the nzvi rgo composites there were two apparent peaks at 24 0 and 44 7 attributed to the 110 plane of fe0 and 002 plane of rgo 37 38 respectively this phenomenon confirmed that nzvi nanoparticles were successfully loaded at rgo nanosheets and no obvious reflection peaks of iron oxide observed proving that rgo could avoid nzvi particles from rapid surface oxidation 3 1 3 functional groups and chemical bonds fig 3 shows the ftir spectra of go rgo and nzvi rgo 1 2 for go the broad band between 3000 and 3600 cm 1 represented oh stretching modes 36 and other bands at 1731 1634 1400 and 1119 cm 1 illustrate the presence of co stretching vibration aromatic cc skeletal vibration 39 carboxyl o c o bonds 36 and oh deformation vibrations 40 respectively in the rgo spectrum the intensity of above mentioned bands had been weakened to an extent confirming that the oxygen containing functional groups in the go were effectively reduced while the remain oxygen containing groups on nzvi rgo perhaps are in favor of the hydrogen bond interaction 41 compared with go the band at 483 and 621 cm 1 of nzvi rgo 1 2 assigned to the appearance of feo bond generated by the weak surface oxidation of nzvi indicating that nzvi particles successfully embedded in the reduced graphene oxide 39 42 3 2 investigation of 2 4 dcp removal 3 2 1 removal efficiency of 2 4 dcp using various materials and effects of nzvi rgo dosage fig 4a shows the removal efficiency of 2 4 dcp by rgo nzvi and nzvi rgo at different mass ratios of nzvi to rgo including 2 1 1 1 1 2 as a function of contact time the removal rate order for 2 4 dcp was nzvi rgo 1 2 nzvi rgo 1 1 nzvi rgo 2 1 nzvi rgo it is worth noting that no degradation products of 2 4 dcp detected during the removal process such as 2 chlorophenol 2 cp 4 chlorophenol 4 cp and phenol p which were detected in our previous research 43 desorption experiment was conducted in 0 1 mol l naoh solution for 120 min to analyze the composition of composites surface after reaction the result is only 2 4 dcp was detected proving that there was no degradation process the rapid removal rate also indicates that adsorption play a dominant role rather than the dechlorination reaction since the latter would take much longer time therefore adsorption is particularly important in the removal of 2 4 dcp by nzvi rgo compared with rgo nzvi rgo has a better specific surface area table s1 and can provide more adsorption sites for 2 4 dcp the processes involved in 2 4 dcp removal by bare nzvi were a combination of adsorption and reduction as its agglomeration and passivation as well as its low specific surface area limit its efficient reduction and strong adsorption of 2 4 dcp in particular the nzvi rgo 1 2 can completely remove 2 4 dcp within 10 min due to its maximum specific surface area therefore the best sample nzvi rgo 1 2 is selected for further adsorption experiments hereinafter referred to as nzvi rgo the 2 4 dcp removal performance of nzvi rgo for different dosages in the range of 0 25 1 50 g l is described in fig 4b and it is obvious that the removal rate of 2 4 dcp increases and the equilibrium removal time shortens with the rise of nzvi rgo dosage the removal rate reached 78 after 4 h when the nzvi rgo dosage was 0 25 g l and 2 4 dcp could be completely removed in 3 h when the dosage of nzvi rgo is 0 50 g l when the nzvi rgo dosage increased to 1 00 g l 2 4 dcp could be completely removed within 10 min this is because with the rise of nzvi rgo dosage the number of adsorption sites increases and the contact probability between the composite and 2 4 dcp becomes larger thus greatly improving the 2 4 dcp removal efficiency 3 2 2 effect of solution ph and analysis of zeta potential solution ph is recognized as an important controlling factor which affects the adsorption behavior by changing the surface charge of composites 44 the effect of solution ph on 2 4 dcp adsorption was assessed and the results were illustrated in fig 5a from ph 3 to 11 the removal rate decreased with the increasing ph which indicated an acidic environment favored 2 4 dcp removal by the nzvi rgo zeta potential as a physical parameter showing the surface charge of solid particles is measured to further explore the adsorption process 45 it can be seen from fig 5b that nzvi altered the surface charge property of rgo the point of the zero potential of nzvi rgo is approximately ph 9 01 which means that when the ph exceeds this value the surface of the material is converted into electronegativity this phenomenon is highly consistent with the results of removal experiments when ph is from 3 to 9 the 2 4 dcp can be completely removed within 20 min while the time was greatly prolonged under the condition that the ph is 11 several reasons can be suggested for the higher removal efficiency one is that the acidic conditions accelerate the corrosion of iron oxides precipitates 46 whereas under alkaline condition the passivating film of nzvi is easily formed inhibiting contacts between the target contaminant and the reactive sites of composites 47 another possible reason is that the negative surface charge of nzvi rgo leads to the electrostatic repulsion with the anionic forms of 2 4 dcp which would be mainly exist in anionic forms when the solution ph exceeds pka 7 83 48 however the removal rate of 2 4 dcp can reach 100 at any ph as shown in fig 4a because the target pollutant content is low so it can be completely removed by prolonging the reaction time under unfavorable conditions 3 2 3 adsorption kinetics study fig 6a depicts the changes of adsorption rate with contact time at different 2 4 dcp initial concentrations when the adsorbent is 1 0 g l it can be observed that the removal process could be completed during the first 10 min when the 2 4 dcp concentration is lower than 10 mg l when the 2 4 dcp initial concentration was increased to 20 mg l the reaction time was extended to 3 h and when the 2 4 dcp initial concentration was further promotion to 40 mg l the removal efficiency is decreased to 90 the insufficient adsorption sites are the major reason leading to a slow adsorption rate in the latter stage 49 adsorption kinetics can describe the adsorption process and provide information on the adsorption mechanism 50 in this study pseudo first order and pseudo second order were applied to evaluate the 2 4 dcp adsorption kinetics by nzvi rgo the fitting results of each model are shown in fig 6 and the kinetic parameters for adsorption are listed in table 1 it is apparent in fig 6 that the pseudo second order kinetic model can better coincide with the experimental data which can also be confirmed by the higher determination r2 0 9988 moreover the equilibrium adsorption capability qe calculated by the pseudo second order model is closer to the experimental data providing further evidence for the above conclusion this result indicates that the adsorption of 2 4 dcp onto nzvi rgo was dominated by chemical adsorption it is similar to some previous reports about the removal of 2 4 dcp using activated carbon fiber 51 and the adsorption of cps onto graphene 52 3 2 4 adsorption isotherms study the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe of nzvi rgo shows an upward tendency with the increase of the 2 4 dcp initial concentration 20 120 mg l at different temperature is exhibited in fig 7a it is due to the driving force for transportation from solution to the adsorbents increases with the increase of contaminant concentration thus promoting the adsorption of more 2 4 dcp 53 qe were calculated by using the following equation 1 q e c 0 c e v m where c0 and ce mg l are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of 2 4 dcp respectively v l is the total volume of the reaction solution and m g the weight of the composites the adsorption isotherm data obtained at 288 298 and 308 k were fitted to the langmuir and freundlich models the langmuir theory assumes that adsorption takes place at specific homogeneous sites on the surface of the adsorbent and once adsorbate molecule occupies a site no further adsorption can take place at that site while the freundlich isotherm model is generally describes the adsorption on the surface of the heterogeneous medium 53 the non linear langmuir and freundlich equation are represented as follows 2 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m 3 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where qe is the adsorption amount mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbates mg l kl ml mg is the constant qm is the saturation capacity mg g kf is freundlich adsorption rate constant mg g 1 l mg 1 1 n n is a constant related to adsorption intensity the fitted line in fig 7b and c and the higher value of r2 in table 2 suggest that the data were better fitted in the langmuir isotherm model confirming the single molecular layer adsorption value of qm was calculated as 40 49 mg g at 308 k to further understand the interaction between 2 4 dichlorophenol and nzvi rgo the thermodynamic parameters are calculated text s1 and summarized in table 3 for further analysis the negative δg value at each temperature suggests that the adsorption process is spontaneous the positive δh and δs values indicate that the adsorption process is endothermic and in the direction of increasing degrees of freedom 54 moreover the δg decreases with the increase of temperature indicating that high temperature is more beneficial to the adsorption of 2 4 dcp which consistent with the adsorption results in fig 7a 3 2 5 reusability of nzvi rgo recyclability is of great significance for its application in practical engineering which not only reduces the cost but also is its environmental friendliness according to section 3 2 2 the adsorption efficiency of 2 4 dcp on nzvi rgo decreased significantly when the solution is alkaline thus we using 0 1 mol l naoh as the eluent it can be observed in fig 8 that the removal rate of 2 4 dcp slightly descend in the cycling the main reasons include the residue of pollutants on the surface of composites and the inevitable loss of composites in the process of reuse but the removal rate could still be maintained 83 65 even after five cycles 3 2 6 possible removal mechanism of 2 4 dcp the possible removal mechanisms of organic pollutants by either nzvi or nzvi based composites from aqueous solutions include adsorption reduction and active oxidation 55 according to the desorption experiment adsorption is considered as the main removal mechanism to further explore the removal mechanisms of 2 4 dcp by nzvi rgo sem xrd and ftir were used to analyses nzvi rgo 1 2 after reaction edx mapping exhibits the distribution of cl element in fig s1e confirming that 2 4 dcp molecules were adsorbed on the composites the spherical morphology of nzvi particles become blurred fig s1a due to the formation of oxidation shell and the adhesion of 2 4 dcp on the surface the xrd pattern of nzvi rgo 1 2 after reaction displayed in fig 9a determines the solid product phase formed in the process of removing 2 4 dcp the new diffraction peaks appear at 14 2 27 0 36 3 46 8 and 52 7 were attributed to the planes of 020 120 031 020 and 151 of iron oxyhydroxide γ feooh 56 and the diffraction peak at 62 6 corresponds to the 440 plane of fe3o4 which were demonstrate that the main aging product of nzvi is hydroxides instead of iron oxides in the ftir spectrum shown in fig 9b the peak of cc at 1617 cm 1 is obviously weakened indicating that it participates in the adsorption process which is probably related to the π π interaction between 2 4 dcp and the rgo surface 57 as previous researchers have proved that graphene based materials with rich π electrons have good adsorption effect on aromatic compounds through π π interaction 58 moreover the deformation of oh stretching vibration between 3000 and 3500 cm 1 after reaction could be assigned to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between 2 4 dcp molecule and the residual oxygen containing functional groups of rgo in conclusion the adsorption of 2 4 dcp by nzvi rgo is a single layer adsorption process dominated by chemical adsorption under the combined action of π π interaction and hydrogen bonding in addition there are two possible reasons for the absence of degradation products in the whole experiment 1 the ccl covalent bond on benzene ring is fully stable leading to it difficult to break 12 2 the crystalline iron oxide layer composed of γ feooh significantly limits the direct interaction between nzvi and pollutants 59 3 3 investigation of 2 4 dcp and cr vi simultaneous removal 3 3 1 simultaneous removal efficiency of 2 4 dcp and cr vi considering the occurrence of co contamination of organic and inorganic in actual situations the simultaneous removal behavior of 2 4 dcp and cr vi by nzvi rgo is further explored and illustrated in fig 10 in this study the time required for complete adsorption of 2 4 dcp has been extended to 20 min which is due to the competition of cr vi for adsorption sites but the removal efficiency of cr vi was significantly enhanced the results show that the removal efficiency of cr vi in the coexisting system is enhanced and the removal rate is close to 100 within 5 min this is because the electron deficient benzene ring and the electron rich chlorine group in 2 4 dcp structure can form a strong connection with cr vi through the n π electron donor acceptor n π eda interaction which well explains the higher removal efficiency of cr vi in the presence of 2 4 dcp and the absence of a separate removal process of cr vi additionally compared with the obvious fluctuation of the individual removal of cr vi the addition of 2 4 dcp in the coexistence system significantly enhanced the removal rate of cr vi without showing an intense adsorption desorption process which was due to the n π eda interaction between cr vi in the form of cro4 2 and the electron deficient benzene ring in 2 4 dcp and complexation between cationic cr iii and the electron rich chlorine group in 2 4 dcp on the other hand the main oxidation product in the process of adsorption of 2 4 dcp by nzvi rgo is γ feooh fig 9a and the functional group oh2 on the surface of γ feooh has been proved to have strong electrostatic attraction to cr vi 60 so it is speculated that the existence of γ feooh also promotes the adsorption of cr vi by nzvi rgo in the process of simultaneous removal subsequently cr vi accepts the electrons of nzvi are reduced to cr iii which is then adsorbed by negatively charged oxygen containing functional groups on rgo and cr oh 3 precipitate is generated through interaction with oh in the solution the desorption experiment of nzvi rgo after simultaneous removal showed that there is no degradation product of 2 4 dcp proving that the removal mechanism of 2 4 dcp in the process of simultaneous removal is still adsorption compared with the single pollution system the removal efficiency of 2 4 dcp in the coexisting pollution system was improved before 7 5 min which was due to the n π eda interaction between cr vi and 2 4 dcp also promoted the adsorption of 2 4 dcp with the accumulation of pollutants on the surface of composite materials the number of adsorption sites available for 2 4 dcp molecules decreased and the contact probability between 2 4 dcp and adsorption sites decreased resulting the reduced of removal efficiency so the time required for completely removing 2 4 dcp was extended to 20 min 3 3 2 characterization of nzvi rgo after simultaneous removal in order to further investigate another way xps and electrochemical experiment were used to analyze the composite after reaction in fig 11a the new peak of cl and cr appeared in the full scan after reaction meaning attachment of 2 4 dcp and cr vi with composites the high resolution xps spectra of fe 2p before and after reaction were shown in fig 11b the peak at 705 6 ev providing evidence that nzvi was successfully load in rgo nanosheets after reaction the iron state changes from fe 0 fe2 to fe3 demonstrating that iron species are greatly oxidized in the reaction process in the meantime the fe0 core was covered by oxide layer resulting the decrease of fe 0 binding energy as shown in fig 11c the peaks at binding energies of 586 3 and 576 6 ev are corresponded to the cr 2p3 2 and cr 2p1 2 orbits of cr iii revealing that cr vi was partially reduced to the less toxic cr iii by nzvi particles 61 thus we confirmed that cr vi was successfully reduced by nzvi particles the electron transfer capacity of nzvi and nzvi rgo was investigated by the analyses of tafel and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis on the electrochemical workstation chi 660e ch instruments usa the tafel polarization curves for nzvi and nzvi rgo 1 2 shown in fig 12a indicate that the corrosive potential of nzvi rgo 1 2 is more negative than bared nzvi nanoparticles meaning that the former has faster electron transfer rates 62 in the eis a larger diameter of the extrapolated semicircle in the high frequency represented a higher charge transfer resistance rct as shown in fig 12b the arc radius of nzvi rgo 1 2 was obviously smaller than nzvi indicating that the rct of nzvi rgo 1 2 was smaller which led to a higher transfer efficiency of electron 11 the results of eis are consistent with tafel analysis which suggests that rgo could enhance the rate of electrons transfer from nzvi electron donor to cr vi electron acceptor 3 3 3 mechanisms of simultaneous removal of 2 4 dcp and cr vi based on the above analysis the mechanism of simultaneous removal of 2 4 dcp and cr vi by nzvi rgo was shown in fig 13 the mechanism of 2 4 dcp in the process of simultaneous removal is still adsorption besides π π interaction and hydrogen bonding mentioned in section 3 2 6 n π eda interaction between cr vi and 2 4 dcp also promotes the removal of 2 4 dcp through the analysis of cr vi removal by different materials fig s2 and text s2 it can be concluded that the efficient removal of cr vi by nzvi rgo is the result of the synergy between rgo adsorption and nzvi adsorption reduction action in the coexisting system cr vi is quickly adsorbed on the surface of positively charged composite by electrostatic action the electrostatic attraction between γ feooh and cr vi and the strong connection formed by n π eda interaction between 2 4 dcp and cr vi further promote the adsorption of cr vi in the composite pollution system then cr vi is reduced to cr iii by accepting the electrons donated by nzvi and the presence of rgo accelerates the rate of electron transfer to cr vi in nzvi finally cr iii is adsorbed by negatively charged oxygen containing functional groups on rgo and cr oh 3 is generated through interaction with oh in the solution as shown in eq 4 4 cr 3 3 oh cr oh 3 4 conclusion in this work nzvi rgo was successfully synthesized via the liquid phase reduction method compared with pristine nzvi and rgo surface analyses show that the presence of rgo facilitates disperse of nzvi particles and prevent the rapid oxidation of nzvi kinetic and thermodynamic study showed that the removal process of 2 4 dcp by nzvi rgo is in good agreement with pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir models respectively recycle test results show that 2 4 dcp removal rate could be maintained 83 65 even after five cycles the removing experimental and characterization results of 2 4 dcp adsorption onto nzvi rgo display that the mechanism is contributed to the π π interaction and hydrogen bonding in the coexisting system the adsorption of 2 4 dcp was slightly suppressed while the removal of cr vi was significantly enhanced the mechanism of 2 4 dcp in the process of simultaneous removal is still adsorption including π π interaction hydrogen bonding and n π eda interaction between cr vi and 2 4 dcp cr vi was firstly fixed on the surface of nzvi rgo through electrostatic interaction the electrostatic attraction between γ feooh and cr vi and the strong connection formed by n π eda interaction between cr vi and 2 4 dcp promoted the adsorption of cr vi by the combined pollution system this study provides some valuable data for the practical application of nzvi rgo and indicates that this promising composite is worth exploring for compound pollution treatment in future work credit authorship contribution statement qi jing conceptualization methodology resources supervision writing
