6770,subsidence and ground uplift are phenomena that may have natural or anthropogenic origin and cause strong socioeconomic and environmental impacts especially in urban areas in this paper the coupling between ground uplift and groundwater rebound in a complex multi layered aquifer system in the metropolitan city of naples southern italy has been investigated by an integrated use of hydrogeological and dinsar monitoring data covering the periods 1989 2013 and 1993 2010 respectively the spatio temporal evolution of natural ground deformation following the strong reduction and interruption of groundwater pumping has been analysed hydrogeological monitoring data have shown large scale groundwater rebound with the highest amplitude of approximately 16 m and a groundwater rising velocity up to approximately 1 0 m yr dinsar data show a general ground uplift with a magnitude of approximately 40 mm on average except for the southern sector of the study area where some local natural and human induced subsidence has been identified a comparison between trends of groundwater level and ground displacement indicates that the ground uplift is linked to a poro elastic rebound mechanism in the porous aquifer system which is triggered by the increase of pore pressure while the rate of ground displacement is controlled by the hydrostratigraphic characteristics of the multi layered aquifer system the results improve the knowledge of man induced deformation in complex urban aquifers affected by groundwater rebound and highlight that the implementation of an appropriate hydro mechanical deformation model is a necessary step to correctly model and manage a new geohazard in a highly urbanized environment keywords groundwater rebound aquifer deformation

szostak chrzanowski and chrzanowski 2014 galloway et al 2016 the measurement and study of which have been strongly fostered in recent decades by satellite interferometric techniques among the wide range of land deformation types vertical displacement of the ground related to human induced variations of groundwater levels can be considered as a major threat to urbanized areas and an additional effect of inefficient aquifer management le mouélic et al 2002 teatini et al 2005 gambolati et al 2005 ishitsuka et al 2014 such phenomena usually involving wide areas can lead to heavy socioeconomic and environmental impacts especially if affecting urbanized and coastal areas where structures and infrastructure can be damaged even more by flood and seawater intrusion abidin et al 2001 teatini et al 2005 phienwej et al 2006 aldiss et al 2014 kusaka et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 in these cases stopping groundwater overexploitation can result in groundwater rebound which depending on the type of aquifer and water table depth can trigger ground uplift colombo et al 2017 in such a case madrid aquifer ezquerro et al 2014 santa clara valley chaussard et al 2017 characterized by multiphase materials the coupling between pore fluid and the soil skeleton can be considered elastic thus respecting the basic model first proposed by biot 1941 consequences on built up areas can be unpredictably severe if the cause effect mechanisms have not been previously analysed by means of hydrogeological giudici et al 2000 teatini et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 gattinoni and scesi 2017 and geotechnical models tomàs et al 2011 tessitore et al 2015 chaussard et al 2017 pujades et al 2017 therefore especially in shallow porous aquifers integrated and effective monitoring of groundwater level and ground deformation is essential to manage inherent hazards and risks several studies have dealt with the importance of integrated monitoring to correctly analyse the effects of groundwater level variations on ground vertical movements e g king et al 2007 jacob et al 2010 amoruso et al 2014 which also hinged on satellite based insar deformation measurements galloway and hoffmann 2007 herrera et al 2009 cigna et al 2012 modoni et al 2013 tessitore et al 2016 béjar et al 2016 boni et al 2016 notti et al 2016 fiaschi et al 2017 mateos et al 2017 in this framework satellite technologies give breakthrough advantages as compared to in situ measurements allowing scientists to accomplish regional scale mapping and monitoring of ground deformation with lower costs tomás et al 2014 in addition satellite technologies turn out to be very useful in knowing the spatial extent and the temporal development of the phenomenon in the present work ground uplift and groundwater rebound due to strong reduction of groundwater exploitation of a multi layered porous shallow aquifer system have been identified for the first time as affecting two municipalities of the metropolitan city of naples italy the study has been based on a coupled analysis of multi temporal hydrogeological and differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar dinsar data covering the periods of 1989 2013 and 1993 2010 respectively hydrogeological characteristic and groundwater level evolution in this area have been widely studied during the last couple decades allocca and celico 2008 2010 allocca et al 2016 the principal outcome of these studies has been the recognition of a gradual recovery of piezometric levels since 1990 which was caused by a drastic reduction of groundwater exploitation ended in 1989 of the pyroclastic alluvial aquifer allocca and celico 2008 since 2007 the aftermath of this groundwater rebound has caused serious problems with groundwater flooding of agricultural soils and underground structures infrastructures allocca et al 2016 such as basements underground parks and subway tunnels which were built while considering the preceding phase of low groundwater level the hydrogeological dataset available for the 1989 2013 period has been used to obtain high resolution multi temporal mapping of the groundwater levels and circulation patterns as well as time lapse piezometric head increase and rising velocity maps dinsar data covering the monitoring periods of 1993 2000 and 2002 2010 were processed through a ps insar technique ferretti et al 2000 in the framework of the italian first not ordinary plan of environmental remote sensing project costabile 2010 such data have been used to obtain cumulative ground deformation maps for the aforementioned periods that can be compared with groundwater level variations in this paper a hydrogeologically based interpretation of the ground deformation measurements will be presented demonstrating that i the ground uplift is consistently correlated to the spatial and temporal evolution of groundwater rebound and ii local patterns of vertical ground movement diverging from the general uplift trend are controlled by other anthropogenic and natural processes the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the hydrogeological characteristics of the study area and temporal evolution of groundwater pumping and recovery phases section 3 shows the monitoring time series used for the analysis and the methods applied whereas the section 4 exposes the results obtained finally in sections 5 and 6 the discussion and conclusions are presented respectively 2 description of the study area 2 1 geological and hydrogeological setting the study area approximately 14 30 km2 is located east of naples fig 1 a and c and encompasses the casalnuovo di napoli and volla municipalities approximately 75 000 inhabitants live in this urban area reaching a mean population density of approximately 5 240 inhabitants km2 from a geological point of view fig 1a the study area is located in the south central sector of the campanian plain a large alluvial plain formed in the pliocene pleistocene by the filling of a regional semi graben structural depression which originated along the western side of the southern apennines during the opening of the tyrrhenian sea patacca et al 1990 in detail the study area is delimited to the west by the phlegraean fields volcanic system to the east by the carbonate massif of avella pizzo d alvano and to the south by somma vesuvius volcano fig 1a the deep structural setting is characterized by a subsiding tectonic depression the sebeto valley set on quaternary active faults bellucci 1994 1998 cinque et al 2011 lanari et al 2002 such as the deeply buried magnaghi sebeto fault zone magnaghi sebeto fz and the deeply buried faults on the northern edge of somma vesuvius volcano fig 1a and b locally these fault systems trending ne sw and nw se engender one of the most seismically active fault zones in the neapolitan area moreover they give rise to an extensional tectonic stress field and gravitational sliding around the base of the somma vesuvius edifice fig 1a and 1b as evidence of ground deformation processes from seismological mesostructural interferometric petrochemical and micropalaeontological data show bianco et al 1998 bruno et al 1998 2003 cinque et al 2000 lanari et al 2002 marturano et al 2013 starting from 300 ka rolandi et al 2003 intense volcanic activity occurred across the plain with the formation of the phlegraean fields and somma vesuvius volcano in the last 25 000 years in addition to the deposition of volcaniclastic products further sedimentation and erosional processes led to the filling of the structural depression with several thousands of metres of alluvial marine and fluvio palustrine sediments bellucci 1994 according to the updated geological data ispra 2014 outcroppings of four different hydrogeological complexes have been identified fig 2 a holocene pyroclastic fluvial sediments pf in the northern sector ash fall pyroclastic deposits p dated at 39 3 39 8 ka in the north central sector holocene pyroclastic alluvial marine and palustrine sediments pap as well as late holocene volcanic and alluvial deposits va in the south central and southern sectors fig 2a furthermore the northern and north central sectors fig 2a are characterized by a low permeability tuff horizon corresponding to the campanian ignimbrite ci in a zeolitized yellow facies dated to 39 28 0 11 ka de vivo et al 2001 this tuff horizon does not outcrop in the area being only recognizable by boreholes bellucci 1994 allocca et al 2016 from whose data the tuff horizon has been reconstructed and show it as being spatially discontinuous with a thickness variable up to 40 m fig 2b specifically in the south central and southern sectors of the study area fig 2a the ci is absent due to the erosion by the paleo sebeto river and is locally substituted by silt and clayey deposits as well as lenses of peat and volcanic rocks fig 2b from a geomorphological point of view the study area ranges in altitude from 12 to 45 m a s l and is characterized by a flat morphology slightly sloping towards the course of the sebeto river known since historical times for supplying the ancient greek roman bolla aqueduct that fed the city of naples celico et al 1995 according to results from previous hydrogeological studies celico 1983 bellucci et al 1990 celico et al 1994 allocca et al 2007 2016 allocca and celico 2008 de vita et al 2018 the study area is overall characterized by a porous multi layered aquifer system formed by a very complex lateral and vertical stratigraphic juxtaposition of volcaniclastic and alluvial deposits fig 2a and b in the northern and north central sectors of the study area fig 2a the aquifer system consists of a shallow unconfined aquifer formed by volcaniclastic and alluvial deposits younger than the ci deposit and by a deep semi confined pyroclastic alluvial aquifer underling the ci horizon fig 2a and b instead in the south central and southern sectors fig 2a due to the lack of ci deposits the aquifer system is characterized by a unique groundwater circulation flow within the laterally discontinuous pyroclastic alluvial bodies with a prevailing sandy grain size in these sectors groundwater flow can be only confined at a local scale by lower permeability lenses of clayey sands clayey silts and peat fig 2b despite these heterogeneities in the aquifer system groundwater circulation can be considered unitary at a basin scale fig 1c behaving as a part of the regional groundwater circulation occurring in the pyroclastic alluvial aquifer of the campania plain sector eastward of naples the aquifer system is recharged by direct effective infiltration assessed to be approximately 300 mm year bellucci et al 1990 allocca and celico 2008 allocca et al 2014 by lateral groundwater flow coming from the adjoining aquifer sector the groundwater basin of which extends up to the carbonate avella pizzo d alvano and volcanic somma vesuvius aquifers fig 1c in the study area the principle land use classes corine land cover 2012 are urbanized zones covering approximately 65 of the territory and agricultural lands extending over the rest 35 2 2 trends in groundwater exploitation since post world war ii times groundwater resources in the pyroclastic alluvial aquifer of the plain sector east of naples have been used for supplying drinking water agriculture and industry needs the most important tapping location is the lufrano well field which was developed at the end of the 1940s consisting of approximately 150 wells subsequently in the 1970s and 1990s the ponticelli and acerra well fields were also built respectively figs 1c and 2a during the same period the number of wells for industrial and agricultural uses increased rapidly reaching a density of up to approximately 90 100 wells km2 celico et al 1994 during the 1950 1989 period due to continued strong population growth salvati 2014 and industrial development in the metropolitan city of naples mazzeo 2009 an intense use of groundwater resources by public and private wells occurred with massive pumping of up to 6 0 m3 s of which approximately 4 0 m3 s was for drinking water use see fig 3 which determined a deficit in the mean annual water budget of the pyroclastic alluvial aquifer of approximately 2 65 m3 s allocca and celico 2008 this mismanagement of groundwater resources caused the following i overexploitation of the pyroclastic alluvial aquifer with a rapid decline of the groundwater level up to 16 m which ended in 1989 fig 3 allocca and celico 2008 and ii a deterioration of groundwater quality due to the increase of nitrate fluoride iron and manganese concentrations which even exceeded acceptable drinking water standards celico et al 1994 1997 esposito 1998 because of such groundwater quality deterioration and the high cost of treatment to match drinking water standards the well fields of lufrano acerra and ponticelli figs 1c and 2a were partially abandoned moreover groundwater withdrawals have also been drastically reduced or interrupted because of the processes of deindustrialization and land use change from agricultural land to urbanized areas allocca and celico 2010 as a consequence starting from 1990 a continuous groundwater rebound has occurred inside the pyroclastic alluvial aquifer of the plain east of naples which has been observed allocca and celico 2008 allocca et al 2016 either at the whole groundwater basin or local scale with rising groundwater levels of up to approximately 16 m the recovery of groundwater levels to the conditions preceding the strong overexploitation phase 1946 1989 had been overlooked until 2007 when the first relevant hydrogeological impacts began affecting structures and infrastructures in the study area which were designed and constructed in consideration of artificially lowered water table levels these impacts were noticed in different zones in the plain east of naples as groundwater flooding events occurring in the winter and spring seasons and affecting basements railway tunnels and other underground structures in recent years the further rising of groundwater levels has worsened impacts involving groundwater flooding of agricultural lands and archaeological sites allocca and celico 2008 allocca et al 2016 groundwater flooding events display wide heterogeneous temporal spatial distribution since they are affected by natural and anthropogenic factors allocca et al 2016 and represent a new hydrogeological risk that is not adequately considered by local authorities and national legislation 3 data and methods 3 1 hydrogeological data stratigraphic data from 86 boreholes fig 2a with depths variable between 10 and 60 m table 1 were collected and filed into a geographical information system platform to reconstruct a 2d hydrostratigraphic model of the aquifer system fig 2b hydraulic conductivity was estimated for each stratigraphic interval of all boreholes with freeze and cherry 1979 empirical relationships which are based on grain size for porous aquifers and lithology for rock aquifers allocca et al 2018 moreover the role of the aquifer or aquitard aquiclude was assigned to each sediment lithofacies and geological formation piezometric measurements have been carried out in wells and boreholes during a long term monitoring period from 1989 to 2013 table 1 in particular piezometric data from 1989 to 2003 were collected during field surveys carried out by private companies public agencies and researchers and then published in scientific or technical papers celico and de paola 1992 esposito 1998 autorità di bacino regionale nord occidentale della campania 2004 the most recent hydrogeological data from 2013 came from a field measurement campaign carried out on approximately 130 wells fig 4 d by a research project developed under an agreement signed by the casalnuovo di napoli and volla municipalities allocca et al 2016 furthermore annual rainfall data recorded by the rain gauge station at the san marcellino meteorological observatory were collected from 1946 to 2013 table 1 the hydrostratigraphic and hydrogeological database has been managed in a qgis environment allowing the reconstruction of multi temporal maps of groundwater level groundwater level change mean velocity of groundwater level rise and groundwater circulation models by the kriging geostatistical method oliver and webster 1990 the following outcomes have been created i four water table contour maps fig 4 ii two maps of the spatio temporal variation of the piezometric head fig 6a and b and iii two maps of the mean velocity of groundwater level rise fig 6c and d the piezometric head variation maps δh m were reconstructed by overlapping piezometric data for the years 1989 2002 and 2013 starting from these datasets the two maps of spatio temporal variation of the piezometric head have been calculated by a respective comparison of 2002 with 1989 and 2013 with 2002 data then maps of groundwater rise velocity m yr were generated by dividing the piezometric head variation observed in each of the two time spans by the time lapse of each period fig 4 shows groundwater level evolution in the study area for the period of 1989 2013 in 1989 fig 4a due to strong groundwater withdrawal of up to 5 6 m3 s allocca and celico 2008 the water table suffered a strong piezometric lowering reaching values as low as 2 0 m below sea level and a deviation of the groundwater flow directions oriented towards the lufrano well field figs 1c and 2a since 1990 as consequence of a drastic reduction in groundwater pumping a gradual rise of the piezometric level began allocca and celico 2008 allocca et al 2016 which is clearly recognizable on the groundwater level maps of 1994 and 2002 fig 4b and c the rising groundwater level continued until 2013 the map from that year fig 4d is well comparable with those related to the beginning of the last century allocca and celico 2008 allocca et al 2016 when no groundwater pumping was being carried out showing an almost complete recovery of groundwater levels moreover the piezometric contour pattern shows that groundwater circulation converges towards the drainage axis represented by the sebeto river and its tributaries cozzone and volla rivers see fig 2 3 2 dinsar data dinsar data consist of ground deformation measurements for each satellite acquisition date projected along the line of sight los direction which allows displacement maps profiles and time series ts to be produced in the present work sar data gathered and processed by the italian first not ordinary plan of environmental remote sensing project have been used under a specific agreement with the italian ministry of environment mattm specifically 139 images taken by the ers 1 2 67 and 72 images in ascending and descending geometry respectively and 92 by the envisat satellite 52 and 40 images in ascending and descending geometry respectively covering the monitoring periods of 1992 2000 and 2002 2010 table 2 were processed through the ps insar technique ferretti et al 2000 a cumulative los projected displacement varying between 100 mm and 50 mm 1993 2000 and between 120 mm and 40 mm 2002 2010 was measured table 2 dinsar mean velocity maps are shown in fig 5 where for the 1993 2000 period a general uplift approximately 1 6 1 1 mm yr on average in the northern sector of the area and an extended subsidence in the southern one approximately 3 12 mm yr on average were observed then for the second observation period 2002 2010 a drop in the displacement rates for both sectors was observed specifically the maximum uplift rate projected along the los of approximately 1 cm year detected in the first monitoring window by ers satellite decreased by approximately 50 in the second time span as is also confirmed by the envisat measurements a small area affected by a localized subsidence with a maximum mean rate of 12 4 mm year was also recognized in the 2002 2010 period fig 5c and d 4 results 4 1 groundwater rebound assessment post pumping groundwater level increments δh fig 6 a and b and groundwater rise velocity maps v fig 6c and d have been reconstructed the results show that groundwater rebound following the interruption of pumping was widespread throughout the study area in the period from 1989 to 2013 in particular for the 1989 2002 period phase 1 in fig 6a the water table showed a general rise although spatially variable ranging from a minimum of 0 5 m to a maximum of 14 0 m the groundwater rebound with the highest magnitude approximately 14 m was recorded in the west central zone of the study area western side of p and pap sectors in fig 6a closer to the lufrano well field figs 1c and 2a where pumping ceased in 1989 inversely the minimum piezometric head increments approximately 1 m were observed in the southern sector where groundwater levels are constrained by the hydraulic potential boundary of the sebeto river and its tributaries as well as by the greater distance from the lufrano well field water table increment values for the 2002 2013 period phase 2 in fig 6b highlight a reduction in the groundwater rise with values ranging from a low of 0 0 1 0 m to a peak of 6 0 m the highest values were recorded in the southeastern side in an area distant from the lufrano well field figs 1c and 2a whereas the minimum piezometric head increments were observed in the west central zone western side of p and pap sectors in fig 6a which is close to the lufrano well field furthermore groundwater rise velocity maps fig 6c and d reveal that rates as high as 1 0 m yr were observed in the 1989 2002 period phase 1 the highest velocities even higher than 2 2 m yr occurring between 1989 and 1994 data not shown were observed in the west central portion of the study area fig 6a close to the deactivated lufrano well field in the period spanning from 2002 to 2003 phase 2 groundwater rise velocity decreased with maximum rates of approximately 0 6 m localized in the northeastern sector of the study area comparing the mean groundwater rise velocities of the two phases a general deceleration of approximately 30 was registered these results allow us to conclude that the rising groundwater levels recorded from 1989 to 2013 can be considered to be groundwater rebound caused by the drastic reduction of groundwater pumping in the surroundings of the study area figs 1c and 3 furthermore the spatio temporal variability of the groundwater rebound was recognized to be strongly dependant on the distance from the abandoned lufrano well field in addition given the absence at a local scale of significant changes in annual rainfall regime fig 3 it is possible to consider allocca et al 2017 the precipitation variable as insignificant when explaining the groundwater rise observed which is consistent with the downward sloping trend of the mean annual precipitation index observed at a regional scale de vita et al 2012 4 2 satellite based deformation maps the cumulative los displacement maps displ of the study area for the periods of 1993 2000 and 2002 2010 have been reconstructed fig 7 a and b all the dinsar measurements in ascending geometry have been interpolated through the inverse distance weighted idw technique to obtain spatially continuous maps that have been very useful for analysing the spatial variability of the phenomenon and profiles of deformation along assigned alignments the interpolated maps obtained from the ers and envisat data in the ascending acquisition mode for the whole study area have a mean cumulative los deformation of 0 9 13 4 mm and of 6 2 9 2 mm respectively as it is possible to observe in fig 7a a widespread ground uplift can be observed in the northern and north central portions of the study area reaching the highest magnitude in its upper left corner approximately 30 mm along the los see also table 2 such observation matches well with the post pumping hydrogeological changes observed fig 6a and b furthermore due to the slowing of the groundwater level rise in the period 2002 2010 the whole ground uplift seems to have been reduced in intensity in the same period 15 mm yr several subsidence phenomena were recognized fig 7 that affect the southern sector of the study area where composite interactions with other natural and anthropogenic factors occur the first phenomenon identified in the southern margin of the study area from both the ers and envisat satellites has a maximum cumulative los deformation respectively of 90 mm and 40 mm ers and envisat ascending accordingly such subsidence seems to have registered as a decrease of approximately 50 across the two time spans as also observed by bonano et al 2012 this local land subsidence is due to natural processes attributable to volcano tectonic dynamics recognized as occurring around the somma vesuvius volcano lanari et al 2002 a more recent subsidence area has been identified for the 2003 2010 period from the envisat satellite fig 7b and has turned out to be related to construction in the 2006 2008 period of the caan agri food centre of naples a large structure extending over approximately 362 000 m2 fig 7b used as a wholesale market and considered to be one of the largest in italy 5 discussion by comparing the trends of groundwater level rise ground deformation and annual precipitation fig 8 during the post pumping period 1989 2013 several interesting correlations have been observed thus a hydrogeologically based interpretation of the deformation mechanisms has been proposed highlighting the hydrostratigraphic factors that control rates of ground displacement for the northern sector of the study area pf graph in fig 8 a positive global trend for both groundwater level rise and ground uplift is recognizable with a piezometric variation of up to approximately 7 m observed from 1989 to 2013 fig 6a and b and a deformation of up to 20 mm fig 7a and b recorded in the period from 1993 to 2010 the link between the observed phenomena can be ascribed reasonably to the elastic rebound of the aquifer under the unloading of effective stress caused by the increase of pore pressure which is related to the recovery of groundwater levels in the unconfined shallow aquifer graph pf fig 8 fig 2 this interpretation is known as pore elastic rebound of an aquifer biot 1941 waltham 2002 ishitsuka et al 2017 and originated from the relaxation of elastically compressed aquifers when pore water pressure is recovered it is also consistent with experimental results of water injection programmes carried out at the subsided site of the wilmington oilfield in california allen and mayuga 1969 teatini et al 2011 although other authors vilardo et al 2009 interpreted this phenomenon as an increase in pore water pressure in agricultural soils inducted by flood episodes from artificial channels and tributaries of regi lagni river in the somma vesuvius northern sector fig 1a and c furthermore in the north central sector p graph fig 8 similar positive trends for both phenomena can be recognized however although in this sector there has been a piezometric level rise of approximately 14 5 m from approximately 1 0 to 15 0 m a s l figs 4 6a and b the ground uplift measured is about 40 mm fig 7 in this case the smallest ground uplift rate observed in the north central sector can be related to the involvement of groundwater rebound mainly in the deep semi confined tufaceous aquitard figs 2 and 8 which it is characterized by a lower elastic deformability than incoherent pyroclastic alluvial deposits such observation confirms that ground uplift is not just related to rising groundwater levels but also dependent on other hydrogeological and geotechnical factors i e aquifer type permeability heterogeneities elastic properties in the southcentral sector graph pap in fig 8 the piezometric level rise was approximately 5 0 m recovering the pyroclastic alluvial palustrine aquifer figs 2 and 7 while heterogeneous ground deformation behaviour was observed by a ground uplift of about 25 mm in the northern margin related to piezometric level rise and b land subsidence of about 80 mm on average along the southern sector due to volcano tectonic dynamics of somma vesuvius or settlement and consolidation caused by new local buildings figs 7 and 8 the ground uplift resulting from pore water pressure increase and pore elastic rebound would have probably affected a more extensive area if there was no interaction with other contrasting phenomena in fact beyond the human induced ground subsidence resulting from an intense urbanization in the 1990s fig 7a and the construction of the caan fig 7b during the 2006 2008 period another natural process affects the southern margin of the pap sector in fact according to lanari et al 2002 this local ground subsidence is characterized by a peculiar annular shape terada 1929 occurring around the northern foot of somma vesuvius fig 1a this peculiar style of ground deformation is caused by gravitational loading of the volcanic edifice coupled with extensional tectonic stress along quaternary active faults such as the sebeto deep fault fig 1 which showed evidence of activity in the late pleistocene holocene cinque et al 2000 this phenomenon is analysed in the va graph fig 8 where despite the positive trend of groundwater levels equal to approximately 6 0 m a continuous subsidence of up to 85 mm was registered finally fig 8 clearly shows that the significant upward trend in the piezometric level and vertical ground deformation observed in the 1989 2002 period was not triggered by a change in the local precipitation s regime since this does not display any substantial change during the same interval of time 6 conclusions integrated use of hydrogeological and dinsar data has allowed the investigation of coupling between groundwater rebound and ground deformation in the multi layered pyroclastic alluvial aquifer of the casalnuovo di napoli and volla municipalities metropolitan city of naples italy by means of approximately 20 years of hydrogeological and dinsar monitoring data covering the period of 1993 2010 the spatio temporal evolution of ground deformation has been analysed for the period following the strong reduction of groundwater pumping hydrogeological monitoring data show that groundwater level rise occurred extensively throughout the study area in the 1989 2013 period fig 6a and b with a maximum amplitude of 16 m observed in the west central sector where the highest velocities of groundwater rise have been recorded with a magnitude of up to approximately 1 0 m yr fig 6c and d dinsar data show general ground uplift during the time span of 1993 2010 fig 7a and b such a phenomenon has turned out to have a magnitude of approximately 40 mm on average except for the southern sector of the study area where some local natural and human induced subsidence with a maximum magnitude of 130 mm have been identified comparisons between trends of groundwater level and ground displacement fig 8 indicate that the ground uplift is linked to a probable poro elastic rebound mechanism in the aquifer system such a phenomenon was caused by piezometric level rise following groundwater pumping interruption related effective stress unloading and deformation recovery the obtained results advance the knowledge of the complex and often unforeseen interactions between human actions and geohazards allowing for more effective urban planning in particular the study area is a relevant example of urban planning that was carried out by taking into account a non natural groundwater level condition kept low for decades by strong groundwater exploitation a consequence of this difficult to predict scenario is groundwater flooding hazards among other geohazards affecting the study area such as those due to coastal fluvial volcanic and earthquake phenomena another related hazard to be studied are the effects of the interaction between groundwater and foundations on the stability of buildings which were designed for low groundwater table conditions in conclusion the results of this study open new perspectives in the management of such a type of geohazard which would need the implementation of an appropriate coupled hydro mechanical model for correct risk

effect of inefficient aquifer management le mouélic et al 2002 teatini et al 2005 gambolati et al 2005 ishitsuka et al 2014 such phenomena usually involving wide areas can lead to heavy socioeconomic and environmental impacts especially if affecting urbanized and coastal areas where structures and infrastructure can be damaged even more by flood and seawater intrusion abidin et al 2001 teatini et al 2005 phienwej et al 2006 aldiss et al 2014 kusaka et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 in these cases stopping groundwater overexploitation can result in groundwater rebound which depending on the type of aquifer and water table depth can trigger ground uplift colombo et al 2017 in such a case madrid aquifer ezquerro et al 2014 santa clara valley chaussard et al 2017 characterized by multiphase materials the coupling between pore fluid and the soil skeleton can be considered elastic thus respecting the basic model first proposed by biot 1941 consequences on built up areas can be unpredictably severe if the cause effect mechanisms have not been previously analysed by means of hydrogeological giudici et al 2000 teatini et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 gattinoni and scesi 2017 and geotechnical models tomàs et al 2011 tessitore et al 2015 chaussard et al 2017 pujades et al 2017 therefore especially in shallow porous aquifers integrated and effective monitoring of groundwater level and ground deformation is essential to manage inherent hazards and risks several studies have dealt with the importance of integrated monitoring to correctly analyse the effects of groundwater level variations on ground vertical movements e g king et al 2007 jacob et al 2010 amoruso et al 2014 which also hinged on satellite based insar deformation measurements galloway and hoffmann 2007

technologies give breakthrough advantages as compared to in situ measurements allowing scientists to accomplish regional scale mapping and monitoring of ground deformation with lower costs tomás et al 2014 in addition satellite technologies turn out to be very useful in knowing the spatial extent and the temporal development of the phenomenon in the present work ground uplift and groundwater rebound due to strong reduction of groundwater exploitation of a multi layered porous shallow aquifer system have been identified for the first time as affecting two municipalities of the metropolitan city of naples italy the study has been based on a coupled analysis of multi temporal hydrogeological and differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar dinsar data covering the periods of 1989 2013 and 1993 2010 respectively hydrogeological characteristic and groundwater level evolution in this area have been widely studied during the last couple decades allocca and celico 2008 2010 allocca et al 2016 the principal outcome of these studies has been the recognition of a gradual recovery of piezometric levels since 1990 which was caused by a drastic reduction of groundwater exploitation ended in 1989 of the pyroclastic alluvial aquifer allocca and celico 2008 since 2007 the aftermath of this groundwater rebound has caused serious problems with groundwater flooding of agricultural soils and underground structures infrastructures allocca et al 2016 such as basements underground parks and subway tunnels which were built while considering the preceding phase of low groundwater level the hydrogeological dataset available for the 1989 2013 period has been used to obtain high resolution multi temporal mapping of the groundwater levels and circulation patterns as well as time lapse piezometric head increase and rising velocity maps dinsar data covering the monitoring periods of 1993 2000 and 2002 2010 were processed through a ps insar technique ferretti et al 2000 in the framework of the italian first not ordinary plan of environmental remote sensing project costabile 2010 such data have been used to obtain cumulative ground deformation maps for the aforementioned periods that can be compared with groundwater level variations in this paper a hydrogeologically based interpretation of the ground deformation measurements will be presented demonstrating that i the ground uplift is consistently correlated to the spatial and temporal evolution of groundwater rebound and ii local patterns of vertical ground movement diverging from the general uplift trend are controlled by other anthropogenic and natural processes the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the hydrogeological characteristics of the study area and temporal evolution of groundwater pumping and recovery phases section 3 shows the monitoring time series used for the analysis and the methods applied whereas the section 4 exposes the results obtained finally in sections 5 and 6 the discussion and conclusions are presented respectively 2 description of the study area 2 1 geological and hydrogeological setting the study area approximately 14 30 km2 is located east of naples fig 1 a and c and encompasses the casalnuovo di napoli and volla municipalities approximately 75 000 inhabitants live in this urban area reaching a mean population density of approximately 5 240 inhabitants km2 from a geological point of view fig 1a the study area is located in the south central sector of the campanian plain a large alluvial plain formed in the pliocene pleistocene by the filling of a regional semi graben structural depression which originated along the western side of the southern apennines during the opening of the tyrrhenian sea patacca et al 1990 in detail the study area is delimited to the west by the phlegraean fields volcanic system to the east by the carbonate massif of avella pizzo d alvano and to the south by somma vesuvius volcano fig 1a the deep structural setting is characterized by a subsiding tectonic depression the sebeto valley set on quaternary active faults bellucci 1994 1998 cinque et al 2011 lanari et al 2002 such as the deeply buried magnaghi sebeto fault zone magnaghi sebeto fz and the deeply buried faults on the northern edge of somma vesuvius volcano fig 1a and b locally these fault systems trending ne sw and nw se engender one of the most seismically active fault zones in the neapolitan area moreover they give rise to an extensional tectonic stress field and gravitational sliding around the base of the somma vesuvius edifice fig 1a and 1b as evidence of ground deformation processes from seismological mesostructural interferometric petrochemical and micropalaeontological data show bianco et al 1998 bruno et al 1998 2003 cinque et al 2000 lanari et al 2002 marturano et al 2013 starting from 300 ka rolandi et al 2003 intense volcanic activity occurred across the plain with the formation of the phlegraean fields and somma vesuvius volcano in the last 25 000 years in addition to the deposition of volcaniclastic products further sedimentation and erosional processes led to the filling of the structural depression with several thousands of metres of alluvial marine and fluvio palustrine sediments bellucci 1994 according to the updated geological data ispra 2014 outcroppings of four different hydrogeological complexes have been identified fig 2 a holocene pyroclastic fluvial sediments pf in the northern sector ash fall pyroclastic deposits p dated at 39 3 39 8 ka in the north central sector holocene pyroclastic alluvial marine and palustrine sediments pap as well as late holocene volcanic and alluvial deposits va in the south central and southern sectors fig 2a furthermore the northern and north central sectors fig 2a are characterized by a low permeability tuff horizon corresponding to the campanian ignimbrite ci in a zeolitized yellow facies dated to 39 28 0 11 ka de vivo et al 2001 this tuff horizon does not outcrop in the area being only recognizable by boreholes bellucci 1994 allocca et al 2016 from whose data the tuff horizon has been reconstructed and show it as being spatially discontinuous with a thickness variable up to 40 m fig 2b specifically in the south central and southern sectors of the study area fig 2a the ci is absent due to the erosion by the paleo sebeto river and is locally substituted by silt and clayey deposits as well as lenses of peat and volcanic rocks fig 2b from a geomorphological point of view the study area ranges in altitude from 12 to 45 m a s l and is characterized by a flat morphology slightly sloping towards the course of the sebeto river known since historical times for supplying the ancient greek roman bolla aqueduct that fed the city of naples celico et al 1995 according to results from previous hydrogeological studies celico 1983 bellucci et al 1990 celico et al 1994 allocca et al 2007 2016 allocca and celico 2008 de vita et al 2018 the study area is overall characterized by a porous multi layered aquifer system formed by a very complex lateral and vertical stratigraphic juxtaposition of volcaniclastic and alluvial deposits fig 2a and b in the northern and north central sectors of the study area fig 2a the aquifer system consists of a shallow unconfined aquifer formed by volcaniclastic and alluvial deposits younger than the ci deposit and by a deep semi confined pyroclastic alluvial aquifer underling the ci horizon fig 2a and b instead in the south central and southern sectors fig 2a due to the lack of ci deposits the aquifer system is characterized by a unique groundwater circulation flow within the laterally discontinuous pyroclastic alluvial bodies with a prevailing sandy grain size in these sectors groundwater flow can be only confined at a local scale by lower permeability lenses of clayey sands clayey silts and peat fig 2b despite these heterogeneities in the aquifer system groundwater circulation can be considered unitary at a basin scale fig 1c behaving as a part of the regional groundwater circulation occurring in the pyroclastic alluvial aquifer of the campania plain sector eastward of naples the aquifer system is recharged by direct effective infiltration assessed to be approximately 300 mm year bellucci et al 1990 allocca and celico 2008 allocca et al 2014 by lateral groundwater flow coming from the adjoining aquifer sector the groundwater basin of which extends up to the carbonate avella pizzo d alvano and volcanic somma vesuvius aquifers fig 1c in the study area the principle land use classes corine land cover 2012 are urbanized zones covering approximately 65 of the territory and agricultural lands extending over the rest 35 2 2 trends in groundwater exploitation since post world war ii times groundwater resources in the pyroclastic alluvial aquifer of the plain sector east of naples have been used for supplying drinking water agriculture and industry needs the most important tapping location is the lufrano well field which was developed at the end of the 1940s consisting of approximately 150 wells subsequently in the 1970s and 1990s the ponticelli and acerra well fields were also built respectively figs 1c and 2a during the same period the number of wells for industrial and agricultural uses increased rapidly reaching a density of up to approximately 90 100 wells km2 celico et al 1994 during the 1950 1989 period due to continued strong population growth salvati 2014 and industrial development in the metropolitan city of naples mazzeo 2009 an intense use of groundwater resources by public and private wells occurred with massive pumping of up to 6 0 m3 s of which approximately 4 0 m3 s was for drinking water use see fig 3 which determined a deficit in the mean annual water budget of the pyroclastic alluvial aquifer of approximately 2 65 m3 s allocca and celico 2008 this mismanagement of groundwater resources caused the following i overexploitation of the pyroclastic alluvial aquifer with a rapid decline of the groundwater level up to 16 m which ended in 1989 fig 3 allocca and celico 2008 and ii a deterioration of groundwater quality due to the increase of nitrate fluoride iron and manganese concentrations which even exceeded acceptable drinking water standards celico et al 1994 1997 esposito 1998 because of such groundwater quality deterioration and the high cost of treatment to match drinking water standards the well fields of lufrano acerra and ponticelli figs 1c and 2a were partially abandoned moreover groundwater withdrawals have also been drastically reduced or interrupted because of the processes of deindustrialization and land use change from agricultural land to urbanized areas allocca and celico 2010 as a consequence starting from 1990 a continuous groundwater rebound has occurred inside the pyroclastic alluvial aquifer of the plain east of naples which has been observed allocca and celico 2008 allocca et al 2016 either at the whole groundwater basin or local scale with rising groundwater levels of up to approximately 16 m the recovery of groundwater levels to the conditions preceding the strong overexploitation phase 1946 1989 had been overlooked until 2007 when the first relevant hydrogeological impacts began affecting structures and infrastructures in the study area which were designed and constructed in consideration of artificially lowered water table levels these impacts were noticed in different zones in the plain east of naples as groundwater flooding events occurring in the winter and spring seasons and affecting basements railway tunnels and other underground structures in recent years the further rising of groundwater levels has worsened impacts involving groundwater flooding of agricultural lands and archaeological sites allocca and celico 2008 allocca et al 2016 groundwater flooding events display wide heterogeneous temporal spatial distribution since they are affected by natural and anthropogenic factors allocca et al 2016 and represent a new hydrogeological risk that is not adequately considered by local authorities and national legislation 3 data and methods 3 1 hydrogeological data stratigraphic data from 86 boreholes fig 2a with depths variable between 10 and 60 m table 1 were collected and filed into a geographical information system platform to reconstruct a 2d hydrostratigraphic model of the aquifer system fig 2b hydraulic conductivity was estimated for each stratigraphic interval of all boreholes with freeze and cherry 1979 empirical relationships which are based on grain size for porous aquifers and lithology for rock aquifers allocca et al 2018 moreover the role of the aquifer or aquitard aquiclude was assigned to each sediment lithofacies and geological formation piezometric measurements have been carried out in wells and boreholes during a long term monitoring period from 1989 to 2013 table 1 in particular piezometric data from 1989 to 2003 were collected during field surveys carried out by private companies public agencies and researchers and then published in scientific or technical papers celico and de paola 1992 esposito 1998 autorità di bacino regionale nord occidentale della campania 2004 the most recent hydrogeological data from 2013 came from a field measurement campaign carried out on approximately 130 wells fig 4 d by a research project developed under an agreement signed by the casalnuovo di napoli and volla municipalities allocca et al 2016 furthermore annual rainfall data recorded by the rain gauge station at the san marcellino meteorological observatory were collected from 1946 to 2013 table 1 the hydrostratigraphic and hydrogeological database has been managed in a qgis environment allowing the reconstruction of multi temporal maps of groundwater level groundwater level change mean velocity of groundwater level rise and groundwater circulation models by the kriging geostatistical method oliver and webster 1990 the following outcomes have been created i four water table contour maps fig 4 ii two maps of the spatio temporal variation of the piezometric head fig 6a and b and iii two maps of the mean velocity of groundwater level rise fig 6c and d the piezometric head variation maps δh m were reconstructed by overlapping piezometric data for the years 1989 2002 and 2013 starting from these datasets the two maps of spatio temporal variation of the piezometric head have been calculated by a respective comparison of 2002 with 1989 and 2013 with 2002 data then maps of groundwater rise velocity m yr were generated by dividing the piezometric head variation observed in each of the two time spans by the time lapse of each period fig 4 shows groundwater level evolution in the study area for the period of 1989 2013 in 1989 fig 4a due to strong groundwater withdrawal of up to 5 6 m3 s allocca and celico 2008 the water table suffered a strong piezometric lowering reaching values as low as 2 0 m below sea level and a deviation of the groundwater flow directions oriented towards the lufrano well field figs 1c and 2a since 1990 as consequence of a drastic reduction in groundwater pumping a gradual rise of the piezometric level began allocca and celico 2008 allocca et al 2016 which is clearly recognizable on the groundwater level maps of 1994 and 2002 fig 4b and c the rising groundwater level continued until 2013 the map from that year fig 4d is well comparable with those related to the beginning of the last century allocca and celico 2008 allocca et al 2016 when no groundwater pumping was being carried out showing an almost complete recovery of groundwater levels moreover the piezometric contour pattern shows that groundwater circulation converges towards the drainage axis represented by the sebeto river and its tributaries cozzone and volla rivers see fig 2 3 2 dinsar data dinsar data consist of ground deformation measurements for each satellite acquisition date projected along the line of sight los direction which allows displacement maps profiles and time series ts to be produced in the present work sar data gathered and processed by the italian first not ordinary plan of environmental remote sensing project have been used under a specific agreement with the italian ministry of environment mattm specifically 139 images taken by the ers 1 2 67 and 72 images in ascending and descending geometry respectively and 92 by the envisat satellite 52 and 40 images in ascending and descending geometry respectively covering the monitoring periods of 1992 2000 and 2002 2010 table 2 were processed through the ps insar technique ferretti et al 2000 a cumulative los projected displacement varying between 100 mm and 50 mm 1993 2000 and between 120 mm and 40 mm 2002 2010 was measured table 2 dinsar mean velocity maps are shown in fig 5 where for the 1993 2000 period a general uplift approximately 1 6 1 1 mm yr on average in the northern sector of the area and an extended subsidence in the southern one approximately 3 12 mm yr on average were observed then for the second observation period 2002 2010 a drop in the displacement rates for both sectors was observed specifically the maximum uplift rate projected along the los of approximately 1 cm year detected in the first monitoring window by ers satellite decreased by approximately 50 in the second time span as is also confirmed by the envisat measurements a small area affected by a localized subsidence with a maximum mean rate of 12 4 mm year was also recognized in the 2002 2010 period fig 5c and d 4 results 4 1 groundwater rebound assessment post pumping groundwater level increments δh fig 6 a and b and groundwater rise velocity maps v fig 6c and d have been reconstructed the results show that groundwater rebound following the interruption of pumping was widespread throughout the study area in the period from 1989 to 2013 in particular for the 1989 2002 period phase 1 in fig 6a the water table showed a general rise although spatially variable ranging from a minimum of 0 5 m to a maximum of 14 0 m the groundwater rebound with the highest magnitude approximately 14 m was recorded in the west central zone of the study area western side of p and pap sectors in fig 6a closer to the lufrano well field figs 1c and 2a where pumping ceased in 1989 inversely the minimum piezometric head increments approximately 1 m were observed in the southern sector where groundwater levels are constrained by the hydraulic potential boundary of the sebeto river and its tributaries as well as by the greater distance from the lufrano well field water table increment values for the 2002 2013 period phase 2 in fig 6b highlight a reduction in the groundwater rise with values ranging from a low of 0 0 1 0 m to a peak of 6 0 m the highest values were recorded in the southeastern side in an area distant from the lufrano well field figs 1c and 2a whereas the minimum piezometric head increments were observed in the west central zone western side of p and pap sectors in fig 6a which is close to the lufrano well field furthermore groundwater rise velocity maps fig 6c and d reveal that rates as high as 1 0 m yr were observed in the 1989 2002 period phase 1 the highest velocities even higher than 2 2 m yr occurring between 1989 and 1994 data not shown were observed in the west central portion of the study area fig 6a close to the deactivated lufrano well field in the period spanning from 2002 to 2003 phase 2 groundwater rise velocity decreased with maximum rates of approximately 0 6 m localized in the northeastern sector of the study area comparing the mean groundwater rise velocities of the two phases a general deceleration of approximately 30 was registered these results allow us to conclude that the rising groundwater levels recorded from 1989 to 2013 can be considered to be groundwater rebound caused by the drastic reduction of groundwater pumping in the surroundings of the study area figs 1c and 3 furthermore the spatio temporal variability of the groundwater rebound was recognized to be strongly dependant on the distance from the abandoned lufrano well field in addition given the absence at a local scale of significant changes in annual rainfall regime fig 3 it is possible to consider allocca et al 2017 the precipitation variable as insignificant when explaining the groundwater rise observed which is consistent with the downward sloping trend of the mean annual precipitation index observed at a regional scale de vita et al 2012 4 2 satellite based deformation maps the cumulative los displacement maps displ of the study area for the periods of 1993 2000 and 2002 2010 have been reconstructed fig 7 a and b all the dinsar measurements in ascending geometry have been interpolated through the inverse distance weighted idw technique to obtain spatially continuous maps that have been very useful for analysing the spatial variability of the phenomenon and profiles of deformation along assigned alignments the interpolated maps obtained from the ers and envisat data in the ascending acquisition mode for the whole study area have a mean cumulative los deformation of 0 9 13 4 mm and of 6 2 9 2 mm respectively as it is possible to observe in fig 7a a widespread ground uplift can be observed in the northern and north central portions of the study area reaching the highest magnitude in its upper left corner approximately 30 mm along the los see also table 2 such observation matches well with the post pumping hydrogeological changes observed fig 6a and b furthermore due to the slowing of the groundwater level rise in the period 2002 2010 the whole ground uplift seems to have been reduced in intensity in the same period 15 mm yr several subsidence phenomena were recognized fig 7 that affect the southern sector of the study area where composite interactions with other natural and anthropogenic factors occur the first phenomenon identified in the southern margin of the study area from both the ers and envisat satellites has a maximum cumulative los deformation respectively of 90 mm and 40 mm ers and envisat ascending accordingly such subsidence seems to have registered as a decrease of approximately 50 across the two time spans as also observed by bonano et al 2012 this local land subsidence is due to natural processes attributable to volcano tectonic dynamics recognized as occurring around the somma vesuvius volcano lanari et al 2002 a more recent subsidence area has been identified for the 2003 2010 period from the envisat satellite fig 7b and has turned out to be related to construction in the 2006 2008 period of the caan agri food centre of naples a large structure extending over approximately 362 000 m2 fig 7b used as a wholesale market and considered to be one of the largest in italy 5 discussion by comparing the trends of groundwater level rise ground deformation and annual precipitation fig 8 during the post pumping period 1989 2013 several interesting correlations have been observed thus a hydrogeologically based interpretation of the deformation mechanisms has been proposed highlighting the hydrostratigraphic factors that control rates of ground displacement for the northern sector of the study area pf graph in fig 8 a positive global trend for both groundwater level rise and ground uplift is recognizable with a piezometric variation of up to approximately 7 m observed from 1989 to 2013 fig 6a and b and a deformation of up to 20 mm fig 7a and b recorded in the period from 1993 to 2010 the link between the observed phenomena can be ascribed reasonably to the elastic rebound of the aquifer under the unloading of effective stress caused by the increase of pore pressure which is related to the recovery of groundwater levels in the unconfined shallow aquifer graph pf fig 8 fig 2 this interpretation is known as pore elastic rebound of an aquifer biot 1941 waltham 2002 ishitsuka et al 2017 and originated from the relaxation of elastically compressed aquifers when pore water pressure is recovered it is also consistent with experimental results of water injection programmes carried out at the subsided site of the wilmington oilfield in california allen and mayuga 1969 teatini et al 2011 although other authors vilardo et al 2009 interpreted this phenomenon as an increase in pore water pressure in agricultural soils inducted by flood episodes from artificial channels and tributaries of regi lagni river in the somma vesuvius northern sector fig 1a and c furthermore in the north central sector p graph fig 8 similar positive trends for both phenomena can be recognized however although in this sector there has been a piezometric level rise of approximately 14 5 m from approximately 1 0 to 15 0 m a s l figs 4 6a and b the ground uplift measured is about 40 mm fig 7 in this case the smallest ground uplift rate observed in the north central sector can be related to the involvement of groundwater rebound mainly in the deep semi confined tufaceous aquitard figs 2 and 8 which it is characterized by a lower elastic deformability than incoherent pyroclastic alluvial deposits such observation confirms that ground uplift is not just related to rising groundwater levels but also dependent on other hydrogeological and geotechnical factors i e aquifer type permeability heterogeneities elastic properties in the southcentral sector graph pap in fig 8 the piezometric level rise was approximately 5 0 m recovering the pyroclastic alluvial palustrine aquifer figs 2 and 7 while heterogeneous ground deformation behaviour was observed by a ground uplift of about 25 mm in the northern margin related to piezometric level rise and b land subsidence of about 80 mm on average along the southern sector due to volcano tectonic dynamics of somma vesuvius or settlement and consolidation caused by new local buildings figs 7 and 8 the ground uplift resulting from pore water pressure increase and pore elastic rebound would have probably affected a more extensive area if there was no interaction with other contrasting phenomena in fact beyond the human induced ground subsidence resulting from an intense urbanization in the 1990s fig 7a and the construction of the caan fig 7b during the 2006 2008 period another natural process affects the southern margin of the pap sector in fact according to lanari et al 2002 this local ground subsidence is characterized by a peculiar annular shape terada 1929 occurring around the northern foot of somma vesuvius fig 1a this peculiar style of ground deformation is caused by gravitational loading of the volcanic edifice coupled with extensional tectonic stress along quaternary active faults such as the sebeto deep fault fig 1 which showed evidence of activity in the late pleistocene holocene cinque et al 2000 this phenomenon is analysed in the va graph fig 8 where despite the positive trend of groundwater levels equal to approximately 6 0 m a continuous subsidence of up to 85 mm was registered finally fig 8 clearly shows that the significant upward trend in the piezometric level and vertical ground deformation observed in the 1989 2002 period was not triggered by a change in the local precipitation s regime since this does not display any substantial change during the same interval of time 6 conclusions integrated use of hydrogeological and dinsar data has allowed the investigation of coupling between groundwater rebound and ground deformation in the multi layered pyroclastic alluvial aquifer of the casalnuovo di napoli and volla municipalities metropolitan city of naples italy by means of approximately 20 years of hydrogeological and dinsar monitoring data covering the period of 1993 2010 the spatio temporal evolution of ground deformation has been analysed for the period following the strong reduction of groundwater pumping hydrogeological monitoring data show that groundwater level rise occurred extensively throughout the study area in the 1989 2013 period fig 6a and b with a maximum amplitude of 16 m observed in the west central sector where the highest velocities of groundwater rise have been recorded with a magnitude of up to approximately 1 0 m yr fig 6c and d dinsar data show general ground uplift during the time span of 1993 2010 fig 7a and b such a phenomenon has turned out to have a magnitude of approximately 40 mm on average except for the southern sector of the study area where some local natural and human induced subsidence with a maximum magnitude of 130 mm have been identified comparisons between trends of groundwater level and ground displacement fig 8 indicate that the ground uplift is linked to a probable poro elastic rebound mechanism in the aquifer system such a phenomenon was caused by piezometric level rise following groundwater pumping interruption related effective stress unloading and deformation recovery the obtained results advance the knowledge of the complex and often unforeseen interactions between human actions and geohazards allowing for more effective urban planning in particular the study area is a relevant example of urban planning that was carried out by taking into account a non natural groundwater level condition kept low for decades by strong groundwater exploitation a consequence of this difficult to predict scenario is groundwater flooding hazards among other geohazards affecting the study area such as those due to coastal fluvial volcanic and earthquake phenomena another related hazard to be studied are the effects of the interaction between groundwater and foundations on the stability of buildings which were designed for low groundwater table conditions in conclusion the results of this study open new perspectives in the management of such a type of geohazard which would need the implementation of an appropriate coupled hydro mechanical model for correct risk

respiration photosynthesis hydrologic dynamics and climate dubois et al 2010 stavang et al 2010 wen et al 2017 in general partial pressure of aqueous co2 pco2 generated from mineralization of terrestrial organic matter and respiration in aquatic ecosystem dominates the magnitude of gas exchange and direction at the water air interface li et al 2012 khadka et al 2014 besides anthropogenic activities increase the carbon inputs and alter the environment and thus mediate riverine pco2 arneth et al 2017 ran et al 2015a however the systematic study on anthropogenic controls of riverine co2 outgassing and carbon cycle remains limited van oost et al 2007 previous studies indicated that 95 of pco2 in rivers and streams were higher than in atmosphere and had an average of 2300 μatm finlay 2003 raymond et al 2013 the published data reported that the global co2 flux from inland surface waters to the atmosphere was within 0 75 2 1 pg c y 1 which was comparable to the net carbon accumulation of continents 2 2 pg c y 1 tranvik et al 2009 aufdenkampe et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 these results suggested that freshwater systems especially rivers and streams were the important contributors of carbon transportation and co2 emissions thus characterization of riverine pco2 and co2 degassing should be taken for better understanding the role of river networks on regional and global carbon cycles the three gorges reservoir tgr is the important water conservancy project for irrigation and hydroelectric power in this region typical subtropical monsoon climate and enormous population density may cause the co2 saturation in the main stream and tributaries of the yangtze river yang et al 2013 huang et al 2017 in china previous studies suggested that riverine pco2 2600 2810 μatm and co2 flux 274 856 mmol m2 d were high on the large rivers e g the yellow and the pearl river ran et al 2015a yao et al 2007 they were higher than that on the mekong 1090 μatm for pco2 and 195 mmol m2 d for co2 flux and mississippi rivers 1335 μatm for pco2 and 270 mmol m2 d for co2 flux li et al 2013 dubois et al 2010 in particular the observations from yangtze river system reported a higher annual average pco2 in major tributaries 1744 899 μatm than that on the main stem 1235 515 μatm liu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 thus tributaries of large rivers and streams are vital to examine spatiotemporal distribution of pco2 across the river networks prior researches on the tgr and its tributaries exhibited the pronounced seasonal and spatial divergences on riverine pco2 and co2 fluxes estimates yang et al 2013 huang et al 2015 li et al 2017 nonetheless fluvial networks in this area are not well documented for carbon emission our preliminary study reported the strong spatial and temporal variations of pco2 and high co2 emission rates 330 mmol m2 d from these mountainous rivers in the tgr area based on two rounds of field campaigns li et al 2018 therefore limited measurements from the whole catchment potentially result in large uncertainty of co2 emission especially for site specific riverine pco2 with the distinct natural and anthropogenic controls in this context detailed field co2 measurements with complete coverage of the main tributary in the tgr region upper yangtze are very necessary the daning river is a representative tributary of the upper yangtze river in the tgr region the area exhibits the significant urbanization gradient from natural conditions to the intensive agricultural practices or urban and yet understandings of riverine co2 outgassing and transport are not available the objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the spatial and temporal variations of riverine pco2 and 2 examine the controls of variations and coupling relationships between pco2 and environmental parameters as well as 3 quantify daytime water air co2 flux our novel contributions are to unravel the mechanisms of natural and anthropogenic controls on riverine co2 emissions and explore the key drivers on the aquatic pco2 based on detailed field works here the seasonal and spatial characteristics of pco2 and co2 degassing in the daning river are examined our results highlight that anthropogenic activities overall increase riverine pco2 and also greatly alter the environmental controls of pco2 which is expected to improve the understandings of regional and global co2 outgassing under global change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the daning river is the main tributary of the yangtze in the tgr region fig 1 where the largest scale of hydroelectric station is located and has a length of 250 km and drains an area of 4426 km2 our sampling sites were mainly distributed in upper reach with a minimal elevation of 185 m and thus not influenced by tgr operation the daning river 31 04 31 44 n 108 44 110 11 e located in wushan county and wuxi county chongqing and lies in a subtropical monsoon climate zone the annual mean temperature

urban land is another tributary in the downstream reach and flows through the populated area with intensive agricultural practices the tributary has a clear urbanization gradient anthropogenic activities constitute the important component of hydrographic and environmental influence the detailed sampling information and hydrological characteristics are listed in the supplement materials appendix table a1 2 2 water sampling and analyses five field campaigns both in rainy may 2016 august 2016 and july 2017 and dry seasons november 2016 and march 2017 were carried out and a total of 164 samples were collected from 33 locations in the daning river fig 1 our field work was performed in the forenoon from 9 00 am to 12 00 pm or afternoon from 14 00 pm to 18 00 pm and each sampling site was revisited based on previous sampling time this intended to minimize the influence from diurnal fluctuation light intensity and temperature shifts on the samples each water sample was taken from the riverbank at approximately 10 cm below the water surface li et al 2018 samples were filtered through glass microfiber filters gf f 47 mm 0 7 μm whatman and preserved in the high density polyethylene plastic containers 50 ml and 100 ml to avoid any headspace or air bubbles the containers were completely sealed filtered samples for doc and nutrient measurements were acidified to ph 2

using a testo 410 1 anemometer germany and flow velocity float method was also determined accompanying each sampling at corresponding sites total alkalinity alk was titrated with 0 0200 m hydrochloric acid hcl dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was detected by multi n c 2100s analytik jena germany total dissolved nitrogen tdn was determined by alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method wei et al 2013 and total dissolved phosphorus tdp was determined by ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method wu et al 2011 2 3 pco2 calculations riverine pco2 was calculated using co2sys software this program is based on the equilibrium of carbonate system parameters alk dic the fugacity of co2 fco2 or pco2 and ph which employs two of the four parameters to calculate the other two parameters in freshwaters the definition of alk can be described by the formula 1 fco2 is approximately 0 3 lower than pco2 at pressures of 1 atm and which is dependent on dic

alk were collected as the essential data li and zhang 2014 li et al 2016 recently co2sys has been widely employed for aquatic pco2 calculations penman et al 2013 tortell et al 2015 especially for rivers and streams with ph 7 and low doc concentration li et al 2013 thus co2sys are generally considered as a simplified and reliable method ries 2011 2 4 water air co2 flux calculations the theoretical model thin boundary layer was employed to calculate the water air co2 flux f as follows 6 f k k h pco 2 w a t e r pco 2 a i r 7 k h 10 1 11 0 016 t 0 00007 t 2 where k refers to gas

2014 unit in μatm kh is the henry s constant of co2 corrected by formula 7 using temperature t in c unit in mmol m3 μatm specially gas transfer velocity k was affected by some hydrologic and environmental factors i e channel slope flow velocity wind speed and water depth but mostly by wind speed and water turbulence telmer and veizer 1999 li et al 2013 literature demonstrated k vales were highly variable i e 8 115 cm h and most studies did not measure k directly aucour et al 1999 extensive studies have been made to calibrate the k value alin et al 2011 raymond et al 2012 recent research reported that current velocity was the dominant source of near surface water turbulence at a large spatial scale galfalk et al 2013 liu et al 2017 and thus the flow velocity was employed for

than some asian monsoon rivers 10 cm h yao et al 2007 wang et al 2011 but comparable to the k levels in the yellow river ran et al 2015a 2 5 data quality chemical analysis of water samples followed the standard procedures and methods described by alekin et al 1973 and the american public health association 1985 the ph probe was calibrated prior to measurement with ph standard solution 4 01 7 00

temperature do and ec were 0 002 ph units 0 5 c 2 and 1 respectively the alk was determined using a fixed end point titration method filtered water 20 ml was titrated with 0 0200 m hcl calibrated with 0 02 m naoh and 1 2 drops of 0 1 helianthine b was employed as the acid base indicator three parallel titrations suggested the uncertainty of the alk titrated with 0 0200 mol l hcl were below 3 ran et al 2015a the measuring of tdn and tdp was replicated coefficient of variance 5 doc concentrations were determined in triplicate coefficient of variance 2 the outliers were picked out and the average of readings was record previous study had concluded that random errors were typically low 2 of median value for ph and total alkalinity in carbonate equilibrium and temperature uncertainty had a negligible effect on pco2 golub et al 2017 moreover the uncertainties of pco2 estimate mainly stem from the non carbonate alkalinity nc alk which is generally dominated by contributions of nitrogen phosphorus silicate and organic species abril et al 2015 in this study the mean values of tdn tdp and doc were respectively 43 6 μm 1 02 μm and 126 7 μm and nc alk could be simply ignored when riverine ph 7 4 hunt et al 2011 thus the contributions of nitrogen phosphorus and organic acid were minor lozovik 2005 li et al 2012 the pco2 could be underestimated due to the diurnal cycles in this study for instance pco2 at night could be 1 3 fold higher than that at daytime because of the variations of metabolic activity which further affects the regional co2 evasion morales pineda et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 available landsat tm in january 2015 dry season and digital elevation model dem data were employed for data extraction of the water surface area prior observations suggested that the water surface area in the rainy season was 1 3 1 5 times an average of 1 4 times higher than that in the dry season for subtropical rivers in china ran et al 2015b this may result in the underestimation 28 of annual co2 flux in this study 2 6 statistical analyses normality and homogeneity of data were tested by kolmogorov smirnov and levene s test the data that did not obey a normal distribution were transformed by the natural logarithm simple linear regressions and multiple regression analyses were employed to explore the relationship between pco2 and the environmental parameters including biogeochemical and physical variables tdn tdp doc and twater analysis of variance anova monthly variations and the mann whitney u test seasonal variations were used for significance test of hydrographic and environmental parameters all statistical analyses were performed using spss statistical package 19 0 and originlab originpro 2017 all the figures were prepared

patterns fig 3 the pco2 levels ranged from 261 9 μatm to 3526 3 μatm in the main stem both the highest 8600 7 μatm and lowest 190 0 μatm pco2 were occurred on xixi river the results showed 85 of samplings were supersaturated in co2 than the atmospheric co2 equilibrium on average pco2 in tributaries 1248 3 1162 0 μatm was much higher than that in the main stem 892 8 785 8 μatm mann whitney u test p 0 05 for example there was a 2 fold decrease of the pco2 from the lower reach tributary xiongjia river 1827 1 1135 9 μatm to the main stem fig 3 spatial average indicated that a decreasing trend along the flow direction of pco2 could be identified on the uppermost reach tributary whereas the reverse phenomenon was observed on the lower tributary in the rainy season fig 4 for example the pco2 levels roughly decreased from upstream 3006 9 μatm for site 1 to downstream 1256 5 μatm for site 8 for dongxi river but increased from headwaters 1572 9 μatm for site 9 to downstream 3455 0 μatm for site 13 for xiongjia river however there were very weak downward trends for the sites of dongxi river and irregular spatial variations for xiongjia river in the dry season in the tributaries both spatial and seasonal variability exhibited the significant natural and human influences on riverine pco2 3 4 co2 diffusion via water air interface distinct co2 emission rates were observed across months p 0 001 fig 5 there was the highest daytime water air co2 flux f of 770 7 570 2 mmol m2 d in august p 0 05 when using pairwise comparison in each month the daytime co2 fluxes were 357 4 483 7

respectively we reported an average co2 areal flux of 329 8 470 2 mmol m2 d using the surface water area of 22 6 km2 the co2 efflux was estimated 0 12 tg co2 y 3 5 nutrients and organic carbon the water quality variables of ec dissolved organic carbon and nutrients are presented in fig 6 and all of these variables showed significant monthly differences p 0 001 ec varied from 218 4 63 1 may to

important controls for co2 degassing cai et al 2004 abril et al 2005 in this context transport of soil co2 via runoff and in situ aquatic mineralization of organic matter increase pco2 levels johnson et al 2008 on the other hand photosynthesis by aquatic plants and subsequent co2 outgassing from water to atmosphere can decrease the pco2 richey et al 2004 khadka et al 2014 nutrient loads lead to the changes of the biomass dynamic and the structure of organisms and thus control the aquatic respiration photosynthesis samuelsson et al 2002 our findings showed low tdn 0 61 0 56 mg l and tdp concentrations 0 032 0 020 mg l fig 6 suggesting that the internal biological processes respiration and photosynthesis were relatively limited however it was also possible that the nutrients were rapidly cycled between organic and inorganic phases which could be potentially important for in stream processes quay et al 1995 seasonal temperature and precipitation influenced the aquatic pco2 as it was the dominant effect on soil respiration and carbon transportation hope et al 2004 in this study pco2 in aug 2183 3 1309 2 μatm was significantly higher than in other months fig 2 which was attributed to enhancement of soil respiration by warm temperature 25 8 37 0 c and wetted soils in the monsoonal rainfall season li et al 2013 the concentrated rainfall also promoted rapid kinetics of hydrological cycle jung et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 which resulted in very low pco2 410 μatm in may similar observations i e lower pco2 of 451 μatm were also found in the upper yangtze in the rainy season li et al 2012 in aquatic ecosystems organic carbon could be biodegraded into co2 by respiration of microbes guillemette et al 2013 this could explain that low pco2 levels were observed in the months that had low doc concentrations figs 2 and 4 however the internal primary production was a non essential driver for low pco2 due to the low chla 0 5 μg l in this region li et al 2018 moreover the local topography and hydrology also showed multiple mechanisms influencing pco2 li et al 2013 for example physical characteristics of the catchment such as land use pattern vegetation cover and soil organic content soc have important influences on riverine pco2 the former two factors are important controls of hydrologic dynamics and chemical composition in rivers ghaffari et al 2010 jeong 2001 soil organic content and hydrological processes are closely linked to terrestrial organic carbon losses to rivers and thus greatly mediated pco2 in rivers arneth et al 2017 klaminder et al 2010 the tributaries with small watershed area but high flow velocity zhou et al 2012 enhanced the terrestrial co2 and organic carbon inputs hotchkiss et al 2015 our results suggested that the pco2 and the watershed area showed the relatively limited co variation in the daning river fig s2 thus despite the significant monthly shifts p 0 001 for pco2 fig 2 our estimation showed the comparable pco2 levels between the rainy season 1243 7 1111 5 μatm and the dry season 1145 5 1146 2 μatm dissolution of carbonate minerals resulted in high alkalinity 2599 7 506 8 μeq l and dic concentrations 2630 5 518 2 μm in the daning river and thus potentially contributed to the pco2 levels meanwhile the relatively low co2 evasion could be observed in the carbonate dominated regions when it compared to the silicate terrains khadka et al 2014 this suggested that catchment lithology could be an important control of riverine co2 martin 2017 pu et al 2016 4 2 controls of anthropogenic activities on pco2 anthropogenic activities can affect the aquatic pco2 by direct carbon inputs but also regulate co2 emissions in waters through altering the terrestrial environment skurlatov and ernestova 2010 gu et al 2017 riverine pco2 was highly dependent on site specific factors such as primary productivity and land derived organic carbon liu et al 2016 human activities generally change these factors bueno et al 2010 which cause some isolated and incongruous observations of the pco2 in densely populated areas wachniew 2006 in particular agricultural practices generally influence the soil carbon and facilitate the transports of soil co2 to fluvial networks li et al 2013 this explained the highest average pco2 1827 1 1135 9 μatm in xiongjia river fig 3 which had intensive agricultural practices along the river 14 14 of farmland moreover regular grazing and crop harvesting would enhance the land cover change pugh et al 2015 and subsequently promoted soil respiration arneth et al 2017 cropping systems trend to increase the contact rate between water and minerals which generally resulted in changes of alk and ph in surrounding waters and thus affected the riverine pco2 ran et al 2015a this was supported by the concomitantly high ph in may after the tillage period in late apr in this study area fig 2 this was in accordance with previous findings in the mississippi river raymond and cole 2003 urbanization may also contribute to large spatial variability of riverine pco2 and was regarded as another important anthropogenic control on co2 evasion martinez zarzoso and maruotti 2011 for example the instantaneous maximal value of pco2 8600 7 μatm was observed in xixi river when the river flowed through a village jilong fig 3 moreover urbanization had greatly increased the population density which was considered as an invasive process of hydrology and pathways in running waters huang et al 2012 it could observe a typical urbanization gradient along the xiongjia river 1 56 of urban land and thus the increasing trend of pco2 fig 4 suggested that human inputs represented the critical influence on riverine co2 on the other hand high terrain and steep channel slope were generally observed in the headwaters which would enhance the lateral inputs of excess co2 to streams from surrounding terrestrial ecosystems hope et al 2004 thus the decreasing trend along the dongxi river 82 73 of forest 5 47 of grass and 0 39 of urban land could attribute to dilution effect and rapidly co2 outgassing but decreasingly terrestrial c inputs from upstream to downstream hotchkiss et al 2015 li et al 2018 4 3 relationships between pco2 and environmental parameters similar to the pco2 the environmental parameters such as tdn tdp doc and twater were the comprehensive results of geographical gradients biogeochemical patterns and metabolic process kamjunke et al 2013 kernan et al 2009 for example geographical gradients and geochemical patterns generally affect the terrestrial inputs of nutrients and doc which could be utilized by subsequent aquatic metabolic process ye et al 2018 thus environmental parameters could be the important predictors for pco2 dynamics and further exhibited the correlations with riverine pco2 our findings in the rainy season were similar to some studies hope et al 1996 larsen et al 2011 yet the findings in the dry season were consistent with other observations sjöstedt et al 2013 pinho et al 2016 trophic status could reveal aquatic biological process and terrestrial influence kuzyakov and cheng 2001 which resulted in varied positive negative or indiscernible relations of pco2 nutrients finlay et al 2009 wang et al 2017 prior studies reported that rivers in the tgr region including the daning river exhibited the very low chla concentrations li et al 2018 this suggested that the respiration was the dominant of biological process quay et al 1995 in this context positive correlation of tdn pco2 in the rainy season pco2 tdn r2 0 268 p 0 001 fig 7 indicated that the increase of tdn potentially boosted the respiration smith and kemp 2003 however in the condition of low doc concentrations 1 52 1 65 mg l the respiration derived couplings of pco2 tdp could be simply masked and the increase of tdp resulted in negative correlation rainy season r2 0 237 p 0 001 lapierre et al 2013 the significant relationship of pco2 twater pco2 40 46e0 166t water r2 0 530 p 0 001 was observed in the rainy season which showed temperature dependency of aquatic metabolism campeau and del giorgio 2014 thus the multiple regression exhibited the significant relations between pco2 tdn and twater pco2 143 3twater 640 1tdn 1785 3 r2 0 468 p 0 001 however for the small rivers and streams the homogeneity and internal relativity of physical and biogeochemical characteristics can be halted in the dry season knapp et al 2008 as a consequence there were very weak relationships in the low runoff period the dry season pco2 tdn r2 0 083 p 0 05 pco2 tdp r2 0 015 p 0 05 pco2 twater r2 0 0006 p 0 05 which evidenced the essentiality of precipitation and hydrological runoff in nutrients transport and similar results have also been found in other rivers karrh et al 2005 strobl et al 2009 li et al 2018 observed the relationships between pco2 and nutrients in the dry season but no significant relationships in the wet season in the tgr the distinct results might be due to the fact that heavy precipitation and runoff in large rivers can dilute the chemical loads and thus simply mask the relationships müller et al 2012 in this context hydrological flow controlled the connections between pco2 and environmental parameters in rivers previous studies reported that doc could be a predictor of pco2 in a smaller regional scale because of the internal metabolic processes macgilchrist et al 2014 wen et al 2017 however there were no significant relationships between pco2 and doc concentration across the seasons p 0 05 fig 7 our findings were similar to the observations elsewhere campeau and del giorgio 2014 doc was controlled by complex hydrographic and environmental factors such as elevation runoff vegetation types land use and ecosystem mann and wetzel 1995 oh et al 2013 smith et al 2014 the effects of these factors could mask the relationships between doc and pco2 especially in the condition of low doc concentration in addition our earlier work demonstrated that biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc had a median value of around 20 in the tgr river networks mao et al 2016 therefore there was a very limited effect of doc on pco2 in the daning river because of low doc concentrations 1 52 mg l 4 4 co2 outgassing to the atmosphere the mean pco2 value 1198 2 1122 9 μatm was in accordance with the previous estimates on the mainstem of the yangtze river 1235 515 μatm liu et al 2016 or 1297 μatm wang et al 2007 but it was lower than most of the reported rivers in china for example the xijiang and the yellow river were 2 2 fold 2600 μatm yao et al 2007 and 2 3 fold 2810 1985 μatm ran et al 2015b higher than the daning river respectively for comparison pco2 estimated previously in the tgr region of the yangtze river was 1493 209 μatm which was partially influenced by water impounding during the year liu et al 2017 and consistent with recent observation in tgr tributaries 1425 μatm li et al 2018 the daning river is located in the upper reaches of the tgr an average elevation of 421 m and thus less impacts from the reservoir we highlight that local environmental parameters resulted in large heterogeneity of the riverine pco2 the pco2 levels in all of the listed rivers were higher than the atmospheric co2 equilibrium 410 μatm table 3 the results suggested that these rivers were oversaturated in co2 and thus acted the co2 sources to the atmosphere our estimated results of co2 degassing rates in the daning river were greater than most of the reported rivers table 3 the highest daytime co2 flux was found in the yellow river 856 409 mmol m2 d followed by wiesent river 450 mmol m2 d geldern et al 2015 whereas lowest flux 39 mmol m2 d was observed in the yangtze river the water air co2 exchange was highly dependent on gas transfer velocity k therefore despite the comparable pco2 values that were found the daytime co2 flux of the daning river 329 8 470 2 mmol m2 d was 1 7 fold and 1 2 fold higher than the lower mekong river 195 mmol m2 d and the mississippi river 270 mmol m2 d respectively in this study highest flux 770 7 570 2 mmol m2 d was observed in aug summer season which indicated that high temperature favoured the co2 degassing aufdenkampe et al 2011 the similar results were found in the lower mekong river tropical river different seasons showed the similar k values 10 5 vs 7 8 m dm d for the rainy and the dry seasons and pco2 1243 7 1111 5 vs 1145 5 1146 2 μatm for the rainy and the dry seasons the total co2 efflux of the daning river was estimated at 0 12 tg co2 y accounting for 5 2 of evasion from the tgr river networks li et al 2018 rivers and streams not only emit aquatic co2 to the atmosphere but also relocate and transport the dissolved carbon which contributes to running water co2 evasion billett et al 2007 by compiling the data of surface runoff 81 6 m3 s shen et al 2008 we estimated that annual discharge of riverine dissolved carbon dic and doc into the tgr were 0 081 and 0 004 tg c y respectively with 0 033 tg c y upper limit of 0 042 tg c y due to seasonal variations of the water surface area of vertical co2 emission previous studies identified drivers of rivers and streams carbon flux such as direct carbon inputs from land aquatic metabolism and co2 emissions hotchkiss et al 2015 wegener et al 2017 our estimated carbon loss via atmospheric exchange accounted for 38 8 upper limit of 49 4 of riverine dissolved carbon discharge thus the magnitude of co2 emissions should be better considered when evaluating riverine carbon loss 5 conclusion co2 degassing from inland rivers and streams plays a key role in global and regional carbon cycle this study investigated the riverine pco2 and co2 degassing in the daning river a typical tributary in the upper yangtze the results displayed that 85 of samplings were supersaturated in co2 the pco2 levels on the main stem and its tributaries presented the significant spatial and temporal variations with an average of 1198 2 1122 9 μatm natural variability and anthropogenic activities regulated co2 emissions environmental parameters such as tdn tdp and water temperature showed the relations with the aqueous pco2 levels in the rainy season but very weak relations in the dry season the daytime water air co2 flux in the investigated subtropical river reported an average of 329 8 470 2 mmol m2 d resulting in the co2 efflux of 0 12 tg co2 y which accounted for 38 8 of riverine dissolved carbon delivery in the daning river our results suggested that the controls of riverine pco2 should be

6771,rivers and streams are important agents for global and regional carbon cycle which represent a nonnegligible carbon source to the atmosphere however carbon dioxide co2 degassing via water air interface from inland waters currently has a large uncertainty in estimation here we examined the co2 partial pressure pco2 and co2 degassing in the daning river a main tributary of the yangtze in the three gorges reservoir tgr region the riverine pco2 showed obvious spatial and temporal variations on the main stem and its tributaries ranging from 483 2 293 9 μatm may to 2183 3 1309 2 μatm august with an average of 1198 2 1122 9 μatm pco2 increased with the intensive agricultural practices and population on the lower reach of the tributary the daytime average water air co2 flux was 329 8 470 2 mmol m2 d and yielded a total co2 efflux approximately 0 12 tg co2 y the results also indicated that carbon loss via atmospheric exchange accounted for 38 8 of riverine dissolved carbon fluxes there were close relations between pco2 and environmental parameters such as total dissolved nitrogen tdn total dissolved phosphorus tdp and water temperature in the rainy season but not in the dry season our results demonstrated the essential need to highlight the importance of anthropogenic activities on global and regional co2 outgassing and it is urgent to underscore the detailed biogeochemical processes in riverine pco2 as well as the couplings between pco2 and environmental parameters keywords co2 emission co2 partial pressure pco2 water air gas exchange anthropogenic controls subtropical river three gorges reservoir 1 introduction river systems play an important role in global and regional carbon cycle richey et al 2002 selvam et al 2014 fluvial networks not only serve as significant vectors of hydrologic and biogeochemical processes for organic and inorganic carbon transport striegl et al 2012 mann et al 2015 but also represent the autonomous carbon dioxide co2 emitters to the atmosphere li and bush 2015 teodoru et al 2009 the worldwide rivers are supersaturated with co2 due to the inputs of terrestrial source and in situ aquatic respiration and thus have a high potential of co2 emissions 1 8 0 25 pg c y 1 lapierre et al 2013 ran et al 2017 raymond et al 2013 however terrestrial co2 transport and in stream respiration are highly variable hotchkiss et al 2015 liu et al 2017 and it is urgent to systematically quantify the magnitude of regional co2 degassing co2 concentrations and proportions in the waters and atmosphere are affected by terrestrial environment aquatic respiration photosynthesis hydrologic dynamics and climate dubois et al 2010 stavang et al 2010 wen et al 2017 in general partial pressure of aqueous co2 pco2 generated from mineralization of terrestrial organic matter and respiration in aquatic ecosystem dominates the magnitude of gas exchange and direction at the water air interface li et al 2012 khadka et al 2014 besides anthropogenic activities increase the carbon inputs and alter the environment and thus mediate riverine pco2 arneth et al 2017 ran et al 2015a however the systematic study on anthropogenic controls of riverine co2 outgassing and carbon cycle remains limited van oost et al 2007 previous studies indicated that 95 of pco2 in rivers and streams were higher than in atmosphere and had an average of 2300 μatm finlay 2003 raymond et al 2013 the published data reported that the global co2 flux from inland surface waters to the atmosphere was within 0 75 2 1 pg c y 1 which was comparable to the net carbon accumulation of continents 2 2 pg c y 1 tranvik et al 2009 aufdenkampe et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 these results suggested that freshwater systems especially rivers and streams were the important contributors of carbon transportation and co2 emissions thus characterization of riverine pco2 and co2 degassing should be taken for better understanding the role of river networks on regional and global carbon cycles the three gorges reservoir tgr is the important water conservancy project for irrigation and hydroelectric power in this region typical subtropical monsoon climate and enormous population density may cause the co2 saturation in the main stream and tributaries of the yangtze river yang et al 2013 huang et al 2017 in china previous studies suggested that riverine pco2 2600 2810 μatm and co2 flux 274 856 mmol m2 d were high on the large rivers e g the yellow and the pearl river ran et al 2015a yao et al 2007 they were higher than that on the mekong 1090 μatm for pco2 and 195 mmol m2 d for co2 flux and mississippi rivers 1335 μatm for pco2 and 270 mmol m2 d for co2 flux li et al 2013 dubois et al 2010 in particular the observations from yangtze river system reported a higher annual average pco2 in major tributaries 1744 899 μatm than that on the main stem 1235 515 μatm liu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 thus tributaries of large rivers and streams are vital to examine spatiotemporal distribution of pco2 across the river networks prior researches on the tgr and its tributaries exhibited the pronounced seasonal and spatial divergences on riverine pco2 and co2 fluxes estimates yang et al 2013 huang et al 2015 li et al 2017 nonetheless fluvial networks in this area are not well documented for carbon emission our preliminary study reported the strong spatial and temporal variations of pco2 and high co2 emission rates 330 mmol m2 d from these mountainous rivers in the tgr area based on two rounds of field campaigns li et al 2018 therefore limited measurements from the whole catchment potentially result in large uncertainty of co2 emission especially for site specific riverine pco2 with the distinct natural and anthropogenic controls in this context detailed field co2 measurements with complete coverage of the main tributary in the tgr region upper yangtze are very necessary the daning river is a representative tributary of the upper yangtze river in the tgr region the area exhibits the significant urbanization gradient from natural conditions to the intensive agricultural practices or urban and yet understandings of riverine co2 outgassing and transport are not available the objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the spatial and temporal variations of riverine pco2 and 2 examine the controls of variations and coupling relationships between pco2 and environmental parameters as well as 3 quantify daytime water air co2 flux our novel contributions are to unravel the mechanisms of natural and anthropogenic controls on riverine co2 emissions and explore the key drivers on the aquatic pco2 based on detailed field works here the seasonal and spatial characteristics of pco2 and co2 degassing in the daning river are examined our results highlight that anthropogenic activities overall increase riverine pco2 and also greatly alter the environmental controls of pco2 which is expected to improve the understandings of regional and global co2 outgassing under global change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the daning river is the main tributary of the yangtze in the tgr region fig 1 where the largest scale of hydroelectric station is located and has a length of 250 km and drains an area of 4426 km2 our sampling sites were mainly distributed in upper reach with a minimal elevation of 185 m and thus not influenced by tgr operation the daning river 31 04 31 44 n 108 44 110 11 e located in wushan county and wuxi county chongqing and lies in a subtropical monsoon climate zone the annual mean temperature

rainfall and january 1 of the annual rainfall respectively according to the statistics in gauging station wuxi station the annual mean runoff ranges from 37 8 to 106 m3 s with an average of 81 6 m3 s and the monthly runoff varies between 13 9 m3 s january and 158 2 m3 s july in general the runoff in the rainy season is 6 0 fold higher than that in the dry season the watershed has a high mountain canyon topography and mountains cover 95 of the total area the limestone carbonates dolomite carbonates and shale quartz and calcite compose the major rock types the main soil type chinese soil classification is yellow soil followed by yellow brown soil brown soil and calcareous soil shi et al 2006 landsat tm in january in 2015 and digital elevation model dem data were extracted using envi 5

urban land is another tributary in the downstream reach and flows through the populated area with intensive agricultural practices the tributary has a clear urbanization gradient anthropogenic activities constitute the important component of hydrographic and environmental influence the detailed sampling information and hydrological characteristics are listed in the supplement materials appendix table a1 2 2 water sampling and analyses five field campaigns both in rainy may 2016 august 2016 and july 2017 and dry seasons november 2016 and march 2017 were carried out and a total of 164 samples were collected from 33 locations in the daning river fig 1 our field work was performed in the forenoon from 9 00 am to 12 00 pm or afternoon from 14 00 pm to 18 00 pm and each sampling site was revisited based on previous sampling time this intended to minimize the influence from diurnal fluctuation light intensity and temperature shifts on the samples each water sample was taken from the riverbank at approximately 10 cm below the water surface li et al 2018 samples were filtered through glass microfiber filters gf f 47 mm 0 7 μm whatman and preserved in the high density polyethylene plastic containers 50 ml and 100 ml to avoid any headspace or air bubbles the containers were completely sealed filtered samples for doc and nutrient measurements were acidified to ph 2

spectrophotometric method wei et al 2013 and total dissolved phosphorus tdp was determined by ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method wu et al 2011 2 3 pco2 calculations riverine pco2 was calculated using co2sys software this program is based on the equilibrium of carbonate system parameters alk dic the fugacity of co2 fco2 or pco2 and ph which employs two of the four parameters to calculate the other two parameters in freshwaters the definition of alk can be described by the formula 1 fco2 is approximately 0 3 lower than pco2 at pressures of 1 atm and which is dependent on dic

alk were collected as the essential data li and zhang 2014 li et al 2016 recently co2sys has been widely employed for aquatic pco2 calculations penman et al 2013 tortell et al 2015 especially for rivers and streams with ph 7 and low doc concentration li et al 2013 thus co2sys are generally considered as a simplified and reliable method ries 2011 2 4 water air co2 flux calculations the theoretical model thin boundary layer was employed to calculate the water air co2 flux f as follows 6 f k k h pco 2 w a t e r pco 2 a i r 7 k h 10 1 11 0 016 t 0 00007 t 2 where k refers to gas

2014 unit in μatm kh is the henry s constant of co2 corrected by formula 7 using temperature t in c unit in mmol m3 μatm specially gas transfer velocity k was affected by some hydrologic and environmental factors i e channel slope flow velocity wind speed and water depth but mostly by wind speed and water turbulence telmer and veizer 1999 li et al 2013 literature demonstrated k vales were highly variable i e 8 115 cm h and most studies did not measure k directly aucour et al 1999 extensive studies have been made to calibrate the k value alin et al 2011 raymond et al 2012 recent research reported that current velocity was the dominant source of near surface water turbulence at a large spatial scale galfalk et al 2013 liu et al 2017 and thus the flow velocity was employed for

the standard procedures and methods described by alekin et al 1973 and the american public health association 1985 the ph probe was calibrated prior to measurement with ph standard solution 4 01 7 00 and 9 18 at 25 c the do and ec probes were calibrated with in situ water saturated air and 12 88 ms cm standard potassium chloride solution replicate measurements indicated the accuracies for ph water temperature do and ec were 0 002 ph units 0 5 c 2 and 1 respectively the alk was determined using a fixed end point titration method filtered water 20 ml was titrated with 0 0200 m hcl calibrated with 0 02 m naoh and 1 2 drops of 0 1 helianthine b was employed as the acid base indicator three parallel titrations suggested the uncertainty of the alk titrated with 0 0200 mol l hcl were below 3 ran et al 2015a the measuring of tdn and tdp was replicated coefficient of variance 5 doc concentrations were determined in triplicate coefficient of variance 2 the outliers were picked out and the average of readings was record previous study had concluded that random errors were typically low 2 of median value for ph and total alkalinity in carbonate equilibrium and temperature uncertainty had a negligible effect on pco2 golub et al 2017 moreover the uncertainties of pco2 estimate mainly stem from the non carbonate alkalinity nc alk which is generally dominated by contributions of nitrogen phosphorus silicate and organic species abril et al 2015 in this study the mean values of tdn tdp and doc were respectively 43 6 μm 1 02 μm and 126 7 μm and nc alk could be simply ignored when riverine ph 7 4 hunt et al 2011 thus the contributions of nitrogen phosphorus and organic acid were minor lozovik 2005 li et al 2012 the pco2 could be underestimated due to the diurnal cycles in this study for instance pco2 at night could be 1 3 fold higher than that at daytime because of the variations of metabolic activity which further affects the regional co2 evasion morales pineda et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 available landsat tm in january 2015 dry season and digital elevation model dem data were employed for data extraction of the water surface area prior observations suggested that the water surface area in the rainy season was 1 3 1 5 times an average of 1 4 times higher than that in the dry season for subtropical rivers in china ran et al 2015b this may result in the underestimation 28 of annual co2 flux in this study 2 6 statistical analyses normality and homogeneity of data were tested by kolmogorov smirnov and levene s test the data that did not obey a normal distribution were transformed by the natural logarithm simple linear regressions and multiple regression analyses were employed to explore the relationship between pco2 and the environmental parameters including biogeochemical and physical variables tdn tdp doc and twater analysis of variance anova monthly variations and the mann whitney u test seasonal variations were used for significance test of hydrographic and environmental parameters all statistical analyses were performed using spss statistical package 19 0 and originlab originpro 2017 all the figures were prepared

whereas twater showed significant differences p 0 001 between the two seasons similar k600 averages 45 5and 42 5 cm h respectively were observed across the seasons which coincided with the

for dic 2630 5 518 2 μm in average 3 3 spatial and temporal variability of pco2 the pco2 exhibited pronounced spatial and monthly variations in the daning river p 0 001 fig 2 and fig 3 ranged from 483 2 293 9 μatm in may to 2183 3 1309 2 μatm in aug fig 2 on average the pco2 levels were comparable in the rainy season 1243 7 1111 5 μatm and the dry season 1145 5 1146 2 μatm mann whitney u test p 0 05 our results indicated that the mean pco2 in the daning river was 1198 2 1122 9 μatm similar to the temporal variations pco2 in the main stem and tributaries exhibited the complicated spatial patterns fig 3 the pco2 levels ranged from 261 9 μatm to 3526 3 μatm in the main stem both the highest 8600 7 μatm and lowest 190 0 μatm pco2 were occurred on xixi river the results showed 85 of samplings were supersaturated in co2 than the atmospheric co2 equilibrium on average pco2 in tributaries 1248 3 1162 0 μatm was much higher than that in the main stem 892 8 785 8 μatm mann whitney u test p 0 05 for example there was a 2 fold decrease of the pco2 from the lower reach tributary xiongjia river 1827 1 1135 9 μatm to the main stem fig 3 spatial average indicated that a decreasing trend along the flow direction of pco2 could be identified on the uppermost reach tributary whereas the reverse phenomenon was observed on the lower tributary in the rainy season fig 4 for example the pco2 levels roughly decreased from upstream 3006 9 μatm for site 1 to downstream 1256 5 μatm for site 8 for dongxi river but increased from headwaters 1572 9 μatm for site 9 to downstream 3455 0 μatm for site 13 for xiongjia river however there were very weak downward trends for the sites of dongxi river and irregular spatial variations for xiongjia river in the dry season in the tributaries both

dry season r2 0 045 p 0 05 table 2 4 discussion 4 1 controls of natural variability on pco2 riverine pco2 varied with intricate hydrological and biogeochemical processes commonly considered as important controls for co2 degassing cai et al 2004 abril et al 2005 in this context transport of soil co2 via runoff and in situ aquatic mineralization of organic matter increase pco2 levels johnson et al 2008 on the other hand photosynthesis by aquatic plants and subsequent co2 outgassing from water to atmosphere can decrease the pco2 richey et al 2004 khadka et al 2014 nutrient loads lead to the changes of the biomass dynamic and the structure of organisms and thus control the aquatic respiration photosynthesis samuelsson et al 2002 our findings showed low tdn 0 61 0 56 mg l and tdp concentrations 0 032 0 020 mg l fig 6 suggesting that the internal biological processes respiration and photosynthesis were relatively limited however it was also possible that the nutrients were rapidly cycled between organic and inorganic phases which could be potentially important for in stream processes quay et al 1995 seasonal temperature and precipitation influenced the aquatic pco2 as it was the dominant effect on soil respiration and carbon transportation hope et al 2004 in this study pco2 in aug 2183 3 1309 2 μatm was significantly higher than in other months fig 2 which was attributed to enhancement of soil respiration by warm temperature 25 8 37 0 c and wetted soils in the monsoonal rainfall season li et al 2013 the concentrated rainfall also promoted rapid kinetics of hydrological cycle jung et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 which resulted in very low pco2 410 μatm in may similar observations i e lower pco2 of 451 μatm were also found in the upper yangtze in the rainy season li et al 2012 in aquatic ecosystems organic carbon could be biodegraded into co2 by respiration of microbes guillemette et al 2013 this could explain that low pco2 levels were observed in the months that had low doc concentrations figs 2 and 4 however the internal primary production was a non essential driver for low pco2 due to the low chla 0 5 μg l in this region li et al 2018 moreover the local topography and hydrology also showed multiple mechanisms influencing pco2 li et al 2013 for example physical characteristics of the catchment such as land use pattern vegetation cover and soil organic content soc have important influences on riverine pco2 the former two factors are important controls of hydrologic dynamics and chemical composition in rivers ghaffari et al 2010 jeong 2001 soil organic content and hydrological processes are closely linked to terrestrial organic carbon losses to rivers and thus greatly mediated pco2 in rivers arneth et al 2017 klaminder et al 2010 the tributaries with small watershed area but high flow velocity zhou et al 2012 enhanced the terrestrial co2 and organic carbon inputs hotchkiss et al 2015 our results suggested that the pco2 and the watershed area showed the relatively limited co variation in the daning river fig s2 thus despite the significant monthly shifts p 0 001 for pco2 fig 2 our estimation showed the comparable pco2 levels between the rainy season 1243 7 1111 5 μatm and the dry season 1145 5 1146 2 μatm dissolution of carbonate minerals resulted in high alkalinity 2599 7 506 8 μeq l and dic concentrations 2630 5 518 2 μm in the daning river and thus potentially contributed to the pco2 levels meanwhile the relatively low co2 evasion could be observed in the carbonate dominated regions when it compared to the silicate terrains khadka et al 2014 this suggested that catchment lithology could be an important control of riverine co2 martin 2017 pu et al 2016 4 2 controls of anthropogenic activities on pco2 anthropogenic activities can affect the aquatic pco2 by direct carbon inputs but also regulate co2 emissions in waters through altering the terrestrial environment skurlatov and ernestova 2010 gu et al 2017 riverine pco2 was highly dependent on site specific factors such as primary productivity and land derived organic carbon liu et al 2016 human activities generally change these factors bueno et al 2010 which cause some isolated and incongruous observations of the pco2 in densely populated areas wachniew 2006 in particular agricultural practices generally influence the soil carbon and facilitate the transports of soil co2 to fluvial networks li et al 2013 this explained the highest average pco2 1827 1 1135 9 μatm in xiongjia river fig 3 which had intensive agricultural practices along the river 14 14 of farmland moreover regular grazing and crop harvesting would enhance the land cover change pugh et al 2015 and subsequently promoted soil respiration arneth et al 2017 cropping systems trend to increase the contact rate between water and minerals which generally resulted in changes of alk and ph in surrounding waters and thus affected the riverine pco2 ran et al 2015a this was supported by the concomitantly high ph in may after the tillage period in late apr in this study area fig 2 this was in accordance with previous findings in the mississippi river raymond and cole 2003 urbanization may also contribute to large spatial variability of riverine pco2 and was regarded as another important anthropogenic control on co2 evasion martinez zarzoso and maruotti 2011 for example the instantaneous maximal value of pco2 8600 7 μatm was observed in xixi river when the river flowed through a village jilong fig 3 moreover urbanization had greatly increased the population density which was considered as an invasive process of hydrology and pathways in running waters huang et al 2012 it could observe a typical urbanization gradient along the xiongjia river 1 56 of urban land and thus the increasing trend of pco2 fig 4 suggested that human inputs represented the critical influence on riverine co2 on the other hand high terrain and steep channel slope were generally observed in the headwaters which would enhance the lateral inputs of excess co2 to streams from surrounding terrestrial ecosystems hope et al 2004 thus the decreasing trend along the dongxi river 82 73 of forest 5 47 of grass and 0 39 of urban land could attribute to dilution effect and rapidly co2 outgassing but decreasingly terrestrial c inputs from upstream to downstream hotchkiss et al 2015 li et al 2018 4 3 relationships between pco2 and environmental parameters similar to the pco2 the environmental parameters such as tdn tdp doc and twater were the comprehensive results of geographical gradients biogeochemical patterns and metabolic process kamjunke et al 2013 kernan et al 2009 for example geographical gradients and geochemical patterns generally affect the terrestrial inputs of nutrients and doc which could be utilized by subsequent aquatic metabolic process ye et al 2018 thus environmental parameters could be the important predictors for pco2 dynamics and further exhibited the correlations with riverine pco2 our findings in the rainy season were similar to some studies hope et al 1996 larsen et al 2011 yet the findings in the dry season were consistent with other observations sjöstedt et al 2013 pinho et al 2016 trophic status could reveal aquatic biological process and terrestrial influence kuzyakov and cheng 2001 which resulted in varied positive negative or indiscernible relations of pco2 nutrients finlay et al 2009 wang et al 2017 prior studies reported that rivers in the tgr region including the daning river exhibited the very low chla concentrations li et al 2018 this suggested that the respiration was the dominant of biological process quay et al 1995 in this context positive correlation of tdn pco2 in the rainy season pco2 tdn r2 0 268 p 0 001 fig 7 indicated that the increase of tdn potentially boosted the respiration smith and kemp 2003 however in the condition of low doc concentrations 1 52 1 65 mg l the respiration derived couplings of pco2 tdp could be simply masked and the increase of tdp resulted in negative correlation rainy season r2 0 237 p 0 001 lapierre et al 2013 the significant relationship of pco2 twater pco2 40 46e0 166t water r2 0 530 p 0 001 was observed in the rainy season which showed temperature dependency of aquatic metabolism campeau and del giorgio 2014 thus the multiple regression exhibited the significant relations between pco2 tdn and twater pco2 143 3twater 640 1tdn 1785 3 r2 0 468 p 0 001 however for the small rivers and streams the homogeneity and internal relativity of physical and biogeochemical characteristics can be halted in the dry season knapp et al 2008 as a consequence there were very weak relationships in the low runoff period the dry season pco2 tdn r2 0 083 p 0 05 pco2 tdp r2 0 015 p 0 05 pco2 twater r2 0 0006 p 0 05 which evidenced the essentiality of precipitation and hydrological runoff in nutrients transport and similar results have also been found in other rivers karrh et al 2005 strobl et al 2009 li et al 2018 observed the relationships between pco2 and nutrients in the dry season but no significant relationships in the wet season in the tgr the distinct results might be due to the fact that heavy precipitation and runoff in large rivers can dilute the chemical loads and thus simply mask the relationships müller et al 2012 in this context hydrological flow controlled the connections between pco2 and environmental parameters in rivers previous studies reported that doc could be a predictor of pco2 in a smaller regional scale because of the internal metabolic processes macgilchrist et al 2014 wen et al 2017 however there were no significant relationships between pco2 and doc concentration across the seasons p 0 05 fig 7 our findings were similar to the observations elsewhere campeau and del giorgio 2014 doc was controlled by complex hydrographic and environmental factors such as elevation runoff vegetation types land use and ecosystem mann and wetzel 1995 oh et al 2013 smith et al 2014 the effects of these factors could mask the relationships between doc and pco2 especially in the condition of low doc concentration in addition our earlier work demonstrated that biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc had a median value of around 20 in the tgr river networks mao et al 2016 therefore there was a very limited effect of doc on pco2 in the daning river because of low doc concentrations 1 52 mg l 4 4 co2 outgassing to the atmosphere the mean pco2 value 1198 2 1122 9 μatm was in accordance with the previous estimates on the mainstem of the yangtze river 1235 515 μatm liu et al 2016 or 1297 μatm wang et al 2007 but it was lower than most of the reported rivers in china for example the xijiang and the yellow river were 2 2 fold 2600 μatm yao et al 2007 and 2 3 fold 2810 1985 μatm ran et al 2015b higher than the daning river respectively for comparison pco2 estimated previously in the tgr region of the yangtze river was 1493 209 μatm which was partially influenced by water impounding during the year liu et al 2017 and consistent with recent observation in tgr tributaries 1425 μatm li et al 2018 the daning river is located in the upper reaches of the tgr an average elevation of 421 m and thus less impacts from the reservoir we highlight that local environmental parameters resulted in large heterogeneity of the riverine pco2 the pco2 levels in all of the listed rivers were higher than the atmospheric co2 equilibrium 410 μatm table 3 the results suggested that these rivers were oversaturated in co2 and thus acted the co2 sources to the atmosphere our estimated results of co2 degassing rates in the daning river were greater than most of the reported rivers table 3 the highest daytime co2 flux was found in the yellow river 856 409 mmol m2 d followed by wiesent river 450 mmol m2 d geldern et al 2015 whereas lowest flux 39 mmol m2 d was observed in the yangtze river the water air co2 exchange was highly dependent on gas transfer velocity k therefore despite the comparable pco2 values that were found the daytime co2 flux of the daning river 329 8 470 2 mmol m2 d was 1 7 fold and 1 2 fold higher than the lower mekong river 195 mmol m2 d and the mississippi river 270 mmol m2 d respectively in this study highest flux 770 7 570 2 mmol m2 d was observed in aug summer season which indicated that high temperature favoured the co2 degassing aufdenkampe et al 2011 the similar results were found in the lower mekong river tropical river different seasons showed the similar k values 10 5 vs 7 8 m dm d for the rainy and the dry seasons and pco2 1243 7 1111 5 vs 1145 5 1146 2 μatm for the rainy and the dry seasons the total co2 efflux of the daning river was estimated at 0 12 tg co2 y accounting for 5 2 of evasion from the tgr river networks li et al 2018 rivers and streams not only emit aquatic co2 to the atmosphere but also relocate and transport the dissolved carbon which contributes to running water co2 evasion billett et al 2007 by compiling the data of surface runoff 81 6 m3 s shen et al 2008 we estimated that annual discharge of riverine dissolved carbon dic and doc into the tgr were 0 081 and 0 004 tg c y respectively with 0 033 tg c y upper limit of 0 042 tg c y due to seasonal variations of the water surface area of vertical co2 emission previous studies identified drivers of rivers and streams carbon flux such as direct carbon inputs from land aquatic metabolism and co2 emissions hotchkiss et al 2015 wegener et al 2017 our estimated carbon loss via atmospheric exchange accounted for 38 8 upper limit of 49 4 of riverine dissolved carbon discharge thus the magnitude of co2 emissions should be better considered when evaluating riverine carbon loss 5 conclusion co2 degassing from inland rivers and streams plays a key role in global and regional carbon cycle this study investigated the riverine pco2 and co2 degassing in the daning river a typical tributary in the upper yangtze the results displayed that 85 of samplings were supersaturated in co2 the pco2 levels on the main stem and its tributaries presented the significant spatial and temporal variations with an average of 1198 2 1122 9 μatm natural variability and anthropogenic activities regulated co2 emissions environmental parameters such as tdn tdp and water temperature showed the relations with the aqueous pco2 levels in the rainy season but very weak relations in the dry season the daytime water air co2 flux in the investigated subtropical river reported an average of 329 8 470 2 mmol m2 d resulting in the co2 efflux of 0 12 tg co2 y which accounted for 38 8 of riverine dissolved carbon delivery in the daning river our results suggested that the controls of riverine pco2 should be

6772,an analytical model for describing pumping induced drawdown by constant head test at a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer is developed by treating the leakage of aquitard storage as an interface phenomenon rather than an volumetric effect which is the novel and never developed so far three different cases of remote lateral boundaries are considered in the model the new drawdown solution in laplace space is obtained and inverted into time domain solution utilizing the stehfest method the semi analytical solutions for well discharge are then obtained under three different cases analytical solutions in laplace and time domains are developed for calculating the total leakage rate and volume across the aquitard aquifer interface due to constant head test at a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer and such solutions are of great use for groundwater resource management based on the newly developed solutions the distribution of wellbore flowrate and aquitard leakage are explored and the sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the most important controlling factor the sensitivity analysis shows that the wellbore flowrate and the drawdown in infinite case 1 finite case 2 and closed case 3 leaky confined aquifer systems are both sensitive to the variation of well partial penetration well radius and aquifer anisotropic ratio during the whole pumping period and they are most sensitive to the change of outer boundary distance at late time for case 3 the effect of the outer boundary on the drawdown or wellbore flowrate is more significant for a shorter outer boundary distance keywords constant head test leaky confined aquifer leakage rate volume partially penetrating well sensitivity analysis 1 introduction constant head test is mainly used to test self flowing wells or to determine aquifer hydraulic parameters and therefore a large number of solutions for constant head test performed in a partially penetrating well have been developed yang and yeh 2005 derived a drawdown solution for constant head test at a partially penetrating well in a confined aquifer considering the effect of a finite skin using the method of laplace transform perina and lee 2006 provided a general well function for a partially penetrating well pumping at constant head or constant rate in a confined leaky or unconfined aquifer without considering the aquitard storage chang and yeh 2009 2010 developed drawdown analytical solutions for constant head test at a partially penetrating well in a confined aquifer using the dual series in combination with the perturbation method or the triple series equation method barua and bora 2010 presented steady quasi steady solutions of hydraulic head and wellbore flowrate induced by a partially penetrating well with a skin zone in a confined aquifer yang et al 2014 considered the effect of well partial penetration on hydraulic head during constant head test and obtained a simple approximate solution of hydraulic head distribution in a two zone confined aquifer based on the developed steady state solution and a formula concerning a time dependent diffusion layer provided by fang et al 2009 lin et al 2016 developed a general analytical drawdown solution in a two zone finite confined aquifer subjected to the robin type condition at both well face and outer boundaries but the pumping well is treated as a fully penetrating well rather than a partially penetrating well as for constant head test at a partially penetrating well in unconfined aquifers chang et al 2010 derived a transient hydraulic head solution for constant head test in a two zone unconfined aquifer with a partially penetrating well chang et al 2011 further developed a semi analytical solution of the transient drawdown for constant head test in a partially penetrating well in an unconfined aquifer for flow in leaky aquifers the aquitard leakage is often treated in two ways in published hydraulic literatures the first way proposed by hantush and jacob 1955 is to impose the leakage as a volumetric source sink term on the governing flow equation which is widely used in well hydraulic because of its simplicity e g hantush 1959 1964 moench 1985 zhan and bian 2006 hunt and scott 2007 lin and yeh 2017 for instance hantush 1964 obtained the analytical expression of drawdown induced by a partially penetrating well in a semi confined aquifer with a constant pumping rate hunt and scot 2007 treated the leakage effect in hantush and jacob 1955 and developed an approximate solution for flow to a fully penetrating pumping well in two aquifer system lin and yeh 2017 obtained the drawdown solution induced by a constant rate pumping well fully penetrating in a leaky confined aquifer with considering the effect of the phase lags however the treatment of the aquitard leakage in hantush and jacob 1955 does not accurately reflect the reality that the leakage occurs at the aquitard aquifer interface rather than happens over the whole aquifer volume to remedy this problem the other way is to treat the leakage as an interface phenomenon and some relevant studies include hunt 2005 bakker 2006 malama et al 2007 2008 feng and zhan 2015 2016 and sedghi et al 2018 for instance malama et al 2007 2008 imposed drawdown and flux continuity conditions at the aquifer aquitard interface and presented semi analytical solutions for flow in a leaky unconfined aquifer with a fully penetrating well and in an unconfined aquifer aquitard confined aquifer with a partially penetrating well pumped at constant rate the review of the recent studies shows that there are a limited number of researches on the constant head test in leaky aquifers by treating the aquitard leakage an interface problem additionally when a long term pumping test is performed in a confined aquifer the effect of cone of depression will inevitably propagate into the nearby aquitards resulting in release of water from aquitard storage due to the drop of pore pressure in the aquitards boulton s work 1963 1973 is one of the first to propose solutions for analyzing pumping tests in a such a scheme the effect of aquitard storage on drawdown distribution have been explored in studies including sun and zhan 2006 zhou et al 2009 feng and zhan 2016 and others for constant rate tests these studies illustrated that some errors would be caused if the effect of aquitard storage was neglected especially at the moderate pumping time with regard to constant head test in a leaky aquifer system hantush 1959 applied the laplace transform technique to obtain the transient drawdown and wellbore flowrate solutions with a fully penetrating well hantush 1959 considered the following outer boundaries 1 drawdown at infinity is zero 2 drawdown at a finite outer boundary is zero 3 flow across the finite outer boundary is zero hantush 1959 treated the leakage as a volumetric effect and neglected the aquitard storage effect kabala and cassiani 1997 obtained a new solution for flow to a fully penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer with the help of the weber goldstein transform wen et al 2011 developed a mathematical model for constant head test with the use of a fully penetrating well in an infinite leaky aquifer taking the finite thickness skin into account recently lin et al 2017 obtained solutions of drawdown and wellbore flowrate due to constant head test in a leaky unconfined aquifer considering well partial penetration unsaturated flow process and infinitesimal thickness skin the well skin is usually developed during the well installation process including well development and or clogging and it can be treated either as infinitesimally thin or with a finite thickness e g novakowski 1989 markle et al 1995 cassiani and kabala 1998 chang and chen 2002 feng and zhan 2016 assuming an infinitesimally thin skin will simply the skin effect into a skin factor and thus is employed in this study assuming a finite thickness skin will require a double zone approach to investigate the coupled flow process in the skin zone and the aquifer zone which will substantially complicate the mathematical model and will be reported elsewhere in the future precise quantification of leakage is an important issue in a leaky aquifer system hantush 1964 provided analytical expressions for calculating pumping induced leakage rate and cumulative volume in a leaky confined aquifer with a fully penetrating well pumping at constant rate or constant head butler and tsou 2003 offered a new method to quantify the leakage rate and volume across the aquitard aquifer interface in a laterally bounded leaky confined aquifer zhan and bian 2006 used the drawdown solution developed by hantush and jacob 1955 and hantush 1964 to obtain the analytical and semi analytical solutions of leakage rate and volume induced by constant head test or constant rate test with the use of a fully penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer neglecting aquitard storage zhou et al 2009 took the aquitard storage into account and developed semi analytical solutions to determine the leakage across the aquitard aquifer interface in a laterally bounded aquifer with a fully penetrating well pumping at constant rate considering the combined effects of well partial penetration aquitard storage and wellbore storage feng and zhan 2016 gave the solutions of leakage rate and volume induced by constant rate test in an aquitard aquifer system unfortunately little attention has been paid to the leakage rate and volume induced by constant head test with the use of a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer the aim of this study is to develop a new analytical model of constant head test with a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer with various lateral boundaries the novelty of the model is that the effect of aquitard storage and well partial penetration is considered in particular the effect of aquitard leakage is treated as an interface phenomenon rather than a volumetric effect to accurately delineate the physical leakage process the transient drawdown solution is derived and is further used to develop the wellbore flowrate solution closed form analytical and semi analytical solutions are presented to determine the leakage rate and leakage volume in addition a sensitivity analysis is conducted to access the wellbore flux and leakage rate in response to the relative changes of parameters of the aquifer and aquitard with the aid of the obtained solutions one can investigate the effects of aquitard storage well partial penetration skin effect and the outer boundary on the wellbore flux and leakage rate volume with a physically robust model the newly developed solution can also be applied to determine the hydraulic parameters of aquifers by using a parameter estimation code such as pest doherty et al 1994 or producing some type curves e g wellbore flowrate versus pumping time furthermore the obtained solutions are applicable in geotechnical engineering especially in the design of the dewatering system of deep excavation in which the confined groundwater level must be lowered using pumping well during excavation to ensure dry conditions and to improve safety wu et al 2016 pujades et al 2016 in addition it is also very important to qualify the total leakage rate and volume based on the presented solution from the perspective of groundwater management 2 mathematical models and solutions fig 1 shows a well of a finite radius rw pumped at a constant drawdown sw partially penetrating a leaky confined axisymmetric aquifer system of lateral extent rb l and d are the upper and lower vertical depths of the well screen relative to the base of the pumped aquifer respectively the main pumped aquifer is homogeneous vertically anisotropic of constant thickness b which is overlain by an aquitard and underlain by an impermeable formation the head in the unconfined aquifer or the surface water body overlying the aquitard is assumed to be constant the aquitard storage is considered the leakage effect from aquitard is not treated as a volumetric effect as done in hantush 1959 zhan and bian 2006 and many other studies but as an interface phenomenon including hantush 1967 bakker 2006 malama et al 2007 2008 and others additional assumptions made for the mathematical model are 1 the aquitard is homogeneous of finite thickness b 2 the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard k is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the aquifer so that flow in the aquitard is vertical neuman and witherspoon 1968 3 the system is hydrostatic before the pumping starts the origin of the coordinate system is located at the point of intersection between the center line of the well and the pumped aquifer base and the r and z axes are positive outward and upward respectively 2 1 problem statement based on the conceptual model described above the equation governing the drawdown distribution s r z t in the domain r w r r b and 0 z b for axisymmetric flow to a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer may be written as 1 k r r 1 r s r k z 2 s z 2 s s s t where kr and kz are the aquifer hydraulic conductivities in the radial and vertical directions l t respectively ss is the aquifer specific storage 1 l and t is the pumping time t the drawdown is initially zero 2 s r z 0 0 the outer boundary at rb for the main aquifer proposed by hantush 1959 can be described as 3 s r b z t 0 or s r r b z t 0 or s r r r b 0 note that eq 3 includes three expressions to describe 1 an infinite outer boundary case 1 2 an finite aquifer with a zero drawdown at finite outer boundary case 2 and 3 a closed aquifer with a no flow finite outer boundary case 3 and in the field situation aquifer with natural artificial laterally finite boundaries cases 2 and 3 may be encountered in part because of the relatively impermeable media and in part due to the invariant uninfluenced pumping drawdown van everdingen and hurst 1949 chen 1984 vilarrasa et al 2011 tsai and yeh 2012 wu et al 2016 therefore it is much needed to provide a simple and more direct semi analytical solution if possible for flow in a laterally finite aquifer aquitard system to consider the skin effect the thickness and the hydraulic conductivity of the skin are respectively r s and k s shown in fig 1 and after application of darcy s law across the skin one can obtain 4 k r 1 r s r r r w k s s w s r s where s l d 1 d l s r w z t d z refers to the average drawdown in the aquifer adjacent to the well screen taking the skin factor s k k r r s k s r w into consideration the well face boundary of constant head test for eq 4 can be rewritten as 5 1 l d d l s r w z t d z r w s k s r z t r r r w s w d z l due to the assumption that drawdown in the wellbore varies only with time it is reasonable that the drawdown at r rw is assumed to be independent of z then one can assume that the flux through the sand face r rw into the well is independent of z and varies in time only and following the studies of dougherty and babu 1984 moench 1997 and yang and yeh 2005 this condition can be written as at r rw d z l 6 k r s r r r w q t d z l eq 6 deserves some discussion in reality the flux over the well screen is a function of z for a well partially penetrating the pumped aquifer with greater fluxes near the two ends and relatively uniform flux along the central portion of the screen however determining such a z dependent and time dependent as well flux distribution along the screen will substantially increase the degree of complexity and requires much more computational time for simplification the flux is often simplified as uniformly distributed over the screen the validity of this simplification for practical purpose has been demonstrated in many previous studies e g dougherty and babu 1984 hantush 1964 kabala and cassiani 1997 moench 1997 yang and yeh 2005 lin and yeh 2017 the no flow boundary condition along the well casing can be expressed as dougherty and babu 1984 moench 1997 and yang and yeh 2005 7 k r s

ωn is determined using the newton raphson method press et al 1989 is related to p in eq 14 it could be difficult however to obtain the closed form solutions by applying the inverse laplace transform directly a number of studies e g moench 1985 perina and lee 2006 zhan and bian 2006 wen et al 2011 feng and zhan 2016 have shown that the stehfest method stehfest 1970 is sufficiently accurate to obtain the time domain solutions for similar flow problems thus will be used in this study as well when excluding the aquitard leakage effect and the skin effect the new solution agrees with that of yang and yeh 2005 eq 56 2 2 2 case 2 solutions in a finite leaky confined aquifer using the outer boundary condition described by case 2 in eq 3 the laplace domain drawdown solution for the pumped

2 3 case 3 solutions in closed leaky confined aquifer similarly if the outer boundary of case 3 in eq 3 is used the laplace domain drawdown solution for a closed leaky confined aquifer is given in the

time domain solutions using the stehfest method with the number of terms n 12 for the inversion 2 3 wellbore flowrate solution for constant head test the wellbore flowrate is often measured as a function of time and is our main concern therefore based on the newly obtained drawdown solution the solution of wellbore flowrate for constant head test conducted at a partially penetrating well is given by 20 q t 2 π r w l d k r s r z t r r r w 2 π r w l d q t considering the dimensionless parameters listed in table 1 and applying the laplace transform to eq 20 the dimensionless wellbore flowrate solution in laplace domain is 21 q d p 1 2 r wd l d d d q d p obviously the dimensionless wellbore flowrate solution for different cases can be easily obtained based on the new developed drawdown solutions and once again all the laplace domain solutions of wellbore flowrates are converted into their time domain solutions using the stehfest method with the number of 12 terms n 12 for the inversion 3 pumping induced leakage at the aquitard aquifer interface for leaky confined aquifers it is interesting to quantify the pumping induced leakage rate and volume at the aquitard aquifer interface from a groundwater management perspective therefore in this section the solutions for the leakage rate and leakage volume induced by constant head test with a partially penetrating well is provided 3 1 the solutions for pumping induced leakage rate the definition of pumping induced leakage rate γ within the radial distance of r from the well is given by zhan and bian 2006 zhou et al 2009 22 γ r t r w r 2 π r q d r r w r r 2 π r k s z z b d r introduction of the dimensionless parameters listed in table 1 eq 22 can be rewritten in the dimensionless form 23 γ d r d t d 1 2 r wd r d

pumping induced leakage volume v inside the range of a radial distance r and a given period of pumping time t can be calculated by integrating eq 22 with respect to t thus 25 v r t 0 t γ r t d d t d using the dimensionless parameters shown in table 1 one can obtain the dimensionless form of eq 25 in the time and laplace domain 26 v d r d t d 0 t γ d r d t d d t d and 27 v d r d p γ d r d p p according to eqs 22 27 the pumping induced leakage rate and leakage volume including laplace domain and steady state solutions of cumulative leakage rate and volume can be easily obtained from the newly developed drawdown solutions the detailed derivation can be found in part b of supplementary materials derivations of leakage solutions up to now the pumping induced leakage solutions in laplace domain and time domain for constant head test at a partially penetrating well with three different outer boundaries are obtained and are summarized in supplementary materials table s1 4 results and discussion in this section the characteristics of the wellbore flowrate and leakage rate or volume induced by constant head test at a partially penetrating well are analyzed in detail a sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate how sensitive the wellbore flowrate and leakage rate are to different hydraulic parameters the default parameter values for the following studies are given as rw 0 05 m b 5 m k 10 8 m s b 25 m l 18 75 m d 6 25 m ss 10 3 m 1 kz 10 5 m s kr 10 4 m s ss 2 10 5 m 1 the choice of such parameter values is similar to the study of moench 1985 and feng and zhan 2015 2016 4 1 analysis of the drawdown fig 2 shows the response of the dimensionless drawdown at rd 0 2 and zd 0 5 for constant head test performed using a partially penetrating well in leaky confined aquifers with three different outer boundaries with rbd 10 20 40 70 and this figure illustrates that drawdowns in pumped confined aquifers for all cases are not influenced by different outer boundaries at the early pumping period i e td 6 as expected the difference of the drawdown for three cases becomes gradually apparent as pumping time goes on at the late pumping time the drawdown for case 3 has no water supply from the no flow outer boundary and drawdown for case 2 has more water supply from a constant head outer boundary than that for case 1 with an infinite outer boundary thus one can see that drawdown for case 1 is smaller than that for case 3 and larger than that for case 2 at the late pumping period reflecting a strong influence of different outer boundaries on late drawdown in aquifers additionally fig 2 shows that a smaller rb d for case 2 results in a smaller drawdown while a larger rb d for case 3 leads to a smaller drawdown at late time this is because a larger rb d means that the pumped aquifer can provide more water from the aquifer storage meanwhile the effect of outer boundary on the drawdown can be neglected when rb d 70 note that the drawdowns for cases 2 and 3 at rbd are coincide with that for case 1 during the whole pumping period indicating that the solution in an infinite aquifer is the special case of the solution in a finite or closed aquifer finally fig 2 also indicates that the effect of the aquifer outer boundary on the drawdown starts much earlier for a shorter boundary distance rbd in case 2 while the opposite is true in case 3 implying that the boundary effect is more significant for a shorter rbd owing to the similar curve characteristic of the drawdown for different cases case 1 is then taken as an example to explore the drawdown responses induced by a partially penetrating well pumping at constant head test for the purpose of comparison several previous relevant studies will be included in the following analysis for example jacob and lohman 1952 obtained drawdown and wellbore flowrate solution due to a constant head pumping scenario at a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer without considering the leakage and skin effect yang and yeh 2005 took account of the effect of skin and well partial penetration and developed an analytical solution for drawdown and wellbore flowrate induced by constant head test in confined aquifer and the solution for the case of no skin was also given hantush 1959 gave a similar solution for constant head test at fully penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer by treating the leakage as a source or sink term added into the governing flow equation of pumped aquifer termed the hantush s approximation and it is worthy of pointing out that the storativity of aquitard and skin effect were not considered in his study fig 3 demonstrates the comparison of the dimensionless drawdown versus the dimensionless time at rd 0 2 and zd 0 5 obtained by the solution of case 1 of this study and the solutions of jacob and lohman 1952 yang and yeh 2005 and hantush 1959 note that the case for present solution neglecting the aquitard storage is also taken into account and the skin effect is not considered in this figure fig 3 indicates that the drawdown increases with the pumping time and reaches steady state at the late time for the pumped aquifer with leakage while the drawdown for the case without leakage jacob and lohman 1952 yang and yeh 2005 cannot approach steady state during the entire pumping period and have a larger drawdown at late time moreover the effect of aquitard storage on the drawdown is significant at the moderate pumping time similar to those reported in the study of sun and zhan 2006 and feng and zhan 2015 2016 for constant rate tests in an infinite leaky confined aquifer in addition the drawdown for the partially penetrating well case is larger than that for the fully penetrating well case at early pumping time say td 9 and has a smaller drawdown at the same given time what is more if comparing the curve developed by the solution of hantush 1959 using the hantush s approximation with that for the present solution treating the leakage as an interface problem one can see from fig 3 that the drawdown will be underestimated at late time by using the hantush s approximation it means that the hantush s approximation cannot reflect the physical leakage process or some error could be caused 4 2 analysis of the wellbore flow rate fig 4 shows the dimensionless wellbore flowrate distribution for constant head test at a partially penetrating well in leaky confined aquifers with three different outer boundaries from this figure one can find that the wellbore flowrate distributions for different cases match well with each other at early pumping times i e t d 30 this is easy to understand as follows the wellbore flow during the early pumping period can almost entirely attribute to the elastic release of aquifer storage thus is not affected by the aquifer outer boundary with the increase of pumping time the wellbore flowrate for case 1 is larger than that for case 3 and smaller than that for case 2 and approach an asymptotic value at the late times this is because the wellbore flow for case 1 is mainly from the elastic storage of the pumped aquifer and aquitard and the leakage above the aquitard however compared to case 1 the wellbore flows for case 2 and case 3 are also influenced by the effect of outer boundary similar results have been found for constant head test in a confined aquifer lin et al 2016 this is because the outer boundary for case 2 has a constant head which serves as a source of water supply while case 3 has a no flux outer boundary which serves as a water barrier besides steady state can be reached in any of the three cases because of the difference in the steady state values of qd the time to reach steady state appears to be the same in all three cases and this can be checked by plotting dqd dtd vs td not shown in here and determining the time to reach slope of zero in addition for case 2 and case 3 the outer boundary of dimensionless distance rb d from 10 to infinity is considered in fig 4 one also can see that the wellbore flow curves for both cases with different rb d are the same at early times and deviate from each other at intermediate and late times a smaller rbd for cases 2 and 3 results in a faster influence on the wellbore flowrate indicating that the time for the effect of outer boundary on the wellbore flowrate starts to work decreases with the outer boundary distance rbd and a larger rbd for case 2 results in a smaller wellbore flowrate while a larger rbd for case 3 leads to a larger wellbore flowrate at late time this is because a larger rbd means that more water is stored in the pumped aquifer so the effect of aquifer boundary and rbd on wellbore flowrate is significant fig 4 also shows that the effect of constant head or no flow outer boundary on wellbore flowrate can be neglected if the value for rbd is large enough e g rbd 70 implying that the solutions for case 2 and case 3 are available for case 1 it means that the solutions for case 2 and case 3 can reduce to that of case 1 and more importantly the type of aquifer outer boundary has no influence on wellbore flow rate because the characteristics of the curves for wellbore flowrate with different cases are similar the results of case 1 is considered in the following analysis fig 5 illustrates the comparison of the dimensionless wellbore flowrate versus the dimensionless time for case 1 of this study and previous studies of jacob and lohman 1952 yang and yeh 2005 and hantush 1959 note that the case for present solution with neglecting aquitard storage is also considered in this figure one can find that the wellbore flowrate for the case with leakage this study at early times agrees well with the case without leakage jacob and lohman 1952 yang and yeh 2005 while the differences among them gradually become significant as pumping time increases and the aquifer with leakage has a larger wellbore flowrate at the late times this is due to the fact that the pumped aquifer storage is the primary water supplier for wellbore flowrate at early times but at late times the wellbore flowrate is mainly from the leakage leading to a larger wellbore flowrate and wellbore flowrate qd clearly decreases with time td and the late time steady state value is much smaller than at early time for all the models depicted as shown in fig 5 moreover fig 5 also shows that the dimensionless wellbore flowrate for the present solution considering the aquitard storage is the same as that of the solution ignoring the storativity of aquitard except at intermediate pumping times in other words the aquitard storage effect influences the wellbore flowrate distribution at intermediate times only furthermore one also can observe the effect of the aquitard aquifer interface flow on the wellbore flowrate distribution from present solution for a fully penetrating well case without considering aquitard storage as shown in fig 5 the wellbore flowrate distribution is overestimated according to the solution obtained under the hantush s approximation hantush 1959 particularly at intermediate and late pumping stages indicating that for constant head test in a leaky confined aquifer the leakage should be treated as an interface phenomenon rather than a volumetric term in addition fig 5 also demonstrates that the wellbore flowrate for the fully penetrating well case is larger than that for the partially penetrating well case for all time from eq 21 one can find that the effect of well partial penetration on wellbore flowrate distribution is obvious as expected 4 3 pumping induced aquitard aquifer interface flow the leakage solutions have been provided in supplementary materials table s1 from a groundwater management perspective one can use the obtained equations to qualify the cumulative leakage rate and volume due to a partially penetrating well with constant head test in a leaky confined aquifer with three different outer boundaries the characteristics of the leakage rate volume will be discussed in the following 4 3 1 pumping induced leakage rate fig 6 shows the dimensionless total leakage rate across the interface between the aquitard and the pumped aquifer due to a constant head partially penetrating pumping well in a leaky confined aquifer for all three cases the values for the outer boundary of radial dimensionless distance rbd are selected to be 10 20 40 70 or obviously the rbd represents case 1 in general the characteristics of the total leakage rate distribution is that the total leakage rate increases with times and reaches the largest at a certain time for different cases e g near td 80 for case 3 rbd 40 after that the total leakage rate decreases with times and approaches a different stable value at late times for various cases e g γ d 0 04 for case 3 rbd 40 from td 105 because the largest rbd denotes the greatest water stored in the aquitard thus the maximum total leakage rate occurs the latest as shown in fig 6 additionally it is understandable that case 3 has no water supply from the no flow outer boundary compared with case 2 with unlimited water supply from the constant head boundary at the same rbd thus the total leakage rate in case 3 is greater than that in case 2 at the late pumping stage and a larger rbd leads to a larger steady state value of the total leakage rate case 1 has the greatest total leakage rate because of its infinite far lateral boundary whereas cases 2 and 3 both have finite lateral boundary because of the similar distribution characteristics of the total leakage rate for case 1 2 and 3 case 1 is chosen for the next analysis zhan and bian 2006 neglected the storativity of the aquitard and obtained the solutions of leakage rate and volume induced by constant head test performed at a fully penetrating well in an infinite leaky confined aquifer case 1 based on the assumption of the hantush s approximation 1959 fig 7 shows the distribution of the total leakage rate obtained using the solutions of this study and zhan and bian 2006 in which the special case for ignoring aquitard storage and well partial penetration are considered for comparison from this figure one can observe that there are some discrepancies at early and intermediate pumping stages due to the influence of aquitard storage while the curves for the total leakage rate reach the same value under the condition of fully penetrating well or partially penetrating well at late times because of the steady water supplement at the aquitard aquifer interface it is interesting to see that the total leakage rate for the fully penetrating well case estimated by the solution of this study neglecting the aquitard storage is the same as in zhan and bian 2006 implying that the hantush s approximation works well in predicting the total leakage rate induced by a well fully penetrated in the pumped aquifer however this conclusion does not hold if the well only partially penetrates the pumped aquifer 4 3 2 pumping induced leakage volume fig 8 shows the cumulative leakage volume through the entire aquitard aquifer interface induced by a partially penetrating well pumping at a constant head in a leakage confined aquifer for cases 1 2 and 3 the values for rbd reflecting the effect of aquifer system outer boundary on flow are chosen to be 10 20 40 70 or and the case 1 rbd is also included one can observe that the cumulative leakage volume for all cases increases linearly with time at the later pumping stage and the cumulative leakage volume is the largest for case 1 and the smallest for case 2 during the whole pumping stage when the value for rbd is the same besides the slope is greater for a larger rbd for cases 2 and 3 and reaches the maximum value for case 1 obviously the cumulative leakage volume is affected by the effect of outer boundary because the explanation of this finding is similar to the analysis of the total leakage rate it will not be repeated here we will also choose the cumulative leakage volume for case 1 in the next analysis the dimensionless cumulative leakage volume through the entire aquitard aquifer interface versus the dimensionless time based on the present solution and zhan and bian 2006 solution are plotted in fig 9 note that the case for present solution neglecting the aquitard storage is taken into account as a reference the dimensionless cumulative leakage volume would be underestimated especially at early time if the effect of aquitard storage is not considered regardless of the well partial penetration in addition the effect of aquitard storage on the distribution of the cumulative leakage volume for a fully penetrating well could last much longer than that for a partially penetrating well provided that the rest conditions remain the same the diffusivity of the aquitard α k s s should control the cumulative volume leaking across the aquitard aquifer interface note that α for s s 0 a nonzero aquitard storage value means that the aquitard behaves as a buffer zone and can hold on to water and release over a prolonged period of time whereas zero storage implies that the aquitard lacks such a hold and release water buffer capacity and it simply serves as a pathway for water from the upper undisturbed aquifer to pass through to replenish the pumped aquifer underneath the aquitard this is why the aquifer drawdown predicted at late time by the classical leakage model of hantush 1959 is smaller than that predicted for the model with a nonzero aquitard storage additionally the leakage in the case with aquitard storage occurs later delayed than the case with s s 0 as shown in fig 9 another interesting point to note from fig 9 is that the cumulative leakage volume induced by a fully penetrating well in this study agrees well with that of zhan and bian 2006 without considering the aquitard storativity indicating that the hantush s approximation is also feasible to determine the cumulative leakage volume the further discussion on characteristic of pumping induced wellbore flowrate and leakage rate volume are analyzed in part c of supplementary materials 4 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is frequently employed to evaluate how various hydraulic parameters would influence the results e g drawdown wellbore flowrate or others of a model kabala 2001 huang and yeh 2007 lin et al 2016 sedghi et al 2018 the normalized sensitivity analysis for researching the change of each aquifer parameter on wellbore flow rate and leakage rate is carried out in this study which is presented by huang and yeh 2007 the definition of the normalized sensitivity coefficient can be given as 28 x i j p j o i p j p j o i p j δ p j o i p j δ p j where x i j is the normalized sensitivity value for the j th parameter pj at the i th time oi represents the response of the model wellbore flowrate or leakage rate in this study and δpj is a small increment which will be selected as 10 2 pj note that the absolute values of x i j is employed in the following analysis for the sake of comparison and the sensitivity analysis of the leakage volume is not conducted because of the similarity to the sensitivity analysis of the leakage rate based on the newly developed solution the parameters used in the sensitivity study include the dimensionless well radii rwd the skin factor sk the pumped aquifer anisotropic ratio kd the well partial penetration φ the aquitard aquifer specific storage ratio γ the aquitard aquifer vertical hydraulic conductivity ratio β the thickness ratio of the aquitard and aquifer bd and the dimensionless distance of outer boundary rbd in cases 2 and 3 figs 10 and 11 show the drawdown and wellbore flowrate sensitivity to parameters rwd sk kd φ γ β bd and rbd for an infinite leaky confined aquifer case 1 a finite leaky confined aquifer case 2 and a closed leaky confined aquifer case 3 respectively the other parameters used in those figures are rwd 0 01 rd 0 2 zd 0 5 φ 0 5 sk 0 1 kd 0 1 bd 0 2 γ 5 β 0 001 and rbd 20 fig 10 a and b indicate that the nearly same dimensionless drawdown sd sensitivity characteristics at rd 0 2 zd 0 5 with respect to the same parameter can be found due to constant head test at a partially penetrating well for cases 1 and 2 and the sensitivity for case 1 is a slightly greater than that for case 2 the drawdown is very sensitive to φ rwd and kd over the whole pumping stage especially to the well partial penetration φ the influence of the change in the other parameters on sd are relatively small and negligible the relative change of γ on sd is obvious at the period of 1 td 103 for cases 1 and 2 it notes that the influence of rbd on sd begins at td 1 then increases with pumping time and finally arrives at steady state when td 103 and its sensitivity is larger than kd and smaller than rwd in other words the outer boundary effect can be ignored when td 10 because the cone of depression induced by a constant head pumping well has not yet propagated to the outer boundary fig 10 c shows the absolute normalized sensitivities with regard to parameters of concern for case 3 as shown in this figure the relative changes in φ rwd and kd on sd are significant during the entire pumping period in addition the degrees of sensitivity of γ β bd and rbd on γd begin at different given pumping times e g for γ and β near td 10 for bd and rbd near td 200 and 8 respectively they increase gradually with the pumping time and arrive at the peak values until reaching non zero asymptotic values e g for rbd near td 104 or decrease gradually until disappearing or reaching a zero asymptotic value e g γ at late times the outer boundary distance rbd has the greatest influence on sd at the late pumping period for case 3 for comparison the effect of β and bd on sd for different cases are shown in fig 10 and one can see that bd on sd at late time for case 3 is more significantly influenced by β and bd than that for cases 1 and 2 moreover sk has a minor influence on sd during the total pumping period especially for an observation well nearby the pumping well fig 11 a and b demonstrate that the sensitivity characteristics of the wellbore flowrate qd for cases 1 and 2 with regard to the same parameter are nearly the same it can be found in these two figures that qd is very sensitive to the variation of φ rwd and kd during the whole pumping stage and their sensitivities reaches their respective asymptotic constants at late times the effects of the rest parameters including sk γ β and bd on qd are relatively minor moreover fig 11 b illustrates that qd is moderately sensitive to rbd and the degree of sensitivity starts to increase from td near 10 and reaches the asymptotic value around td near 100 for case 2 furthermore the degree of sensitivity to rbd is smaller than that to kd and larger than that to rwd fig 11 c shows that qd is very sensitivity to φ rwd and kd over the whole pumping stage for case 3 the degree of sensitivity to rwd is larger than to kd and smaller than that to φ at early times while the degree of sensitivity to kd is larger than that to rwd and smaller than that to φ at late times additionally fig 11 c indicates that the normalized sensitivity of qd to bd β and rbd start after some pumping time and reaches maximum values at late times for case 3 it should be noted that β has an earlier effect on the wellbore flowrate than bd and the effect of rbd on qd is the largest among all the parameters and the effect of bd and β on qd is the same and smaller than kd at late times on the other hand the effect of γ on qd only can be found at the intermediate pumping stage as expected it also can be found from fig 11 that the impact of sk on qd is minor compared to other parameters 5 summary and conclusions a new semi analytical drawdown solution for flow toward a partially penetrating constant head pumping well in a leaky confined aquifer is developed after applying laplace transform and separation of variables with a more rigorous treatment of aquitard leakage as an interface phenomenon rather than a volumetric source sink term for some available solutions note that the effect of different outer boundary aquitard storage and skin effect are taken into account as well the wellbore flowrate solutions in laplace space for constant head test are obtained under three different outer boundaries moreover semi analytical solutions for pumping induced leakage rate volume are derived for three different cases and are shown in supplementary materials table s1 and more crucially the leakage solutions are useful for managing similar aquifers in which pumping induced flow occurs at the aquitard aquifer interface the detailed characteristic of the drawdown the wellbore flowrate and leakage rate volume induced by constant head test at a partially penetrating well are provided based on the newly developed solutions and sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate how sensitive the drawdown and wellbore flowrate are to different hydraulic parameters under different cases the following findings can be concluded from this study 1 the drawdown in pumped confined aquifers for all cases are not affected by the different outer boundaries at early pumping times the effect of the outer boundary on the drawdown is more significant for a shorter outer boundary distance and the aquitard leakage should be regarded as an interface problem for analyzing the drawdown induced by constant head test no matter what the well partial penetration is 2 the wellbore flowrate distributions induced by constant head test in leaky confined aquifer with different boundaries agrees well with each other at early pumping times and the wellbore flowrate distribution in an infinite leaky confined aquifer case 1 is larger than that in a closed leaky confined aquifer with no flow condition at the outer radial boundary case 3 and smaller than that in a finite leaky confined aquifer with constant head condition at the outer radial boundary case 2 at intermediate and late pumping stages 3 the total leakage rate for constant head test for different cases are the same at early pumping times while the total leakage rate for case 3 is greater than that for case 2 and smaller than that for case 1 at the late pumping times and a larger outer boundary distance leads to a larger steady state value of total leakage rate 4 the cumulative leakage volume for all cases increases linearly with time during the later pumping stage and the cumulative leakage volume is the largest for case 1 and the smallest for case 2 during the whole pumping period at the same outer boundary distance and the slope is greater for a larger outer boundary distance in cases 2 and 3 and reaches a peak value in case 1 5 the leakage should be treated as an interface phenomenon otherwise the wellbore flowrate is overestimated according to the solution obtained using the hantush s approximation hantush 1959 especially at intermediate and late times while the hantush s approximation is feasible to determine the total leakage rate and the cumulative leakage volume induced by constant head test at a fully penetrating well in an infinite aquifer without considering the aquitard storage 6 the drawdown induced by constant head test at a partially penetrating well in different cases are sensitive to well partial penetration over the whole pumping stage and the outer boundary rbd has the strongest influence on drawdown at late times for case 3 7 the dimensionless wellbore flowrates in infinite finite closed leaky confined aquifer systems cases 1 2 and 3 are sensitive to the variation of φ rwd and kd during the whole pumping period for a leakage aquifer system our solutions can be directly used for predicting the drawdown distributions in an observation well and the transient wellbore flowrate exploring the effects of aquitard storage well partial penetration skin effect and the outer boundary on the drawdown the wellbore flowrate and leakage rate volume determining the hydraulic parameters of aquifers in aquifer tests and data analyses and qualifying the pumping induced leakage for a constant head test in addition our solutions show a great potential application value in other related field such as in geotechnical engineering

6772,an analytical model for describing pumping induced drawdown by constant head test at a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer is developed by treating the leakage of aquitard storage as an interface phenomenon rather than an volumetric effect which is the novel and never developed so far three different cases of remote lateral boundaries are considered in the model the new drawdown solution in laplace space is obtained and inverted into time domain solution utilizing the stehfest method the semi analytical solutions for well discharge are then obtained under three different cases analytical solutions in laplace and time domains are developed for calculating the total leakage rate and volume across the aquitard aquifer interface due to constant head test at a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer and such solutions are of great use for groundwater resource management based on the newly developed solutions the distribution of wellbore flowrate and aquitard leakage are explored and the sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the most important controlling factor the sensitivity analysis shows that the wellbore flowrate and the drawdown in infinite case 1 finite case 2 and closed case 3 leaky confined aquifer systems are both sensitive to the variation of well partial penetration well radius and aquifer anisotropic ratio during the whole pumping period and they are most sensitive to the change of outer boundary distance at late time for case 3 the effect of the outer boundary on the drawdown or wellbore flowrate is more significant for a shorter outer boundary distance keywords constant head test leaky confined aquifer leakage rate volume partially penetrating well sensitivity analysis 1 introduction constant head test is mainly used to test self flowing wells or to determine aquifer hydraulic parameters and therefore a large number of solutions for constant head test performed in a partially penetrating well have been developed yang and yeh 2005 derived a drawdown solution for constant head test at a partially penetrating well in a confined aquifer considering the effect of a finite skin using the method of laplace transform perina and lee 2006 provided a general well function for a partially penetrating well pumping at constant head or constant rate in a confined leaky or unconfined aquifer without considering the aquitard storage chang and yeh 2009 2010 developed drawdown analytical solutions for constant head test at a partially penetrating well in a confined aquifer using the dual series in combination with the perturbation method or the triple series equation method barua and bora 2010 presented steady quasi steady solutions of hydraulic head and wellbore flowrate induced by a partially penetrating well with a skin zone in a confined aquifer yang et al 2014 considered the effect of well partial penetration on hydraulic head during constant head test and obtained a simple approximate solution of hydraulic head distribution in a two zone confined aquifer based on the developed steady state solution and a formula concerning a time dependent diffusion layer provided by fang et al 2009 lin et al 2016 developed a general analytical drawdown solution in a two zone finite confined aquifer subjected to the robin type condition at both well face and outer boundaries but the pumping well is treated as a fully penetrating well rather than a partially penetrating well as for constant head test at a partially penetrating well in unconfined aquifers chang et al 2010 derived a transient hydraulic head solution for constant head test in a two zone unconfined aquifer with a partially penetrating well chang et al 2011 further developed a semi analytical solution of the transient drawdown for constant head test in a partially penetrating well in an unconfined aquifer for flow in leaky aquifers the aquitard leakage is often treated in two ways in published hydraulic literatures the first way proposed by hantush and jacob 1955 is to impose the leakage as a volumetric source sink term on the governing flow equation which is widely used in well hydraulic because of its simplicity e g hantush 1959 1964 moench 1985 zhan and bian 2006 hunt and scott 2007 lin and yeh 2017 for instance hantush 1964 obtained the analytical expression of drawdown induced by a partially penetrating well in a semi confined aquifer with a constant pumping rate hunt and scot 2007 treated the leakage effect in hantush and jacob 1955 and developed an approximate solution for flow to a fully penetrating pumping well in two aquifer system lin and yeh 2017 obtained the drawdown solution induced by a constant rate pumping well fully penetrating in a leaky confined aquifer with considering the effect of the phase lags however the treatment of the aquitard leakage in hantush and jacob 1955 does not accurately reflect the reality that the leakage occurs at the aquitard aquifer interface rather than happens over the whole aquifer volume to remedy this problem the other way is to treat the leakage as an interface phenomenon and some relevant studies include hunt 2005 bakker 2006 malama et al 2007 2008 feng and zhan 2015 2016 and sedghi et al 2018 for instance malama et al 2007 2008 imposed drawdown and flux continuity conditions at the aquifer aquitard interface and presented semi analytical solutions for flow in a leaky unconfined aquifer with a fully penetrating well and in an unconfined aquifer aquitard confined aquifer with a partially penetrating well pumped at constant rate the review of the recent studies shows that there are a limited number of researches on the constant head test in leaky aquifers by treating the aquitard leakage an interface problem additionally when a long term pumping test is performed in a confined aquifer the effect of cone of depression will inevitably propagate into the nearby aquitards resulting in release of water from aquitard storage due to the drop of pore pressure in the aquitards boulton s work 1963 1973 is one of the first to propose solutions for analyzing pumping tests in a such a scheme the effect of aquitard storage on drawdown distribution have been explored in studies including sun and zhan 2006 zhou et al 2009 feng and zhan 2016 and others for constant rate tests these studies illustrated that some errors would be caused if the effect of aquitard storage was neglected especially at the moderate pumping time with regard to constant head test in a leaky aquifer system hantush 1959 applied the laplace transform technique to obtain the transient drawdown and wellbore flowrate solutions with a fully penetrating well hantush 1959 considered the following outer boundaries 1 drawdown at infinity is zero 2 drawdown at a finite outer boundary is zero 3 flow across the finite outer boundary is zero hantush 1959 treated the leakage as a volumetric effect and neglected the aquitard storage effect kabala and cassiani 1997 obtained a new solution for flow to a fully penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer with the help of the weber goldstein transform wen et al 2011 developed a mathematical model for constant head test with the use of a fully penetrating well in an infinite leaky aquifer taking the finite thickness skin into account recently lin et al 2017 obtained solutions of drawdown and wellbore flowrate due to constant head test in a leaky unconfined aquifer considering well partial penetration unsaturated flow process and infinitesimal thickness skin the well skin is usually developed during the well installation process including well development and or clogging and it can be treated either as infinitesimally thin or with a finite thickness e g novakowski 1989 markle et al 1995 cassiani and kabala 1998 chang and chen 2002 feng and zhan 2016 assuming an infinitesimally thin skin will simply the skin effect into a skin factor and thus is employed in this study assuming a finite thickness skin will require a double zone approach to investigate the coupled flow process in the skin zone and the aquifer zone which will substantially complicate the mathematical model and will be reported elsewhere in the future precise quantification of leakage is an important issue in a leaky aquifer system hantush 1964 provided analytical expressions for calculating pumping induced leakage rate and cumulative volume in a leaky confined aquifer with a fully penetrating well pumping at constant rate or constant head butler and tsou 2003 offered a new method to quantify the leakage rate and volume across the aquitard aquifer interface in a laterally bounded leaky confined aquifer zhan and bian 2006 used the drawdown solution developed by hantush and jacob 1955 and hantush 1964 to obtain the analytical and semi analytical solutions of leakage rate and volume induced by constant head test or constant rate test with the use of a fully penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer neglecting aquitard storage zhou et al 2009 took the aquitard storage into account and developed semi analytical solutions to determine the leakage across the aquitard aquifer interface in a laterally bounded aquifer with a fully penetrating well pumping at constant rate considering the combined effects of well partial penetration aquitard storage and wellbore storage feng and zhan 2016 gave the solutions of leakage rate and volume induced by constant rate test in an aquitard aquifer system unfortunately little attention has been paid to the leakage rate and volume induced by constant head test with the use of a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer the aim of this study is to develop a new analytical model of constant head test with a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer with various lateral boundaries the novelty of the model is that the effect of aquitard storage and well partial penetration is considered in particular the effect of aquitard leakage is treated as an interface phenomenon rather than a volumetric effect to accurately delineate the physical leakage process the transient drawdown solution is derived and is further used to develop the wellbore flowrate solution closed form analytical and semi analytical solutions are presented to determine the leakage rate and leakage volume in addition a sensitivity analysis is conducted to access the wellbore flux and leakage rate in response to the relative changes of parameters of the aquifer and aquitard with the aid of the obtained solutions one can investigate the effects of aquitard storage well partial penetration skin effect and the outer boundary on the wellbore flux and leakage rate volume with a physically robust model the newly developed solution can also be applied to determine the hydraulic parameters of aquifers by using a parameter estimation code such as pest doherty et al 1994 or producing some type curves e g wellbore flowrate versus pumping time furthermore the obtained solutions are applicable in geotechnical engineering especially in the design of the dewatering system of deep excavation in which the confined groundwater level must be lowered using pumping well during excavation to ensure dry conditions and to improve safety wu et al 2016 pujades et al 2016 in addition it is also very important to qualify the total leakage rate and volume based on the presented solution from the perspective of groundwater management 2 mathematical models and solutions fig 1 shows a well of a finite radius rw pumped at a constant drawdown sw partially penetrating a leaky confined axisymmetric aquifer system of lateral extent rb l and d are the upper and lower vertical depths of the well screen relative to the base of the pumped aquifer respectively the main pumped aquifer is homogeneous vertically anisotropic of constant thickness b which is overlain by an aquitard and underlain by an impermeable formation the head in the unconfined aquifer or the surface water body overlying the aquitard is assumed to be constant the aquitard storage is considered the leakage effect from aquitard is not treated as a volumetric effect as done in hantush 1959 zhan and bian 2006 and many other studies but as an interface phenomenon including hantush 1967 bakker 2006 malama et al 2007 2008 and others additional assumptions made for the mathematical model are 1 the aquitard is homogeneous of finite thickness b 2 the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard k is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the aquifer so that flow in the aquitard is vertical neuman and witherspoon 1968 3 the system is hydrostatic before the pumping starts the origin of the coordinate system is located at the point of intersection between the center line of the well and the pumped aquifer base and the r and z axes are positive outward and upward respectively 2 1 problem statement based on the conceptual model described above the equation governing the drawdown distribution s r z t in the domain r w r r b and 0 z b for axisymmetric flow to a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer may be written as 1 k r r 1 r s r k z 2 s z 2 s s s t where kr and kz are the aquifer hydraulic conductivities in the radial and vertical directions l t respectively ss is the aquifer specific storage 1 l and t is the pumping time t the drawdown is initially zero 2 s r z 0 0 the outer boundary at rb for the main aquifer proposed by hantush 1959 can be described as 3 s r b z t 0 or s r r b z t 0 or s r r r b 0 note that eq 3 includes three expressions to describe 1 an infinite outer boundary case 1 2 an finite aquifer with a zero drawdown at finite outer boundary case 2 and 3 a closed aquifer with a no flow finite outer boundary case 3 and in the field situation aquifer with natural artificial laterally finite boundaries cases 2 and 3 may be encountered in part because of the relatively impermeable media and in part due to the invariant uninfluenced pumping drawdown van everdingen and hurst 1949 chen 1984 vilarrasa et al 2011 tsai and yeh 2012 wu et al 2016 therefore it is much needed to provide a simple and more direct semi analytical solution if possible for flow in a laterally finite aquifer aquitard system to consider the skin effect the thickness and the hydraulic conductivity of the skin are respectively r s and k s shown in fig 1 and after application of darcy s law across the skin one can obtain 4 k r 1 r s r r r w k s s w s r s where s l d 1 d l s r w z t d z refers to the average drawdown in the aquifer adjacent to the well screen taking the skin factor s k k r r s k s r w into consideration the well face boundary of constant head test for eq 4 can be rewritten as 5 1 l d d l s r w z t d z r w s k s r z t r r r w s w d z l due to the assumption that drawdown in the wellbore varies only with time it is reasonable that the drawdown at r rw is assumed to be independent of z then one can assume that the flux through the sand face r rw into the well is independent of z and varies in time only and following the studies of dougherty and babu 1984 moench 1997 and yang and yeh 2005 this condition can be written as at r rw d z l 6 k r s r r r w q t d z l eq 6 deserves some discussion in reality the flux over the well screen is a function of z for a well partially penetrating the pumped aquifer with greater fluxes near the two ends and relatively uniform flux along the central portion of the screen however determining such a z dependent and time dependent as well flux distribution along the screen will substantially increase the degree of complexity and requires much more computational time for simplification the flux is often simplified as uniformly distributed over the screen the validity of this simplification for practical purpose has been demonstrated in many previous studies e g dougherty and babu 1984 hantush 1964 kabala and cassiani 1997 moench 1997 yang and yeh 2005 lin and yeh 2017 the no flow boundary condition along the well casing can be expressed as dougherty and babu 1984 moench 1997 and yang and yeh 2005 7 k r s r r r w 0 0 z d l z b the no flow boundary condition at the bottom of the aquifer is 8 s z z 0 0 the continuity of flux at the aquifer aquitard interface is given by 9 k z s z z b k s z z b where k is the aquitard hydraulic conductivity in the vertical direction l t s is the aquitard drawdown l assuming that flow in the aquitard is vertical the governing equation of flow in this layer is 10 k 2 s z 2 s s s t b z b b the initial condition of drawdown in the aquitard is 11 s r z 0 0 the drawdown continuity at the aquitard aquifer interface requires 12 s r z t s r z t z b the boundary condition on the top of the aquitard is 13 s r z t 0 z b b 2 2 transient drawdown solution for the problem the mathematical model described above is transformed into its dimensionless form to reduce the number of free parameters and to identify the controlling dimensionless numbers of the investigated flow system definitions for the dimensionless parameters used in this study are shown in table 1 2 2 1 case 1 solutions in an infinite leaky confined aquifer when the left expression in eq 3 is used the laplace domain drawdown solution for the pumped aquifer of infinite extent in radial direction r b is developed by applying the method of separation of variables and the generalized finite fourier cosine transform the detailed derivation can be found in the part a derivations of wellbore flowrate

ωn is determined using the newton raphson method press et al 1989 is related to p in eq 14 it could be difficult however to obtain the closed form solutions by applying the inverse laplace transform directly a number of studies e g moench 1985 perina and lee 2006 zhan and bian 2006 wen et al 2011 feng and zhan 2016 have shown that the stehfest method stehfest 1970 is sufficiently accurate to obtain the time domain solutions for similar flow problems thus will be used in this study as well when excluding the aquitard leakage effect and the skin effect the new solution agrees with that of yang and yeh 2005 eq 56 2 2 2 case 2 solutions in a finite leaky confined aquifer using the outer boundary condition described by case 2 in eq 3 the laplace domain drawdown solution for the pumped aquifer of finite extent in radial direction can be developed following the similar procedures shown in part a of the supplementary materials and the final solution is given as 16 s d r d z d p q d p

2 3 case 3 solutions in closed leaky confined aquifer similarly if the outer boundary of case 3 in eq 3 is used the laplace domain drawdown solution for a closed leaky confined aquifer is given in the following form 18 s d r d z d p q d p n 0 δ 1 i 0 ξ n r d k 1 ξ n r bd k 0 ξ n r d i 1 ξ n r bd ξ n δ 2 k 1 ξ n r wd i 1 ξ n r bd i 1 ξ n r wd k 1 ξ n r bd cos ω n z d with 19 q d p 1 p 1 l d d d n 0

time domain solutions using the stehfest method with the number of terms n 12 for the inversion 2 3 wellbore flowrate solution for constant head test the wellbore flowrate is often measured as a function of time and is our main concern therefore based on the newly obtained drawdown solution the solution of wellbore flowrate for constant head test conducted at a partially penetrating well is given by 20 q t 2 π r w l d k r s r z t r r r w 2 π r w l d q t considering the dimensionless parameters listed in table 1 and applying the laplace transform to eq 20 the dimensionless wellbore flowrate solution in laplace domain is 21 q d p 1 2 r wd l d d d q d p obviously the dimensionless wellbore flowrate solution for different cases can be easily obtained based on the new developed drawdown solutions and once again all the laplace domain solutions of wellbore flowrates are converted into their time domain solutions using the stehfest method with the number of 12 terms n 12 for the inversion 3 pumping induced leakage at the aquitard aquifer interface for leaky confined aquifers it is interesting to quantify the pumping induced leakage rate and volume at the aquitard aquifer interface from a groundwater management perspective therefore in this section the solutions for the leakage rate and leakage volume induced by constant head test with a partially penetrating well is provided 3 1 the solutions for pumping induced leakage rate the definition of pumping induced leakage rate γ within the radial distance of r from the well is given by zhan and bian 2006 zhou et al 2009 22 γ r t r w r 2 π r q d r r w r r 2 π r k s z z b d r introduction of the dimensionless parameters listed in table 1 eq 22 can be rewritten in the dimensionless form 23 γ d r d t d 1 2 r wd r d

pumping induced leakage volume v inside the range of a radial distance r and a given period of pumping time t can be calculated by integrating eq 22 with respect to t thus 25 v r t 0 t γ r t d d t d using the dimensionless parameters shown in table 1 one can obtain the dimensionless form of eq 25 in the time and laplace domain 26 v d r d t d 0 t γ d r d t d d t d and 27 v d r d p γ d r d p p according to eqs 22 27 the pumping induced leakage rate and leakage volume including laplace domain and steady state solutions of cumulative leakage rate and volume can be easily obtained from the newly developed drawdown solutions the detailed derivation can be found in part b of supplementary materials derivations of leakage solutions up to now the pumping induced leakage solutions in laplace domain and time domain for constant head test at a partially penetrating well with three different outer boundaries are obtained and are summarized in supplementary materials table s1 4 results and discussion in this section the characteristics of the wellbore flowrate and leakage rate or volume induced by constant head test at a partially penetrating well are analyzed in detail a sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate how sensitive the wellbore flowrate and leakage rate are to different hydraulic parameters the default parameter values for the following studies are given as rw 0 05 m b 5 m k 10 8 m s b 25 m l 18 75 m d 6 25 m ss 10 3 m 1 kz 10 5 m s kr 10 4 m s ss 2 10 5 m 1 the choice of such parameter values is similar to the study of moench 1985 and feng and zhan 2015 2016 4 1 analysis of the drawdown fig 2 shows the response of the dimensionless drawdown at rd 0 2 and zd 0 5 for constant head test performed using a partially penetrating well in leaky confined aquifers with three different outer boundaries with rbd 10 20 40 70 and this figure illustrates that drawdowns in pumped confined aquifers for all cases are not influenced by different outer boundaries at the early pumping period i e td 6 as expected the difference of the drawdown for three cases becomes gradually apparent as pumping time goes on at the late pumping time the drawdown for case 3 has no water supply from the no flow outer boundary and drawdown for case 2 has more water supply from a constant head outer boundary than that for case 1 with an infinite outer boundary thus one can see that drawdown for case 1 is smaller than that for case 3 and larger than that for case 2 at the late pumping period reflecting a strong influence of different outer boundaries on late drawdown in aquifers additionally fig 2 shows that a smaller rb d for case 2 results in a smaller drawdown while a larger rb d for case 3 leads to a smaller drawdown at late time this is because a larger rb d means that the pumped aquifer can provide more water from the aquifer storage meanwhile the effect of outer boundary on the drawdown can be neglected when rb d 70 note that the drawdowns for cases 2 and 3 at rbd are coincide with that for case 1 during the whole pumping period indicating that the solution in an infinite aquifer is the special case of the solution in a finite or closed aquifer finally fig 2 also indicates that the effect of the aquifer outer boundary on the drawdown starts much earlier for a shorter boundary distance rbd in case 2 while the opposite is true in case 3 implying that the boundary effect is more significant for a shorter rbd owing to the similar curve characteristic of the drawdown for different cases case 1 is then taken as an example to explore the drawdown responses induced by a partially penetrating well pumping at constant head test for the purpose of comparison several previous relevant studies will be included in the following analysis for example jacob and lohman 1952 obtained drawdown and wellbore flowrate solution due to a constant head pumping scenario at a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer without considering the leakage and skin effect yang and yeh 2005 took account of the effect of skin and well partial penetration and developed an analytical solution for drawdown and wellbore flowrate induced by constant head test in confined aquifer and the solution for the case of no skin was also given hantush 1959 gave a similar solution for constant head test at fully penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer by treating the leakage as a source or sink term added into the governing flow equation of pumped aquifer termed the hantush s approximation and it is worthy of pointing out that the storativity of aquitard and skin effect were not considered in his study fig 3 demonstrates the comparison of the dimensionless drawdown versus the dimensionless time at rd 0 2 and zd 0 5 obtained by the solution of case 1 of this study and the solutions of jacob and lohman 1952 yang and yeh 2005 and hantush 1959 note that the case for present solution neglecting the aquitard storage is also taken into account and the skin effect is not considered in this figure fig 3 indicates that the drawdown increases with the pumping time and reaches steady state at the late time for the pumped aquifer with leakage while the drawdown for the case without leakage jacob and lohman 1952 yang and yeh 2005 cannot approach steady state during the entire pumping period and have a larger drawdown at late time moreover the effect of aquitard storage on the drawdown is significant at the moderate pumping time similar to those reported in the study of sun and zhan 2006 and feng and zhan 2015 2016 for constant rate tests in an infinite leaky confined aquifer in addition the drawdown for the partially penetrating well case is larger than that for the fully penetrating well case at early pumping time say td 9 and has a smaller drawdown at the same given time what is more if comparing the curve developed by the solution of hantush 1959 using the hantush s approximation with that for the present solution treating the leakage as an interface problem one can see from fig 3 that the drawdown will be underestimated at late time by using the hantush s approximation it means that the hantush s approximation cannot reflect the physical leakage process or some error could be caused 4 2 analysis of the wellbore flow rate fig 4 shows the dimensionless wellbore flowrate distribution for constant head test at a partially penetrating well in leaky confined aquifers with three different outer boundaries from this figure one can find that the wellbore flowrate distributions for different cases match well with each other at early pumping times i e t d 30 this is easy to understand as follows the wellbore flow during the early pumping period can almost entirely attribute to the elastic release of aquifer storage thus is not affected by the aquifer outer boundary with the increase of pumping time the wellbore flowrate for case 1 is larger than that for case 3 and smaller than that for case 2 and approach an asymptotic value at the late times this is because the wellbore flow for case 1 is mainly from the elastic storage of the pumped aquifer and aquitard and the leakage above the aquitard however compared to case 1 the wellbore flows for case 2 and case 3 are also influenced by the effect of outer boundary similar results have been found for constant head test in a confined aquifer lin et al 2016 this is because the outer boundary for case 2 has a constant head which serves as a source of water supply while case 3 has a no flux outer boundary which serves as a water barrier besides steady state can be reached in any of the three cases because of the difference in the steady state values of qd the time to reach steady state appears to be the same in all three cases and this can be checked by plotting dqd dtd vs td not shown in here and determining the time to reach slope of zero in addition for case 2 and case 3 the outer boundary of dimensionless distance rb d from 10 to infinity is considered in fig 4 one also can see that the wellbore flow curves for both cases with different rb d are the same at early times and deviate from each other at intermediate and late times a smaller rbd for cases 2 and 3 results in a faster influence on the wellbore flowrate indicating that the time for the effect of outer boundary on the wellbore flowrate starts to work decreases with the outer boundary distance rbd and a larger rbd for case 2 results in a smaller wellbore flowrate while a larger rbd for case 3 leads to a larger wellbore flowrate at late time this is because a larger rbd means that more water is stored in the pumped aquifer so the effect of aquifer boundary and rbd on wellbore flowrate is significant fig 4 also shows that the effect of constant head or no flow outer boundary on wellbore flowrate can be neglected if the value for rbd is large enough e g rbd 70 implying that the solutions for case 2 and case 3 are available for case 1 it means that the solutions for case 2 and case 3 can reduce to that of case 1 and more importantly the type of aquifer outer boundary has no influence on wellbore flow rate because the characteristics of the curves for wellbore flowrate with different cases are similar the results of case 1 is considered in the following analysis fig 5 illustrates the comparison of the dimensionless wellbore flowrate versus the dimensionless time for case 1 of this study and previous studies of jacob and lohman 1952 yang and yeh 2005 and hantush 1959 note that the case for present solution with neglecting aquitard storage is also considered in this figure one can find that the wellbore flowrate for the case with leakage this study at early times agrees well with the case without leakage jacob and lohman 1952 yang and yeh 2005 while the differences among them gradually become significant as pumping time increases and the aquifer with leakage has a larger wellbore flowrate at the late times this is due to the fact that the pumped aquifer storage is the primary water supplier for wellbore flowrate at early times but at late times the wellbore flowrate is mainly from the leakage leading to a larger wellbore flowrate and wellbore flowrate qd clearly decreases with time td and the late time steady state value is much smaller than at early time for all the models depicted as shown in fig 5 moreover fig 5 also shows that the dimensionless wellbore flowrate for the present solution considering the aquitard storage is the same as that of the solution ignoring the storativity of aquitard except at intermediate pumping times in other words the aquitard storage effect influences the wellbore flowrate distribution at intermediate times only furthermore one also can observe the effect of the aquitard aquifer interface flow on the wellbore flowrate distribution from present solution for a fully penetrating well case without considering aquitard storage as shown in fig 5 the wellbore flowrate distribution is overestimated according to the solution obtained under the hantush s approximation hantush 1959 particularly at intermediate and late pumping stages indicating that for constant head test in a leaky confined aquifer the leakage should be treated as an interface phenomenon rather than a volumetric term in addition fig 5 also demonstrates that the wellbore flowrate for the fully penetrating well case is larger than that for the partially penetrating well case for all time from eq 21 one can find that the effect of well partial penetration on wellbore flowrate distribution is obvious as expected 4 3 pumping induced aquitard aquifer interface flow the leakage solutions have been provided in supplementary materials table s1 from a groundwater management perspective one can use the obtained equations to qualify the cumulative leakage rate and volume due to a partially penetrating well with constant head test in a leaky confined aquifer with three different outer boundaries the characteristics of the leakage rate volume will be discussed in the following 4 3 1 pumping induced leakage rate fig 6 shows the dimensionless total leakage rate across the interface between the aquitard and the pumped aquifer due to a constant head partially penetrating pumping well in a leaky confined aquifer for all three cases the values for the outer boundary of radial dimensionless distance rbd are selected to be 10 20 40 70 or obviously the rbd represents case 1 in general the characteristics of the total leakage rate distribution is that the total leakage rate increases with times and reaches the largest at a certain time for different cases e g near td 80 for case 3 rbd 40 after that the total leakage rate decreases with times and approaches a different stable value at late times for various cases e g γ d 0 04 for case 3 rbd 40 from td 105 because the largest rbd denotes the greatest water stored in the aquitard thus the maximum total leakage rate occurs the latest as shown in fig 6 additionally it is understandable that case 3 has no water supply from the no flow outer boundary compared with case 2 with unlimited water supply from the constant head boundary at the same rbd thus the total leakage rate in case 3 is greater than that in case 2 at the late pumping stage and a larger rbd leads to a larger steady state value of the total leakage rate case 1 has the greatest total leakage rate because of its infinite far lateral boundary whereas cases 2 and 3 both have finite lateral boundary because of the similar distribution characteristics of the total leakage rate for case 1 2 and 3 case 1 is chosen for the next analysis zhan and bian 2006 neglected the storativity of the aquitard and obtained the solutions of leakage rate and volume induced by constant head test performed at a fully penetrating well in an infinite leaky confined aquifer case 1 based on the assumption of the hantush s approximation 1959 fig 7 shows the distribution of the total leakage rate obtained using the solutions of this study and zhan and bian 2006 in which the special case for ignoring aquitard storage and well partial penetration are considered for comparison from this figure one can observe that there are some discrepancies at early and intermediate pumping stages due to the influence of aquitard storage while the curves for the total leakage rate reach the same value under the condition of fully penetrating well or partially penetrating well at late times because of the steady water supplement at the aquitard aquifer interface it is interesting to see that the total leakage rate for the fully penetrating well case estimated by the solution of this study neglecting the aquitard storage is the same as in zhan and bian 2006 implying that the hantush s approximation works well in predicting the total leakage rate induced by a well fully penetrated in the pumped aquifer however this conclusion does not hold if the well only partially penetrates the pumped aquifer 4 3 2 pumping induced leakage volume fig 8 shows the cumulative leakage volume through the entire aquitard aquifer interface induced by a partially penetrating well pumping at a constant head in a leakage confined aquifer for cases 1 2 and 3 the values for rbd reflecting the effect of aquifer system outer boundary on flow are chosen to be 10 20 40 70 or and the case 1 rbd is also included one can observe that the cumulative leakage volume for all cases increases linearly with time at the later pumping stage and the cumulative leakage volume is the largest for case 1 and the smallest for case 2 during the whole pumping stage when the value for rbd is the same besides the slope is greater for a larger rbd for cases 2 and 3 and reaches the maximum value for case 1 obviously the cumulative leakage volume is affected by the effect of outer boundary because the explanation of this finding is similar to the analysis of the total leakage rate it will not be repeated here we will also choose the cumulative leakage volume for case 1 in the next analysis the dimensionless cumulative leakage volume through the entire aquitard aquifer interface versus the dimensionless time based on the present solution and zhan and bian 2006 solution are plotted in fig 9 note that the case for present solution neglecting the aquitard storage is taken into account as a reference the dimensionless cumulative leakage volume would be underestimated especially at early time if the effect of aquitard storage is not considered regardless of the well partial penetration in addition the effect of aquitard storage on the distribution of the cumulative leakage volume for a fully penetrating well could last much longer than that for a partially penetrating well provided that the rest conditions remain the same the diffusivity of the aquitard α k s s should control the cumulative volume leaking across the aquitard aquifer interface note that α for s s 0 a nonzero aquitard storage value means that the aquitard behaves as a buffer zone and can hold on to water and release over a prolonged period of time whereas zero storage implies that the aquitard lacks such a hold and release water buffer capacity and it simply serves as a pathway for water from the upper undisturbed aquifer to pass through to replenish the pumped aquifer underneath the aquitard this is why the aquifer drawdown predicted at late time by the classical leakage model of hantush 1959 is smaller than that predicted for the model with a nonzero aquitard storage additionally the leakage in the case with aquitard storage occurs later delayed than the case with s s 0 as shown in fig 9 another interesting point to note from fig 9 is that the cumulative leakage volume induced by a fully penetrating well in this study agrees well with that of zhan and bian 2006 without considering the aquitard storativity indicating that the hantush s approximation is also feasible to determine the cumulative leakage volume the further discussion on characteristic of pumping induced wellbore flowrate and leakage rate volume are analyzed in part c of supplementary materials 4 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is frequently employed to evaluate how various hydraulic parameters would influence the results e g drawdown wellbore flowrate or others of a model kabala 2001 huang and yeh 2007 lin et al 2016 sedghi et al 2018 the normalized sensitivity analysis for researching the change of each aquifer parameter on wellbore flow rate and leakage rate is carried out in this study which is presented by huang and yeh 2007 the definition of the normalized sensitivity coefficient can be given as 28 x i j p j o i p j p j o i p j δ p j o i p j δ p j where x i j is the normalized sensitivity value for the j th parameter pj at the i th time oi represents the response of the model wellbore flowrate or leakage rate in this study and δpj is a small increment which will be selected as 10 2 pj note that the absolute values of x i j is employed in the following analysis for the sake of comparison and the sensitivity analysis of the leakage volume is not conducted because of the similarity to the sensitivity analysis of the leakage rate based on the newly developed solution the parameters used in the sensitivity study include the dimensionless well radii rwd the skin factor sk the pumped aquifer anisotropic ratio kd the well partial penetration φ the aquitard aquifer specific storage ratio γ the aquitard aquifer vertical hydraulic conductivity ratio β the thickness ratio of the aquitard and aquifer bd and the dimensionless distance of outer boundary rbd in cases 2 and 3 figs 10 and 11 show the drawdown and wellbore flowrate sensitivity to parameters rwd sk kd φ γ β bd and rbd for an infinite leaky confined aquifer case 1 a finite leaky confined aquifer case 2 and a closed leaky confined aquifer case 3 respectively the other parameters used in those figures are rwd 0 01 rd 0 2 zd 0 5 φ 0 5 sk 0 1 kd 0 1 bd 0 2 γ 5 β 0 001 and rbd 20 fig 10 a and b indicate that the nearly same dimensionless drawdown sd sensitivity characteristics at rd 0 2 zd 0 5 with respect to the same parameter can be found due to constant head test at a partially penetrating well for cases 1 and 2 and the sensitivity for case 1 is a slightly greater than that for case 2 the drawdown is very sensitive to φ rwd and kd over the whole pumping stage especially to the well partial penetration φ the influence of the change in the other parameters on sd are relatively small and negligible the relative change of γ on sd is obvious at the period of 1 td 103 for cases 1 and 2 it notes that the influence of rbd on sd begins at td 1 then increases with pumping time and finally arrives at steady state when td 103 and its sensitivity is larger than kd and smaller than rwd in other words the outer boundary effect can be ignored when td 10 because the cone of depression induced by a constant head pumping well has not yet propagated to the outer boundary fig 10 c shows the absolute normalized sensitivities with regard to parameters of concern for case 3 as shown in this figure the relative changes in φ rwd and kd on sd are significant during the entire pumping period in addition the degrees of sensitivity of γ β bd and rbd on γd begin at different given pumping times e g for γ and β near td 10 for bd and rbd near td 200 and 8 respectively they increase gradually with the pumping time and arrive at the peak values until reaching non zero asymptotic values e g for rbd near td 104 or decrease gradually until disappearing or reaching a zero asymptotic value e g γ at late times the outer boundary distance rbd has the greatest influence on sd at the late pumping period for case 3 for comparison the effect of β and bd on sd for different cases are shown in fig 10 and one can see that bd on sd at late time for case 3 is more significantly influenced by β and bd than that for cases 1 and 2 moreover sk has a minor influence on sd during the total pumping period especially for an observation well nearby the pumping well fig 11 a and b demonstrate that the sensitivity characteristics of the wellbore flowrate qd for cases 1 and 2 with regard to the same parameter are nearly the same it can be found in these two figures that qd is very sensitive to the variation of φ rwd and kd during the whole pumping stage and their sensitivities reaches their respective asymptotic constants at late times the effects of the rest parameters including sk γ β and bd on qd are relatively minor moreover fig 11 b illustrates that qd is moderately sensitive to rbd and the degree of sensitivity starts to increase from td near 10 and reaches the asymptotic value around td near 100 for case 2 furthermore the degree of sensitivity to rbd is smaller than that to kd and larger than that to rwd fig 11 c shows that qd is very sensitivity to φ rwd and kd over the whole pumping stage for case 3 the degree of sensitivity to rwd is larger than to kd and smaller than that to φ at early times while the degree of sensitivity to kd is larger than that to rwd and smaller than that to φ at late times additionally fig 11 c indicates that the normalized sensitivity of qd to bd β and rbd start after some pumping time and reaches maximum values at late times for case 3 it should be noted that β has an earlier effect on the wellbore flowrate than bd and the effect of rbd on qd is the largest among all the parameters and the effect of bd and β on qd is the same and smaller than kd at late times on the other hand the effect of γ on qd only can be found at the intermediate pumping stage as expected it also can be found from fig 11 that the impact of sk on qd is minor compared to other parameters 5 summary and conclusions a new semi analytical drawdown solution for flow toward a partially penetrating constant head pumping well in a leaky confined aquifer is developed after applying laplace transform and separation of variables with a more rigorous treatment of aquitard leakage as an interface phenomenon rather than a volumetric source sink term for some available solutions note that the effect of different outer boundary aquitard storage and skin effect are taken into account as well the wellbore flowrate solutions in laplace space for constant head test are obtained under three different outer boundaries moreover semi analytical solutions for pumping induced leakage rate volume are derived for three different cases and are shown in supplementary materials table s1 and more crucially the leakage solutions are useful for managing similar aquifers in which pumping induced flow occurs at the aquitard aquifer interface the detailed characteristic of the drawdown the wellbore flowrate and leakage rate volume induced by constant head test at a partially penetrating well are provided based on the newly developed solutions and sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate how sensitive the drawdown and wellbore flowrate are to different hydraulic parameters under different cases the following findings can be concluded from this study 1 the drawdown in pumped confined aquifers for all cases are not affected by the different outer boundaries at early pumping times the effect of the outer boundary on the drawdown is more significant for a shorter outer boundary distance and the aquitard leakage should be regarded as an interface problem for analyzing the drawdown induced by constant head test no matter what the well partial penetration is 2 the wellbore flowrate distributions induced by constant head test in leaky confined aquifer with different boundaries agrees well with each other at early pumping times and the wellbore flowrate distribution in an infinite leaky confined aquifer case 1 is larger than that in a closed leaky confined aquifer with no flow condition at the outer radial boundary case 3 and smaller than that in a finite leaky confined aquifer with constant head condition at the outer radial boundary case 2 at intermediate and late pumping stages 3 the total leakage rate for constant head test for different cases are the same at early pumping times while the total leakage rate for case 3 is greater than that for case 2 and smaller than that for case 1 at the late pumping times and a larger outer boundary distance leads to a larger steady state value of total leakage rate 4 the cumulative leakage volume for all cases increases linearly with time during the later pumping stage and the cumulative leakage volume is the largest for case 1 and the smallest for case 2 during the whole pumping period at the same outer boundary distance and the slope is greater for a larger outer boundary distance in cases 2 and 3 and reaches a peak value in case 1 5 the leakage should be treated as an interface phenomenon otherwise the wellbore flowrate is overestimated according to the solution obtained using the hantush s approximation hantush 1959 especially at intermediate and late times while the hantush s approximation is feasible to determine the total leakage rate and the cumulative leakage volume induced by constant head test at a fully penetrating well in an infinite aquifer without considering the aquitard storage 6 the drawdown induced by constant head test at a partially penetrating well in different cases are sensitive to well partial penetration over the whole pumping stage and the outer boundary rbd has the strongest influence on drawdown at late times for case 3 7 the dimensionless wellbore flowrates in infinite finite closed leaky confined aquifer systems cases 1 2 and 3 are sensitive to the variation of φ rwd and kd during the whole pumping period for a leakage aquifer system our solutions can be directly used for predicting the drawdown distributions in an observation well and the transient wellbore flowrate exploring the effects of aquitard storage well partial penetration skin effect and the outer boundary on the drawdown the wellbore flowrate and leakage rate volume determining the hydraulic parameters of aquifers in aquifer tests and data analyses and qualifying the pumping induced leakage for a constant head test in addition our solutions show a great potential application value in other related field such as in geotechnical engineering

6773,road construction associated with land development generally increases erosion and sediment yields construction of unpaved roads has the potential to alter hydro sedimentological behavior and catchment sediment source dynamics and to date this has largely been investigated in forested environments the objective of this study therefore was to assess the relative importance of unpaved recreational roads as a sediment source alongside hillslope surface soils and stream channel banks in a non forested mountainous catchment in northern tehran iran using a fingerprinting procedure eleven geochemical tracers were measured on 27 samples collected to characterise the sediment sources and five suspended sediment samples collected at the study catchment outlet the statistical analysis employed to select three different composite fingerprints for discriminating the sediment sources comprised 1 the kruskal wallis h test kw h 2 a combination of kw h and discriminant function analysis dfa and 3 a combination of kw h and principal components classification analysis pcca a bayesian un mixing model was used to ascribe sediment source contributions using the three composite fingerprints using the kw h composite signature the respective relative contributions with uncertainty ranges from recreational roads hillslope surface soils and channel banks were estimated as 64 5 57 7 73 1 1 1 0 1 4 9 and 33 9 24 9 41 0 compared to 55 3 45 5 68 5 1 9 0 1 7 9 and 42 1 27 8 52 4 using a composite signature selected using a combination of kw h and dfa or 82 0 69 7 93 8 8 2 0 7 22 7 and 7 3 0 7 21 0 using a fingerprint selected using kw h and pcca the root mean square difference between the apportionment results using the fingerprints identified on the basis of the three different statistical approaches ranged from 5 5 to 25 7 highlighting the sensitivity of source estimates to the tracers used regardless the different composite signatures all suggested that unpaved recreational roads were the dominant source of the suspended sediment samples underscoring the need for mitigation measures targeting these anthropogenic features of the catchment system including closure to permit re vegetation surface ripping and or mulching to improve infiltration or gravel re surfacing to reduce exposure of bare surfaces to sediment mobilisation keywords geochemical tracers modified mixsir bayesian model sediment source tracing statistical techniques 1 introduction anthropogenic disturbance associated with land development such as intensive farming for crops or livestock deforestation or urbanisation generally modifies catchment hydrology and increases soil erosion and catchment sediment yields foley et al 2005 seutloali and beckedahl 2015 accelerated soil erosion and sediment delivery are identified as being of priority concern around the world because of many negative on site and off site consequences on site impacts include a reduction in soil productivity whilst off site effects include sedimentation of reservoirs or deterioration of water quality effective conservative actions for mitigating these effects require reliable information on key erosion processes and sediment sources at landscape scale one of the most substantial impacts on catchment erosion concerns road construction road networks artificially increase connectivity for transferring eroded materials through catchment systems croke et al 1999 motha et al 2004 during construction and utilization roads can accelerate soil erosion through diverse mechanisms such as removal of the protective vegetation cover and physical disturbance cao et al 2015 jimenez et al 2013 compaction of soil in road surfaces can reduce infiltration and as a result runoff potential is increased pereira et al 2015 cut slopes formed in conjunction with road construction can increase mass movements and release considerable volumes of sediment doten et al 2006 wu et al 2008 some researchers also report switches in the types of erosion such as to inter rill and gully erosion as a result of road construction clarke and walsh 2006 imwangana et al 2014 megahan et al 2001 investigated sediment production from forest road cutslopes in idaho usa and reported that erosion rates for the first winter period after construction averaged about five times greater than the average rates for subsequent seasons among different types of roads those that are unpaved or unsealed unmetalled tend to have the most significant contributions to sediment yield motha et al 2004 thomaz et al 2014 in general unpaved roads generate substantial amounts of sediment due to accelerated in situ erosion of unmetalled surfaces destabilisation of side cast material and the extension of the stream network and associated increased connectivity galia et al 2017 accordingly much previous research has reported the importance of unpaved roads as major sediment sources in rural catchments bravo linares et al 2017 froehlich

highly susceptible to hydraulic erosion processes and may produce significant amounts of sediment despite their relatively small areal extent collins et al 2010a cooper et al 2015 ramos scharrón and macdonald 2007a russell et al 2001 soil loss is closely related to erosivity rainfall amount and intensity and erodibility resistance of the soil to both detachment and transport the soil erodibility depends on topographic position slope steepness soil texture aggregate stability shear strength infiltration capacity organic and chemical content and land use management the transformation of natural hillslope profiles the interception of surface and subsurface flows construction of road banks reduced plant cover and the compaction of soil on the road bed are all potential causes of changes in erodibility jordán lópez et al 2009 a range of factors can control sediment mobilisation from unsealed roads including surface characteristics burroughs and king 1989 road construction and maintenance

traffic encourages sediment production by forcing fine sediment to the surface and via abrasion and crushing luce and black 1999 sheridan et al 2006 ziegler et al 2001 here atv and dirt bike impacts can be as substantial as those resulting from regular truck traffic welsh 2008 unpaved roads can also act as secondary sediment sources as a result of deposition and subsequent remobilisation froehlich and walling 1992 1997 gruszowski et al 2003 wemple et al 2001 even well designed road systems can alter catchment sediment budgets gucinski et al 2001 unpaved recreational roads have received less attention from previous research than those serving commercial forestry but can nevertheless play an important role in accelerating soil erosion and sediment production especially in hilly or mountainous terrains kidd et al 2014 for example studied the effect of such roads in southwestern virginia usa earmarking the role of recreational road stream crossings impacting on sediment delivery and water quality recreational roads can expose soils to higher rates of erosion in conjunction with exposure of the road bed cutslopes fill slopes and or ditches spinelli and marchi 1996 arnaez et al 2004 for example found that the cutslope of a road exhibited the highest erosion rates attributing the losses to mass wasting and freeze thaw processes along the cut banks which continuously release loose material however in contrast reid and dunne 1984 reported that the cutslope fill slope and ditches of unpaved roads contributed only a small amount of sediment compared to the exposed road surface identifying the relative contributions of sediment from unpaved recreational roads can be used to help inform erosion mitigation strategies historically different techniques and methods have been used to identify and apportion sediment sources ranging from traditional techniques such as erosion pins or field surveys of erosion features to sediment source fingerprinting collins and walling 2004 some research has also applied modelling fu et al 2010 penna et al 2014 a combination of direct volumetric measurements and 137cs based sediment budgeting katz et al 2014 or high resolution topographic mapping tarolli et al 2012 2013 the concept of sediment fingerprinting refers to a field based technique that apportions or un mixes sampled sediment into distinguishable sources through the use of different tracers combined in a so called composite fingerprint or signature collins et al 1997 2017 owens et al 2017 walling et al 1993 the importance of unpaved road margins in agricultural catchments and of unpaved roads in forested areas has already been explored using the source fingerprinting approach see for example collins et al 2010b haddadchi et al 2013 wallbrink et al 2002 in contrast the fingerprinting approach has not been used to investigate sediment contributions from unpaved recreational roads in a mountainous environment the main objective of this study was therefore to use a composite fingerprinting method combining different statistical tests for source discrimination and a bayesian un mixing model for apportionment to determine the relative importance of unpaved recreational roads in the koohsar catchment northern tehran iran it was hypothesized that unpaved recreational roads are the primary sediment source in the study catchment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the koohsar catchment 292 ha is located to the north of the capital of iran tehran city between 51⁰ 20 50 e to 51⁰ 21 45 e longitude and 35⁰ 47 36 n to 35⁰ 49 47 n latitude fig 1 in the southern alborz mountains the topography of the koohsar catchment is mountainous with elevations ranging from 1721 to 2793 m with a mean of 2154 m above sea level the average slope gradient is 43 3 the longest stream length is 4012 m land cover comprises 97 4 grazing land 284 5 ha and 2 6 residential urban use 7 5 ha the catchment lithology is primarily triassic sedimentary deposits including the karaj formation consisting of well bedded green tuff and tuffaceous shale ek the soil orders within the catchment are mainly entisols and inceptisols long term 20 years mean annual precipitation at the darakeh station near the study area is ca 450 mm in the upper parts of the region precipitation is mostly snow urban sprawl has the potential to influence geomorphic systems throughout the mountainous terrain in northern tehran city and particularly in the areas immediately adjacent to the residential developments and associated dense populations the construction of unpaved roads is widespread for the purpose of recreation in the study area several unpaved recreational roads have been constructed on hillslopes these recreational roads are usually 3 6 m in width and often follow watersheds on hillslopes and along mountain ridges the total length and drainage density of unpaved recreational roads in the study area are ca 12 2 km and 4 2 km km 2 respectively the road slope varies from 1 7 to 14 the damage caused by the frequent use of these roads and particularly by vehicle wheels promotes deepening these unpaved recreational roads can increase runoff and erosion and should therefore be a major source of sediment as a result consecutive check dams have been constructed at the study catchment outlet to intercept high sediment loads fig 2 a 2 2 field sampling sediment source samples prior to sampling field surveys were undertaken to identify potential sediment sources across the study area potential sediment sources were identified on the basis of soil erosion types observed within the study catchment surface soil erosion on hillslope rangelands or unpaved recreational roads and subsurface erosion affecting stream channel banks figs 1 and 2 a total of 27 source samples were collected to represent these key sediment sources comprising six from the hillslopes fifteen from unpaved recreational roads and six from channel banks in order to increase the representativeness of the individual source samples each surface 0 2 cm depth sample for recreational roads i e the road bed or the rangeland hillslopes 0 5 cm depth comprised a composite of five sub samples collected within ca 40 m2 at a specific site whereas each subsoil the full vertical extent of actively eroding profile faces sample comprised a composite of 10 sub samples collected within a 20 m long reach interval 2 m at each sampling site the source samples were assumed to provide a spatially representative snapshot of erosion source conditions at the time of sample collection but the temporal representativeness of the source samples was not investigated explicitly each composite source sample weighed at least 1 kg all source samples were retrieved from the field between may 2nd and may 5th 2016 similarly to many previous studies source samples were collected only once during the study period collins et al 2017 suspended sediment samples although a range of target sediment sample types can be used collins et al 2017 owens et al 2017 walling 2013 walling and collins 2016 the majority of sediment fingerprinting studies rely on the collection and analysis of suspended sediment transported during flood events collins and walling 2004 devereux et al 2010 mizugaki et al 2008 mukundan et al 2012 pulley et al 2015 in this study five bulk suspended sediment samples were collected from the study catchment outlet these samples spanned one water year to capture potential seasonal contrasts in sediment dynamics all individual suspended sediment samples were retrieved during flood events by collecting a large volume 40 to 80 l of water manually at varying time intervals during five rainfall runoff events december 12 2015 january 15 2016 march 01 2016 march 22 2016 and april 25 2016 at the catchment outlet these samples were decanted and manually filtered to de water sufficient sediment mass for all laboratory analyses the five rainfall runoff events sampled for sediment were monitored for discharge discharges were measured manually using the velocity area method gordon et al 2004 in a rectangular structure at the study catchment outlet this method requires measurement of the area of the channel cross section and the average stream velocity during each rainfall runoff event discharge is then calculated as q v s where q is discharge m3 s 1 v is average velocity m s 1 and s is cross sectional area of the water m2 area was calculated from cross section measurements calculated by multiplying width and depth flow velocity was measured with a current meter ott hydromet germany as the width of the rectangular structure at the study catchment outlet was fixed constant the velocity and depth of flow were measured three times during each storm event the mean estimated using three measurements for each individual event discharge during the runoff events sampled on december 12th 2015 january 15th 2016 march 01st 2016 march 22nd 2016 and april 25th 2016 was estimated minimum maximum ranges in brackets at 1 53 1 19 1 90 2 14 1 28 3 15 1 89 0 96 2 75 1 17 0 67 1 64 and 1 75 0 80 2 36 m3 s 1 respectively a snapshot of suspended sediment concentration during each event was measured by collecting an instantaneous 1 5 l sample of runoff water and using manual gravitational filtering and weighing in the laboratory the sediment concentrations during the events sampled on december 12th 2015 january 15th 2016 march 01st 2016 march 22nd 2016 and april 25th 2016 were estimated at 52 124 96 181 and 172 mg l 1 respectively given that the work reported here was a preliminary investigation of the importance of recreational roads as a sediment source in the study catchment the experimental design did not explore the implications of spatially heterogeneous snowfall or varying proportions of rainfall snowfall or freeze thaw on the magnitude timing and intensity of runoff induced erosion processes and thereby the estimated source proportions instead the work herein provided a first pass assessment of the relative contribution of recreational road erosion to sediment export from the study area 2 3 laboratory measurements of tracers dry sieving revealed that the 63 µm fraction was most representative of the suspended sediment samples collected in this study consequently only the 63 µm fraction of the sediment and source samples was used for the analysis and comparison of fingerprint properties in order to measure the concentrations of geochemical tracers one gram of the sediment and source samples 63 µm was digested in aqua regia hcl hno3 3 1 using a velp thermo reactor at 95 c for two hours after filtering the extracts through s s me24 0 2 µm filter papers the solutions were analysed by a varian spectraa 20 plus calibrated using an element standard solution merck kgaa frankfurter germany for ca co fe k mg mn na pb sr and zn concentrations the results showed that analytical error was less than 5 for all elements total organic carbon content was measured by the walkley black method skjemstad and baldock 2008 2 4 tracer conservation tests a range of factors can influence tracer conservation in the natural environment including redox temperature selective particle transport adsorption desorption or precipitation dissolution stumm and morgan 1996 the complex interplay of these controls will be highly variable and site specific a three part procedure was used to assess tracer conservation firstly a standard bracket or range test foster and lees 2000 was used to identify non conservative tracers whereby the tracer concentrations in the suspended sediment samples were compared with the corresponding minimum and maximum ranges associated with the sources samples which bound the un mixing polygon zhang and liu 2016 this standard test does not provide truly definitive confirmation of tracer conservation but instead is used to confirm that major transformation is not occurring during sediment mobilisation and delivery secondly in addition to the standard test the tracers were checked using a stricter test whereby the sediment sample means should fall within the corresponding source means rather than their full ranges this stricter range test is useful because sediment sample tracer concentrations commonly exhibit limited variation compared with source samples meaning that tracers easily pass the standard range test procedure thirdly to augment the testing for conservatism further biplots of tracers included in the final statistically verified composite fingerprints were also used to compare source and sediment samples here the source and sediment sample values will plot in the same space or along the same line if tracer behaviour is conservative in combination these three tests provide a more robust assessment of conservatism than the standard range test alone 2 5 statistical discrimination of sediment sources the statistical analysis employed to identify different composite fingerprints for discriminating between the potential sediment sources used three approaches 1 the kruskal wallis h test kw h 2 a combination of the kw h as step one and discriminant function analysis dfa as step two and 3 a combination of the kw h as step one and principal component classification analysis pcca as the second step three final composite signatures were therefore selected on this basis all statistical analyses were performed using statistica v 8 0 statsoft 2008 it is well established that selecting differing composite signatures using independent statistical tests based on different rules can generate contrasting estimates of source apportionment this reflects the sensitivity of the source fingerprinting approach to the tracers included in any composite signature the international tracing community has widely accepted that it is better to be explicit about this aspect of sensitivity by using more than one composite signature selected by different statistical tests e g collins et al 2012 2013 2014 2017 owens et al 2017 palazón et al 2015 palazón and navas 2017 2 5 1 kruskal wallis h test the kw h is a non parametric equivalent of one way anova to compare more than two groups and tests the null hypothesis that the different groups in the comparison are drawn from the same distribution or from distributions with the same median however unlike one way anova it does not make assumptions about homogeneity of variance or normal distributions thus the interpretation of the kw h is basically similar to that of parametric one way anova except that it is based on ranks rather than means dytham 2011 2 5 2 discriminant function analysis dfa those tracers exhibiting statistically significant differences between the potential sediment sources using kw h were included in the dfa dfa has been used extensively in sediment source fingerprinting investigations e g gellis and noe 2013 laceby et al 2015 walling 2013 since an early study by collins et al 1997 the basis of dfa is to provide a set of weightings that allow the source groups to be distinguished the weightings can then be used on individuals that are not assigned to a group to provide a probability of them belonging to each of the possible source groups different tests including eigenvalue canonical correlation wilks lambda and squared mahalanobis were used to determine whether the discriminant functions were statistically significant membership of the sediment source groups was the dependent variable whereas the measured tracers constituted the independent variables 2 5 3 principal component classification analysis pcca pcca can be used as a classification technique in addition to reducing the dimensions of the original variable space so that the relations among variables and cases can be highlighted to do this the variables and the cases are plotted in the space generated by the principal component axes this technique works in very much the same way as pca but with one crucial difference the individual samples must be assigned to source groups before the analysis the test then calculates the variable weightings that will maximize the differences between source groups rather than individuals as is the case with pca the pcca produces weightings that will allow you to identify those variables that are the most different between source groups and discard those that are the same only those tracers with significant differences between the potential sediment sources using kw h were included in the pcca principal components with eigenvalues 1 were retained and subjected to a varimax rotation to minimize the number of tracers that have high loadings on each pc under a particular pc each tracer is given a weight or pc loading that represents the contribution of that tracer to the composition of the pc only the highly weighted tracers were retained from each pc highly weighted tracer loadings were defined as having absolute values within 10 of the highest tracer loading when more than one tracer was retained under a single pc multivariate correlation coefficients were employed to determine if the tracers could be considered redundant and therefore eliminated from the final set of tracers i e composite fingerprint if the highly weighted tracers were not correlated assumed to be a correlation coefficient 0 60 then each was considered important and thus retained in the final composite signature among well correlated tracers the tracer with the highest pc loading absolute value was chosen for the final composite fingerprint once the composite signature was chosen a final check was undertaken to identify significant differences among the potential sediment sources based on the pc scores of each sample using one way anova f test and tukey hsd post hoc tests p 0 05 2 6 source apportionment using the modified mixsir bayesian un mixing model some recent sediment source tracing studies applying un mixing models have used the modified mixsir bayesian model nosrati et al 2014 2018 this model provides a bayesian rather than frequentist e g collins et al 1997 walling et al 2006 2008 approach to apportionment modelling and builds upon earlier tools constructed for isotopic studies e g moore and semmens 2008 parnell and jackson 2011 parnell et al 2010 the modified mixsir bayesian statistical approach quantifies the relative contributions of sediment from different sources by calculating probability distributions for the proportional contribution fi of each source i to the downstream target sediment samples in three stages 1 determination of the prior probability distributions for model parameters 2 construction of a likelihood function for the statistical model and 3 derivation of the posterior probability distributions for the parameters using the bayes rule to adjust the prior distribution based on the observed data the bayes rule states that the posterior probability distribution for all fi is proportional to the prior probability distributions multiplied by the likelihood and then dividing by their sum viz 1 p f q data l d a t a f q p f q l d a t a f q p f q where l data fq is the likelihood of the data given fq p fq representing the prior probability being true based on prior information and fq is the proportional source contributions of q proposed vectors the relative contributions of sediment are factored into the model by defining mean and variance parameters for each sediment source i and the final sets of tracers composite fingerprints j modelling source contributions using more than one composite signature permits an assessment of the potential uncertainty resulting from different fingerprint property sets collins et al 2012 the proposed tracer distributions for the target sediment mixtures collected from the study catchment outlet are determined by solving for the proposed means μ j and standard deviations σ j of the sediment mixtures based on the randomly drawn fi values comprising a vector fq 2 μ j i 1 n f i m j sourc e i 3 σ j i 1 n f i 2 s j sourc e i 2 where m j sourc e i in eq 3 is the mean and s j sourc e i 2 in eq 4 is the variance of the jth sediment tracer and the ith sediment source based on the μ j and σ j of each property comprising each final composite fingerprint the likelihood of the data given the proposed sediment mixture is calculated as 4 l x μ j σ j k 1 n j 1 n 1 σ j 2 π exp x kj μ j 2 2 σ j 2 where x kj represents the jth tracer property of the kth sediment sample using a version of the sampling importance resampling sir algorithm moore and semmens 2008 we generated 106 samples from the posterior distribution of the estimated target sediment mixtures this method establishes a threshold acceptance value prior to sampling and uses it simultaneously to resample as the un normalized posterior probabilities for each fq sample are calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 final tracers and composite fingerprints for discriminating the potential sediment sources table 1 compares the tracer concentrations in the sediment sources and five suspended sediment samples collected at the study catchment outlet in addition table 1 also presents the results of the normality test for tracers showing that all measured tracers had normal distributions a prerequisite for using the tracers in a bayesian model the results of the standard bracket test showed that all tracers were generally conservative in addition to the standard test the results of comparing the sediment means with the corresponding source means showed that all tracers except k and na are conservative table 1 therefore these two tracers were removed from further analysis table 1 also shows the results of applying the kw h test which indicated that seven tracers ca co fe mg mn oc and sr exhibited a statistically significant difference between the three potential sediment sources those tracers pb and zn unable to discriminate the potential sources were discarded from further analysis the seven tracers selected by the kw h test were entered into the stepwise dfa table 2 the largest eigenvalue of the first function 25 1 corresponds to the eigenvector in the direction of the maximum spread of the groups means the wilk s lambda value of the first function 0 015 indicated that 98 5 of the total variance among the potential sediment sources was explained by these tracers the canonical correlation value was 0 98 and indicated a strong correlation between the discriminant scores and the individual source groups the squared mahalanobis distance showed that the sediment sources were well separated by the shortlisted tracers table 2 the backward stepwise dfa yielded classification matrices assigning 100 of the cases i e source samples to the correct groups table 2 stepwise selection using wilks lambda indicated that a composite signature comprising four tracers ca mg mn and oc provided significant discriminatory power on the basis of the dfa model table 3 the results of different tests within dfa indicated that the discriminatory power of mg and mn is perfect table 3 partial wilks lambda is the wilks lambda for the unique contribution of the respective tracer to the discrimination between individual source groups the smaller the partial wilks lambda the greater the contribution to the overall discrimination the partial wilks lambda values suggested that mg contributed the most mn second most oc third most and ca the least to the overall discrimination table 3 a scatterplot using the first and second discriminant functions calculated using backward dfa confirmed that the samples collected to characterise the different potential sediment sources were well separated fig 3 tracers passing the kw h test ca co fe mg mn oc and sr were also tested using pcca all tracers were further explored as an alternative means of reducing the number of tracers and problems of multicollinearity the results of pcca showed that the first three principal components pcs with eigenvalues 1 accounted for 86 of the variability among the tracer values for the source groups table 4 the pc corresponding to the largest eigenvalue 3 7 accounted for approximately 52 of the total variance the second pc corresponding to the second eigenvalue 1 4 accounted for approximately 19 of the total variance table 4 the pc corresponding to the smallest selected eigenvalue 1 0 accounted for approximately 14 of the total variance table 4 the highly weighted tracers under pc1 with absolute values within 10 of the highest tracer 0 93 value for sr loading the loading of selected tracers should be larger than 0 84 were mg and sr only sr was retained for the final composite signature because mg and sr were strongly correlated r 0 76 also this tracer was most important due to the highest communality estimate table 4 under pc2 the highly weighted tracer with absolute values within 10 of the highest tracer 0 67 value for fe loading the loading of selected tracers should be larger than 0 60 was fe under pc3 the highly weighted tracer 0 69 value for oc with absolute values within 10 of the highest tracer loading the loading of selected tracers should be larger than 0 62 was oc these results selected these three tracers sr fe and oc as an alternative composite fingerprint on the basis of the pcca model table 4 the plot of principal component pc coordinates of tracers for the first two pcs showed that the three selected tracers were represented by the current set of pcs fig 4 a thus the set of selected tracers i e composite fingerprint clearly provided discrimination between the three potential sediment sources fig 4b these results illustrated that pcca can be used as a tool for identifying important dimensions in a set of tracers and to identify those sediment sources with similar or dissimilar characteristics pcs scores were calculated using the resulting component score coefficient matrix and tested for significant differences between the potential sediment sources table 4 pc scores for both pcs varied significantly with sediment source table 4 thus the tracers related to these pcs provided a basis for selection of an alternative composite signature sr fe and oc for the tracers selected in the final composite signatures the biplots of all tracer pairings for source and sediment samples were compared the results confirmed that there is no major tracer transformation fig 5 3 2 sediment source contributions using priors and estimates of uncertainty associated with the un mixing model inputs a modified mixsir model run of 106 iterations resulted in convergence on the posterior contributions from the sources using the three different composite signatures selected using the independent tests fig 6 using kw h table 5 the relative contributions with corresponding uncertainty ranges from recreational roads hillslope surface soils and channel banks were estimated as 64 5 57 7 73 1 1 1 0 1 4 9 and 33 9 24 9 41 0 respectively using the alternative composite signature selected by a combination of kw h and dfa table 5 the corresponding respective contributions and associated uncertainty ranges were estimated as 55 3 45 5 68 5 1 9 0 1 7 9 and 42 1 27 8 52 4 finally on the basis of the composite signature selected using a combination of kw h and pcca table 5 the relative contributions from recreational roads hillslope surface soils and channel banks were estimated as 82 0 69 7 93 8 8 2 0 7 22 7 and 7 3 0 7 21 0 respectively the root mean square difference table 5 between the estimated sediment contributions using the three different composite signatures ranged from 5 5 hillslope surface soils to 25 7 channel banks the predicted source contributions were therefore sensitive to the composite fingerprint used underscoring the need to use multiple signatures when investigating sediment source contributions cf collins et al 2012 2017 nosrati et al 2018 owens et al 2017 palazón and navas 2017 3 3 discussion previous studies in other areas of the world have highlighted unpaved roads as landscape features experiencing high erosion rates and as important contributors to sediment fluxes in river catchments for example ramos scharrón and macdonald 2007a and croke et al 1999 observed erosion rates of between four and six orders of magnitude higher on unpaved roads than on undisturbed hillslope areas in the u s virgin islands and coastal southeast australia respectively jordán lópez et al 2009 reported that highest soil loss rates were found on road banks and that the total soil loss on road banks was between 3 and 18 times higher than corresponding estimates for road beds and side cast fills respectively megahan et al 2001 reported that erosion rates for the first winter period after forest road construction in idaho usa averaged about five times greater than the corresponding average rates for subsequent monitoring seasons motha et al 2004 reported that relative contributions from gravel surfaced roads grouped lands un graveled roads pasture lands and cultivated lands on basalt derived soils cultivated lands on granite derived soils and forest areas to sediment sampled on the falling limbs of event hydrographs were 41 17 18 13 13 11 and 14 7 respectively the relative contributions during a peak discharge event were 52 12 30 17 15 11 and 17 8 respectively froehlich and walling 1997 reported that the evidence provided by radiocaesium fingerprints suggested that the major source of the suspended sediment transported by the homerka stream was unmetalled roads which occur throughout both the forested and the agricultural zones of this study basin in the polish flysch carpathians equally data measured using rainfall simulations on plots or on slope segments also demonstrated that unpaved roads are the major source of suspended sediment jordán lópez et al 2009 reported that the highest sediment concentration in runoff was detected on the roadbank from which mean sediment yield was estimated at 13 7 g l 1 ramos scharrón and macdonald 2007b reviewed studies of small scale erosion on unsealed roads the sediment concentrations they reported ranged from 70 mg l 1 to 227 000 mg l 1 fu et al 2010 reviewed road erosion data provided by rainfall simulator and flume studies the hourly sediment erosion rates ranged from 0 3 to 35 9 g m 2 mm 1 h 1 these estimates suggest a very large range in road erosion rates across different study areas the source apportionment estimates generated here using different composite signatures underscored the importance of sediment loss from recreational roads in the study catchment unpaved recreational roads have a propensity to alter catchment hydrology and sediment dynamics with common impacts including increasing hortonian overland flow ramos scharrón and lafevor 2016 ziegler and giambelluca 1997 altering the magnitude and timing of peak flows in response to rainfall la marche and lettenmaier 2001 accelerating runoff responses to precipitation froehlich 1995 and increasing sediment yields bilby 1985 brunsden and thornes 1979 fransen et al 2001 poeppl et al 2017 such hydro sedimentological impacts largely reflect the role of unmetalled roads in increasing drainage density by artificially extending flow pathways and the stream network croke and mockler 2001 luce and wemple 2001 takken et al 2008 here it is important to note however that the impact of unmetalled roads on sediment dynamics via increasing drainage density and connectivity from slopes to channels depends on source strength associated with the erodibility of unmetalled road surfaces croke et al 2005 in addition the impact of unmetalled roads on hydro sedimentological response is strongly influenced by the location and arrangement of road drainage structures including mitre drains and culverts croke et al 2005 gully development at culvert outlets enhances connectivity between unmetalled road networks and streams with such gully development being controlled by contributing area road runoff and hillslope gradient croke et al 2005 montgomery 1994 where runoff mobilising sediment from unpaved road networks discharges onto well vegetated slopes impacts on hydro sedimentological responses are smaller haupt 1959 given that the source apportionment estimates underscored the importance of unpaved recreational roads in the study area appropriate mitigation measures need to be identified and implemented existing common ways of reducing the adverse impacts of unmetalled roads on catchment sediment dynamics include decommissioning or closing roads switalski et al 2004 weaver et al 2015 road closure whilst not always reducing infiltration rates to background levels foltz et al 2009 does improve infiltration reduce surface degradation by vehicle traffic and permit re vegetation all of which collectively reduce sediment production foltz et al 2009 in situations where it is not possible to close or decommission unpaved recreational roads alternative mitigation can comprise compaction treatment by roadbed ripping luce 1997 weaver et al 2015 although here the treatment effect can be transient robichaud 2000 furthermore ripping alone has been shown to not be as effective as a combination of ripping and mulching sosa pérez and macdonald 2017 where unpaved recreational roads are retained gravel re surfacing can be used to enhance trafficability and to reduce mobilisation of surface sediment from the road bed brown et al 2013 clinton and vose 2003 3 4 limitations the source apportionment estimates discussed above must inevitably be interpreted in the context of some limitations numbers of samples collected to characterise individual sources by any sediment fingerprinting investigation are inevitably constrained by available budgets as well as practical considerations including those associated with the mountainous terrain of the study area and rarely if ever satisfy statistically based probability sampling collins and walling 2004 a single source sampling campaign was undertaken and so any potential sensitivity issues surrounding general replicability associated with the timing and locations of the source samples including those from the unpaved recreational roads were not investigated explicitly different locations within the same source category will clearly be characterised by different erosion histories spatial patterns and intensities meaning that repeat source sampling could affect signatures and hence the overall findings equally the work on account of its duration did not consider the potential impacts of spatially heterogeneous snowfall varying proportions of rainfall snowfall or freeze thaw on the magnitude timing and intensity of runoff induced erosion processes and thereby potentially the source apportionment estimates the source apportionment estimates are scale dependent and it important to recognise that they might differ for different sampling locations along the study catchment channel network koiter et al 2013 in this study target suspended sediment for source apportionment was collected from a single downstream location on the main stem of the study river as a result the source proportions pertain to this specific sampling site and additional stream network locations would need to be included to assess potential variations in sediment source contributions at different scales within the study area sediment sampling also needs to be temporally representative and this study sampled the catchment outlet across one water year but in the context of hydro climatic variability it would be informative to sample additional water years for this reason some previous sediment source tracing investigations albeit in different physiographical settings to the one involved here have reported sampling spanning more than a single year e g walling et al 2006 walling et al 2008 although sediment sample collection during a single year is also reported in published studies e g gellis and noe 2013 nosrati 2017 tracer property transformation during mobilisation and delivery to and through the stream network was assumed not to be significant enough to impact on the predicted source proportions here although tracer properties were tested for major transformation using a three part procedure this does not confirm a complete absence of tracer transformation and this potential issue associated with source tracing requires further work various factors can influence sediment tracer conservation during mobilisation and transport through catchment systems including biogeochemical processes such as adsorption or desorption förstner and salomons 1980 as well as physical factors such as particle size selectivity grygar and popelka 2016 horowitz 1991 a limited amount of previous research has tested tracer conservation experimentally e g motha et al 2002 and both past motha et al 2004 or more recent sherriff et al 2015 work has incorporated explicit assessment of tracer transformation in sediment un mixing modelling there remains however no widespread consensus as to the best additional and more detailed means of quantifying tracer conservativeness as a standard component of fingerprinting methodological decision trees meaning that the range test remains a standard step in data processing procedures collins et al 2017 in the study reported here however a three part assessment was used for tracer conservation in addition the sampling of deviate tracer values during the un mixing modelling using tracer distributions constructed on the basis of the sediment samples collected from the catchment outlet provided an additional means of taking some account of potential tracer transformations collins et al 2014 collection of sediment samples from additional reaches along the channel network would permit inclusion of a more representative range of sediment tracer values and thereby of the potential for tracer conservation 4 conclusions sediment fingerprinting was successfully used to investigate the relative importance of unpaved recreational roads as a sediment source in the study area this suggests that the approach has the potential to address a similar research question in other environmental settings assuming good source discrimination can be achieved with the tracers selected we therefore recommend consideration of the approach reported here by those investigators wanting to apportion sediment loss from unpaved roads and additional landscape sources elsewhere in the world three different composite signatures were selected using different statistical tests but each signature suggested that the unpaved recreational roads dominate source contributions to the suspended sediment samples collected at the study catchment outlet it remains important to assess the sensitivity of fingerprinting results to different composite signatures a modified bayesian mixing model was successfully used to estimate the relative source contributions but where the requirements of a bayesian approach are not satisfied by the tracer data alternative frequentist models used by the sediment source fingerprinting research community could be applied the findings support the targeting of management resources towards addressing the erosion of unpaved recreational roads management interventions need to be selected on the basis of experience elsewhere in tackling sediment loss from unpaved road systems in river catchments interventions will need to be implemented with due care and attention and well maintained to ensure sustained impact under ambient hydro climatic conditions and the ongoing need for recreational access to mountainous areas

6773,road construction associated with land development generally increases erosion and sediment yields construction of unpaved roads has the potential to alter hydro sedimentological behavior and catchment sediment source dynamics and to date this has largely been investigated in forested environments the objective of this study therefore was to assess the relative importance of unpaved recreational roads as a sediment source alongside hillslope surface soils and stream channel banks in a non forested mountainous catchment in northern tehran iran using a fingerprinting procedure eleven geochemical tracers were measured on 27 samples collected to characterise the sediment sources and five suspended sediment samples collected at the study catchment outlet the statistical analysis employed to select three different composite fingerprints for discriminating the sediment sources comprised 1 the kruskal wallis h test kw h 2 a combination of kw h and discriminant function analysis dfa and 3 a combination of kw h and principal components classification analysis pcca a bayesian un mixing model was used to ascribe sediment source contributions using the three composite fingerprints using the kw h composite signature the respective relative contributions with uncertainty ranges from recreational roads hillslope surface soils and channel banks were estimated as 64 5 57 7 73 1 1 1 0 1 4 9 and 33 9 24 9 41 0 compared to 55 3 45 5 68 5 1 9 0 1 7 9 and 42 1 27 8 52 4 using a composite signature selected using a combination of kw h and dfa or 82 0 69 7 93 8 8 2 0 7 22 7 and 7 3 0 7 21 0 using a fingerprint selected using kw h and pcca the root mean square difference between the apportionment results using the fingerprints identified on the basis of the three different statistical approaches ranged from 5 5 to 25 7 highlighting the sensitivity of source estimates to the tracers used regardless the different composite signatures all suggested that unpaved recreational roads were the dominant source of the suspended sediment samples underscoring the need for mitigation measures targeting these anthropogenic features of the catchment system including closure to permit re vegetation surface ripping and or mulching to improve infiltration or gravel re surfacing to reduce exposure of bare surfaces to sediment mobilisation keywords geochemical tracers modified mixsir bayesian model sediment source tracing statistical techniques 1 introduction anthropogenic disturbance associated with land development such as intensive farming for crops or livestock deforestation or urbanisation generally modifies catchment hydrology and increases soil erosion and catchment sediment yields foley et al 2005 seutloali and beckedahl 2015 accelerated soil erosion and sediment delivery are identified as being of priority concern around the world because of many negative on site and off site consequences on site impacts include a reduction in soil productivity whilst off site effects include sedimentation of reservoirs or deterioration of water quality effective conservative actions for mitigating these effects require reliable information on key erosion processes and sediment sources at landscape scale one of the most substantial impacts on catchment erosion concerns road construction road networks artificially increase connectivity for transferring eroded materials through catchment systems croke et al 1999 motha et al 2004 during construction and utilization roads can accelerate soil erosion through diverse mechanisms such as removal of the protective vegetation cover and physical disturbance cao et al 2015 jimenez et al 2013 compaction of soil in road surfaces can reduce infiltration and as a result runoff potential is increased pereira et al 2015 cut slopes formed in conjunction with road construction can increase mass movements and release considerable volumes of sediment doten et al 2006 wu et al 2008 some researchers also report switches in the types of erosion such as to inter rill and gully erosion as a result of road construction clarke and walsh 2006 imwangana et al 2014 megahan et al 2001 investigated sediment production from forest road cutslopes in idaho usa and reported that erosion rates for the first winter period after construction averaged about five times greater than the average rates for subsequent seasons among different types of roads those that are unpaved or unsealed unmetalled tend to have the most significant contributions to sediment yield motha et al 2004 thomaz et al 2014 in general unpaved roads generate substantial amounts of sediment due to accelerated in situ erosion of unmetalled surfaces destabilisation of side cast material and the extension of the stream network and associated increased connectivity galia et al 2017 accordingly much previous research has reported the importance of unpaved roads as major sediment sources in rural catchments bravo linares et al 2017 froehlich

highly susceptible to hydraulic erosion processes and may produce significant amounts of sediment despite their relatively small areal extent collins et al 2010a cooper et al 2015 ramos scharrón and macdonald 2007a russell et al 2001 soil loss is closely related to erosivity rainfall amount and intensity and erodibility resistance of the soil to both detachment and transport the soil erodibility depends on topographic position slope steepness soil texture aggregate stability shear strength infiltration capacity organic and chemical content and land use management the transformation of natural hillslope profiles the interception of surface and subsurface flows construction of road banks reduced plant cover and the compaction of soil on the road bed are all potential causes of changes in erodibility jordán lópez et al 2009 a range of factors can control sediment mobilisation from unsealed roads including surface characteristics burroughs and king 1989 road construction and maintenance

traffic encourages sediment production by forcing fine sediment to the surface and via abrasion and crushing luce and black 1999 sheridan et al 2006 ziegler et al 2001 here atv and dirt bike impacts can be as substantial as those resulting from regular truck traffic welsh 2008 unpaved roads can also act as secondary sediment sources as a result of deposition and subsequent remobilisation froehlich and walling 1992 1997 gruszowski et al 2003 wemple et al 2001 even well designed road systems can alter catchment sediment budgets gucinski et al 2001 unpaved recreational roads have received less attention from previous research than those serving commercial forestry but can nevertheless play an important role in accelerating soil erosion and sediment production especially in hilly or mountainous terrains kidd et al 2014 for example studied the effect of such roads in southwestern virginia usa earmarking the role of recreational road stream crossings impacting on sediment delivery and water quality recreational roads can expose soils to higher rates of erosion in conjunction with exposure of the road bed cutslopes fill slopes and or ditches spinelli and marchi 1996 arnaez et al 2004 for example found that the cutslope of a road exhibited the highest erosion rates attributing the losses to mass wasting and freeze thaw processes along the cut banks which continuously release loose material however in contrast reid and dunne 1984 reported that the cutslope fill slope and ditches of unpaved roads contributed only a small amount of sediment compared to the exposed road surface identifying the relative contributions of sediment from unpaved recreational roads can be used to help inform erosion mitigation strategies historically different techniques and methods have been used to identify and apportion sediment sources ranging from traditional techniques such as erosion pins or field surveys of erosion features to sediment source fingerprinting collins and walling 2004 some research has also applied modelling fu et al 2010 penna et al 2014 a combination of direct volumetric measurements and 137cs based sediment budgeting katz et al 2014 or high resolution topographic mapping tarolli et al 2012 2013 the concept of sediment fingerprinting refers to a field based technique that apportions or un mixes sampled sediment into distinguishable sources through the use of different tracers combined in a so called composite fingerprint or signature collins et al 1997 2017 owens et al 2017 walling et al 1993 the importance of unpaved road margins in agricultural catchments and of unpaved roads in forested areas has already been explored using the source fingerprinting approach see for example collins et al 2010b haddadchi et al 2013 wallbrink et al 2002 in contrast the fingerprinting approach has not been used to investigate sediment contributions from unpaved recreational roads in a mountainous environment the main objective of this study was therefore to use a composite fingerprinting method combining different statistical tests for source discrimination and a bayesian un mixing model for apportionment to determine the relative importance of unpaved recreational roads in the koohsar catchment northern tehran iran it was hypothesized that unpaved recreational roads are the primary sediment source in the study catchment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the koohsar catchment 292 ha is located to the north of the capital of iran tehran city between 51⁰ 20 50 e to 51⁰ 21 45 e longitude and 35⁰ 47 36 n to 35⁰ 49 47 n latitude fig 1 in the southern alborz mountains the topography of the koohsar catchment is mountainous with elevations ranging from 1721 to 2793 m with a mean of 2154 m above sea level the average slope gradient is 43 3 the longest stream length is 4012 m land cover comprises 97 4 grazing land 284 5 ha and 2 6 residential urban use 7 5 ha the catchment lithology is primarily triassic sedimentary deposits including the karaj formation consisting of well bedded green tuff and tuffaceous shale ek the soil orders within the catchment are mainly entisols and inceptisols long term 20 years mean annual precipitation at the darakeh station near the study area is ca 450 mm in the upper parts of the region precipitation is mostly snow urban sprawl has the potential to influence geomorphic systems throughout the mountainous terrain in northern tehran city and particularly in the areas immediately adjacent to the residential developments and associated dense populations the construction of unpaved roads is widespread for the purpose of recreation in the study area several unpaved recreational roads have been constructed on hillslopes these recreational roads are usually 3 6 m in width and often follow watersheds on hillslopes and along mountain ridges the total length and drainage density of unpaved recreational roads in the study area are ca 12 2 km and 4 2 km km 2 respectively the road slope varies from 1 7 to 14 the damage caused by the frequent use of these roads and particularly by vehicle wheels promotes deepening these unpaved recreational roads can increase runoff and erosion and should therefore be a major source of sediment as a result consecutive check dams have been constructed at the study catchment outlet to intercept high sediment loads fig 2 a 2 2 field sampling sediment source samples prior to sampling field surveys were undertaken to identify potential sediment sources across the study area potential sediment sources were identified on the basis of soil erosion types observed within the study catchment surface soil erosion on hillslope rangelands or unpaved recreational roads and subsurface erosion affecting stream channel banks figs 1 and 2 a total of 27 source samples were collected to represent these key sediment sources comprising six from the hillslopes fifteen from unpaved recreational roads and six from channel banks in order to increase the representativeness of the individual source samples each surface 0 2 cm depth sample for recreational roads i e the road bed or the rangeland hillslopes 0 5 cm depth comprised a composite of five sub samples collected within ca 40 m2 at a specific site whereas each subsoil the full vertical extent of actively eroding profile faces sample comprised a composite of 10 sub samples collected within a 20 m long reach interval 2 m at each sampling site the source samples were assumed to provide a spatially representative snapshot of erosion source conditions at the time of sample collection but the temporal representativeness of the source samples was not investigated explicitly each composite source sample weighed at least 1 kg all source samples were retrieved from the field between may 2nd and may 5th 2016 similarly to many previous studies source samples were collected only once during the study period collins et al 2017 suspended sediment samples although a range of target sediment sample types can be used collins et al 2017 owens et al 2017 walling 2013 walling and collins 2016 the majority of sediment fingerprinting studies rely on the collection and analysis of suspended sediment transported during flood events collins and walling 2004 devereux et al 2010 mizugaki et al 2008 mukundan et al 2012 pulley et al 2015 in this study five bulk suspended sediment samples were collected from the study catchment outlet these samples spanned one water year to capture potential seasonal contrasts in sediment dynamics all individual suspended sediment samples were retrieved during flood events by collecting a large volume 40 to 80 l of water manually at varying time intervals during five rainfall runoff events december 12 2015 january 15 2016 march 01 2016 march 22 2016 and april 25 2016 at the catchment outlet these samples were decanted and manually filtered to de water sufficient sediment mass for all laboratory analyses the five rainfall runoff events sampled for sediment were monitored for discharge discharges were measured manually using the velocity area method gordon et al 2004 in a rectangular structure at the study catchment outlet this method requires measurement of the area of the channel cross section and the average stream velocity during each rainfall runoff event discharge is then calculated as q v s where q is discharge m3 s 1 v is average velocity m s 1 and s is cross sectional area of the water m2 area was calculated from cross section measurements calculated by multiplying width and depth flow velocity was measured with a current meter ott hydromet germany as the width of the rectangular structure at the study catchment outlet was fixed constant the velocity and depth of flow were measured three times during each storm event the mean estimated using three measurements for each individual event discharge during the runoff events sampled on december 12th 2015 january 15th 2016 march 01st 2016 march 22nd 2016 and april 25th 2016 was estimated minimum maximum ranges in brackets at 1 53 1 19 1 90 2 14 1 28 3 15 1 89 0 96 2 75 1 17 0 67 1 64 and 1 75 0 80 2 36 m3 s 1 respectively a snapshot of suspended sediment concentration during each event was measured by collecting an instantaneous 1 5 l sample of runoff water and using manual gravitational filtering and weighing in the laboratory the sediment concentrations during the events sampled on december 12th 2015 january 15th 2016 march 01st 2016 march 22nd 2016 and april 25th 2016 were estimated at 52 124 96 181 and 172 mg l 1 respectively given that the work reported here was a preliminary investigation of the importance of recreational roads as a sediment source in the study catchment the experimental design did not explore the implications of spatially heterogeneous snowfall or varying proportions of rainfall snowfall or freeze thaw on the magnitude timing and intensity of runoff induced erosion processes and thereby the estimated source proportions instead the work herein provided a first pass assessment of the relative contribution of recreational road erosion to sediment export from the study area 2 3 laboratory measurements of tracers dry sieving revealed that the 63 µm fraction was most representative of the suspended sediment samples collected in this study consequently only the 63 µm fraction of the sediment and source samples was used for the analysis and comparison of fingerprint properties in order to measure the concentrations of geochemical tracers one gram of the sediment and source samples 63 µm was digested in aqua regia hcl hno3 3 1 using a velp thermo reactor at 95 c for two hours after filtering the extracts through s s me24 0 2 µm filter papers the solutions were analysed by a varian spectraa 20 plus calibrated using an element standard solution merck kgaa frankfurter germany for ca co fe k mg mn na pb sr and zn concentrations the results showed that analytical error was less than 5 for all elements total organic carbon content was measured by the walkley black method skjemstad and baldock 2008 2 4 tracer conservation tests a range of factors can influence tracer conservation in the natural environment including redox temperature selective particle transport adsorption desorption or precipitation dissolution stumm and morgan 1996 the complex interplay of these controls will be highly variable and site specific a three part procedure was used to assess tracer conservation firstly a standard bracket or range test foster and lees 2000 was used to identify non conservative tracers whereby the tracer concentrations in the suspended sediment samples were compared with the corresponding minimum and maximum ranges associated with the sources samples which bound the un mixing polygon zhang and liu 2016 this standard test does not provide truly definitive confirmation of tracer conservation but instead is used to confirm that major transformation is not occurring during sediment mobilisation and delivery secondly in addition to the standard test the tracers were checked using a stricter test whereby the sediment sample means should fall within the corresponding source means rather than their full ranges this stricter range test is useful because sediment sample tracer concentrations commonly exhibit limited variation compared with source samples meaning that tracers easily pass the standard range test procedure thirdly to augment the testing for conservatism further biplots of tracers included in the final statistically verified composite fingerprints were also used to compare source and sediment samples here the source and sediment sample values will plot in the same space or along the same line if tracer behaviour is conservative in combination these three tests provide a more robust assessment of conservatism than the standard range test alone 2 5 statistical discrimination of sediment sources the statistical analysis employed to identify different composite fingerprints for discriminating between the potential sediment sources used three approaches 1 the kruskal wallis h test kw h 2 a combination of the kw h as step one and discriminant function analysis dfa as step two and 3 a combination of the kw h as step one and principal component classification analysis pcca as the second step three final composite signatures were therefore selected on this basis all statistical analyses were performed using statistica v 8 0 statsoft 2008 it is well established that selecting differing composite signatures using independent statistical tests based on different rules can generate contrasting estimates of source apportionment this reflects the sensitivity of the source fingerprinting approach to the tracers included in any composite signature the international tracing community has widely accepted that it is better to be explicit about this aspect of sensitivity by using more than one composite signature selected by different statistical tests e g collins et al 2012 2013 2014 2017 owens et al 2017 palazón et al 2015 palazón and navas 2017 2 5 1 kruskal wallis h test the kw h is a non parametric equivalent of one way anova to compare more than two groups and tests the null hypothesis that the different groups in the comparison are drawn from the same distribution or from distributions with the same median however unlike one way anova it does not make assumptions about homogeneity of variance or normal distributions thus the interpretation of the kw h is basically similar to that of parametric one way anova except that it is based on ranks rather than means dytham 2011 2 5 2 discriminant function analysis dfa those tracers exhibiting statistically significant differences between the potential sediment sources using kw h were included in the dfa dfa has been used extensively in sediment source fingerprinting investigations e g gellis and noe 2013 laceby et al 2015 walling 2013 since an early study by collins et al 1997 the basis of dfa is to provide a set of weightings that allow the source groups to be distinguished the weightings can then be used on individuals that are not assigned to a group to provide a probability of them belonging to each of the possible source groups different tests including eigenvalue canonical correlation wilks lambda and squared mahalanobis were used to determine whether the discriminant functions were statistically significant membership of the sediment source groups was the dependent variable whereas the measured tracers constituted the independent variables 2 5 3 principal component classification analysis pcca pcca can be used as a classification technique in addition to reducing the dimensions of the original variable space so that the relations among variables and cases can be highlighted to do this the variables and the cases are plotted in the space generated by the principal component axes this technique works in very much the same way as pca but with one crucial difference the individual samples must be assigned to source groups before the analysis the test then calculates the variable weightings that will maximize the differences between source groups rather than individuals as is the case with pca the pcca produces weightings that will allow you to identify those variables that are the most different between source groups and discard those that are the same only those tracers with significant differences between the potential sediment sources using kw h were included in the pcca principal components with eigenvalues 1 were retained and subjected to a varimax rotation to minimize the number of tracers that have high loadings on each pc under a particular pc each tracer is given a weight or pc loading that represents the contribution of that tracer to the composition of the pc only the highly weighted tracers were retained from each pc highly weighted tracer loadings were defined as having absolute values within 10 of the highest tracer loading when more than one tracer was retained under a single pc multivariate correlation coefficients were employed to determine if the tracers could be considered redundant and therefore eliminated from the final set of tracers i e composite fingerprint if the highly weighted tracers were not correlated assumed to be a correlation coefficient 0 60 then each was considered important and thus retained in the final composite signature among well correlated tracers the tracer with the highest pc loading absolute value was chosen for the final composite fingerprint once the composite signature was chosen a final check was undertaken to identify significant differences among the potential sediment sources based on the pc scores of each sample using one way anova f test and tukey hsd post hoc tests p 0 05 2 6 source apportionment using the modified mixsir bayesian un mixing model some recent sediment source tracing studies applying un mixing models have used the modified mixsir bayesian model nosrati et al 2014 2018 this model provides a bayesian rather than frequentist e g collins et al 1997 walling et al 2006 2008 approach to apportionment modelling and builds upon earlier tools constructed for isotopic studies e g moore and semmens 2008 parnell and jackson 2011 parnell et al 2010 the modified mixsir bayesian statistical approach quantifies the relative contributions of sediment from different sources by calculating probability distributions for the proportional contribution fi of each source i to the downstream target sediment samples in three stages 1 determination of the prior probability distributions for model parameters 2 construction of a likelihood function for the statistical model and 3 derivation of the posterior probability distributions for the parameters using the bayes rule to adjust the prior distribution based on the observed data the bayes rule states that the posterior probability distribution for all fi is proportional to the prior probability distributions multiplied by the likelihood and then dividing by their sum viz 1 p f q data l d a t a f q p f q l d a t a f q p f q where l data fq is the likelihood of the data given fq p fq representing the prior probability being true based on prior information and fq is the proportional source contributions of q proposed vectors the relative contributions of sediment are factored into the model by defining mean and variance parameters for each sediment source i and the final sets of tracers composite fingerprints j modelling source contributions using more than one composite signature permits an assessment of the potential uncertainty resulting from different fingerprint property sets collins et al 2012 the proposed tracer distributions for the target sediment mixtures collected from the study catchment outlet are determined by solving for the proposed means μ j and standard deviations σ j of the sediment mixtures based on the randomly drawn fi values comprising a vector fq 2 μ j i 1 n f i m j sourc e i 3 σ j i 1 n f i 2 s j sourc e i 2 where m j sourc e i in eq 3 is the mean and s j sourc e i 2 in eq 4 is the variance of the jth sediment tracer and the ith sediment source based on the μ j and σ j of each property comprising each final composite fingerprint the likelihood of the data given the proposed sediment mixture is calculated as 4 l x μ j σ j k 1 n j 1 n 1 σ j 2 π exp x kj μ j 2 2 σ j 2 where x kj represents the jth tracer property of the kth sediment sample using a version of the sampling importance resampling sir algorithm moore and semmens 2008 we generated 106 samples from the posterior distribution of the estimated target sediment mixtures this method establishes a threshold acceptance value prior to sampling and uses it simultaneously to resample as the un normalized posterior probabilities for each fq sample are calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 final tracers and composite fingerprints for discriminating the potential sediment sources table 1 compares the tracer concentrations in the sediment sources and five suspended sediment samples collected at the study catchment outlet in addition table 1 also presents the results of the normality test for tracers showing that all measured tracers had normal distributions a prerequisite for using the tracers in a bayesian model the results of the standard bracket test showed that all tracers were generally conservative in addition to the standard test the results of comparing the sediment means with the corresponding source means showed that all tracers except k and na are conservative table 1 therefore these two tracers were removed from further analysis table 1 also shows the results of applying the kw h test which indicated that seven tracers ca co fe mg mn oc and sr exhibited a statistically significant difference between the three potential sediment sources those tracers pb and zn unable to discriminate the potential sources were discarded from further analysis the seven tracers selected by the kw h test were entered into the stepwise dfa table 2 the largest eigenvalue of the first function 25 1 corresponds to the eigenvector in the direction of the maximum spread of the groups means the wilk s lambda value of the first function 0 015 indicated that 98 5 of the total variance among the potential sediment sources was explained by these tracers the canonical correlation value was 0 98 and indicated a strong correlation between the discriminant scores and the individual source groups the squared mahalanobis distance showed that the sediment sources were well separated by the shortlisted tracers table 2 the backward stepwise dfa yielded classification matrices assigning 100 of the cases i e source samples to the correct groups table 2 stepwise selection using wilks lambda indicated that a composite signature comprising four tracers ca mg mn and oc provided significant discriminatory power on the basis of the dfa model table 3 the results of different tests within dfa indicated that the discriminatory power of mg and mn is perfect table 3 partial wilks lambda is the wilks lambda for the unique contribution of the respective tracer to the discrimination between individual source groups the smaller the partial wilks lambda the greater the contribution to the overall discrimination the partial wilks lambda values suggested that mg contributed the most mn second most oc third most and ca the least to the overall discrimination table 3 a scatterplot using the first and second discriminant functions calculated using backward dfa confirmed that the samples collected to characterise the different potential sediment sources were well separated fig 3 tracers passing the kw h test ca co fe mg mn oc and sr were also tested using pcca all tracers were further explored as an alternative means of reducing the number of tracers and problems of multicollinearity the results of pcca showed that the first three principal components pcs with eigenvalues 1 accounted for 86 of the variability among the tracer values for the source groups table 4 the pc corresponding to the largest eigenvalue 3 7 accounted for approximately 52 of the total variance the second pc corresponding to the second eigenvalue 1 4 accounted for approximately 19 of the total variance table 4 the pc corresponding to the smallest selected eigenvalue 1 0 accounted for approximately 14 of the total variance table 4 the highly weighted tracers under pc1 with absolute values within 10 of the highest tracer 0 93 value for sr loading the loading of selected tracers should be larger than 0 84 were mg and sr only sr was retained for the final composite signature because mg and sr were strongly correlated r 0 76 also this tracer was most important due to the highest communality estimate table 4 under pc2 the highly weighted tracer with absolute values within 10 of the highest tracer 0 67 value for fe loading the loading of selected tracers should be larger than 0 60 was fe under pc3 the highly weighted tracer 0 69 value for oc with absolute values within 10 of the highest tracer loading the loading of selected tracers should be larger than 0 62 was oc these results selected these three tracers sr fe and oc as an alternative composite fingerprint on the basis of the pcca model table 4 the plot of principal component pc coordinates of tracers for the first two pcs showed that the three selected tracers were represented by the current set of pcs fig 4 a thus the set of selected tracers i e composite fingerprint clearly provided discrimination between the three potential sediment sources fig 4b these results illustrated that pcca can be used as a tool for identifying important dimensions in a set of tracers and to identify those sediment sources with similar or dissimilar characteristics pcs scores were calculated using the resulting component score coefficient matrix and tested for significant differences between the potential sediment sources table 4 pc scores for both pcs varied significantly with sediment source table 4 thus the tracers related to these pcs provided a basis for selection of an alternative composite signature sr fe and oc for the tracers selected in the final composite signatures the biplots of all tracer pairings for source and sediment samples were compared the results confirmed that there is no major tracer transformation fig 5 3 2 sediment source contributions using priors and estimates of uncertainty associated with the un mixing model inputs a modified mixsir model run of 106 iterations resulted in convergence on the posterior contributions from the sources using the three different composite signatures selected using the independent tests fig 6 using kw h table 5 the relative contributions with corresponding uncertainty ranges from recreational roads hillslope surface soils and channel banks were estimated as 64 5 57 7 73 1 1 1 0 1 4 9 and 33 9 24 9 41 0 respectively using the alternative composite signature selected by a combination of kw h and dfa table 5 the corresponding respective contributions and associated uncertainty ranges were estimated as 55 3 45 5 68 5 1 9 0 1 7 9 and 42 1 27 8 52 4 finally on the basis of the composite signature selected using a combination of kw h and pcca table 5 the relative contributions from recreational roads hillslope surface soils and channel banks were estimated as 82 0 69 7 93 8 8 2 0 7 22 7 and 7 3 0 7 21 0 respectively the root mean square difference table 5 between the estimated sediment contributions using the three different composite signatures ranged from 5 5 hillslope surface soils to 25 7 channel banks the predicted source contributions were therefore sensitive to the composite fingerprint used underscoring the need to use multiple signatures when investigating sediment source contributions cf collins et al 2012 2017 nosrati et al 2018 owens et al 2017 palazón and navas 2017 3 3 discussion previous studies in other areas of the world have highlighted unpaved roads as landscape features experiencing high erosion rates and as important contributors to sediment fluxes in river catchments for example ramos scharrón and macdonald 2007a and croke et al 1999 observed erosion rates of between four and six orders of magnitude higher on unpaved roads than on undisturbed hillslope areas in the u s virgin islands and coastal southeast australia respectively jordán lópez et al 2009 reported that highest soil loss rates were found on road banks and that the total soil loss on road banks was between 3 and 18 times higher than corresponding estimates for road beds and side cast fills respectively megahan et al 2001 reported that erosion rates for the first winter period after forest road construction in idaho usa averaged about five times greater than the corresponding average rates for subsequent monitoring seasons motha et al 2004 reported that relative contributions from gravel surfaced roads grouped lands un graveled roads pasture lands and cultivated lands on basalt derived soils cultivated lands on granite derived soils and forest areas to sediment sampled on the falling limbs of event hydrographs were 41 17 18 13 13 11 and 14 7 respectively the relative contributions during a peak discharge event were 52 12 30 17 15 11 and 17 8 respectively froehlich and walling 1997 reported that the evidence provided by radiocaesium fingerprints suggested that the major source of the suspended sediment transported by the homerka stream was unmetalled roads which occur throughout both the forested and the agricultural zones of this study basin in the polish flysch carpathians equally data measured using rainfall simulations on plots or on slope segments also demonstrated that unpaved roads are the major source of suspended sediment jordán lópez et al 2009 reported that the highest sediment concentration in runoff was detected on the roadbank from which mean sediment yield was estimated at 13 7 g l 1 ramos scharrón and macdonald 2007b reviewed studies of small scale erosion on unsealed roads the sediment concentrations they reported ranged from 70 mg l 1 to 227 000 mg l 1 fu et al 2010 reviewed road erosion data provided by rainfall simulator and flume studies the hourly sediment erosion rates ranged from 0 3 to 35 9 g m 2 mm 1 h 1 these estimates suggest a very large range in road erosion rates across different study areas the source apportionment estimates generated here using different composite signatures underscored the importance of sediment loss from recreational roads in the study catchment unpaved recreational roads have a propensity to alter catchment hydrology and sediment dynamics with common impacts including increasing hortonian overland flow ramos scharrón and lafevor 2016 ziegler and giambelluca 1997 altering the magnitude and timing of peak flows in response to rainfall la marche and lettenmaier 2001 accelerating runoff responses to precipitation froehlich 1995 and increasing sediment yields bilby 1985 brunsden and thornes 1979 fransen et al 2001 poeppl et al 2017 such hydro sedimentological impacts largely reflect the role of unmetalled roads in increasing drainage density by artificially extending flow pathways and the stream network croke and mockler 2001 luce and wemple 2001 takken et al 2008 here it is important to note however that the impact of unmetalled roads on sediment dynamics via increasing drainage density and connectivity from slopes to channels depends on source strength associated with the erodibility of unmetalled road surfaces croke et al 2005 in addition the impact of unmetalled roads on hydro sedimentological response is strongly influenced by the location and arrangement of road drainage structures including mitre drains and culverts croke et al 2005 gully development at culvert outlets enhances connectivity between unmetalled road networks and streams with such gully development being controlled by contributing area road runoff and hillslope gradient croke et al 2005 montgomery 1994 where runoff mobilising sediment from unpaved road networks discharges onto well vegetated slopes impacts on hydro sedimentological responses are smaller haupt 1959 given that the source apportionment estimates underscored the importance of unpaved recreational roads in the study area appropriate mitigation measures need to be identified and implemented existing common ways of reducing the adverse impacts of unmetalled roads on catchment sediment dynamics include decommissioning or closing roads switalski et al 2004 weaver et al 2015 road closure whilst not always reducing infiltration rates to background levels foltz et al 2009 does improve infiltration reduce surface degradation by vehicle traffic and permit re vegetation all of which collectively reduce sediment production foltz et al 2009 in situations where it is not possible to close or decommission unpaved recreational roads alternative mitigation can comprise compaction treatment by roadbed ripping luce 1997 weaver et al 2015 although here the treatment effect can be transient robichaud 2000 furthermore ripping alone has been shown to not be as effective as a combination of ripping and mulching sosa pérez and macdonald 2017 where unpaved recreational roads are retained gravel re surfacing can be used to enhance trafficability and to reduce mobilisation of surface sediment from the road bed brown et al 2013 clinton and vose 2003 3 4 limitations the source apportionment estimates discussed above must inevitably be interpreted in the context of some limitations numbers of samples collected to characterise individual sources by any sediment fingerprinting investigation are inevitably constrained by available budgets as well as practical considerations including those associated with the mountainous terrain of the study area and rarely if ever satisfy statistically based probability sampling collins and walling 2004 a single source sampling campaign was undertaken and so any potential sensitivity issues surrounding general replicability associated with the timing and locations of the source samples including those from the unpaved recreational roads were not investigated explicitly different locations within the same source category will clearly be characterised by different erosion histories spatial patterns and intensities meaning that repeat source sampling could affect signatures and hence the overall findings equally the work on account of its duration did not consider the potential impacts of spatially heterogeneous snowfall varying proportions of rainfall snowfall or freeze thaw on the magnitude timing and intensity of runoff induced erosion processes and thereby potentially the source apportionment estimates the source apportionment estimates are scale dependent and it important to recognise that they might differ for different sampling locations along the study catchment channel network koiter et al 2013 in this study target suspended sediment for source apportionment was collected from a single downstream location on the main stem of the study river as a result the source proportions pertain to this specific sampling site and additional stream network locations would need to be included to assess potential variations in sediment source contributions at different scales within the study area sediment sampling also needs to be temporally representative and this study sampled the catchment outlet across one water year but in the context of hydro climatic variability it would be informative to sample additional water years for this reason some previous sediment source tracing investigations albeit in different physiographical settings to the one involved here have reported sampling spanning more than a single year e g walling et al 2006 walling et al 2008 although sediment sample collection during a single year is also reported in published studies e g gellis and noe 2013 nosrati 2017 tracer property transformation during mobilisation and delivery to and through the stream network was assumed not to be significant enough to impact on the predicted source proportions here although tracer properties were tested for major transformation using a three part procedure this does not confirm a complete absence of tracer transformation and this potential issue associated with source tracing requires further work various factors can influence sediment tracer conservation during mobilisation and transport through catchment systems including biogeochemical processes such as adsorption or desorption förstner and salomons 1980 as well as physical factors such as particle size selectivity grygar and popelka 2016 horowitz 1991 a limited amount of previous research has tested tracer conservation experimentally e g motha et al 2002 and both past motha et al 2004 or more recent sherriff et al 2015 work has incorporated explicit assessment of tracer transformation in sediment un mixing modelling there remains however no widespread consensus as to the best additional and more detailed means of quantifying tracer conservativeness as a standard component of fingerprinting methodological decision trees meaning that the range test remains a standard step in data processing procedures collins et al 2017 in the study reported here however a three part assessment was used for tracer conservation in addition the sampling of deviate tracer values during the un mixing modelling using tracer distributions constructed on the basis of the sediment samples collected from the catchment outlet provided an additional means of taking some account of potential tracer transformations collins et al 2014 collection of sediment samples from additional reaches along the channel network would permit inclusion of a more representative range of sediment tracer values and thereby of the potential for tracer conservation 4 conclusions sediment fingerprinting was successfully used to investigate the relative importance of unpaved recreational roads as a sediment source in the study area this suggests that the approach has the potential to address a similar research question in other environmental settings assuming good source discrimination can be achieved with the tracers selected we therefore recommend consideration of the approach reported here by those investigators wanting to apportion sediment loss from unpaved roads and additional landscape sources elsewhere in the world three different composite signatures were selected using different statistical tests but each signature suggested that the unpaved recreational roads dominate source contributions to the suspended sediment samples collected at the study catchment outlet it remains important to assess the sensitivity of fingerprinting results to different composite signatures a modified bayesian mixing model was successfully used to estimate the relative source contributions but where the requirements of a bayesian approach are not satisfied by the tracer data alternative frequentist models used by the sediment source fingerprinting research community could be applied the findings support the targeting of management resources towards addressing the erosion of unpaved recreational roads management interventions need to be selected on the basis of experience elsewhere in tackling sediment loss from unpaved road systems in river catchments interventions will need to be implemented with due care and attention and well maintained to ensure sustained impact under ambient hydro climatic conditions and the ongoing need for recreational access to mountainous areas

6774,lake chad was once the sixth largest lake in the world with a surface area of about 25 000 km2 in the early 1960s however it has shrunk to almost only one twentieth of its maximum area by now as the biggest river of the lake chad basin the chari logone river contributes approximately 90 of lake chad s water input consequently several previous studies have focused on the chari logone river system to investigate the causes of lake chad s shrinkage however due to the lack of authoritative irrigation and natural runoff observations it is usually difficult to explain the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability in this paper unlike the hydrological modeling approaches used in previous studies a conceptual and statistical approach was presented to investigate discharge variations and the causes leading to such variations specifically the runoff change caused by climate variability δ q climate was estimated using budyko analysis while that caused by human activities δ q human was estimated using regression analysis the accuracy of estimation was evaluated through cross validation and comparison with previous studies the comparison suggests that due to the lack of natural runoff and irrigation withdrawal observations the runoff simulation produced by previous hydrological models suffers from large errors the water loss of the chari logone river discharge is dominated by human activities rather than climate variability on annual average scale the total water loss caused by climate variability and anthropogenic activities is 16 76 km3 the relative contribution of δ q climate and δ q human is 26 83 and 73 17 respectively the role of human activities is particularly obvious in recent ten years from 2003 to 2013 due to the increase of rainfall and irrigation withdrawals the relative contribution of human activities accounts for more than 80 of the total water loss keywords runoff change climate variability human activities chari logone river budyko analysis statistical analysis 1 introduction lake chad lies in an endoreic basin on the southern margin of the sahara coe and foley 2001 leblanc et al 2011 as a very flat and shallow lake lake chad responds rapidly to precipitation and runoff in the early 1960s lake chad was africa s fourth largest lake and the sixth largest in the world with a surface area of about 25 000 km2 odada et al 2005 however it has shrunk to almost one twentieth of its maximum area in the subsequent forty years okpara et al 2016 lake chad is composed of freshwater which is rare for an endorheic lake its location on the edge of the sahara desert makes it an oasis providing a vital source of water for humans livestock and wildlife bouchez et al 2016 coe and birkett 2004 leblanc et al 2003 water scarcity caused by the lake s recession has triggered food insecurity poverty migration conflicts and ecological degradation buma et al 2016 in 2016 the lake chad basin commission lcbc declared that one of its three mandates is to manage the waters of lake chad and the other transboundary water resources in the lake chad basin in a sustainable and equitable way lcbc 2016 an important step towards this would be to evaluate the natural and anthropogenic causes for the shrinking of lake chad located in an endorheic drainage basin lake chad retains inflow of water but allows no outflow to other water bodies the water budget of lake chad has been investigated in several studies bouchez et al 2016 lcbc 2016 odada et al 2005 olivry et al 1996 vuillaume 1981 according to lcbc 2016 during the period from 1988 to 2010 the main input of lake chad is the chari logone river system discharge 21 1 km3 yr or 88 7 of total inputs supplemented by direct rainfall 8 of total inputs and inflow from other small tributaries such as the el beid and komadugu yobe 0 3 and 0 5 km3 yr respectively it is clear that the fluctuation of lake chad is dominated by the chari logone river system discharge boronina and ramillien 2008 ndehedehe et al 2016 there are also other observations to support this claim for example during the lake recession in the second half of the 20th century the annual mean discharge of the chari logone river system observed at n djamena has decreased from about 40 km3 yr in the early 1960s to 10 15 km3 yr in the 1980s and 1990s jung et al 2011 as a result almost all previous studies have focused on the chari logone river system to investigate the causes of lake chad s shrinkage coe and foley 2001 gao et al 2011 based on such studies birkett 2000 coe and foley 2001 gao et al 2011 lemoalle et al 2012 it is increasingly recognized that the shrinkage is caused by persistent droughts and increased irrigation withdrawals the basic logic is as follows the combined effects of climate variability and anthropogenic activities lead to significant reduction in the discharge of the chari logone river system in turn this situation has resulted in the shrinkage of the lake odada et al 2005 however this theory fails to explain the relative contribution of anthropogenic activities and climate variability hydrological models were usually adopted in earlier studies to simulate the discharge of the chari logone river coe and foley 2001 gao et al 2011 due to the lack of authoritative water withdrawal and natural runoff observations it is usually difficult to calibrate the model accurately for example in coe and foley s model coe and foley 2001 water loss caused by irrigation withdrawal was assumed to be invariable over fifteen years controlled by precipitation variability and water management practices the irrigation rate tends to vary significantly with time therefore the assumption of a constant irrigation rate in earlier studies would necessarily introduce some error to the simulation results in contrast with the hydrological modeling approaches used in previous studies a conceptual and statistical approach was adopted in this research to evaluate the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability on the water loss of the chari logone river discharge the runoff change caused by climate variability was estimated using budyko analysis while that caused by anthropogenic activities was estimated using regression analysis the independence of these two approaches makes it possible for us to compare and evaluate their respective results specifically the aims of this study are 1 to evaluate the long term variation characteristics of the chari logone river discharge from 1950 to 2013 2 to quantify the water loss caused by water withdrawals and climate variability since the 1960s and 3 to distinguish the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability on river discharge 2 general situation of the chari logone river basin the lake chad drainage basin is located between latitude 6 and 24 n and longitude 7 and 24 e covering an area of 2 434 000 km2 bastola and francois 2012 odada et al 2005 it has a monsoon climate with rainfall mostly occurring in the southern one third of the basin and semiarid and arid conditions in the north coe and birkett 2004 the annual average rainfall is 320 mm ranging from nearly 1600 mm in the southwest part to less than 150 mm in the north odada et al 2005 consequently runoff is generated predominantly in the southern portions of the drainage basin and transported via the chari logone river system to the town of n djamena and thereafter to lake chad coe and birkett 2004 the chari logone river basin is drained by the chari river and its principle tributary the logone river fig 1 its total area is 690 000 km2 an estimated 28 of the total area of the lake chad basin the chari river is a 1200 km long stream originating in the central african republic the logone river is 1000 km long and has its origin in cameroon these two rivers converge at n djamena the capital and largest city of chad as a result chari river s discharge measured at n djamena represents the greatest proportion of discharge input to lake chad coe and birkett 2004 precipitation over the chari logone river basin varies significantly throughout the seasons the rainy season is relatively short from june to october with the dry season lasting from november to the following may on annual average scale precipitation during the rainy season accounts for 85 of the total precipitation with a peak value in august the river discharge from august to december accounts for 80 of the total discharge with a peak value in october besides the high variability in precipitation water use in human activities also has a direct impact on the river discharge according to the lcbc 2016 agriculture particularly through irrigation systems accounts for most water usage in the basin most of these activities occur along the chari logone river in chad and cameroon traditionally agriculture in the lake chad basin was conducted in the upland rain fed field where precipitation is plentiful more reliable production and higher yields however are available in low lying areas that are seasonally flooded by tributary streams hutchinson et al 1992 with irrigation becoming increasingly widespread to meet growing population demands the vulnerability of rainfed agriculture to climate stress has increased lcbc 2016 as a result large quantities of water from inflowing rivers are being diverted for irrigation purposes before flowing into the lake it is estimated that over one third of the waters from the chari logone river system are diverted before reaching lake chad onyekakeyah 2008 3 material and methods 3 1 material used in this research three datasets are used in this study the first one is the monthly discharge q of the chari logone river system from 1950 to 2013 observed at n djamena it is provided by the lake chad basin commission the second dataset is the grid precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e 0 data provided by the climatic research unit cru it is produced through interpolation techniques using average data from climatic models and stations harris et al 2014 harris and jones 2015 in this paper the cru ts version 4 01 product with a spatial grid of 30 arc minutes is used to retrieve the spatial average of monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration over the chari logone river basin the third dataset is the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao statistics faostat which is available on the homepage of the fao annual agricultural area of the three countries chad cameroon and central african republic covered by the chari river basin is used to evaluate our results as auxiliary data 3 2 methods used in this research 3 2 1 trend analysis the mann kendall mk trend detection test is used to analyze the long term variation characteristics of precipitation and river discharge the nonparametric mk test proposed by mann 1945 and kendall 1975 has been widely used to assess the significance of monotonic trends in climatological meteorological and hydrological data time series asoka et al 2017 dittus et al 2015 shan and mishra 2016 it is based on the correlation between the ranks of a time series and their time order specifically for a time series x x 1 x 2 x n the mk test statistic s is given as follows 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i 2 s g n x j x i 1 x i x j 0 x i x j 1 x i x j where x i and x j are the data values at times i and j and n is the length of the data set positive s values indicate upward increasing trends while negative s values indicate downward decreasing trends for parametric trend tests such as the regression coefficient test it is usually assumed that the data follow a normal distribution in contrast the mk test depends only on the ranks of the samples rather than their original values which results in a distribution free test statistic consequently it has the advantage that its power and significance are not influenced by the actual distribution of the data hamed 2008 3 2 2 correlation analysis the pearson correlation coefficient r is used in this paper to evaluate the correlation relationship between two variables lena and margara 2010 love 2013 in mathematics it is the covariance of two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations for time series x x 1 x 2 x n and y y 1 y 2 y n the pearson r is defined as follows 3 r c o v x y σ x σ y x i x y i y x i x 2 y i y 2 the value of r ranges from 1 to 1 with the values of 1 and 1 representing total positive and negative correlations respectively a value of 0 means there is no correlation 3 2 3 quantifying the impact of climate variability and human activities 3 2 3 1 basic framework the discharge of the chari logone river system into lake chad results from climatic variability and anthropogenic activities the discharge measured at n djamena is the part of streamflow left by water withdrawals upstream rather than the total natural runoff generated by precipitation in order to distinguish the impact of climate variability and human activities on river discharge a period with little impact of human activities is usually defined as the baseline period for comparison ahn and merwade 2014 wu et al 2017 according to coe and foley 2001 and gao et al 2011 discharge loss due to irrigation withdrawal is close to zero for the chari logone river basin in the early 1960s therefore the period from 1950 to 1960 is adopted as the baseline period of our research for each year thereafter the change of river discharge caused by climate variability and anthropogenic activities can be calculated as follows 4 δ q total δ q climate δ q human q o i q baseline where δ q total δ q climate and δ q human are the total change of river discharge and that caused by climate variability and anthropogenic water withdrawal activities respectively q o i is the observed annual river discharge in the year i and q baseline is the annual average river discharge over the whole baseline period in theory the values of δ q climate δ q human and δ q total can be either positive or negative for consistency positive and negative values are used in this paper to label water loss and water surplus respectively accordingly there are two concepts to be discriminated and clarified the first one is the relative contribution of climate variability and human activities on the change of river discharge they are defined as follows 5 cq climate δ q climate δ q climate δ q human 100 6 cq human δ q human δ q climate δ q human 100 where cq climate and cq human represent the relative contribution of climate variability and anthropogenic activities on the change of river discharge respectively the function with the symbol of absolute value is used to reflect both the positive and negative impact of climate variability and human activities the second concept is the relative contribution of climate variability and human activities on the water loss of river discharge their mathematical expression is described below 7 c climate q climate q climate q human 100 8 c human q human q climate q human 100 where c climate and c human are the relative contribution of climate variability and anthropogenic activities on the water loss of river discharge respectively obviously eqs 7 and 8 hold true only when the values of both δ q climate and δ q human are positive over the study period 3 2 3 2 estimation of δ q climate based on budyko analysis budyko 1974 proposed that in a watershed over a long term time scale the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation e p is governed by the climatic dryness index which is defined as the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation e 0 p since then multiple mathematical equations have been developed to describe the budyko hypothesis a summary of these equations can be found in dey and mishra 2017 wu et al 2017 and yang et al 2008 based on the budyko hypothesis schaake 1990 pointed out that the climate elasticity method can be used to evaluate the impact of climate change on runoff specifically the change in runoff caused by climate variability is decomposed into the impact of changes in potential evaporation δ e 0 and precipitation δ p as follows 9 δ q climate ε p δ p ε e 0 δ e 0 where ε p and ε e 0 are elasticity coefficients of runoff with respect to p and e 0 respectively the equation proposed by zhang et al 2001 is used in our research to describe the budyko hypothesis as follows 10 e p 1 ω e 0 p 1 ω e 0 p e 0 p 1 where ω is a model parameter related to land surface characteristics including vegetation soil type topography and climate seasonality li et al 2013 following the parameterization scheme proposed by ahn and merwade 2014 ω is estimated by trial and error approach and e is estimated based on water balance equation as below 11 p e q δ s where δ s is the change in water storage at the basin scale which is assumed to be negligible over ten year periods once parameter ω is certain the elasticity coefficients in eq 9 are calculated following the parameterization schemes proposed by li et al 2007 as follows 12 ε p 1 2 x 3 ω x 1 x ω x 2 2 13 ε e 0 1 2 ω x 1 x w x 2 2 where x is the climatic dryness index e 0 p assuming the period from 1950 to 1960 as the baseline the change in runoff caused by climate variability thereafter is estimated through the combination of eqs 9 12 and 13 3 2 3 3 estimation of δ q human based on regression analysis according to the review of dey and mishra 2017 most of previous studies have focused on the modification of land use land cover lulc to investigate the impact of human activities on hydrological processes hydrological modeling approaches are usually adopted to address such research objectives to be specific hydrological models are firstly calibrated using the natural runoff observations during the calibration period and then they are used to predict the natural runoff during the testing period asoka et al 2018 mishra et al 2010 schilling et al 2008 the change in runoff due to lulc modification δ q lulc is estimated as follows 14 δ q lulc q on q p where q on is the observed streamflow during the testing period which represents the natural runoff under current lulc conditions q p is the predicted runoff during the testing period which is produced by using current meteorological observations and previous lulc conditions as inputs it is clear that there are two assumptions involved in such studies firstly the impact of human activities on river discharge is caused mainly by lulc change rather than water withdrawal activities secondly both the natural runoff and lulc conditions are known however it is not the case in this research just as numerous studies have revealed the decrease of chari river discharge into lake chad is mainly caused by increased irrigation withdrawals in addition to climate variability birkett 2000 coe and foley 2001 gao et al 2011 lemoalle et al 2012 due to the lack of authoritative observations both the irrigation withdrawals and lulc conditions are unknown for these reasons a statistical approach is designed here to evaluate the impact of human water withdrawal activities on river discharge jiang et al 2011 suggest that monthly runoff q can be retrieved from precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e 0 using a linear regression model the studies of meng et al 2016 and herrnegger et al 2015 show that the impact p and e 0 on monthly q has lag effect consequently jiang et al s formula is modified as follows for monthly runoff simulation 15 q i f p i p i 1 p i 2 p i 3 e 0 i e 0 i 1 e 0 i 2 e 0 i 3 where q i p i and e 0 i represent runoff precipitation and potential evapotranspiration of month i respectively the function is established using multiple stepwise linear regression method so that only explanatory variables that have passed significance test are introduced to the final regression model eq 15 is established to predict natural runoff without water withdrawal activities therefore only monthly observations during the baseline period are utilized for model calibration and validation specifically the observations from 1950 to 1957 are used for calibration with those of the remaining three years for validation based on the regression model of eq 15 the water loss caused by human water withdrawal activities δ q human can be estimated as 16 δ q human q om q p where q om is the observed river charge during the testing period which represents the part of streamflow left by water withdrawals upstream q p is the predicted natural runoff during the testing period which is produced by using current p and e 0 observations as the inputs of eq 15 eq 14 and 16 are very similar in form but the meaning of their parameters is quite different eq 14 is used to investigate the impact of lulc change on runoff δ q lulc is estimated as the difference of natural runoff under different lulc conditions in contrast eq 16 is used to investigate the impact of human water withdrawal activities on river discharge δ q human is estimated as the difference between natural runoff and observed river discharge left by water withdrawals upstream in our research the regression model used for natural runoff prediction is established using observations of the baseline period as a result q p in eq 16 represents actually the natural runoff under the context of current meteorological observations and previous lulc conditions in contrast q om is the observed river discharge under current lulc conditions therefore the difference between q om and q p represents not only the impact of water withdrawal activities but also the influence of lulc change compared with eq 14 eq 16 proposed in our research is more suitable for a comprehensive evaluation on the impact of human activities on river discharge 4 results 4 1 variations of precipitation and river discharge fig 2 presents the time series of precipitation and discharge of the chari logone river system from 1950 to 2013 the mk test shows that an overall decreasing trend is observed in both curves p 0 05 specifically the annual average decrease rates of precipitation and discharge are 1 93 mm yr and 0 39 km3 yr respectively the annual discharge of the chari logone river system has decreased by 24 52 km3 over the past 63 years however a close look at fig 2 indicates that both the two time series can be divided into two phases with the serious drought in 1984 as the turning point during the first period a significant downward trend is observed in both precipitation and discharge the annual average rate is 7 40 mm yr and 0 77 km3 yr respectively which are much larger than those observed during the entire period from 1950 to 2013 during the second period however both precipitation and discharge show an increasing trend the increase of precipitation is very significant p 0 05 with an annual average rate of 5 72 mm yr in contrast the increase of river discharge is very slight the annual rate is only 0 07 km3 yr which means that it does not keep level with precipitation variability in order to further investigate the relationship between discharge and precipitation the concept of runoff coefficient is introduced here the runoff coefficient defined as the ratio of total runoff to total rainfall has been widely used as a diagnostic variable to represent runoff generation in a catchment marshall et al 2007 merz and blöschl 2009 pektas and cigizoglu 2013 however due to the lack of natural runoff observations river discharge observed at n djamena is used directly to calculate the runoff coefficient of the whole chari logone river basin the results are presented in fig 3 a in general there is significant positive correlation between precipitation and runoff coefficient with r as high as 0 64 however there are some outliers in individual years it is particularly obvious in the last ten years of the time series specifically the pearson r over the period from 1950 to 2002 is 0 79 while it is only 0 09 during the period from 2003 to 2013 this comparison shows that the runoff coefficient over the last 11 years is not dominated by precipitation variability the scatterplots between runoff coefficient and precipitation are presented in fig 3b to further investigate these outliers the solid black line is the established linear regression model to represent the general relationship between runoff coefficient and precipitation it is clear that the runoff coefficient of the last 11 years is much lower than the average state therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the runoff coefficient of the chari logone river basin is reduced as a whole due to the increasing impact of human activities 4 2 impact of climate variability on river discharege based on budyko analysis the impact of climate variability on river discharge is divided into two parts the influence caused by precipitation variability and that caused by potential evapotranspiration variability the results are shown in fig 4 the period from 1950 to 1960 is selected as the baseline for the calculation of δ p and δ e 0 the annual average p and e 0 over the baseline period is 623 51 km3 and 1019 04 km3 respectively it is obvious that the impact of climate variability over the chari logone river basin is dominated by precipitation variability on annual average scale the change of river discharge caused by δ p and δ e 0 is 4 20 km3 and 0 14 km3 respectively the difference of sign indicates that precipitation and potential evapotranspiration influence runoff in opposite direction the variability of precipitation leads to a decrease of river discharge while the variability of potential evapotranspiration is beneficial to runoff generation in terms of relative contribution δ p accounts for 85 60 of the total change brought by climate variability with the remaining 14 40 caused by δ e 0 compared with the baseline period the natural runoff from 1961 to 2013 is generally lower with positive values of δ q climate it is mainly caused by the decrease of precipitation the impact of precipitation variability is particularly significant for the two periods 1977 and 1985 with serious droughts where the water loss caused by δ p is as high as 7 80 km3 however just as presented in fig 2 the variations of δ q climate are also composed of two curves with opposite trends during the first period from 1961 to 1985 a significant increasing trend is observed the annual average δ q climate is 3 63 km3 with an increasing rate of 0 31 km3 yr the annual average δ q climate during the second period is 4 45 km3 however in contrast with the increasing trend over the first period a slight decreasing trend is observed from 1986 to 2013 with a rate of 0 09 km3 yr 4 3 impact of human activities on river discharege following eq 15 monthly runoff is estimated from precipitation and potential evapotranspiration using multiple stepwise linear regression method the regression model produced by least square estimation lse is presented in eq 17 17 q i 0 030 p i 2 0 024 p i 3 0 026 e 0 i 3 0 014 p i 1 0 032 e 0 i 0 429 where the units of q p and e 0 are all km3 although eight explanatory variables are selected to establish the regression model only five variables that have passed significance test are introduced to the final regression model the calibration and validation results are shown in fig 5 four statistics including correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coefficient nsc nash and sutcliffe 1970 are used for model evaluation the mathematical expression of nsc is described below 18 nsc 1 i 1 n q o i q p i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 where q o i and q p i are the observed and predicted runoff of month i respectively q o is the monthly average of observed runoff the maximum of nsc in theory is 1 which stands for a perfect match to the observations moriasi et al 2007 suggest that ncs larger than 0 5 represents a satisfactory simulation at monthly scale during the calibration period the r mae rmse and nsc presented in fig 5 are 0 98 0 44 km3 0 68 km3 and 0 96 respectively correspondingly the fours statistics during the validation period are 0 99 0 35 km3 0 51 km3 and 0 97 respectively the accuracy is even better than that obtained during the calibration period therefore the above regression model captures effectively the monthly variations of natural runoff applying eq 17 to the testing period we obtained monthly natural runoff from 1961 to 2013 the results are presented in fig 6 where the runoff at annual scale is calculated as the sum of monthly runoff although there is a good agreement between the simulated and observed runoff with r as high as 0 75 the difference between these two variables is significant in terms of magnitude in the early 1960s the gap between natural and observed runoff is very small due to the little influence of human activities however the difference thereafter shows an overall increasing trend which implies a growing impact of human activities the annual average δ q human from 1961 to 2013 is 12 60 km3 with a standard deviation sd of 5 17 km3 selecting some local minimum δ q human as the partition points we divide the whole period into four sections during the first decade from 1961 to 1970 the water loss caused by anthropogenic activities is relatively small with an annual average of 4 19 km3 however a significant increase of δ q human is observed in the second period from 1971 to 1982 the annual average δ q human is as high as 11 92 km3 which is almost triple the size it once was δ q human of the third period from 1983 to 1996 shows a slight increasing trend the annual average water loss caused by anthropogenic activities is 13 85 km3 with a rate of 0 15 km3 yr during the rest 17 years from 1997 to 2013 the annual average δ q human is 16 99 km3 which is three times larger than the average of the first period 4 4 impact of climate variability and human activities on river discharge assuming the period from 1950 to 1960 as the baseline for comparison the total runoff change δ q total caused by climate variability and anthropogenic activities can be retrieved from eq 4 accordingly either of the two components of δ q total can be estimated as the residual of the other and the sum of δ q human and δ q climate retrieved from the above two sections is theoretically equal to δ q total retrieved from eq 4 therefore the accuracy of δ q human and δ q climate estimates can be evaluated within the framework proposed in this research through cross validation the results are presents in fig 7 a for simplicity purpose the δ q total retrieved from eq 4 and the sum of δ q human and δ q climate are termed as δ q tm and δ q ts respectively in general the simulated and measured δ q total are in good agreement with each other the r mae and rmse are 0 97 1 51 km3 and 1 86 km3 respectively this justifies indirectly the effectiveness of the methods used for δ q human and δ q climate estimation as a summary fig 7b shows the quantities of δ q climate δ q human and δ q total of each year from 1961 to 2013 the variations of δ q climate and δ q human have been analyzed in sections 4 2 and 4 3 respectively here we only focus on the variations of δ q total the annual average river discharge of the baseline period is 43 15 km3 the negative values of δ q total in the early 1960s indicate that the runoff increased by climate variability has outweighed the water loss caused by anthropogenic water withdrawal activities thereafter the discharge has been reduced generally with positive δ q total values an increasing trend of water loss is observed for the whole period from 1961 to 2013 the annual average δ q total is 16 76 km3 with a sd of 6 95 km3 however according to the local variations of δ q total three phases are identified from the whole period during the first period from 1961 to 1987 the total water loss has increased rapidly from 0 70 km3 to 24 68 km3 with a rate of 0 82 km3 yr during the second period from 1988 to 1996 δ q total fluctuates significantly it first increases and then decreases at a large rate the annual average δ q total is 18 30 km3 with a sd of 4 39 km3 after a sharp increase from 1997 δ q total peaks in 2000 with a value of 26 82 km3 thereafter the variation of δ q total has been in a relatively stable phase the annual average δ q total from 2001 to 2013 is 21 80 km3 with a sd of 2 61 km3 4 5 relative contribution of climate variability and anthropogenic activities due to different parameterization schemes of δ q human δ q climate and δ q total the relative contribution of δ q human and δ q climate to δ q total in eqs 5 and 6 can be expressed in three forms as below 19 cq c l i m a t e 1 δ q climate δ q total 100 20 cq c l i m a t e 2 δ q total δ q human δ q total 100 21 cq c l i m a t e 3 δ q climate δ q climate δ q human 100 22 cq h u m a n 1 δ q total δ q climate δ q total 100 23 cq h u m a n 2 δ q human δ q total 100 24 cq h u m a n 3 δ q human δ q climate δ q human 100 where δ q climate is the estimation of runoff change caused by climate variability based on budyko analysis δ q human is the estimation of runoff change caused by human activities based on regression analysis and δ q total is the estimation of total runoff change retrieved from eq 4 it is clear that cq climate and the corresponding cq human defined above are complementary to each other with a sum equal to 1 therefore only the variations of cq cliamte are presented in fig 8 as an example to show the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability at annual scale apart from the year of 1961 there is generally good agreement among the cq climate retrieved from three different equations both cq c l i a m t e 1 and cq c l i a m t e 2 are highly correlated with cq c l i a m t e 3 with the value of r as 0 97 and 0 85 respectively the pearson r between cq c l i a m t e 1 and cq c l i a m t e 2 is 0 75 which is a little lower but still large enough to satisfy the significance test under the confidential level of 0 01 in terms of the absolute difference the rmse calculated for cq c l i a m t e 1 and cq c l i a m t e 2 cq c l i a m t e 2 and cq c l i a m t e 3 cq c l i a m t e 1 and cq c l i a m t e 3 is 10 32 7 96 and 3 49 respectively both the values of r and rmse suggest that the cq c l i a m t e 3 retrieved from eq 21 provides an optimal evaluation on the relative contribution of climate variability this is also confirmed by the good agreement between cq c l i a m t e 3 and the average of the three cq cliamte retrieved above the r and rmse obtained for these two variables are 0 98 and 2 23 respectively therefore the cq c l i a m t e 3 and cq h u m a n 3 retrieved from eqs 21 and 24 are used finally to evaluate the relative contribution of climate variability and human activities on river discharge the results are presented in fig 9 apart from the first five years from 1961 to 1965 the contribution of δ q human is generally larger than that of δ q climate the variations of δ q total are mainly dominated by δ q human specifically the annual average cq climate and cq human over the whole period is 26 83 and 73 17 respectively besides the variations of cq climate and cq human show an opposite trend the relative contribution of climate variability has been decreasing at a rate of 0 0034 yr while the relative contribution of human activities has been increasing at the same rate the assumptions involved in the budyko hypothesis and the linear regression model mean that the estimates of δ q climate and δ q human in individual years suffer from errors the sharp change of cq climate and cq human in 1964 is a typical example because in general the impact exerted by human activities works in a more gradual way in order to reduce such errors the quantities of δ q total δ q climate and δ q human are averaged over a five year period the results as well as the corresponding c climate and c human are shown in table 1 as a result of climate variability and anthropogenic activities the river discharge of the chari logone river system has been decreasing since 1961 for all the periods the relative contribution of human activities to water loss is much larger than that of climate variability it is particularly obvious in the first five years of the 1960s when c human is as high as 98 water loss is mainly caused by human activities because the climate variability in the first four years leads to water surplus since then c climate has been increasing due to the decrease of precipitation it reaches 32 during the period from 1971 to 1975 following the serious drought in 1984 the maximum c climate is observed in the period from 1981 to 1985 with a value of 34 in the subsequent twenty years from 1986 to 2005 the annual average water loss is about 20 km3 the relative contribution of climate variability and anthropogenic actives has been relatively stable which is about 25 and 75 respectively because of the increase of rainfall in the last ten years from 2003 to 2013 the relative contribution of climate variability to water loss begins to decrease more than 80 decrease of river discharge is attributed to human activities 5 discussion 5 1 evaluating present research in light of earlier research the prediction of natural runoff is the basis for δ q human estimation in this paper due to the lack of natural runoff observations it is difficult to evaluate directly the results of our present research however several studies have been conducted prior to ours to investigate the causes of lake chad s shrinkage which makes it possible for us to evaluate our present research through comparative analysis unlike the linear regression method adopted in our research hydrological models have been used by coe and foley 2001 and mahmood and jia 2018 to simulate natural runoff of the chari logone river basin both of them have used the river discharge observed at n djamena for model calibration the results of their studies as well as ours are presented in fig 10 obviously the runoff produced by coe and foley 2001 agrees best with the observations the correlation r and mae produced are 0 87 and 3 85 km3 respectively it is because the hydrological routing algorithm hydra developed by coe and foley 2001 has adopted the observations during the whole period from 1953 to 1994 for model calibration therefore the simulation produced by coe and foley is more like the part of streamflow left by water withdrawals upstream rather than the total natural runoff generated by precipitation in contrast the runoff simulation produced by mahmood and jia 2018 and our research is much larger than the observations which provides a better estimation of natural runoff in general good agreement is observed between the natural runoff produced by mahmood and jia 2018 and our research the r mae and rmse is 0 89 3 45 km3 and 4 16 km 3 respectively natural runoff produced in our research is generally a little higher than that produced by mahmood and jia 2018 the overestimation can be explained by the difference in the calibration in this research the runoff observations from 1951 to 1957 are used for the calibration of the linear regression model while the period used by mahmood and jia 2018 for model calibration ranges from 1956 to 1965 the results in table 1 indicate that the annual average water loss caused by irrigation withdrawals from 1961 to 1965 is about 3 88 km3 which is very close to value of mae therefore the natural runoff in mahmood and jia s research may be underestimated due to the neglect of the water loss in the early 1960s besides due to the lack of land cover data from 1956 to 1965 the land cover used for model calibration by mahmood and jia 2018 is retrieved after 2000 this also brings some uncertainties to their simulation results as for the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability on river discharge a constant irrigation rate was used by coe and foley 2001 to evaluate the impact of human activities specifically for the period 1965 1980 the annual water loss caused by irrigation was assumed to be 2 50 km3 and the annual δ q human from 1981 to 1994 was assumed to be 9 20 km3 based on this assumption their analysis suggested that the relative contribution of δ q climate and δ q human during 1953 1979 is 80 and 20 respectively since 1975 the water loss of lake chad can be attributed in roughly equal parts to climate variability and water use by human however our research indicates that the relative contribution of human activities for the period from 1961 to 1979 and the period from 1975 to 1994 is about 69 and 72 respectively both of these two values are much higher than the results of coe and foley 2001 the impact of anthropogenic activities and climate variability on river discharge has also been distinguished in mahmood and jia 2018 through hydrological modeling approach however the baseline period in their research is from 1951 to 1971 which makes it difficult to compare our results with theirs directly here we only present part of their results for qualitative comparison according to their research the relative contribution of δ q climate and δ q human during 1972 1981 is 31 and 69 respectively c climate and c human produced in our research for the same period is 28 and 72 respectively for the period from 1972 to 2013 the c human estimated in mahmood and jia 2018 and our research is 66 and 75 respectively both of them show that the contribution of human activities has outweighed the contribution of climate variability besides mahmood and jia 2018 several recent studies have also underlined the role of irrigation withdrawals the annual average water diversion for irrigation from 1997 to 2006 estimated by gao et al 2011 is about 13 km3 our estimation for the same period is 15 48 km3 although there are some difference in number both of them demonstrate the bigger role of human activities in the shrinkage of lake chad gao et al s research even suggested that the split lake would have merged in 1999 under the hypothesis of no irrigation withdrawals the causes leading to the shrinkage of lake chad have also been investigated in the global international waters assessment giwa report published by the united nations environmental programme unep 2004 it states that the roles and extent of influence of climate change and human induced stream flow modification in causing the freshwater shortage has not been determined nevertheless according to expert opinion the most significant giwa assessed immediate cause for low stream flow into lake chad is the increased diversion of rivers and the associated unsustainable use of water resources in another report published recently by lake chad basin commission lcbc 2016 the irrigation withdrawals have also been considered as a major contributing factor to lake chad s reduced size population around lake chad have soared in recent decades at a rate between 1 5 and 3 7 per year depending on the country following the report published by the international atomic energy agency iaea 2017 the total population over the basin in 2013 was estimated at 47 million consequently irrigation has been becoming increasingly widespread to meet the growing demand of the population lcbc 2016 iaea 2017 unep 2004 it was estimated that the volume of water diverted from the lake quadrupled between 1983 and 1994 odada et al 2005 as for the chari logone river the maga dam constructed in 1979 alone has accounted for more than 30 of the observed decrease in river discharge since 1960 shingirirai et al 2013 dams have also altered the regime of the hydrographic network as such the water flowing into lake chad from the chari logone river has decreased by 55 over the past 40 years according to a recent report published by german agency for international cooperation for development giz 2015 on another main tributary of lake chad the komadugu yobe river only 1 of the original amount of water from the river now reaches lake chad due to the twenty dams built upstream world bank 2002 in the sahel region irrigation is the only reliable means by which inhabitants can practice intensive agriculture and settle giz 2015 however there are not any authoritative irrigation records about the chari logone river basin apart from some estimation for individual years olivry et al 1996 vuillaume 1981 assuming the water loss caused by human activities is dominated by irrigation withdrawals a comparison between δ q human estimates and the total agricultural area aa within the basin can be used to verify our findings indirectly fig 11 a shows that there is a good agreement between δ q human estimates and agricultural area from 1961 to 2013 a logarithm relationship is observed with r as high as 0 85 besides agricultural area the amount of water used for irrigation is also influenced by the meteorological conditions consequently the irrigation withdrawals over the chari logone river basin are simulated using logarithmic regression method as follows 25 δ q irr 203 66 ln a a 12 12 ln e 0 p 2243 06 where δ q irr is the water used for irrigation on annual scale km3 aa is the total agricultural area of the three countries covering the basin 1000 ha and e 0 p is the average climatic dryness index over the whole basin fig 11b indicates that the regression model provides a good estimation of δ q human the correlation r mae and rmse are 0 88 2 05 km3 and 2 43 km3 respectively the good performance of the regression model has not only validated the accuracy of δ q human estimates indirectly but also provided a simple method for δ q irr estimation 5 2 uncertainty analysis as we discussed in section 4 5 different selection of the baseline period has a significant influence on the evaluation results according to coe and foley 2001 and gao et al 2011 discharge loss due to irrigation withdrawal is close to zero in the early 1960s consequently the baseline period used in this research ranges from 1950 to 1960 so that the impact of human activities thereafter can be distinguished completely it explains partly why the c human estimated in our study for 1972 2013 is higher than that estimated by mahmood and jia 2018 the baseline period adopted by mahmood and jia 2018 ranges from 1951 to 1971 the impact of human activities has been partly embodied in the baseline period in view of this our study presents a more accurate estimation of c human however it should be noted that the period from 1950 to 1960 is part of the declining precipitation and streamflow regime fig 2 it means that the baseline period used in this paper represents non stationary climate the impact of climate variability has already been involved in the baseline period in fact the non stationary climate during the baseline period also exist in coe and foley 2001 and mahmood and jia 2018 in view of this there is large uncertainty in the estimation of c climate in all these studies uncertainty in our above analysis also arises from the groundwater storage variability due to the lack of information on groundwater reserves it is only recently anything has been known about groundwater flows in the lake chad basin however this knowledge is only confined to the findings of a number of localized pilot initiatives carries out in certain parts of the basin lcbc 2016 over the lake chad basin groundwater is an important source of water supply for both domestic and agricultural use its role is particularly obvious during the dry season overall the lake chad basin has considerable groundwater resources because of its hydrogeology according to lcbc 2016 the total renewable groundwater reserves in the quaternary aquifer is about 4 billion m3 eberschweiler 1993 estimated that the water extracted from the whole quaternary aquifer was around 80 million m3 in 1970 the water loss caused by climate variability and surface water withdrawals for the same year in fig 7b is 4902 and 3620 million m3 respectively in the early 1990s the groundwater exploitation over the basin was estimated at 438 million m3 lcbc 2016 the results in table 1 show that the water loss caused by climate variability and surface water withdrawals from 1990 to 1995 is 5010 and 13 900 million m3 respectively judging from these comparisons the contribution of groundwater exploitation to the total water loss of river discharge is negligible nevertheless surface water scarcity as well as adaptation strategy has increased the abstraction of groundwater a persistent decreasing trend in water table was observed during the 1980s and early 1990s however there was evidence of a recovery of the groundwater level at the end of the 1990s although the exact recovery extent is still unknown candela et al 2014 the report published by the lcbc 2016 also suggested that the water level of the quaternary aquifer over the lake chad basin is highly variable over time the driving factors include human activities rainfall infiltration evapotranspiration and river aquifer interactions boronina and ramillien 2008 candela et al 2014 genthon et al 2015 the lack of enough relevant technical information on this topic hinders us investigating further the uncertainty caused by the groundwater storage variability 6 conclusions the serious recession of lake chad since the 1960s has been widely reported in the media because approximately 90 of lake chad s water stems from the chari logone river system there is a tremendous need to investigate the variations of river discharge and the causes leading to such variations considering the limitations of data availability and validity a conceptual and statistical approach was proposed in this paper to address the above issues only discharge observations and a global precipitation and potential evapotranspiration dataset are necessary in this research which makes it possible for us to distinguish the relative contribution of climate variability and human activities on river discharge in the absence of natural runoff and irrigation withdrawal observations due to the little impact of human activities the time period of 1950 1960 was adopted as the baseline the runoff change caused by climate variability δ q climate was evaluated based on budyko analysis δ q climate was decomposed into the effect of precipitation variability δ p and potential evapotranspiration variability δ e 0 using climate elasticity method the runoff change caused by anthropogenic activities δ q human was estimated using linear regression method it is expressed as the difference between observed runoff left by water withdrawals upstream and the total natural runoff predicted by the regression model constrained by the total water loss δ q total caused by climate variability and anthropogenic activities either of these two components of δ q total can be estimated as the residual of the other consequently the accuracy of δ q human and δ q climate estimates can be evaluated within the framework proposed in this research without any ancillary data the major results and conclusions are presented as follows 1 the time series of the chari logone river discharge from 1950 to 2013 can be divided into two periods with opposite variation trend with the serious drought in 1984 as the turning point 2 the impact of climate variability on runoff is dominated by precipitation on annual average scale the change of runoff caused by δ p and δ e 0 is 4 20 km3 and 0 14 km3 respectively 3 in general the water loss caused by human activities increases throughout the whole testing period with varying rate the annual average δ q human from 1961 to 2013 is 12 60 km3 with a standard deviation sd of 5 17 km3 4 compared with the baseline period an increasing trend of total water loss is observed for the whole period from 1961 to 2013 the annual average δ q total is 16 76 km3 with a sd of 6 95 km3 5 unlike the research of coe and foley 2001 our research suggests that the decrease of the chari logone river discharge is dominated by human activities rather than climate variability on annual average scale the relative contribution of climate variability and anthropogenic activities is 26 83 and 73 17 respectively besides cross validation our results are also evaluated in light of earlier studies in general the annual natural runoff predicted by the regression model agrees well with that predicted by mahmood and jia 2018 the correlation r mae and rmse is 0 89 3 45 km3 and 4 16 km 3 respectively a good correlation relationship is also observed between δ q human estimates and the agricultural area provided by the fao all above confirms the effectiveness of the conceptual and statistical approach proposed in this paper although our research still suffers from large uncertainty acknowledgments this study was funded by the national natural science foundation of china 41701485 thanks are given to the climatic research unit cru and the lake chad basin commission lcbc for their data support 
6774,lake chad was once the sixth largest lake in the world with a surface area of about 25 000 km2 in the early 1960s however it has shrunk to almost only one twentieth of its maximum area by now as the biggest river of the lake chad basin the chari logone river contributes approximately 90 of lake chad s water input consequently several previous studies have focused on the chari logone river system to investigate the causes of lake chad s shrinkage however due to the lack of authoritative irrigation and natural runoff observations it is usually difficult to explain the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability in this paper unlike the hydrological modeling approaches used in previous studies a conceptual and statistical approach was presented to investigate discharge variations and the causes leading to such variations specifically the runoff change caused by climate variability δ q climate was estimated using budyko analysis while that caused by human activities δ q human was estimated using regression analysis the accuracy of estimation was evaluated through cross validation and comparison with previous studies the comparison suggests that due to the lack of natural runoff and irrigation withdrawal observations the runoff simulation produced by previous hydrological models suffers from large errors the water loss of the chari logone river discharge is dominated by human activities rather than climate variability on annual average scale the total water loss caused by climate variability and anthropogenic activities is 16 76 km3 the relative contribution of δ q climate and δ q human is 26 83 and 73 17 respectively the role of human activities is particularly obvious in recent ten years from 2003 to 2013 due to the increase of rainfall and irrigation withdrawals the relative contribution of human activities accounts for more than 80 of the total water loss keywords runoff change climate variability human activities chari logone river budyko analysis statistical analysis 1 introduction lake chad lies in an endoreic basin on the southern margin of the sahara coe and foley 2001 leblanc et al 2011 as a very flat and shallow lake lake chad responds rapidly to precipitation and runoff in the early 1960s lake chad was africa s fourth largest lake and the sixth largest in the world with a surface area of about 25 000 km2 odada et al 2005 however it has shrunk to almost one twentieth of its maximum area in the subsequent forty years okpara et al 2016 lake chad is composed of freshwater which is rare for an endorheic lake its location on the edge of the sahara desert makes it an oasis providing a vital source of water for humans livestock and wildlife bouchez et al 2016 coe and birkett 2004 leblanc et al 2003 water scarcity caused by the lake s recession has triggered food insecurity poverty migration conflicts and ecological degradation buma et al 2016 in 2016 the lake chad basin commission lcbc declared that one of its three mandates is to manage the waters of lake chad and the other transboundary water resources in the lake chad basin in a sustainable and equitable way lcbc 2016 an important step towards this would be to evaluate the natural and anthropogenic causes for the shrinking of lake chad located in an endorheic drainage basin lake chad retains inflow of water but allows no outflow to other water bodies the water budget of lake chad has been investigated in several studies bouchez et al 2016 lcbc 2016 odada et al 2005 olivry et al 1996 vuillaume 1981 according to lcbc 2016 during the period from 1988 to 2010 the main input of lake chad is the chari logone river system discharge 21 1 km3 yr or 88 7 of total inputs supplemented by direct rainfall 8 of total inputs and inflow from other small tributaries such as the el beid and komadugu yobe 0 3 and 0 5 km3 yr respectively it is clear that the fluctuation of lake chad is dominated by the chari logone river system discharge boronina and ramillien 2008 ndehedehe et al 2016 there are also other observations to support this claim for example during the lake recession in the second half of the 20th century the annual mean discharge of the chari logone river system observed at n djamena has decreased from about 40 km3 yr in the early 1960s to 10 15 km3 yr in the 1980s and 1990s jung et al 2011 as a result almost all previous studies have focused on the chari logone river system to investigate the causes of lake chad s shrinkage coe and foley 2001 gao et al 2011 based on such studies birkett 2000 coe and foley 2001 gao et al 2011 lemoalle et al 2012 it is increasingly recognized that the shrinkage is caused by persistent droughts and increased irrigation withdrawals the basic logic is as follows the combined effects of climate variability and anthropogenic activities lead to significant reduction in the discharge of the chari logone river system in turn this situation has resulted in the shrinkage of the lake odada et al 2005 however this theory fails to explain the relative contribution of anthropogenic activities and climate variability hydrological models were usually adopted in earlier studies to simulate the discharge of the chari logone river coe and foley 2001 gao et al 2011 due to the lack of authoritative water withdrawal and natural runoff observations it is usually difficult to calibrate the model accurately for example in coe and foley s model coe and foley 2001 water loss caused by irrigation withdrawal was assumed to be invariable over fifteen years controlled by precipitation variability and water management practices the irrigation rate tends to vary significantly with time therefore the assumption of a constant irrigation rate in earlier studies would necessarily introduce some error to the simulation results in contrast with the hydrological modeling approaches used in previous studies a conceptual and statistical approach was adopted in this research to evaluate the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability on the water loss of the chari logone river discharge the runoff change caused by climate variability was estimated using budyko analysis while that caused by anthropogenic activities was estimated using regression analysis the independence of these two approaches makes it possible for us to compare and evaluate their respective results specifically the aims of this study are 1 to evaluate the long term variation characteristics of the chari logone river discharge from 1950 to 2013 2 to quantify the water loss caused by water withdrawals and climate variability since the 1960s and 3 to distinguish the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability on river discharge 2 general situation of the chari logone river basin the lake chad drainage basin is located between latitude 6 and 24 n and longitude 7 and 24 e covering an area of 2 434 000 km2 bastola and francois 2012 odada et al 2005 it has a monsoon climate with rainfall mostly occurring in the southern one third of the basin and semiarid and arid conditions in the north coe and birkett 2004 the annual average rainfall is 320 mm ranging from nearly 1600 mm in the southwest part to less than 150 mm in the north odada et al 2005 consequently runoff is generated predominantly in the southern portions of the drainage basin and transported via the chari logone river system to the town of n djamena and thereafter to lake chad coe and birkett 2004 the chari logone river basin is drained by the chari river and its principle tributary the logone river fig 1 its total area is 690 000 km2 an estimated 28 of the total area of the lake chad basin the chari river is a 1200 km long stream originating in the central african republic the logone river is 1000 km long and has its origin in cameroon these two rivers converge at n djamena the capital and largest city of chad as a result chari river s discharge measured at n djamena represents the greatest proportion of discharge input to lake chad coe and birkett 2004 precipitation over the chari logone river basin varies significantly throughout the seasons the rainy season is relatively short from june to october with the dry season lasting from november to the following may on annual average scale precipitation during the rainy season accounts for 85 of the total precipitation with a peak value in august the river discharge from august to december accounts for 80 of the total discharge with a peak value in october besides the high variability in precipitation water use in human activities also has a direct impact on the river discharge according to the lcbc 2016 agriculture particularly through irrigation systems accounts for most water usage in the basin most of these activities occur along the chari logone river in chad and cameroon traditionally agriculture in the lake chad basin was conducted in the upland rain fed field where precipitation is plentiful more reliable production and higher yields however are available in low lying areas that are seasonally flooded by tributary streams hutchinson et al 1992 with irrigation becoming increasingly widespread to meet growing population demands the vulnerability of rainfed agriculture to climate stress has increased lcbc 2016 as a result large quantities of water from inflowing rivers are being diverted for irrigation purposes before flowing into the lake it is estimated that over one third of the waters from the chari logone river system are diverted before reaching lake chad onyekakeyah 2008 3 material and methods 3 1 material used in this research three datasets are used in this study the first one is the monthly discharge q of the chari logone river system from 1950 to 2013 observed at n djamena it is provided by the lake chad basin commission the second dataset is the grid precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e 0 data provided by the climatic research unit cru it is produced through interpolation techniques using average data from climatic models and stations harris et al 2014 harris and jones 2015 in this paper the cru ts version 4 01 product with a spatial grid of 30 arc minutes is used to retrieve the spatial average of monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration over the chari logone river basin the third dataset is the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao statistics faostat which is available on the homepage of the fao annual agricultural area of the three countries chad cameroon and central african republic covered by the chari river basin is used to evaluate our results as auxiliary data 3 2 methods used in this research 3 2 1 trend analysis the mann kendall mk trend detection test is used to analyze the long term variation characteristics of precipitation and river discharge the nonparametric mk test proposed by mann 1945 and kendall 1975 has been widely used to assess the significance of monotonic trends in climatological meteorological and hydrological data time series asoka et al 2017 dittus et al 2015 shan and mishra 2016 it is based on the correlation between the ranks of a time series and their time order specifically for a time series x x 1 x 2 x n the mk test statistic s is given as follows 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i 2 s g n x j x i 1 x i x j 0 x i x j 1 x i x j where x i and x j are the data values at times i and j and n is the length of the data set positive s values indicate upward increasing trends while negative s values indicate downward decreasing trends for parametric trend tests such as the regression coefficient test it is usually assumed that the data follow a normal distribution in contrast the mk test depends only on the ranks of the samples rather than their original values which results in a distribution free test statistic consequently it has the advantage that its power and significance are not influenced by the actual distribution of the data hamed 2008 3 2 2 correlation analysis the pearson correlation coefficient r is used in this paper to evaluate the correlation relationship between two variables lena and margara 2010 love 2013 in mathematics it is the covariance of two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations for time series x x 1 x 2 x n and y y 1 y 2 y n the pearson r is defined as follows 3 r c o v x y σ x σ y x i x y i y x i x 2 y i y 2 the value of r ranges from 1 to 1 with the values of 1 and 1 representing total positive and negative correlations respectively a value of 0 means there is no correlation 3 2 3 quantifying the impact of climate variability and human activities 3 2 3 1 basic framework the discharge of the chari logone river system into lake chad results from climatic variability and anthropogenic activities the discharge measured at n djamena is the part of streamflow left by water withdrawals upstream rather than the total natural runoff generated by precipitation in order to distinguish the impact of climate variability and human activities on river discharge a period with little impact of human activities is usually defined as the baseline period for comparison ahn and merwade 2014 wu et al 2017 according to coe and foley 2001 and gao et al 2011 discharge loss due to irrigation withdrawal is close to zero for the chari logone river basin in the early 1960s therefore the period from 1950 to 1960 is adopted as the baseline period of our research for each year thereafter the change of river discharge caused by climate variability and anthropogenic activities can be calculated as follows 4 δ q total δ q climate δ q human q o i q baseline where δ q total δ q climate and δ q human are the total change of river discharge and that caused by climate variability and anthropogenic water withdrawal activities respectively q o i is the observed annual river discharge in the year i and q baseline is the annual average river discharge over the whole baseline period in theory the values of δ q climate δ q human and δ q total can be either positive or negative for consistency positive and negative values are used in this paper to label water loss and water surplus respectively accordingly there are two concepts to be discriminated and clarified the first one is the relative contribution of climate variability and human activities on the change of river discharge they are defined as follows 5 cq climate δ q climate δ q climate δ q human 100 6 cq human δ q human δ q climate δ q human 100 where cq climate and cq human represent the relative contribution of climate variability and anthropogenic activities on the change of river discharge respectively the function with the symbol of absolute value is used to reflect both the positive and negative impact of climate variability and human activities the second concept is the relative contribution of climate variability and human activities on the water loss of river discharge their mathematical expression is described below 7 c climate q climate q climate q human 100 8 c human q human q climate q human 100 where c climate and c human are the relative contribution of climate variability and anthropogenic activities on the water loss of river discharge respectively obviously eqs 7 and 8 hold true only when the values of both δ q climate and δ q human are positive over the study period 3 2 3 2 estimation of δ q climate based on budyko analysis budyko 1974 proposed that in a watershed over a long term time scale the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation e p is governed by the climatic dryness index which is defined as the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation e 0 p since then multiple mathematical equations have been developed to describe the budyko hypothesis a summary of these equations can be found in dey and mishra 2017 wu et al 2017 and yang et al 2008 based on the budyko hypothesis schaake 1990 pointed out that the climate elasticity method can be used to evaluate the impact of climate change on runoff specifically the change in runoff caused by climate variability is decomposed into the impact of changes in potential evaporation δ e 0 and precipitation δ p as follows 9 δ q climate ε p δ p ε e 0 δ e 0 where ε p and ε e 0 are elasticity coefficients of runoff with respect to p and e 0 respectively the equation proposed by zhang et al 2001 is used in our research to describe the budyko hypothesis as follows 10 e p 1 ω e 0 p 1 ω e 0 p e 0 p 1 where ω is a model parameter related to land surface characteristics including vegetation soil type topography and climate seasonality li et al 2013 following the parameterization scheme proposed by ahn and merwade 2014 ω is estimated by trial and error approach and e is estimated based on water balance equation as below 11 p e q δ s where δ s is the change in water storage at the basin scale which is assumed to be negligible over ten year periods once parameter ω is certain the elasticity coefficients in eq 9 are calculated following the parameterization schemes proposed by li et al 2007 as follows 12 ε p 1 2 x 3 ω x 1 x ω x 2 2 13 ε e 0 1 2 ω x 1 x w x 2 2 where x is the climatic dryness index e 0 p assuming the period from 1950 to 1960 as the baseline the change in runoff caused by climate variability thereafter is estimated through the combination of eqs 9 12 and 13 3 2 3 3 estimation of δ q human based on regression analysis according to the review of dey and mishra 2017 most of previous studies have focused on the modification of land use land cover lulc to investigate the impact of human activities on hydrological processes hydrological modeling approaches are usually adopted to address such research objectives to be specific hydrological models are firstly calibrated using the natural runoff observations during the calibration period and then they are used to predict the natural runoff during the testing period asoka et al 2018 mishra et al 2010 schilling et al 2008 the change in runoff due to lulc modification δ q lulc is estimated as follows 14 δ q lulc q on q p where q on is the observed streamflow during the testing period which represents the natural runoff under current lulc conditions q p is the predicted runoff during the testing period which is produced by using current meteorological observations and previous lulc conditions as inputs it is clear that there are two assumptions involved in such studies firstly the impact of human activities on river discharge is caused mainly by lulc change rather than water withdrawal activities secondly both the natural runoff and lulc conditions are known however it is not the case in this research just as numerous studies have revealed the decrease of chari river discharge into lake chad is mainly caused by increased irrigation withdrawals in addition to climate variability birkett 2000 coe and foley 2001 gao et al 2011 lemoalle et al 2012 due to the lack of authoritative observations both the irrigation withdrawals and lulc conditions are unknown for these reasons a statistical approach is designed here to evaluate the impact of human water withdrawal activities on river discharge jiang et al 2011 suggest that monthly runoff q can be retrieved from precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e 0 using a linear regression model the studies of meng et al 2016 and herrnegger et al 2015 show that the impact p and e 0 on monthly q has lag effect consequently jiang et al s formula is modified as follows for monthly runoff simulation 15 q i f p i p i 1 p i 2 p i 3 e 0 i e 0 i 1 e 0 i 2 e 0 i 3 where q i p i and e 0 i represent runoff precipitation and potential evapotranspiration of month i respectively the function is established using multiple stepwise linear regression method so that only explanatory variables that have passed significance test are introduced to the final regression model eq 15 is established to predict natural runoff without water withdrawal activities therefore only monthly observations during the baseline period are utilized for model calibration and validation specifically the observations from 1950 to 1957 are used for calibration with those of the remaining three years for validation based on the regression model of eq 15 the water loss caused by human water withdrawal activities δ q human can be estimated as 16 δ q human q om q p where q om is the observed river charge during the testing period which represents the part of streamflow left by water withdrawals upstream q p is the predicted natural runoff during the testing period which is produced by using current p and e 0 observations as the inputs of eq 15 eq 14 and 16 are very similar in form but the meaning of their parameters is quite different eq 14 is used to investigate the impact of lulc change on runoff δ q lulc is estimated as the difference of natural runoff under different lulc conditions in contrast eq 16 is used to investigate the impact of human water withdrawal activities on river discharge δ q human is estimated as the difference between natural runoff and observed river discharge left by water withdrawals upstream in our research the regression model used for natural runoff prediction is established using observations of the baseline period as a result q p in eq 16 represents actually the natural runoff under the context of current meteorological observations and previous lulc conditions in contrast q om is the observed river discharge under current lulc conditions therefore the difference between q om and q p represents not only the impact of water withdrawal activities but also the influence of lulc change compared with eq 14 eq 16 proposed in our research is more suitable for a comprehensive evaluation on the impact of human activities on river discharge 4 results 4 1 variations of precipitation and river discharge fig 2 presents the time series of precipitation and discharge of the chari logone river system from 1950 to 2013 the mk test shows that an overall decreasing trend is observed in both curves p 0 05 specifically the annual average decrease rates of precipitation and discharge are 1 93 mm yr and 0 39 km3 yr respectively the annual discharge of the chari logone river system has decreased by 24 52 km3 over the past 63 years however a close look at fig 2 indicates that both the two time series can be divided into two phases with the serious drought in 1984 as the turning point during the first period a significant downward trend is observed in both precipitation and discharge the annual average rate is 7 40 mm yr and 0 77 km3 yr respectively which are much larger than those observed during the entire period from 1950 to 2013 during the second period however both precipitation and discharge show an increasing trend the increase of precipitation is very significant p 0 05 with an annual average rate of 5 72 mm yr in contrast the increase of river discharge is very slight the annual rate is only 0 07 km3 yr which means that it does not keep level with precipitation variability in order to further investigate the relationship between discharge and precipitation the concept of runoff coefficient is introduced here the runoff coefficient defined as the ratio of total runoff to total rainfall has been widely used as a diagnostic variable to represent runoff generation in a catchment marshall et al 2007 merz and blöschl 2009 pektas and cigizoglu 2013 however due to the lack of natural runoff observations river discharge observed at n djamena is used directly to calculate the runoff coefficient of the whole chari logone river basin the results are presented in fig 3 a in general there is significant positive correlation between precipitation and runoff coefficient with r as high as 0 64 however there are some outliers in individual years it is particularly obvious in the last ten years of the time series specifically the pearson r over the period from 1950 to 2002 is 0 79 while it is only 0 09 during the period from 2003 to 2013 this comparison shows that the runoff coefficient over the last 11 years is not dominated by precipitation variability the scatterplots between runoff coefficient and precipitation are presented in fig 3b to further investigate these outliers the solid black line is the established linear regression model to represent the general relationship between runoff coefficient and precipitation it is clear that the runoff coefficient of the last 11 years is much lower than the average state therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the runoff coefficient of the chari logone river basin is reduced as a whole due to the increasing impact of human activities 4 2 impact of climate variability on river discharege based on budyko analysis the impact of climate variability on river discharge is divided into two parts the influence caused by precipitation variability and that caused by potential evapotranspiration variability the results are shown in fig 4 the period from 1950 to 1960 is selected as the baseline for the calculation of δ p and δ e 0 the annual average p and e 0 over the baseline period is 623 51 km3 and 1019 04 km3 respectively it is obvious that the impact of climate variability over the chari logone river basin is dominated by precipitation variability on annual average scale the change of river discharge caused by δ p and δ e 0 is 4 20 km3 and 0 14 km3 respectively the difference of sign indicates that precipitation and potential evapotranspiration influence runoff in opposite direction the variability of precipitation leads to a decrease of river discharge while the variability of potential evapotranspiration is beneficial to runoff generation in terms of relative contribution δ p accounts for 85 60 of the total change brought by climate variability with the remaining 14 40 caused by δ e 0 compared with the baseline period the natural runoff from 1961 to 2013 is generally lower with positive values of δ q climate it is mainly caused by the decrease of precipitation the impact of precipitation variability is particularly significant for the two periods 1977 and 1985 with serious droughts where the water loss caused by δ p is as high as 7 80 km3 however just as presented in fig 2 the variations of δ q climate are also composed of two curves with opposite trends during the first period from 1961 to 1985 a significant increasing trend is observed the annual average δ q climate is 3 63 km3 with an increasing rate of 0 31 km3 yr the annual average δ q climate during the second period is 4 45 km3 however in contrast with the increasing trend over the first period a slight decreasing trend is observed from 1986 to 2013 with a rate of 0 09 km3 yr 4 3 impact of human activities on river discharege following eq 15 monthly runoff is estimated from precipitation and potential evapotranspiration using multiple stepwise linear regression method the regression model produced by least square estimation lse is presented in eq 17 17 q i 0 030 p i 2 0 024 p i 3 0 026 e 0 i 3 0 014 p i 1 0 032 e 0 i 0 429 where the units of q p and e 0 are all km3 although eight explanatory variables are selected to establish the regression model only five variables that have passed significance test are introduced to the final regression model the calibration and validation results are shown in fig 5 four statistics including correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coefficient nsc nash and sutcliffe 1970 are used for model evaluation the mathematical expression of nsc is described below 18 nsc 1 i 1 n q o i q p i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 where q o i and q p i are the observed and predicted runoff of month i respectively q o is the monthly average of observed runoff the maximum of nsc in theory is 1 which stands for a perfect match to the observations moriasi et al 2007 suggest that ncs larger than 0 5 represents a satisfactory simulation at monthly scale during the calibration period the r mae rmse and nsc presented in fig 5 are 0 98 0 44 km3 0 68 km3 and 0 96 respectively correspondingly the fours statistics during the validation period are 0 99 0 35 km3 0 51 km3 and 0 97 respectively the accuracy is even better than that obtained during the calibration period therefore the above regression model captures effectively the monthly variations of natural runoff applying eq 17 to the testing period we obtained monthly natural runoff from 1961 to 2013 the results are presented in fig 6 where the runoff at annual scale is calculated as the sum of monthly runoff although there is a good agreement between the simulated and observed runoff with r as high as 0 75 the difference between these two variables is significant in terms of magnitude in the early 1960s the gap between natural and observed runoff is very small due to the little influence of human activities however the difference thereafter shows an overall increasing trend which implies a growing impact of human activities the annual average δ q human from 1961 to 2013 is 12 60 km3 with a standard deviation sd of 5 17 km3 selecting some local minimum δ q human as the partition points we divide the whole period into four sections during the first decade from 1961 to 1970 the water loss caused by anthropogenic activities is relatively small with an annual average of 4 19 km3 however a significant increase of δ q human is observed in the second period from 1971 to 1982 the annual average δ q human is as high as 11 92 km3 which is almost triple the size it once was δ q human of the third period from 1983 to 1996 shows a slight increasing trend the annual average water loss caused by anthropogenic activities is 13 85 km3 with a rate of 0 15 km3 yr during the rest 17 years from 1997 to 2013 the annual average δ q human is 16 99 km3 which is three times larger than the average of the first period 4 4 impact of climate variability and human activities on river discharge assuming the period from 1950 to 1960 as the baseline for comparison the total runoff change δ q total caused by climate variability and anthropogenic activities can be retrieved from eq 4 accordingly either of the two components of δ q total can be estimated as the residual of the other and the sum of δ q human and δ q climate retrieved from the above two sections is theoretically equal to δ q total retrieved from eq 4 therefore the accuracy of δ q human and δ q climate estimates can be evaluated within the framework proposed in this research through cross validation the results are presents in fig 7 a for simplicity purpose the δ q total retrieved from eq 4 and the sum of δ q human and δ q climate are termed as δ q tm and δ q ts respectively in general the simulated and measured δ q total are in good agreement with each other the r mae and rmse are 0 97 1 51 km3 and 1 86 km3 respectively this justifies indirectly the effectiveness of the methods used for δ q human and δ q climate estimation as a summary fig 7b shows the quantities of δ q climate δ q human and δ q total of each year from 1961 to 2013 the variations of δ q climate and δ q human have been analyzed in sections 4 2 and 4 3 respectively here we only focus on the variations of δ q total the annual average river discharge of the baseline period is 43 15 km3 the negative values of δ q total in the early 1960s indicate that the runoff increased by climate variability has outweighed the water loss caused by anthropogenic water withdrawal activities thereafter the discharge has been reduced generally with positive δ q total values an increasing trend of water loss is observed for the whole period from 1961 to 2013 the annual average δ q total is 16 76 km3 with a sd of 6 95 km3 however according to the local variations of δ q total three phases are identified from the whole period during the first period from 1961 to 1987 the total water loss has increased rapidly from 0 70 km3 to 24 68 km3 with a rate of 0 82 km3 yr during the second period from 1988 to 1996 δ q total fluctuates significantly it first increases and then decreases at a large rate the annual average δ q total is 18 30 km3 with a sd of 4 39 km3 after a sharp increase from 1997 δ q total peaks in 2000 with a value of 26 82 km3 thereafter the variation of δ q total has been in a relatively stable phase the annual average δ q total from 2001 to 2013 is 21 80 km3 with a sd of 2 61 km3 4 5 relative contribution of climate variability and anthropogenic activities due to different parameterization schemes of δ q human δ q climate and δ q total the relative contribution of δ q human and δ q climate to δ q total in eqs 5 and 6 can be expressed in three forms as below 19 cq c l i m a t e 1 δ q climate δ q total 100 20 cq c l i m a t e 2 δ q total δ q human δ q total 100 21 cq c l i m a t e 3 δ q climate δ q climate δ q human 100 22 cq h u m a n 1 δ q total δ q climate δ q total 100 23 cq h u m a n 2 δ q human δ q total 100 24 cq h u m a n 3 δ q human δ q climate δ q human 100 where δ q climate is the estimation of runoff change caused by climate variability based on budyko analysis δ q human is the estimation of runoff change caused by human activities based on regression analysis and δ q total is the estimation of total runoff change retrieved from eq 4 it is clear that cq climate and the corresponding cq human defined above are complementary to each other with a sum equal to 1 therefore only the variations of cq cliamte are presented in fig 8 as an example to show the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability at annual scale apart from the year of 1961 there is generally good agreement among the cq climate retrieved from three different equations both cq c l i a m t e 1 and cq c l i a m t e 2 are highly correlated with cq c l i a m t e 3 with the value of r as 0 97 and 0 85 respectively the pearson r between cq c l i a m t e 1 and cq c l i a m t e 2 is 0 75 which is a little lower but still large enough to satisfy the significance test under the confidential level of 0 01 in terms of the absolute difference the rmse calculated for cq c l i a m t e 1 and cq c l i a m t e 2 cq c l i a m t e 2 and cq c l i a m t e 3 cq c l i a m t e 1 and cq c l i a m t e 3 is 10 32 7 96 and 3 49 respectively both the values of r and rmse suggest that the cq c l i a m t e 3 retrieved from eq 21 provides an optimal evaluation on the relative contribution of climate variability this is also confirmed by the good agreement between cq c l i a m t e 3 and the average of the three cq cliamte retrieved above the r and rmse obtained for these two variables are 0 98 and 2 23 respectively therefore the cq c l i a m t e 3 and cq h u m a n 3 retrieved from eqs 21 and 24 are used finally to evaluate the relative contribution of climate variability and human activities on river discharge the results are presented in fig 9 apart from the first five years from 1961 to 1965 the contribution of δ q human is generally larger than that of δ q climate the variations of δ q total are mainly dominated by δ q human specifically the annual average cq climate and cq human over the whole period is 26 83 and 73 17 respectively besides the variations of cq climate and cq human show an opposite trend the relative contribution of climate variability has been decreasing at a rate of 0 0034 yr while the relative contribution of human activities has been increasing at the same rate the assumptions involved in the budyko hypothesis and the linear regression model mean that the estimates of δ q climate and δ q human in individual years suffer from errors the sharp change of cq climate and cq human in 1964 is a typical example because in general the impact exerted by human activities works in a more gradual way in order to reduce such errors the quantities of δ q total δ q climate and δ q human are averaged over a five year period the results as well as the corresponding c climate and c human are shown in table 1 as a result of climate variability and anthropogenic activities the river discharge of the chari logone river system has been decreasing since 1961 for all the periods the relative contribution of human activities to water loss is much larger than that of climate variability it is particularly obvious in the first five years of the 1960s when c human is as high as 98 water loss is mainly caused by human activities because the climate variability in the first four years leads to water surplus since then c climate has been increasing due to the decrease of precipitation it reaches 32 during the period from 1971 to 1975 following the serious drought in 1984 the maximum c climate is observed in the period from 1981 to 1985 with a value of 34 in the subsequent twenty years from 1986 to 2005 the annual average water loss is about 20 km3 the relative contribution of climate variability and anthropogenic actives has been relatively stable which is about 25 and 75 respectively because of the increase of rainfall in the last ten years from 2003 to 2013 the relative contribution of climate variability to water loss begins to decrease more than 80 decrease of river discharge is attributed to human activities 5 discussion 5 1 evaluating present research in light of earlier research the prediction of natural runoff is the basis for δ q human estimation in this paper due to the lack of natural runoff observations it is difficult to evaluate directly the results of our present research however several studies have been conducted prior to ours to investigate the causes of lake chad s shrinkage which makes it possible for us to evaluate our present research through comparative analysis unlike the linear regression method adopted in our research hydrological models have been used by coe and foley 2001 and mahmood and jia 2018 to simulate natural runoff of the chari logone river basin both of them have used the river discharge observed at n djamena for model calibration the results of their studies as well as ours are presented in fig 10 obviously the runoff produced by coe and foley 2001 agrees best with the observations the correlation r and mae produced are 0 87 and 3 85 km3 respectively it is because the hydrological routing algorithm hydra developed by coe and foley 2001 has adopted the observations during the whole period from 1953 to 1994 for model calibration therefore the simulation produced by coe and foley is more like the part of streamflow left by water withdrawals upstream rather than the total natural runoff generated by precipitation in contrast the runoff simulation produced by mahmood and jia 2018 and our research is much larger than the observations which provides a better estimation of natural runoff in general good agreement is observed between the natural runoff produced by mahmood and jia 2018 and our research the r mae and rmse is 0 89 3 45 km3 and 4 16 km 3 respectively natural runoff produced in our research is generally a little higher than that produced by mahmood and jia 2018 the overestimation can be explained by the difference in the calibration in this research the runoff observations from 1951 to 1957 are used for the calibration of the linear regression model while the period used by mahmood and jia 2018 for model calibration ranges from 1956 to 1965 the results in table 1 indicate that the annual average water loss caused by irrigation withdrawals from 1961 to 1965 is about 3 88 km3 which is very close to value of mae therefore the natural runoff in mahmood and jia s research may be underestimated due to the neglect of the water loss in the early 1960s besides due to the lack of land cover data from 1956 to 1965 the land cover used for model calibration by mahmood and jia 2018 is retrieved after 2000 this also brings some uncertainties to their simulation results as for the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability on river discharge a constant irrigation rate was used by coe and foley 2001 to evaluate the impact of human activities specifically for the period 1965 1980 the annual water loss caused by irrigation was assumed to be 2 50 km3 and the annual δ q human from 1981 to 1994 was assumed to be 9 20 km3 based on this assumption their analysis suggested that the relative contribution of δ q climate and δ q human during 1953 1979 is 80 and 20 respectively since 1975 the water loss of lake chad can be attributed in roughly equal parts to climate variability and water use by human however our research indicates that the relative contribution of human activities for the period from 1961 to 1979 and the period from 1975 to 1994 is about 69 and 72 respectively both of these two values are much higher than the results of coe and foley 2001 the impact of anthropogenic activities and climate variability on river discharge has also been distinguished in mahmood and jia 2018 through hydrological modeling approach however the baseline period in their research is from 1951 to 1971 which makes it difficult to compare our results with theirs directly here we only present part of their results for qualitative comparison according to their research the relative contribution of δ q climate and δ q human during 1972 1981 is 31 and 69 respectively c climate and c human produced in our research for the same period is 28 and 72 respectively for the period from 1972 to 2013 the c human estimated in mahmood and jia 2018 and our research is 66 and 75 respectively both of them show that the contribution of human activities has outweighed the contribution of climate variability besides mahmood and jia 2018 several recent studies have also underlined the role of irrigation withdrawals the annual average water diversion for irrigation from 1997 to 2006 estimated by gao et al 2011 is about 13 km3 our estimation for the same period is 15 48 km3 although there are some difference in number both of them demonstrate the bigger role of human activities in the shrinkage of lake chad gao et al s research even suggested that the split lake would have merged in 1999 under the hypothesis of no irrigation withdrawals the causes leading to the shrinkage of lake chad have also been investigated in the global international waters assessment giwa report published by the united nations environmental programme unep 2004 it states that the roles and extent of influence of climate change and human induced stream flow modification in causing the freshwater shortage has not been determined nevertheless according to expert opinion the most significant giwa assessed immediate cause for low stream flow into lake chad is the increased diversion of rivers and the associated unsustainable use of water resources in another report published recently by lake chad basin commission lcbc 2016 the irrigation withdrawals have also been considered as a major contributing factor to lake chad s reduced size population around lake chad have soared in recent decades at a rate between 1 5 and 3 7 per year depending on the country following the report published by the international atomic energy agency iaea 2017 the total population over the basin in 2013 was estimated at 47 million consequently irrigation has been becoming increasingly widespread to meet the growing demand of the population lcbc 2016 iaea 2017 unep 2004 it was estimated that the volume of water diverted from the lake quadrupled between 1983 and 1994 odada et al 2005 as for the chari logone river the maga dam constructed in 1979 alone has accounted for more than 30 of the observed decrease in river discharge since 1960 shingirirai et al 2013 dams have also altered the regime of the hydrographic network as such the water flowing into lake chad from the chari logone river has decreased by 55 over the past 40 years according to a recent report published by german agency for international cooperation for development giz 2015 on another main tributary of lake chad the komadugu yobe river only 1 of the original amount of water from the river now reaches lake chad due to the twenty dams built upstream world bank 2002 in the sahel region irrigation is the only reliable means by which inhabitants can practice intensive agriculture and settle giz 2015 however there are not any authoritative irrigation records about the chari logone river basin apart from some estimation for individual years olivry et al 1996 vuillaume 1981 assuming the water loss caused by human activities is dominated by irrigation withdrawals a comparison between δ q human estimates and the total agricultural area aa within the basin can be used to verify our findings indirectly fig 11 a shows that there is a good agreement between δ q human estimates and agricultural area from 1961 to 2013 a logarithm relationship is observed with r as high as 0 85 besides agricultural area the amount of water used for irrigation is also influenced by the meteorological conditions consequently the irrigation withdrawals over the chari logone river basin are simulated using logarithmic regression method as follows 25 δ q irr 203 66 ln a a 12 12 ln e 0 p 2243 06 where δ q irr is the water used for irrigation on annual scale km3 aa is the total agricultural area of the three countries covering the basin 1000 ha and e 0 p is the average climatic dryness index over the whole basin fig 11b indicates that the regression model provides a good estimation of δ q human the correlation r mae and rmse are 0 88 2 05 km3 and 2 43 km3 respectively the good performance of the regression model has not only validated the accuracy of δ q human estimates indirectly but also provided a simple method for δ q irr estimation 5 2 uncertainty analysis as we discussed in section 4 5 different selection of the baseline period has a significant influence on the evaluation results according to coe and foley 2001 and gao et al 2011 discharge loss due to irrigation withdrawal is close to zero in the early 1960s consequently the baseline period used in this research ranges from 1950 to 1960 so that the impact of human activities thereafter can be distinguished completely it explains partly why the c human estimated in our study for 1972 2013 is higher than that estimated by mahmood and jia 2018 the baseline period adopted by mahmood and jia 2018 ranges from 1951 to 1971 the impact of human activities has been partly embodied in the baseline period in view of this our study presents a more accurate estimation of c human however it should be noted that the period from 1950 to 1960 is part of the declining precipitation and streamflow regime fig 2 it means that the baseline period used in this paper represents non stationary climate the impact of climate variability has already been involved in the baseline period in fact the non stationary climate during the baseline period also exist in coe and foley 2001 and mahmood and jia 2018 in view of this there is large uncertainty in the estimation of c climate in all these studies uncertainty in our above analysis also arises from the groundwater storage variability due to the lack of information on groundwater reserves it is only recently anything has been known about groundwater flows in the lake chad basin however this knowledge is only confined to the findings of a number of localized pilot initiatives carries out in certain parts of the basin lcbc 2016 over the lake chad basin groundwater is an important source of water supply for both domestic and agricultural use its role is particularly obvious during the dry season overall the lake chad basin has considerable groundwater resources because of its hydrogeology according to lcbc 2016 the total renewable groundwater reserves in the quaternary aquifer is about 4 billion m3 eberschweiler 1993 estimated that the water extracted from the whole quaternary aquifer was around 80 million m3 in 1970 the water loss caused by climate variability and surface water withdrawals for the same year in fig 7b is 4902 and 3620 million m3 respectively in the early 1990s the groundwater exploitation over the basin was estimated at 438 million m3 lcbc 2016 the results in table 1 show that the water loss caused by climate variability and surface water withdrawals from 1990 to 1995 is 5010 and 13 900 million m3 respectively judging from these comparisons the contribution of groundwater exploitation to the total water loss of river discharge is negligible nevertheless surface water scarcity as well as adaptation strategy has increased the abstraction of groundwater a persistent decreasing trend in water table was observed during the 1980s and early 1990s however there was evidence of a recovery of the groundwater level at the end of the 1990s although the exact recovery extent is still unknown candela et al 2014 the report published by the lcbc 2016 also suggested that the water level of the quaternary aquifer over the lake chad basin is highly variable over time the driving factors include human activities rainfall infiltration evapotranspiration and river aquifer interactions boronina and ramillien 2008 candela et al 2014 genthon et al 2015 the lack of enough relevant technical information on this topic hinders us investigating further the uncertainty caused by the groundwater storage variability 6 conclusions the serious recession of lake chad since the 1960s has been widely reported in the media because approximately 90 of lake chad s water stems from the chari logone river system there is a tremendous need to investigate the variations of river discharge and the causes leading to such variations considering the limitations of data availability and validity a conceptual and statistical approach was proposed in this paper to address the above issues only discharge observations and a global precipitation and potential evapotranspiration dataset are necessary in this research which makes it possible for us to distinguish the relative contribution of climate variability and human activities on river discharge in the absence of natural runoff and irrigation withdrawal observations due to the little impact of human activities the time period of 1950 1960 was adopted as the baseline the runoff change caused by climate variability δ q climate was evaluated based on budyko analysis δ q climate was decomposed into the effect of precipitation variability δ p and potential evapotranspiration variability δ e 0 using climate elasticity method the runoff change caused by anthropogenic activities δ q human was estimated using linear regression method it is expressed as the difference between observed runoff left by water withdrawals upstream and the total natural runoff predicted by the regression model constrained by the total water loss δ q total caused by climate variability and anthropogenic activities either of these two components of δ q total can be estimated as the residual of the other consequently the accuracy of δ q human and δ q climate estimates can be evaluated within the framework proposed in this research without any ancillary data the major results and conclusions are presented as follows 1 the time series of the chari logone river discharge from 1950 to 2013 can be divided into two periods with opposite variation trend with the serious drought in 1984 as the turning point 2 the impact of climate variability on runoff is dominated by precipitation on annual average scale the change of runoff caused by δ p and δ e 0 is 4 20 km3 and 0 14 km3 respectively 3 in general the water loss caused by human activities increases throughout the whole testing period with varying rate the annual average δ q human from 1961 to 2013 is 12 60 km3 with a standard deviation sd of 5 17 km3 4 compared with the baseline period an increasing trend of total water loss is observed for the whole period from 1961 to 2013 the annual average δ q total is 16 76 km3 with a sd of 6 95 km3 5 unlike the research of coe and foley 2001 our research suggests that the decrease of the chari logone river discharge is dominated by human activities rather than climate variability on annual average scale the relative contribution of climate variability and anthropogenic activities is 26 83 and 73 17 respectively besides cross validation our results are also evaluated in light of earlier studies in general the annual natural runoff predicted by the regression model agrees well with that predicted by mahmood and jia 2018 the correlation r mae and rmse is 0 89 3 45 km3 and 4 16 km 3 respectively a good correlation relationship is also observed between δ q human estimates and the agricultural area provided by the fao all above confirms the effectiveness of the conceptual and statistical approach proposed in this paper although our research still suffers from large uncertainty acknowledgments this study was funded by
