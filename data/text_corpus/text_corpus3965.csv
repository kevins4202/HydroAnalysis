19825,the environmental risks of carbon nanotubes have received considerable attention in this work the effects of multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts on the adsorption of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs by riverine sediment and the transport of sdbs in sediment were studied mwcnts could significantly increase the adsorption capacity of the sediment for sdbs thus affecting the transport of sdbs in sediment maximum adsorption capacity of the sediment for sdbs increases from 2 29 to 2 99 mg g with the increasing content of mwcnts from 0 to 1 5 breakthrough curves btcs of sdbs obtained from the column experiments were described by the convection dispersion equation thomas model and yan model the estimated retardation factor r increases with the incorporation of mwcnts either in water or sediment additionally the value of r is well correlated to the content of mwcnts in sediment compared with thomas model yan model is more suitable for fitting the btcs with all the values of r 2 0 951 but it tends to overestimate the maximum adsorption capacity when the content of mwcnts in sediment is relatively higher the results of sdbs retention in sediment indicate that mwcnts can increase the accumulation of sdbs in the top sediment layer while they can impede the transport of sdbs into deeper sediment layer when incorporated into the sediment these effects should be taken into consideration for risk assessment of cnts in the aquatic environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption transport sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate multi walled carbon nanotubes sediment environmental risk 1 introduction carbon nanotubes cnts composed of carbon atoms in a periodic hexagonal arrangement are hollow cylinders with a diameter in the nanometer range single walled nanotubes swcnts and multi walled nanotubes mwcnts are two main types of cnts since their observation was first reported by iijima in 1991 iijima 1991 cnts have been attracting much attention of researchers because of their unique mechanical thermal optical and electronic properties as well as many potential applications popov 2004 zhang et al 2007 huang et al 2008 tang et al 2008 de volder et al 2013 current production capacity of cnts worldwide has exceeded 5000 tonnes per year and is increasing at an annual growth rate of 32 5 patel 2011 de volder et al 2013 increasing production and application of cnts will inevitably result in the release of these nanomaterials into the environment in a multimedia environment atmosphere soil water and sediment mass accumulation of cnts was mostly in soil and sediment yang et al 2010 liu and cohen 2014 based on the research of koelmans et al 2009 the estimated concentrations of manufactured carbon based nanoparticles in aquatic sediment are ranging from 1 2 to 2000 μg per kilogram of the dry sediment and it is likely that the concentrations of cnts in sediment will increase in the future cnts have strong adsorption affinity for various organic and inorganic contaminants gong et al 2009 song et al 2017a 2017b as sediment is also the ultimate reservoir of various contaminants in aquatic ecosystem the interaction between cnts and contaminants may alter the fate and transport of these contaminants significantly influencing their mobility toxicity and bioavailability xu et al 2012a zeng et al 2013a b cheng et al 2016 for example sun et al 2015 found that cnts released into sediment would increase the adsorption capacity of cd ii by sediment fang et al 2013 demonstrated that tx100 suspended mwcnts could facilitate the transport of phenanthrene in soil columns while li et al 2013 reported that 5 mg g cnts could significantly retain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soil recent research by liang et al 2016 showed that cnts could enhance the mobility of tetrabromobisphenol a in saturated porous media zhang et al 2017 also observed facilitated transport of chlordecone and sulfadiazine in the presence of cnts in soil however studies investigating the effect of cnts on the transport of contaminants in real riverine sediment were insufficient since sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs is commonly used to increase the dispersity and stability of cnts in aqueous solutions most of the current studies focused on the effect of sdbs on the properties transport and fate of cnts tian et al 2011 ju et al 2012 wusiman et al 2013 however few studies investigated the effect of cnts on the transport and fate of sdbs as an anionic surfactant sdbs is usually present in detergent soap as well as cosmetic and widely used as emulsifier dispersant lubricant and preservative in industrial processes myers 2005 taffarel and rubio 2010 because of its extensive applications a large amount of sdbs is released into the aquatic environment causing serious environmental problems the adverse effects of the surfactant on the aquatic environment and human health have been studied and reported elsewhere according to the available literature sdbs exhibits toxic effects towards algae benthic invertebrates fishes and human cells qv and jiang 2013 mu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 2016 considering the ecological and human health risks of sdbs the environmental behavior of sdbs in the presence of cnts in the aquatic environment should be studied in this study research on the transport of sdbs in riverine sediment in the presence of mwcnts was conducted the objectives of the present study were 1 to investigate the effect of mwcnts on the adsorption of sdbs by sediment and 2 to study the transport of sdbs in the presence and absence of mwcnts in riverine sediment by column experiments and numerical modeling 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sediment and carbon nanotubes sdbs c18h29nao3s ar was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china all other reagents in this study were of analytical grade or better and commercially available surface sediment samples 0 15 cm were collected from changsha section of the xiangjiang river in hunan province china sediment samples were air dried at room temperature and then crushed in a porcelain mortar subsequently the samples were sieved over a one mm mesh sieve and homogenized prior to use sediment properties including ph zeta potential electrical conductivity organic carbon content cation exchange capacity and texture sand silt and clay were measured with the methods mentioned in previous literature song et al 2017b industrial grade mwcnts with an outer diameter of 10 20 nm and a length of 5 10 μm were used in this study they were purchased from chengdu organic chemistry co chinese academy of sciences chengdu china 2 2 batch adsorption experiments kinetics experiments of sdbs adsorption onto mwcnts sediment and sediment mwcnts mixtures content of mwcnts in sediment w w 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 were performed in 250 ml conical flasks containing 20 mg l sdbs on a shaker at 180 rpm 25 1 c absorbent dosage of mwcnts was 0 3 g l while the dosages of sediment and sediment mwcnts were both 20 g l the samples were taken out from the flask after predetermined time intervals from 30 s to 300 min and the concentrations of sdbs were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1100 usa equipped with uv vis variable wavelength detector vwd and reversed phase c18 column methanol 90 v v was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min with constant detection wavelength at 224 nm adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted in conical flasks containing sdbs solutions of different concentrations from 10 to 80 mg l on a shaker at 180 rpm 25 1 c the dosages of absorbents were the same as those in kinetics experiments after a 2 h equilibrium samples were taken out and the concentrations of sdbs were determined by the above mentioned analytical method of hplc 2 3 column experiments column transport experiments of sdbs in various sediment columns were carried out under saturated flow conditions a teflon column with a length of 300 mm and an inner diameter of 24 mm was used in the experiments the column packing was based on previously reported methods with appropriate modifications zhuang et al 2003 tričković et al 2016 concretely a stainless steel wire mesh with pore size of 0 14 mm was placed at the bottom of the column and then a quartz sand 25 50 mesh layer of 10 mm was added for supporting the sediment particles subsequently ultrapure water was introduced into the column from the bottom to a certain height with a peristaltic pump ddb 300 zhisun equipment co ltd shanghai china after that sediment was slowly poured into the column by 5 6 mm increments until the column was packed to a height of 48 mm during the packing process the sediment in the column was stirred with a glass rod to ensure homogeneous packing and to avoid air entrapment after the sediment column was prepared a potassium bromide kbr solution was used as a conservative tracer for characterizing the sediment column and the hydraulic conditions two sets of column transport experiment denoted as set i and set ii were conducted in set i 50 mg l sdbs 50 mg l sdbs containing 0 3 g l mwcnts reached adsorption equilibrium in advance and 32 mg l sdbs an equilibrium concentration of 50 mg l sdbs containing 0 3 g l mwcnts were pumped respectively to the top of the sediment columns for set ii sediment in the column was mixed with mwcnts and the contents of mwcnts were 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 w w respectively in this set 50 mg l sdbs solutions were pumped to the columns by peristaltic pump and transported from the top down the duration of each column transport experiment was 24 h for both set i and set ii during the column experiments a constant water head of 150 mm was maintained and the effluent was collected at regular intervals for the measurement of sdbs concentrations at the end of the column experiment sediment in the column was air dried and equally divided into 6 segments then sdbs concentrations in these segments were analyzed based on previously reported method santos et al 2007 in short sdbs in the sediment was extracted with methanol for each extraction 20 ml methanol was added into the beaker containing the sediment followed by shaking the beaker on a shaker for 5 min afterwards the sample was sonicated for 30 min and then centrifuged to collect the supernatants after filtered through 0 45 μm filter membrane the sdbs concentration in the filtrate was determined by hplc 2 4 numerical modeling the obtained data of adsorption kinetics were fitted with pseudo first order kinetic model and pseudo second order kinetic model the models are given by the following equations hu et al 2011 xu et al 2012b 1 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t pseudo first order kinetic model 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e pseudo second order kinetic model where q e and q t mg g are the amount of adsorbed sdbs at equilibrium and time t min k 1 and k 2 are the first order rate constant 1 min and second order rate constant g mg min respectively experimental results of the adsorption isotherms were described by langmuir and freundlich models which are represented by the following equations hu et al 2011 xu et al 2012b 3 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e langmuir model 4 q e k f c e 1 n freundlich model where q e mg g is the amount of adsorbed sdbs at equilibrium q m mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity k l l mg is the langmuir constant c e mg l is the equilibrium concentration of sdbs k f mg g mg l 1 n and n dimensionless are freundlich constants breakthrough curves btcs are used to indicate the transport of sdbs through sediment columns under the condition of steady flow the btcs can be described by the convection dispersion equation cde btc of the tracer br is fitted with deterministic equilibrium cde toride et al 1995 which is written as 5 r c t d 2 c x 2 v c x where c mg l is the br concentration in effluent r dimensionless is the retardation factor d cm2 h is the dispersion coefficient v cm h is the average pore water velocity x cm is distance and t h is time based on the assumption that br is nonreactive and can not be adsorbed onto sediment r 1 the estimated d and v by the equilibrium cde are 3 35 cm2 h and 4 73 cm h fig 2a r 2 0 982 respectively these parameters are then used for understanding the dominant process that impacts the solute transport and analyzing the btcs of sdbs transport the transport of sdbs in sediment can be described by a two site chemical nonequilibrium model tsm a deterministic nonequilibrium cde model in which adsorption sites of the sediment are divided into two types equilibrium adsorption sites and kinetic adsorption sites toride et al 1995 dimensionless form of the tsm is given by 6 β r c 1 t 1 p 2 c 1 z 2 c 1 z ω c 1 c 2 7 1 β r c 2 t ω c 1 c 2 8 β θ f k d θ k d 9 ω α 1 β r l v 10 r 1 ρ b k d θ 11 t v t l 12 p v l d 13 z x l where β is a partitioning coefficient of equilibrium and kinetic

length θ is volumetric water content f is the fraction of exchange sites assumed to be at equilibrium k d is the distribution coefficient for linear adsorption α is a first order kinetic rate coefficient ρ b is the bulk density of sediment and the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to equilibrium and kinetic adsorption sites respectively other symbols have the same meaning as those in eq 5 when fitting the btcs of sdbs the parameter d and v are fixed as the value obtained by the equilibrium cde and then the transport parameter r β and ω are estimated with tsm thomas and yan models are widely used for describing the adsorption process in a continuous system valizadeh et al 2016 in this study they are applied for modeling the btcs concerning sdbs adsorption the models are given by the following equations 14 c c 0 1 1 exp k t q t m q k t c 0 t thomas model 15 c c 0 1 1 1 q 2 t k y q y m k y c 0 q yan model where c mg l is the sdbs concentration in effluent c 0 mg l is the sdbs

are the maximum adsorption capacity estimated by thomas model and yan model respectively yan model is an empirical formula that overcomes some deficiencies of thomas model especially that of the prediction of solute concentration in effluent near time zero originpro 9 1 software originlab corporation massachusetts usa was used to fit the adsorption models and btc models concerning sdbs adsorption fitting of btc models concerning transport parameters was performed with the program cxtfit 2 0 executed in the software stanmod version 2 08 toride et al 1995 simunek et al 1999 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the sediment and mwcnts the measured ph value organic carbon content cation exchange capacity zeta potential and electrical conductivity of the sediment are 7 92 1 63 10 8 cmol kg 18 4 mv and 0 144 ms cm respectively additionally the sediment sample has a composition of 23 4 sand 27 6 silt and 49 0 clay mwcnts used in this study were characterized by scanning electron microscope sem and specific surface analyzer typical tubular structure of the mwcnts was observed with sem images shown in fig s1 according to the specific surface analysis brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area of the mwcnts is 134 m2 g 3 2 effect of mwcnts on the adsorption of sdbs by sediment the mwcnts significantly influenced the adsorption of sdbs by sediment as shown in fig 1 the adsorption amount of sdbs increases with the increase of time the whole process of adsorption can be broadly divided onto three stages during the first stage the first 20 min a rapid increase of the adsorption amount of sdbs is observed as a result of the high concentration gradient in the second stage 20 50 min the adsorption amount increases slowly until the arrival of the last stage 50 min the maximum adsorption amount is reached at the last stage and the adsorption gets to an equilibrium state compared with the adsorption by sediment the adsorption amount of sdbs by mwcnts increases more quickly in the first stage parameters of the fitted models for sdbs adsorption are listed in table s1 and table s2 it can be found that experimental data of adsorption kinetics are better fitted by pseudo second order kinetic model r 2 0 911 than pseudo first order kinetic model r 2 0 828 such result indicates that rate limiting step of the adsorption processes is a chemical adsorption in which valence forces generated by exchanging or sharing electrons are involved fan et al 2008 feng et al 2010 xu et al 2012b langmuir and freundlich models could be well used to fit the isotherm data with all the values of r 2 0 926 the estimated q m of mwcnts for sdbs adsorption is 115 mg g which is much more than that of sediment 2 29 mg g this could be due to the specific molecular structure of sdbs on the one hand the strong π π electron donor acceptor interaction between the benzene ring of sdbs molecule and the highly polarizable graphene sheets of mwcnts can facilitate the adsorption processes lin et al 2015 on the other hand the hydrophobic tail 12 carbon alkyl chain of sdbs may be bound to the surface of mwcnts through hydrophobic attraction lin et al 2010 additionally the values of q m from 2 29 to 2 99 mg g and k f from 0 0713 to 0 844 mg g mg l 1 n increase with the increasing content of mwcnts in sediment from 0 to 1 5 implying that the adsorption capacity of sediment for sdbs was enhanced as a result of the incorporation of mwcnts 3 3 effect of mwcnts on the transport of sdbs in sediment 3 3 1 analysis and modeling of the btcs concerning transport parameters the experimental and cde fitting results of sdbs transport through sediment columns in set i and set ii are shown in fig 2 and associated parameters estimated by the model are listed in table 1 it is observed from the table that the experimental data are well fitted by tsm with all the values of r 2 0 927 however the equilibrium cde is not suitable for describing the btcs of sdbs data not shown retardation factor r is a derived parameter to quantify the slowing down of solute transport in the experimental results of set i a lower value of r 5 10 is obtained with an initial sdbs concentration of 50 mg l while the value of r increases to 5 62 with an initial sdbs concentration of 32 mg l thus it can be regarded that a slightly higher concentration of sdbs is able to overcome part of the mass transfer resistance resulting in a lower value of r similar results can be found in previous literature fonseca et al 2009 florido et al 2010 considering the surfactant characteristic of sdbs the effect of the critical micelle concentration cmc on the transport of sdbs were investigated fig s2 we determined the cmc of sdbs through conductivity measurement and the result is 1 72 mmol l 599 16 mg l thus sdbs aqueous solutions with three different concentrations 200 600 and 1000 mg l were used and transported through the sediment columns compared with 32 and 50 mg l sdbs higher sdbs concentration near cmc leads to an increase in r value 5 62 and the value decreases with the increasing sdbs concentration 11 3 7 00 and 5 91 when sdbs concentration increases but is below the cmc the surfactant may increase the dispersion of colloidal size sediment particles leading to sediment pore clogging and when the concentration up to the cmc clay size sediment particles can be trapped in the sdbs micelles and cannot settle out of the solution abdul et al 1990 using 50 mg l sdbs containing 0 3 g l mwcnts as the influent significantly increases calculated r to 37 0 c 0 50 mg l this is mainly because of the strong adsorption affinity of mwcnts towards sdbs partitioning coefficient β and mass transfer coefficient ω can be used for evaluating the validity of equilibrium assumption for the transport conditions pang and close 1999 when β 1 the transport is under an equilibrium condition and all the adsorption sites are instantaneous when 0 β 1 a nonequilibrium condition exists and there are some rate limited adsorption sites a higher value of ω corresponds to faster adsorption of the solute during transport process and when ω 100 the transport is considered to be under an equilibrium condition pang and close 1999 the calculated values of β for set i table 1 indicated that more than 80 of the adsorption sites were rate limited and less than 10 of the adsorption sites were instantaneous the lower values of β β 0 196 and ω ω 9 53 in the experiment results of set i provide evidence for the nonequilibrium transport of sdbs in the sediment columns additionally it is interesting that the calculated r β and ω for the influent with 50 mg l sdbs containing 0 3 g l mwcnts c 0 32 mg l are very similar to those obtained with 32 mg l sdbs as influent when using the equilibrium concentration as initial concentration for modeling we assume that the sdbs in the influent can be divided into an adsorbed part and a free part based on the above result only the free part participated in the transport while the adsorbed part deposited with mwcnts on the top of the sediment column the result also shows that the adsorption affinity between sdbs and mwcnts is relatively stronger and sdbs is not easy to be desorbed from mwcnts under natural conditions in the results of set ii in table 1 retardation factor increases from 5 10 to 92 6 with the increasing content of mwcnts in sediment from 0 to 1 5 this is mainly because of the strong adsorption affinity of mwcnts for sdbs after the incorporation of mwcnts into sediment there is a consequential increase in the resistance of sdbs transport through the sediment columns retardation factor can also be estimated using eq 10 based on the batch adsorption experiments zhang et al 2011 the calculated values of r are 39 66 70 44 106 5 and 182 2 which correspond to the mwcnts content in sediment of 0 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively table s3 it is found that the r values determined through the batch adsorption experiments are higher than those determined from the column experiments nonetheless the changing trends are consistent the difference could be due to a shorter retention time in column experiments pang and close 1999 3 3 2 analysis and modeling of the btcs concerning sdbs adsorption results of analysis and modeling of the btcs concerning sdbs adsorption are shown in fig 3 and table 2 thomas model can well fit most btcs except that using the influent of 50 mg l sdbs containing 0 3 g l mwcnts and modeling with 50 mg l as the initial concentration r 2 0 752 compared with thomas model yan model is more suitable for fitting the btcs with all the values of r 2 0 951 in the experiment results of set i q t and q y increase with the incorporation of mwcnts in influent while the rate constant k t and k y vary inversely for the influent with 50 mg l sdbs containing 0 3 g l mwcnts c 0 32 mg l the modeling results are also similar to those obtained with 32 mg l sdbs as influent which further confirms the foregoing conclusion for set ii 50 mg l sdbs can completely c c 0 1 break through the sediment column without mwcnts in about 12 h after which the concentration of sdbs in effluent reaches a stationary value of 50 mg l when mwcnts were incorporated into the sediment the transport of sdbs in sediment column was much slower for sediment columns incorporated with 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 mwcnts the values of c c 0 are calculated to be 0 66 0 25 and 0 09 after 24 h respectively fig 3b a higher content of mwcnts in sediment leads to higher values of q t and q y most values of maximum adsorption capacity estimated by thomas model and yan model table 2 are lower than those obtained from batch adsorption tests table s2 because of a shorter retention time however when the content of mwcnts in sediment increase to 1 5 the value of q y is estimated to be 9 96 mg g which is much higher than that 2 99 mg g obtained from the batch adsorption tests the result suggests that yan model tends to overestimate the maximum adsorption capacity when the content of mwcnts in sediment is relatively higher the rate constant k t and k y which characterize the rate of sdbs transfer from the liquid to sediment decrease with the increase in content of mwcnts in sediment the lower values of rate constants indicate a greater decrease of the adsorption rate with the increase of time due to fewer unoccupied adsorption sites shahbazi et al 2011 3 3 3 retention of sdbs in sediment mwcnts have a remarkable influence on the retention of sdbs in sediment fig 4 under natural conditions sdbs can be intercepted during the transport process due to mechanical resistance adsorption complexation gravity sedimentation etc for influent with 50 mg l sdbs the final concentrations of sdbs in sediment segments from the top to the bottom are 0 39 0 37 0 37 0 36 0 27 0 22 mg g respectively fig 4a for influent with 32 mg l sdbs the concentrations of sdbs in corresponding sediment segments decrease slightly for example sdbs concentrations of the top and the bottom segments are 0 35 and 0 19 mg g respectively when mwcnts were incorporated into the influent transport of sdbs through the sediment column became more difficult the adsorbed sdbs deposited with mwcnts on the top of the sediment column resulting in a high concentration of sdbs 1 96 mg g in the top sediment segment for set ii the concentrations of sdbs in the top segments are 0 39 0 62 0 82 and 1 10 mg g while those in the bottom segments are 0 22 0 13 0 09 and 0 07 mg g when the contents of mwcnts in sediment columns are 0 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively fig 4b these results indicate that mwcnts can increase the accumulation of sdbs in the top sediment layer either in water or sediment on the other hand mwcnts in sediment can impede the transport of sdbs into deeper sediment layer this is mainly because of strong adsorption affinity of mwcnts for sdbs and low mobility of mwcnts in riverine sediment nevertheless some previous studies reported the facilitated transport of contaminants in the presence of mwcnts fang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 the different results can be attributed to that the mwcnts were pretreated before the column experiments and the size of particles in porous media was relatively larger in these studies as a result mwcnts showed high mobility in these porous media leading to the co transport of contaminants with mwcnts in our study the mwcnts used in the experiments showed no macroscopic transport in the riverine sediment thus they impeded the transport of sdbs in sediment due to the increase of adsorption capacity of the sediment incorporated with mwcnts 3 4 environmental implications the release of cnts into sediment can significantly influence the adsorption behaviors of sdbs by sediment and the transport of sdbs in sediment the q m q t q y r estimated from the column experiments and the batch adsorption experiments and retention amount of sdbs in sediment increased after the incorporation of cnts relationships between the content of mwcnts in sediment and these parameters were analyzed the pearson s correlation coefficients were calculated to be 0 957 0 992 0 975 0 997 0 860 and 0 990 respectively table s4 the results indicate a concentration dependent effect of mwcnts on sdbs transport in riverine sediment retardation factors estimated by the column experiments can be interpreted as the transport distance of sdbs in sediment since r is also expressed as the ratio of the velocity of pore water to that of solute baik and lee 1994 in other words for example when the pore water flows for a distance of 92 6 cm in the sediment incorporated with 1 5 mwcnts sdbs can only be transported for 1 cm r 92 6 although the ecological risks of cnts are not fully understood the retention of sdbs may increase the ecotoxicity of cnts to the aquatic organisms due to the toxicity of sdbs and the prolonged contact time 4 conclusions in this work the effects of mwcnts on the adsorption and transport of sdbs in riverine sediment were investigated the main conclusions are as follows mwcnts significantly increase the adsorption capacity of the sediment for sdbs thus affecting the transport of sdbs in sediment the retardation factor r estimated by the cde model increases with the incorporation of mwcnts either in water or sediment additionally the value of r is well correlated to the content of mwcnts in sediment compared with thomas model yan model is more suitable for fitting the btcs with all the values of r 2 0 951 but it tends to overestimate the maximum adsorption capacity when the content of mwcnts in sediment is relatively higher mwcnts can increase the accumulation of sdbs in the top sediment layer while they can impede the transport of sdbs into deeper sediment layer when incorporated into the sediment further studies on the potential ecological impacts of cnts and their mechanisms should be conducted

the aquatic environment causing serious environmental problems the adverse effects of the surfactant on the aquatic environment and human health have been studied and reported elsewhere according to the available literature sdbs exhibits toxic effects towards algae benthic invertebrates fishes and human cells qv and jiang 2013 mu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 2016 considering the ecological and human health risks of sdbs the environmental behavior of sdbs in the presence of cnts in the aquatic environment should be studied in this study research on the transport of sdbs in riverine sediment in the presence of mwcnts was conducted the objectives of the present study were 1 to investigate the effect of mwcnts on the adsorption of sdbs by sediment and 2 to study the transport of sdbs in the presence and absence of mwcnts in riverine sediment by column experiments and numerical modeling 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sediment and carbon nanotubes sdbs c18h29nao3s ar was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china all other reagents in this study were of analytical grade or better and commercially available surface sediment samples 0 15 cm were collected from changsha section of the xiangjiang river in hunan province china sediment samples were air dried at room temperature and then crushed in a porcelain mortar subsequently the samples were sieved over a one mm mesh sieve and homogenized prior to use sediment properties including ph zeta potential electrical conductivity organic carbon content cation exchange capacity and texture sand silt and clay were measured with the methods mentioned in previous literature song et al 2017b industrial grade mwcnts with an outer diameter of 10 20 nm and a length of 5 10 μm were used in this study they were purchased from chengdu organic chemistry co chinese academy of sciences chengdu china 2 2 batch adsorption experiments kinetics experiments of sdbs adsorption onto mwcnts sediment and sediment mwcnts mixtures content of mwcnts in sediment w w 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 were performed in 250 ml conical flasks containing 20 mg l sdbs on a shaker at 180 rpm 25 1 c absorbent dosage of mwcnts was 0 3 g l while the dosages of sediment and sediment mwcnts were both 20 g l the samples were taken out from the flask after predetermined time intervals from 30 s to 300 min and the concentrations of sdbs were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1100 usa equipped with uv vis variable wavelength detector vwd and reversed phase c18 column methanol 90 v v was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min with constant detection wavelength at 224 nm adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted in conical flasks containing sdbs solutions of different concentrations from 10 to 80 mg l on a shaker at 180 rpm 25 1 c the dosages of absorbents were the same as those in kinetics experiments after a 2 h equilibrium samples were taken out and the concentrations of sdbs were determined by the above mentioned analytical method of hplc 2 3 column experiments column transport experiments of sdbs in various sediment columns were carried out under saturated flow conditions a teflon column with a length of 300 mm and an inner diameter of 24 mm was used in the experiments the column packing was based on previously reported methods with appropriate modifications zhuang et al 2003 tričković et al 2016 concretely a stainless steel wire mesh with pore size of 0 14 mm was placed at the bottom of the column and then a quartz sand 25 50 mesh layer of 10 mm was added for supporting the sediment particles subsequently ultrapure water was introduced into the column from the bottom to a certain height with a peristaltic pump ddb 300 zhisun equipment co ltd shanghai china after that sediment was slowly poured into the column by 5 6 mm increments until the column was packed to a height of 48 mm during the packing process the sediment in the column was stirred with a glass rod to ensure homogeneous packing and to avoid air entrapment after the sediment column was prepared a potassium bromide kbr solution was used as a conservative tracer for characterizing the sediment column and the hydraulic conditions two sets of column transport experiment denoted as set i and set ii were conducted in set i 50 mg l sdbs 50 mg l sdbs containing 0 3 g l mwcnts reached adsorption equilibrium in advance and 32 mg l sdbs an equilibrium concentration of 50 mg l sdbs containing 0 3 g l mwcnts were pumped respectively to the top of the sediment columns for set ii sediment in the column was mixed with mwcnts and the contents of mwcnts were 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 w w respectively in this set 50 mg l sdbs solutions were pumped to the columns by peristaltic pump and transported from the top down the duration of each column transport experiment was 24 h for both set i and set ii during the column experiments a constant water head of 150 mm was maintained and the effluent was collected at regular intervals for the measurement of sdbs concentrations at the end of the column experiment sediment in the column was air dried and equally divided into 6 segments then sdbs concentrations in these segments were analyzed based on previously reported method santos et al 2007 in short sdbs in the sediment was extracted with methanol for each extraction 20 ml methanol was added into the beaker containing the sediment followed by shaking the beaker on a shaker for 5 min afterwards the sample was sonicated for 30 min and then centrifuged to collect the supernatants after filtered through 0 45 μm filter membrane the sdbs concentration in the filtrate was determined by hplc 2 4 numerical modeling the obtained data of adsorption kinetics were fitted with pseudo first order kinetic model and pseudo second order kinetic model the models are given by the following equations hu et al 2011 xu et al 2012b 1 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t pseudo first order kinetic model 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e pseudo second order kinetic model where q e and q t mg g are the amount of adsorbed sdbs at equilibrium and time t min k 1 and k 2 are the first order rate constant 1 min and second order rate constant g mg min respectively experimental results of the adsorption isotherms were described by langmuir and freundlich models which are represented by the following equations hu et al 2011 xu et al 2012b 3 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e langmuir model 4 q e k f c e 1 n freundlich model where q e mg g is the amount of adsorbed sdbs at equilibrium q m mg g is

btcs are used to indicate the transport of sdbs through sediment columns under the condition of steady flow the btcs can be described by the convection dispersion equation cde btc of the tracer br is fitted with deterministic equilibrium cde toride et al 1995 which is written as 5 r c t d 2 c x 2 v c x where c mg l is the br concentration in effluent r dimensionless is the retardation factor d cm2 h is the dispersion coefficient v cm h is the average pore water velocity x cm is distance and t h is time based on the assumption that br is nonreactive and can not be adsorbed onto sediment r 1 the estimated d and v by the equilibrium cde are 3 35 cm2 h and 4 73 cm h fig 2a r 2 0 982 respectively these parameters are then used for understanding the dominant process that impacts the solute transport and analyzing the btcs of sdbs transport the transport of sdbs in sediment can be described by a two site chemical nonequilibrium model tsm a deterministic nonequilibrium cde model in which adsorption sites of the sediment are divided into two types equilibrium adsorption sites and kinetic adsorption sites toride et al 1995 dimensionless form of the tsm is given by 6 β r c 1 t 1 p 2 c 1

length θ is volumetric water content f is the fraction of exchange sites assumed to be at equilibrium k d is the distribution coefficient for linear adsorption α is a first order kinetic rate coefficient ρ b is the bulk density of sediment and the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to equilibrium and kinetic adsorption sites respectively other symbols have the same meaning as those in eq 5 when fitting the btcs of sdbs the parameter d and v are fixed as the value obtained by the equilibrium cde and then the transport parameter r β and ω are estimated with tsm thomas and yan models are widely used for describing the adsorption process in a continuous system valizadeh et al 2016 in this study they are applied for modeling the btcs concerning sdbs adsorption the models are given by the

are the maximum adsorption capacity estimated by thomas model and yan model respectively yan model is an empirical formula that overcomes some deficiencies of thomas model especially that of the prediction of solute concentration in effluent near time zero originpro 9 1 software originlab corporation massachusetts usa was used to fit the adsorption models and btc models concerning sdbs adsorption fitting of btc models concerning transport parameters was performed with the program cxtfit 2 0 executed in the software stanmod version 2 08 toride et al 1995 simunek et al 1999 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the sediment and mwcnts the measured ph value organic carbon content cation exchange capacity zeta potential and electrical conductivity of the sediment are 7 92 1 63 10 8 cmol kg 18 4 mv and 0 144 ms cm respectively additionally the sediment sample has a composition of 23 4 sand 27 6 silt and 49 0 clay mwcnts used in this study were characterized by scanning electron microscope sem and specific surface analyzer typical tubular structure of the mwcnts was observed with sem images shown in fig s1 according to the specific surface analysis brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area of the mwcnts is 134 m2 g 3 2 effect of mwcnts on the adsorption of sdbs by sediment the mwcnts significantly influenced the adsorption of sdbs by sediment as shown in fig 1 the adsorption amount of sdbs increases with the increase of time the whole process of adsorption can be broadly divided onto three stages during the first stage the first 20 min a rapid increase of the adsorption amount of sdbs is observed as a result of the high concentration gradient in the second stage 20 50 min the adsorption amount increases slowly until the arrival of the last stage 50 min the maximum adsorption amount is reached at the last stage and the adsorption gets to an equilibrium state compared with the adsorption by sediment the adsorption amount of sdbs by mwcnts increases more quickly in the first stage parameters of the fitted models for sdbs adsorption are listed in table s1 and table s2 it can be found that experimental data of adsorption kinetics are better fitted by pseudo second order kinetic model r 2 0 911 than pseudo first order kinetic model r 2 0 828 such result indicates that rate limiting step of the adsorption processes is a chemical adsorption in which valence forces generated by exchanging or sharing electrons are involved fan et al 2008 feng et al 2010 xu et al 2012b langmuir and freundlich models could be well used to fit the isotherm data with all the values of r 2 0 926 the estimated q m of mwcnts for sdbs adsorption is 115 mg g which is much more than that of sediment 2 29 mg g this could be due to the specific molecular structure of sdbs on the one hand the strong π π electron donor acceptor interaction between the benzene ring of sdbs molecule and the highly polarizable graphene sheets of mwcnts can facilitate the adsorption processes lin et al 2015 on the other hand the hydrophobic tail 12 carbon alkyl chain of sdbs may be bound to the surface of mwcnts through hydrophobic attraction lin et al 2010 additionally the values of q m from 2 29 to 2 99 mg g and k f from 0 0713 to 0 844 mg g mg l 1 n increase with the increasing content of mwcnts in sediment from 0 to 1 5 implying that the adsorption capacity of sediment for sdbs was enhanced as a result of the incorporation of mwcnts 3 3 effect of mwcnts on the transport of sdbs in sediment 3 3 1 analysis and modeling of the btcs concerning transport parameters the experimental and cde fitting results of sdbs transport through sediment columns in set i and set ii are shown in fig 2 and associated parameters estimated by the model are listed in table 1 it is observed from the table that the experimental data are well fitted by tsm with all the values of r 2 0 927 however the equilibrium cde is not suitable for describing the btcs of sdbs data not shown retardation factor r is a derived parameter to quantify the slowing down of solute transport in the experimental results of set i a lower value of r 5 10 is obtained with an initial sdbs concentration of 50 mg l while the value of r increases to 5 62 with an initial sdbs concentration of 32 mg l thus it can be regarded that a slightly higher concentration of sdbs is able to overcome part of the mass transfer resistance resulting in a lower value of r similar results can be found in previous literature fonseca et al 2009 florido et al 2010 considering the surfactant characteristic of sdbs the effect of the critical micelle concentration cmc on the transport of sdbs were investigated fig s2 we determined the cmc of sdbs through conductivity measurement and the result is 1 72 mmol l 599 16 mg l thus sdbs aqueous solutions with three different concentrations 200 600 and 1000 mg l were used and transported through the sediment columns compared with 32 and 50 mg l sdbs higher sdbs concentration near cmc leads to an increase in r value 5 62 and the value decreases with the increasing sdbs concentration 11 3 7 00 and 5 91 when sdbs concentration increases but is below the cmc the surfactant may increase the dispersion of colloidal size sediment particles leading to sediment pore clogging and when the concentration up to the cmc clay size sediment particles can be trapped in the sdbs micelles and cannot settle out of the solution abdul et al 1990 using 50 mg l sdbs containing 0 3 g l mwcnts as the influent significantly increases calculated r to 37 0 c 0 50 mg l this is mainly because of the strong adsorption affinity of mwcnts towards sdbs partitioning coefficient β and mass transfer coefficient ω can be used for evaluating the validity of equilibrium assumption for the transport conditions pang and close 1999 when β 1 the transport is under an equilibrium condition and all the adsorption sites are instantaneous when 0 β 1 a nonequilibrium condition exists and there are some rate limited adsorption sites a higher value of ω corresponds to faster adsorption of the solute during transport process and when ω 100 the transport is considered to be under an equilibrium condition pang and close 1999 the calculated values of β for set i table 1 indicated that more than 80 of the adsorption sites were rate limited and less than 10 of the adsorption sites were instantaneous the lower values of β β 0 196 and ω ω 9 53 in the experiment results of set i provide evidence for the nonequilibrium transport of sdbs in the sediment columns additionally it is interesting that the calculated r β and ω for the influent with 50 mg l sdbs containing 0 3 g l mwcnts c 0 32 mg l are very similar to those obtained with 32 mg l sdbs as influent when using the equilibrium concentration as initial concentration for modeling we assume that the sdbs in the influent can be divided into an adsorbed part and a free part based on the above result only the free part participated in the transport while the adsorbed part deposited with mwcnts on the top of the sediment column the result also shows that the adsorption affinity between sdbs and mwcnts is relatively stronger and sdbs is not easy to be desorbed from mwcnts under natural conditions in the results of set ii in table 1 retardation factor increases from 5 10 to 92 6 with the increasing content of mwcnts in sediment from 0 to 1 5 this is mainly because of the strong adsorption affinity of mwcnts for sdbs after the incorporation of mwcnts into sediment there is a consequential increase in the resistance of sdbs transport through the sediment columns retardation factor can also be estimated using eq 10 based on the batch adsorption experiments zhang et al 2011 the calculated values of r are 39 66 70 44 106 5 and 182 2 which correspond to the mwcnts content in sediment of 0 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively table s3 it is found that the r values determined through the batch adsorption experiments are higher than those determined from the column experiments nonetheless the changing trends are consistent the difference could be due to a shorter retention time in column experiments pang and close 1999 3 3 2 analysis and modeling of the btcs concerning sdbs adsorption results of analysis and modeling of the btcs concerning sdbs adsorption are shown in fig 3 and table 2 thomas model can well fit most btcs except that using the influent of 50 mg l sdbs containing 0 3 g l mwcnts and modeling with 50 mg l as the initial concentration r 2 0 752 compared with thomas model yan model is more suitable for fitting the btcs with all the values of r 2 0 951 in the experiment results of set i q t and q y increase with the incorporation of mwcnts in influent while the rate constant k t and k y vary inversely for the influent with 50 mg l sdbs containing 0 3 g l mwcnts c 0 32 mg l the modeling results are also similar to those obtained with 32 mg l sdbs as influent which further confirms the foregoing conclusion for set ii 50 mg l sdbs can completely c c 0 1 break through the sediment column without mwcnts in about 12 h after which the concentration of sdbs in effluent reaches a stationary value of 50 mg l when mwcnts were incorporated into the sediment the transport of sdbs in sediment column was much slower for sediment columns incorporated with 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 mwcnts the values of c c 0 are calculated to be 0 66 0 25 and 0 09 after 24 h respectively fig 3b a higher content of mwcnts in sediment leads to higher values of q t and q y most values of maximum adsorption capacity estimated by thomas model and yan model table 2 are lower than those obtained from batch adsorption tests table s2 because of a shorter retention time however when the content of mwcnts in sediment increase to 1 5 the value of q y is estimated to be 9 96 mg g which is much higher than that 2 99 mg g obtained from the batch adsorption tests the result suggests that yan model tends to overestimate the maximum adsorption capacity when the content of mwcnts in sediment is relatively higher the rate constant k t and k y which characterize the rate of sdbs transfer from the liquid to sediment decrease with the increase in content of mwcnts in sediment the lower values of rate constants indicate a greater decrease of the adsorption rate with the increase of time due to fewer unoccupied adsorption sites shahbazi et al 2011 3 3 3 retention of sdbs in sediment mwcnts have a remarkable influence on the retention of sdbs in sediment fig 4 under natural conditions sdbs can be intercepted during the transport process due to mechanical resistance adsorption complexation gravity sedimentation etc for influent with 50 mg l sdbs the final concentrations of sdbs in sediment segments from the top to the bottom are 0 39 0 37 0 37 0 36 0 27 0 22 mg g respectively fig 4a for influent with 32 mg l sdbs the concentrations of sdbs in corresponding sediment segments decrease slightly for example sdbs concentrations of the top and the bottom segments are 0 35 and 0 19 mg g respectively when mwcnts were incorporated into the influent transport of sdbs through the sediment column became more difficult the adsorbed sdbs deposited with mwcnts on the top of the sediment column resulting in a high concentration of sdbs 1 96 mg g in the top sediment segment for set ii the concentrations of sdbs in the top segments are 0 39 0 62 0 82 and 1 10 mg g while those in the bottom segments are 0 22 0 13 0 09 and 0 07 mg g when the contents of mwcnts in sediment columns are 0 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively fig 4b these results indicate that mwcnts can increase the accumulation of sdbs in the top sediment layer either in water or sediment on the other hand mwcnts in sediment can impede the transport of sdbs into deeper sediment layer this is mainly because of strong adsorption affinity of mwcnts for sdbs and low mobility of mwcnts in riverine sediment nevertheless some previous studies reported the facilitated transport of contaminants in the presence of mwcnts fang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 the different results can be attributed to that the mwcnts were pretreated before the column experiments and the size of particles in porous media was relatively larger in these studies as a result mwcnts showed high mobility in these porous media leading to the co transport of contaminants with mwcnts in our study the mwcnts used in the experiments showed no macroscopic transport in the riverine sediment thus they impeded the transport of sdbs in sediment due to the increase of adsorption capacity of the sediment incorporated with mwcnts 3 4 environmental implications the release of cnts into sediment can significantly influence the adsorption behaviors of sdbs by sediment and the transport of sdbs in sediment the q m q t q y r estimated from the column experiments and the batch adsorption experiments and retention amount of sdbs in sediment increased after the incorporation of cnts relationships between the content of mwcnts in sediment and these parameters were analyzed the pearson s correlation coefficients were calculated to be 0 957 0 992 0 975 0 997 0 860 and 0 990 respectively table s4 the results indicate a concentration dependent effect of mwcnts on sdbs transport in riverine sediment retardation factors estimated by the column experiments can be interpreted as the transport distance of sdbs in sediment since r is also expressed as the ratio of the velocity of pore water to that of solute baik and lee 1994 in other words for example when the pore water flows for a distance of 92 6 cm in the sediment incorporated with 1 5 mwcnts sdbs can only be transported for 1 cm r 92 6 although the ecological risks of cnts are not fully understood the retention of sdbs may increase the ecotoxicity of cnts to the aquatic organisms due to the toxicity of sdbs and the prolonged contact time 4 conclusions in this work the effects of mwcnts on the adsorption and transport of sdbs in riverine sediment were investigated the main conclusions are as follows mwcnts significantly increase the adsorption capacity of the sediment for sdbs thus affecting the transport of sdbs in sediment the retardation factor r estimated by the cde model increases with the incorporation of mwcnts either in water or sediment additionally the value of r is well correlated to the content of mwcnts in sediment compared with thomas model yan model is more suitable for fitting the btcs with all the values of r 2 0 951 but it tends to overestimate the maximum adsorption capacity when the content of mwcnts in sediment is relatively higher mwcnts can increase the accumulation of sdbs in the top sediment layer while they can impede the transport of sdbs into deeper sediment layer when incorporated into the sediment further studies on the potential ecological impacts of cnts and their mechanisms should be conducted

19826,most of the knowledge on the occurrence of uranium u in groundwater comes from in situ manipulation experiments in the field computational modelling studies or from laboratory analyses where individual processes of u mobilization were studied in isolation because of uranium s vital redox chemistry it interacts often simultaneously with many other element cycles e g sulfur carbon iron and manganese making it difficult to predict u concentrations in natural environments for the present study a large data set was analyzed to predict the occurrence of u in groundwater from basic hydrochemistry the data set consists of more than 8000 chemical groundwater analyses including uranium concentrations from more than 2000 sampling locations a strong relation between u concentrations and electric conductivity as well as alkalinity was observed suggesting that weathering of geogenic source material and desorption from mineral surfaces is the principle mechanism of u release except for aquifers with strongly reducing conditions this process leads to a slow but continuous accumulation of u in groundwater in most cases importantly the occurrence of u is modulated by the prevailing redox conditions in an aquifer uranium concentrations were moderate under oxic conditions and highest under manganese and nitrate reducing conditions heterotrophic as wells as autotrophic nitrate reduction only in iron and sulfate reducing groundwater the probability of u concentrations above 1 μg l 1 was virtually zero as these ground waters act as u sinks the combination of mineral weathering especially carbonates with mobilization of u under manganese and nitrate reducing conditions results in the highest risk of detecting u in contrast a low risk is associated with low ph 7 and low mineralization of groundwater which is the case in granitic catchments for example our results further provide evidence that agricultural practices such as liming use of fertilizers and irrigation influence the occurrence of u in groundwater in multiple ways accurate management of aquifers underlying farmland will therefore become more and more important in the future in summary we find that the vulnerability of an aquifer to elevated u concentrations cannot be explained by a single factor this complicates efforts to target elevated u concentrations in groundwaters that are abstracted for drinking water production keywords uranium groundwater drinking water geochemistry 1 introduction uranium is an element of considerable interest for drinking water suppliers in recent years it has attracted some media attention and emerged as a contaminant of broader interest that is critically recognized in the public since u removal from drinking water is costly and may result in u enriched waste brines that are difficult to dispose one aim for drinking water production from groundwater resources is therefore to use water from aquifers where u removal is not needed while many publications focused on the investigation of excessive uranium contaminations in groundwaters from industrial and mining operations gavrilescu et al 2009 and references therein only a few focused on major aquifers that are used for drinking water abstraction where no anthropogenic uranium contamination has occurred thomas et al 1993 nolan and weber 2015 however the sources and fates of uranium in groundwater and during drinking water abstraction are still under discussion e g smidt et al 2011a the complex behavior of u in groundwater systems makes it difficult to understand the occurrence of u in groundwater for non experts such as policy makers and drinking water authorities most of the knowledge on the occurrence of uranium u in groundwater comes from in situ manipulation experiments in the field computational modelling studies or from laboratory analyses where individual processes of u mobilization were studied in isolation e g alam and cheng 2014 bi et al 2013 bone et al 2017 duff and amrhein 1996 finneran et al 2002 fox et al 2006 lesher et al 2013 ranville et al 2007 senko et al 2002 wang et al 2013 the findings are often limited to the specific conditions in the experimental set up for example limited ph range or single soil sample and may therefore not always directly be transferable to a natural aquifer system additionally some processes may be more important than others under natural conditions which cannot always be deduced from experimental studies therefore researcher have recently turned the attention towards larger surveys of natural groundwater systems to refine the picture of u mobility in natural settings and to identify the most important factors controlling the occurrence of u in groundwater e g liesch et al 2015 nolan and weber 2015 burrow et al 2017 in this regard we summarize evidence from on a large geochemical data set to provide a comprehensive view on the occurrence of u in groundwater we like to identify principle mechanisms that result in elevated u concentrations using simple hydrochemical data the chemical parameters used in this study are commonly available such as major ion composition ph dissolved fe and mn these parameters are relatively inexpensive and easy to measure each of these parameters are either directly related to the mobility of u or indirectly indicate processes that mobilize u the results are used to infer simple rules to predict the occurrence of u from basic groundwater chemistry that can be applied to any given aquifer even when u data is not available the rules can be used for an initial risk assessment when planning a drinking water abstraction facility or predicting future changes in u concentrations based on expected changes in groundwater chemistry hydraulic factors such as well construction screen depth and length or position of a well in a given aquifer system may be important but were neglected for the present study because of the uncertainty associated with flow path analysis also land use and geology were not considered but have already been discussed in detail with regard to the present data elsewhere liesch et al 2015 the data set used here is publicly available and consists of more than 8000 groundwater samples data set which have been analyzed for major and minor ion chemistry as well as u concentrations and have previously been used to identify the role of fertilizer inputs on u concentrations liesch et al 2015 2 materials and methods for the present study groundwater data was retrieved on 10 01 2017 from the federal database of the landesanstalt für umwelt messungen und naturschutz baden württemberg lubw germany http jdkgw lubw baden wuerttemberg de servlet is 200 a subset of 2000 samples has been analyzed previously liesch et al 2015 the data set is publically available and includes more than 8000 samples taken at roughly 2000 sampling locations the data is part of a continuous groundwater quality monitoring and covers samples taken between january 2000 and december 2015 most locations were sampled four times with intervals of two to three years some locations were sampled only once or twice so that a small bias towards the more frequently sampled locations may arise when calculating quantiles for example the probability calculations that are used to infer the relation between several hydrochemical parameters and the occurrence of u see methods below are not affected though the data for each sample consist of physicochemical as well as chemical parameters including 8201 uranium measurements using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry plum et al 2008 uranium data is accompanied by several other chemical and physico chemical parameters of which the following parameters were considered for the present analysis ph alkalinity ca mg na fe mn chloride nitrate nitrite sulfate dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved oxygen conductivity and depth to groundwater all parameters were analyzed using iso international organization for standardization standardized methods 2 1 study area the study area has been described in detail previously liesch et al 2015 briefly the study region encompasses an area of 35 752 km2 and consists of a large variety of different hydrogeological settings fig 1 table s1 groundwater samples were taken from a diverse range of geological units including fractured u rich paleozoic rocks a mesozoic series of carbonate and porous sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated cenozoic sediments as a result of the different hydrogeological settings groundwater chemistry shows a large heterogeneity covering i slightly acidic waters with low mineralization in the paleozoic aquifers that mostly consist of igneous mostly granitic and metamorphic rocks ii mildly mineralized waters of the ca hco3 type are localized in mesozoic and quaternary aquifers waters of the ca so4 type as well as na cl rich waters are found in evaporitic triassic rocks locally a mixture may have been sampled when groundwater is in contact with more than one lithology highest uranium concentrations were found in upper and middle triassic hydrogeological units as well as in tertiary and quaternary sediments fig 1 lowest uranium concentrations often below detection limit were found in areas with a palaeozoic crystalline basement or in jurassic shale marl and claystones the hydrochemistry of the groundwater percolating each of the geological units therefore likely plays a role in u mobility uranium concentrations of rain in the study area are 0 005 mg l 1 and are not likely to contribute significantly to the uranium groundwater inventory plum et al 2009 roughly 1 3 of all samples were taken from wells that receive inputs from farmland liesch et al 2015 2 2 analysis of the data this study focuses on the links between geochemistry and the occurrence of uranium in groundwater in contrast to other studies with larger data sets multivariate statistics such as principle component analysis pca were not applied to decipher dependencies between different parameters and u e g smidt et al 2011b liesch et al 2015 while pcas yield valuable information on general linkages between parameters it does not provide quantitative information on the effect of individual parameters on other parameters and may sometimes even lead to delusive results liesch et al 2015 for example conducted a correlation matrix using 19 chemical and physicochemical parameters and found no significant correlation between u and ph this finding is somewhat misleading since ph is undoubtedly central to the mobility of u in the subsurface because of its effect on u speciation echevarria et al 2001 for the present analysis the dependency of u concentrations on each individual chemical parameter was analyzed separately by comparing the probability of u being above a threshold concentration across the range of reported values for a given parameter by doing so non linear relationships such as the ph u relation can easily be identified for this approach any given parameter was analyzed stepwise i e the range of values reported for a single parameter was divided into several equally sized smaller ranges then the probability of u being above a threshold value was calculated for each sub range each data point in figs 2 5 shows the percentage of samples with u concentrations above 1 μg l 1 when at least ten values were available for the calculation if there were less than 10 values available the data point was omitted the nonparametric kruskal wallis test was used to test for differences among data groups test results were evaluated at the 0 01 level of significance odds ratios were calculated following mchugh 2009 a worldwide comparison shows that current guidelines as to which u concentrations are considered to pose acceptable health risk vary substantially the world health organization who considers 30 μg l 1 as safe but a clear no effect concentration has not been definitively derived yet the us epa has adapted this value in europe germany and austria recently launched values of 10 and 15 μg l 1 respectively while most other european countries have no regulations at all because of these variations we chose to base the discussion in this study on a threshold value of 1 μg l 1 though the value is arbitrary it is well above the detection limit of most standard laboratory methods of uranium analysis and allows a statistically sound analysis of the current data set for the calculation of quantiles samples below the limit of detection lod were set to one half the lod assuming a normal distribution of values below the lod in most cases the lod for uranium was 0 5 μg l 1 2 3 characterization of groundwater redox state measurements of redox potential were not available for the current data set to investigate the influence of redox processes on the occurrence of u in groundwater all samples were classified according to a redox framework into oxic manganese nitrate iron and sulfate reducing according to table 1 the framework is based on threshold concentrations of chemical parameters which are indicative for certain redox conditions mcmahon and chapelle 2008 and have previously been used to characterize the redox dependent occurrence of u and other trace elements in groundwater burrow et al 2017 wright and belitz 2010 in reality redox conditions may not always be identified according to the scheme in table 1 due to mixing of groundwaters with different redox states that have not established a new equilibrium during after mixing this may be the case when long well screens are installed in redox stratified aquifers ayotte et al 2011 unfortunately no data on screen depth is available for this study because sulfide was not reported in the present data set iron and sulfate reducing conditions were not further separated the presence of sulfide from sulfate reduction may result in elevated dissolved iron concentrations through reductive dissolution of iron oxides which may lead to interpretation as iron reducing when all sulfide has completely reacted and deposited in the sediment as acid volatile sulfide bethke et al 2008 nitrate reduction has frequently been reported to increase u mobilization in reducing aquifers senko et al 2002 wu et al 2010 however since reduction of nitrate can proceed via different pathways an attempt was made to further subdivide nitrate reduction into the two most prominent pathways in most aquifers heterotrophic and autotrophic nitrate reduction are commonly reported heterotrophic reduction of nitrate is presumed to be the most common nitrate removal pathway in groundwater tiedje 1988 denitrifying microorganisms utilize organic carbon as the electron source resulting in an increase in alkalinity in groundwater the stoichiometry of the terminal process follows the chemical reaction 1 5 ch 2 o 4 no 3 2 n 2 4 hco 3 h 2 co 3 2 h 2 o although organic matter is present in almost all sediments some aquifers have shown to be dominated by autotrophic rather than heterotrophic reduction of nitrate via the reaction with inorganic sulfur e g tesoriero et al 2000 in this case the electron source are minerals containing reduced sulfur such as pyrite the process releases dissolved iron and sulfate as a result of pyrite oxidation according to the stoichiometric relation 2 5 fes 2 14 no 3 4 h 5 fe 2 7 n 2 10 so 4 2 2 h 2 o the presence of dissolved iron was therefore used to separate heterotrophic nitrate reduction from autotrophic nitrate reduction table 1 however the identification of autotrophic nitrate reduction is somewhat limited because iron may be further oxidized via the reaction 3 5 fe 2 no 3 7 h 2 o 5 feooh 0 5 n 2 9 h accordingly samples where iron has been precipitated as hydroxides will not be classified correctly likely resulting in an underestimation of autotrophic nitrate reduction in the present data set dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia may also occur in natural settings but is relatively unimportant accounting for less than 10 of nitrate conversion in soils tiedje 1988 and groundwater mcmahon and chapelle 2008 and was therefore not considered in this study an attempt to further characterize samples that did fall into one of the above defined categories has not been made 3 results the mean and median u concentrations of all samples are 1 4 μg l 1 and 0 8 μg l 1 respectively a total of 2664 samples or 32 had no detectable u concentrations 95 of all samples had u concentrations below 4 8 μg l 1 strongly elevated u concentrations of more than 10 μg l 1 were observed in 122 or 1 4 samples a distribution of the reported values is presented in fig s1 sorting the samples with respect to redox processes reveals that the occurrence of u is strongly coupled with the redox conditions prevailing in an aquifer fig 2 6653 81 of 8201 samples could be assigned to one of the five categories oxic manganese nitrate heterotrophic and autotrophic and iron sulfate reducing the rest of the samples did not fall into a specific category or could be characterized as mixed oxic groundwater was most common n 5844 followed by fe so4 reducing groundwater n 356 highest uranium concentrations were observed under manganese mean and median are 2 8 and 1 3 μg u l 1 respectively n 298 and nitrate reducing conditions notably groundwaters characterized as being dominated by either heterotrophic mean median 2 4 μg u l 1 1 2 μg u l 1 n 91 or autotrophic nitrate reduction mean median 2 2 μg u l 1 1 7 μg u l 1 n 78 show very similar u concentrations iron sulfate reducing groundwater shows very low uranium concentrations about 66 of all samples characterized as being iron sulfate reducing had uranium concentrations of below 1 μg l 1 in many cases being below the detection limit oxic groundwater with concentrations of dissolved oxygen above 0 1 mg l 1 shows uranium concentrations mostly below 3 μg l 1 with a mean and median of 1 3 μg l 1 and 0 8 μg l 1 respectively this is also evident when looking at the occurrence of u solely as a function of oxygen concentration in the complete data set fig s2 oxygen concentrations below 5 mg l 1 are associated with a higher probability of encountering u 1 μg l 1 there is a clear trend in the data set of higher electric conductivities being associated with higher probabilities of u being above 1 μg l 1 fig 3 this relation is also evident under iron and sulfate reducing conditions although the probability for u 1 μg l 1 is lower the occurrence of uranium is further dependent on ph and the presence of complexing agents such as bicarbonate which is shown in fig 4 in acidic groundwater with ph 6 the probability of encountering u concentrations above 1 μg 1 is very low 1 the occurrence of uranium above 1 μg l 1 is mostly associated with ph values above 6 the highest frequency is observed at a ph of around 7 with increasing alkalinity the probability of detecting u concentrations above 1 μg l 1 increases almost linearly for the data set used suggesting that carbonate chemistry plays a major role in controlling the occurrence of u in groundwater in the study area groundwater exhibiting an alkalinity of 6 mmol per litre or above show a probability of greater than 50 of showing u concentrations above 1 μg l 1 conversely to the observed trends with electric conductivity the probabilities are about 54 lower under iron and sulfate reducing conditions other geochemical parameters showing a positive relation to uranium concentrations are ca nitrate and dissolved organic carbon fig 5 with increasing ca concentrations the probability of detecting u above 1 μg l 1 increases as well this observation shows some similarity to the uranium alkalinity relationship further uranium concentrations above 1 μg l 1 are more frequent in groundwater with higher nitrate levels a possible relation to doc concentrations is also indicated by the data higher doc concentrations appear to occur with a higher likelihood of u being above 1 μg l 1 however the relationship is relatively weak i e the likelihood only increases from 40 to 55 across the entire range of doc concentrations 0 5 6 mg l 1 depth to water table appears to have some influence on the occurrence of uranium in groundwater fig 5 at a water table of less than 30 m below surface the chance for u above 1 μg l 1 is roughly 50 when the water table is deeper than 30 m below surface the chance decreases markedly 4 discussion 4 1 uranium from weathering of bedrock and the role of carbonate chemistry for uranium mobility in groundwater uranium may be present as the result of natural weathering geogenic background anthropogenic inputs and natural processes that lead to elevated u mobilization in the subsurface the potential for u mobilization from weathering under oxic conditions can be estimated when looking at the u concentrations in surface waters a number of regional geochemical mappings conducted in the last decades have shown that rivers and streams in the study area exhibit u concentrations ranging from 0 01 μg l 1 to approx 5 μg l 1 birke et al 2015 the observed concentration range in groundwater fig s1 is therefore mostly comparable to the range observed in surface waters in this region which contrasts findings of other studies burrow et al 2017 jurgens et al 2009 when electric conductivity ec is used as a proxy for mineral weathering the influence of weathering is reflected by the relation between ec and u concentrations in groundwater fig 3 therefore a natural source of u can most likely be expected in the investigated groundwater in fact the observed relation between ec and u shows that u accumulates in groundwater mostly as a function of weathering even in nitrate and manganese reducing groundwater this is also reflected in the observation that lower oxygen concentrations and thus higher oxygen consumption are associated with a higher probability for u concentrations above 1 μg l 1 fig s2 only under iron and sulfate reducing conditions the relation between mineralization and u is less pronounced fig 3 consequently the highly mineralized groundwaters that are found in regions with quaternary and tertiary sediments often exhibit detectable u concentrations while groundwater of low mineralization predominantly regions with palaeozoic and jurassic rocks rarely shows u concentrations above the limit of detection fig 1 yet it has to be noted that aquifers beneath farmland may receive additional inputs of nutrients from the application of mineral fertilizers which may increase ec as well however ec is also strongly linked to chloride concentrations chloride may result from different sources for example the dissolution of halite which is present in some of the sampled aquifers e g middle triassic evaporates in urban and rural areas chloride concentrations may additionally be affected by application of road salts for deicing purposes road salt application has led to a substantial increase in groundwater chloride concentrations in recent decades kelly 2008 the intrusion of deeper saline waters into shallow aquifers is unknown in this area but cannot completely be excluded and may also lead to elevated chloride concentrations most groundwaters in the study area are of the ca hco3 type and mineral surfaces are in equilibrium with ca and mg ions when nacl rich waters are introduced ca and mg ions are exchanged leading to a decrease in na cl ratio in solution thereby shifting the groundwater towards a ca cl type kim and koretsky 2013 shanley 1994 since the uranyl ion sorbs to mineral surfaces increases of sodium chloride concentrations in an aquifer may similarly enhance u concentrations in solution through cation exchange ion exchange induced by road salt for example is known to mobilize heavy metals and radium from soil and ground water jones et al 1992 mcnaboe et al 2017 ramakrishna and viraraghavan 2005 but has not been reported for u yet whether this process occurs or not can be tested when comparing the occurrence of u with the exchanged sodium naex naex can be calculated as the molar difference between chloride and sodium assuming that chloride behaves conservatively in the subsurface and has no other sources than halite dissolution molar na cl ratio of 1 1 fig 6 indicates that samples with a higher rate of naex tend to show a higher probability of u being above 1 μg l 1 thus excessive input of salts into aquifers may play an important yet unrecognized role for u mobilization although the here discussed relation between naex and u does not provide direct evidence for u mobilization from ion exchange by itself the data suggests that nacl concentrations have an effect on u mobilization and may have to be considered for example in areas such as in urban settings where road salt is used for deicing purposes the strong relation between the occurrence of u in groundwater and ph as well as alkalinity further suggests that weathering of carbonates plays a crucial role in governing uranium mobility in the aquatic environment under aerobic conditions in natural waters u vi exists predominantly as the uranyl ion uo2 2 at ph 5 0 but forms various ternary complexes with hydroxyl and carbonate at ph 5 grenthe et al 1992 the presence of bicarbonate from calcite dissolution as a potential ligand limits adsorption to mineral surfaces dong et al 2005 duff and amrhein 1996 ma et al 2014 because ph controls the formation of u co3 complexes sorption of u to soil decreases with increasing ph echevarria et al 2001 even under iron and sulfate reducing conditions the presence of bicarbonate increases the probability of finding u above 1 μg l 1 likely due to the stability of u co3 complexes zhou and gu 2005 as a result groundwater samples taken from the regions with crystalline basement have very low u concentrations likely because weathering of these rocks i e granite results in weakly buffered acidic soils in which u is hardly mobile fig 1 previous works in rivers and streams pointed out that the presence of bicarbonate is more important when predicting uranium concentrations than the content of uranium in catchment bedrock mangini et al 1979 in addition it was shown recently that irrigation with bicarbonate rich waters leads to an enhanced mobilization of uranium from soils to groundwater suggesting that arid regions are even more at risk of high u concentrations when bicarbonate rich groundwater is used for irrigation burrow et al 2017 thus inorganic complexation of the uranyl ion especially with co3 2 is central to the mobility of u in groundwater in this respect the role of liming practices on arable land needs to be explored in more detail liming is conducted on farmland to raise soil ph and increase the exchangeable divalent cation capacity of agriculturally used soils when carbonate is used it can be expected that the increase in alkalinity in the soil waters may increase the leaching of uranium from soils via carbonate complexation duff and amrhein 1996 mason et al 1997 zhou and gu 2005 besides the often discussed input of u with phosphate fertilizers this may therefore be another explanation why the occurrence of uranium is often associated with farmland 4 2 biogeochemical aspects of uranium mobility in the subsurface microbial activity and the associated redox conditions play a key role in the fate of u in the environment manganese and nitrate reducing groundwaters appeared to have the highest probabilities of showing u concentrations above 1 μg l 1 when the groundwater was characterized as manganese reducing up to 11 μg l 1 of u were observed which is well above the concentrations found in surface waters in this region birke et al 2015 when mn oxides are close to reduced u species a mobilization of u vi has been observed via the reduction of manganese to mn ii wang et al 2013 in some aquifers this may explain why dissolved mn and u are observed simultaneously in low oxygen environments the occurrence of nitrate reduction also seems to be a possible predictor for elevated u concentrations in an aquifer several causes can explain this observation the conversion of nitrate to n2 via the heterotrophic reduction pathway eq 1 involves the production of several intermediate nitrogen species tiedje 1988 some of these species such as nitrite are highly reactive towards u iv and can mobilize u in groundwater quickly via oxidative dissolution senko et al 2002 wu et al 2010 indeed the presence of nitrite in groundwater was also associated with high u concentrations similar to nitrate reducing groundwater fig s3 while samples with no detectable nitrite showed lower u concentrations thus the presence of reactive intermediates of heterotrophic nitrate reduction may be a good predictor for elevated u concentrations in groundwater microbial oxidation of pyrite using nitrate has been observed at the oxic anoxic interface in sandy aquifers where nitrate is introduced at the surface from extensive agriculture and is transported into formerly reducing parts of an aquifer jorgensen et al 2009 the process is accompanied by an increase in sulfate concentrations eq 2 which is also reflected in the regional data set used here i e the high sulfate concentrations are observed in samples where nitrate reduction coupled to pyrite oxidation is observed fig s4 reactions of u vi with pyrite lead to a reduction to u iv and subsequent immobilization of uranium pyrite therefore acts as a natural sink for u vi bruggeman and maes 2010 janot et al 2016 and its consumption with nitrate may result in elevated u concentrations in addition minerals containing reduced sulfur such as pyrite and mackinawite effectively inhibit u re oxidation through scavenging oxidants such as oxygen or nitrate finneran et al 2002 bi et al 2013 consequently a progressive oxidation of such minerals via nitrate consumption has been proposed to be a reason for elevated u concentrations in groundwater for example at the oxic nitrate reducing boundary when pyrite is present van berk and fu 2017 changes of the natural groundwater redox state for example through excessive fertilizer inputs can therefore easily result in elevated u concentrations in summary heterotrophic as well as autotrophic nitrate reduction can both be responsible for elevated uranium concentrations in low oxygen groundwater the simple presence of nitrate in groundwater does not necessarily correspond to elevated u concentrations lowest u concentrations were observed in groundwater characterized by iron and sulfate reducing conditions the occurrence of low u concentrations under iron reducing conditions is best explained by the overlapping redox potentials of the two redox couples of u iv vi and fe ii iii stewart et al 2011 the presence of dissolved fe ii is therefore often associated with low u concentrations and vice versa fig s6 laboratory experiments and field investigations have shown that fe iii reducing bacteria and some sulfate reducing bacteria are capable of reducing soluble u vi to insoluble u iv therefore immobilizing dissolved uranium in aquifers e g lovley et al 1991 lovley and phillips 1992 the maintenance of strongly reducing conditions is therefore one option when dealing with u contaminated soil or groundwater e g gavrilescu et al 2009 since iron and sulfate reducing groundwater is a sink for u janot et al 2016 introduction of oxygen or nitrate may lead to a substantial remobilization of u moon et al 2009 which needs to be considered in catchments with intense agricultural activity 4 3 depth to groundwater aquifers underneath soils with stagnant water tend to be low in oxygen the reducing conditions in saturated gleyic soils for example result from the slow resupply of oxygen during organic matter decomposition because diffusion of o2 is limited in saturated soils groundwater recharged in areas with hydromorphic soils are therefore usually reducing in the present data set reducing conditions are generally associated with a low depth to water table while the probability of oxic groundwater increases with an increase in depth to groundwater fig s5 since reducing conditions may either result in high nitrate and manganese reducing or low iron and sulftate reducing u concentrations depth to water table is not a good predictor for u concentrations in groundwater 4 4 uranium calcium relation the increasing abundance of uranium above 1 μg l 1 with increasing ca concentrations can be attributed to at least three different processes first the presence of ca promotes the formation of ca u vi co3 complexes that are more resistant to reduction than other soluble uranium species thereby stabilizing soluble uranium in reducing groundwater brooks et al 2003 stewart et al 2011 this is reflected by the fact that there was no difference between the total dataset and iron and sulfate reducing groundwaters fig 5a second a relation between u and ca may occur because both elements originate from the same source material in many aquifers e g carbonate minerals calcite especially biogenic calcite is known to contain various amounts of uranium kelly et al 2006 for example calcifying marine organisms such as coccolithophores are known to take up u within the crystal structure during growth russell et al 1994 marine deposits including the remains of calcareous organisms may therefore also be a source of u upon chemical weathering when the respective groundwater is undersaturated with respect to calcite third the presence of ca2 in solution can decrease u vi sorption on mineral surfaces under conditions at which the cauo2 co3 3 2 and ca2uo2 co3 3 0 species dominate u vi aqueous speciation dong et al 2005 fox et al 2006 in combination with the role of carbonate discussed above it appears that regions where the caco3 present in soil or bedrock dissolves are likely to exhibit detectable u concentrations 4 5 uranium dissolved organic matter dom interactions the data present in fig 5 shows some effect of doc on uranium in a system with dissolved organic matter and u vi uranium dom complexes are likely to form depending on solution ph redox and concentrations of other ligands cumberland et al 2016 moulin and moulin 1995 the presence of dom may even enhance mobility of u which has been shown in soil column experiments lesher et al 2013 it may also reduce the proportion of u reduced by pyrite under anoxic conditions bruggeman and maes 2010 however because of the stronger stability of the carbonate complex doc u complexes are only of secondary importance under the conditions found in most aquifers ranville et al 2007 trenfield et al 2011 the presence of doc concentrations may also reflect enzymatic degradation of sedimentary organic matter in soils u may be sorbed to organic matter zhou and gu 2005 bone et al 2017 if this pool of organic matter is microbially degraded the adsorbed u may be released into solution if elevated u concentrations are due to organic matter degradation the process requires that u has been accumulated with the organic matter prior to degradation which may be the case in anoxic peatlands for example banning et al 2013 binding of u to dom offers coagulation of dom with metal salts as a treatment option when u concentrations exceed quality standards 4 6 the possible role for nitrate and phosphate fertilizers on the occurrence of uranium in groundwater the co occurence of u and nitrate in many shallow wells across the usa poses questions about the role of fertilizer derived nitrate in mobilizing geogenic u nolan and weber 2015 indeed nitrate may influence the occurrence of uranium in groundwater for multiple reasons as discussed in section 4 2 however the co occurrence of nitrate and uranium may also be partly be explained by the use of phosphate fertilizer in addition to nitrate fertilizers indeed elevated u concentrations in german and polish rivers and streams have been attributed to intense agricultural activity on loess soils in the respective catchments birke et al 2009 skwarzec et al 2010 loess soils are well buffered aeolian deposits with various carbonate content which favor u mobility as discussed above the source of u in these soils however is suspected to be phosphate fertilizer schnug and lottermoser 2013 artificial fertilizers may contain up to 206 mg kg 1 u smidt et al 2011b which accumulates in the top soil a long term fertilizer experiment showed an enrichment of 0 09 mg kg 1 u in the topsoil after application of mineral fertilizer in contrast to a significant enrichment when stall mist was applied rogasik et al 2008 however contrasting results are reported regarding the mobilization of fertilizer derived u in soils while zielinski et al 2006 found that fertilized soils show a higher potential for u mobilization takeda et al 2006 found that almost all u applied by fertilizer had accumulated in the surface horizon of an agricultural soil following the application of fertilizer for 61 years an influence of phosphate fertilizers on the occurrence of u in groundwater of the present data set was recently identified albeit being relatively small liesch et al 2015 therefore the role of artificial fertilizers as potential inputs of u to the environment remains to be a matter of discussion in summary current evidence suggests that applications of u containing fertilizer to soils may have variable effects on the occurrence of uranium in groundwater below arable land which need to be evaluated from case to case 5 conclusions despite numerous research efforts a single mechanism has not been identified yet that explains the occurrence of u in groundwater and it is likely that no such mechanism will be found in the future given the complex geochemistry of uranium thus in case of elevated u concentrations it will be necessary for water suppliers to investigate geology and hydrochemistry of an aquifer thoroughly the results of this study provide some general rules that help to manage aquifers that are used as a drinking water resource a simplified form of the study results is presented in table 2 each of the values given indicates a threshold when u concentrations exceed 1 μg l 1 at a probability higher than 50 the odds ratios indicate that u concentrations above 1 μg l 1 are more likely to occur when the threshold value for a certain parameter is exceeded for example samples with ca concentrations above 200 mg l 1 had u concentrations above 1 μg l 1 4 7 times more often than samples with ca concentrations below 200 mg l 1 table 2 may therefore be considered as a first approach to a chemical risk assessment in summary the following rules and management options for natural groundwater not affected by mining operations or industrial contamination can be inferred from this study 1 in many cases the presence of u is simply the result of weathering of u bearing minerals as well as desorption from mineral surfaces in concert with weathering of carbonate minerals which increase solubility of u vi thus as long as waters are oxic enough to support u accumulation from mineral weathering uranium concentrations will increase in groundwater 2 competition of the carbonate uranyl ion with anions such as chloride nitrate and carbonate will increase the solubility of u thus in the initial stages of a risk assessment anthropogenic activities that lead to increasing inputs of chloride nitrate and carbonate into an aquifer need to be monitored potentially important activities with respect to u mobilization are irrigation practices that increase alkalinity or ionic strength in the subsurface fertilizer additions to arable land and road salt applications 3 introduction of dissolved oxygen or nitrate into formerly iron and sulfate reducing parts of an aquifer may lead to a substantial increase in u concentrations at the redox interface where reduced u species are mobilized via oxidative dissolution or desorption thus lowering of groundwater table and or excessive application of no3 fertilizer on farmland may result in extensive u mobilization in anoxic ground waters a description of the prevailing redox conditions within an aquifer in combination with an analysis of land use will help to elucidate if u can be expected to be mobile or not if the aquifer is anoxic the use of fertilizers within the catchment may have to be regulated to reduce the risk of nitrate dependent u mobilization 4 when u is already above quality standards changes in well operation may help to reduce u concentrations since elevated u concentrations may be centered around a redox interface in an aquifer or in highly alkaline zones it can be advantageous to install an additional well casing at the depth of the interface or pump water from deeper or shallower parts of the aquifer where different redox conditions and thus lower u concentrations can be expected acknowledgments we thank the landesanstalt für umwelt messungen und naturschutz baden württemberg lubw for providing the hydrochemical data wolfgang feuerstein of lubw

19826,most of the knowledge on the occurrence of uranium u in groundwater comes from in situ manipulation experiments in the field computational modelling studies or from laboratory analyses where individual processes of u mobilization were studied in isolation because of uranium s vital redox chemistry it interacts often simultaneously with many other element cycles e g sulfur carbon iron and manganese making it difficult to predict u concentrations in natural environments for the present study a large data set was analyzed to predict the occurrence of u in groundwater from basic hydrochemistry the data set consists of more than 8000 chemical groundwater analyses including uranium concentrations from more than 2000 sampling locations a strong relation between u concentrations and electric conductivity as well as alkalinity was observed suggesting that weathering of geogenic source material and desorption from mineral surfaces is the principle mechanism of u release except for aquifers with strongly reducing conditions this process leads to a slow but continuous accumulation of u in groundwater in most cases importantly the occurrence of u is modulated by the prevailing redox conditions in an aquifer uranium concentrations were moderate under oxic conditions and highest under manganese and nitrate reducing conditions heterotrophic as wells as autotrophic nitrate reduction only in iron and sulfate reducing groundwater the probability of u concentrations above 1 μg l 1 was virtually zero as these ground waters act as u sinks the combination of mineral weathering especially carbonates with mobilization of u under manganese and nitrate reducing conditions results in the highest risk of detecting u in contrast a low risk is associated with low ph 7 and low mineralization of groundwater which is the case in granitic catchments for example our results further provide evidence that agricultural practices such as liming use of fertilizers and irrigation influence the occurrence of u in groundwater in multiple ways accurate management of aquifers underlying farmland will therefore become more and more important in the future in summary we find that the vulnerability of an aquifer to elevated u concentrations cannot be explained by a single factor this complicates efforts to target elevated u concentrations in groundwaters that are abstracted for drinking water production keywords uranium groundwater drinking water geochemistry 1 introduction uranium is an element of considerable interest for drinking water suppliers in recent years it has attracted some media attention and emerged as a contaminant of broader interest that is critically recognized in the public since u removal from drinking water is costly and may result in u enriched waste brines that are difficult to dispose one aim for drinking water production from groundwater resources is therefore to use water from aquifers where u removal is not needed while many publications focused on the investigation of excessive uranium contaminations in groundwaters from industrial and mining operations gavrilescu et al 2009 and references therein only a few focused on major aquifers that are used for drinking water abstraction where no anthropogenic uranium contamination has occurred thomas et al 1993 nolan and weber 2015 however the sources and fates of uranium in groundwater and during drinking water abstraction are still under discussion e g smidt et al 2011a the complex behavior of u in groundwater systems makes it difficult to understand the occurrence of u in groundwater for non experts such as policy makers and drinking water authorities most of the knowledge on the occurrence of uranium u in groundwater comes from in situ manipulation experiments in the field computational modelling studies or from laboratory analyses where individual processes of u mobilization were studied in isolation e g alam and cheng 2014 bi et al 2013 bone et al 2017 duff and amrhein 1996 finneran et al 2002 fox et al 2006 lesher et al 2013 ranville et al 2007 senko et al 2002 wang et al 2013 the findings are often limited to the specific conditions in the experimental set up for example limited ph range or single soil sample and may therefore not always directly be transferable to a natural aquifer system additionally some processes may be more important than others under natural conditions which cannot always be deduced from experimental studies therefore researcher have recently turned the attention towards larger surveys of natural groundwater systems to refine the picture of u mobility in natural settings and to identify the most important factors controlling the occurrence of u in groundwater e g liesch et al 2015 nolan and weber 2015 burrow et al 2017 in this regard we summarize evidence from on a large geochemical data set to provide a comprehensive view on the occurrence of u in groundwater we like to identify principle mechanisms that result in elevated u concentrations using simple hydrochemical data the chemical parameters used in this study are commonly available such as major ion composition ph dissolved fe and mn these parameters are relatively inexpensive and easy to measure each of these parameters are either directly related to the mobility of u or indirectly indicate processes that mobilize u the results are used to infer simple rules to predict the occurrence of u from basic groundwater chemistry that can be applied to any given aquifer even when u data is not available the rules can be used for an initial risk assessment when planning a drinking water abstraction facility or predicting future changes in u concentrations based on expected changes in groundwater chemistry hydraulic factors such as well construction screen depth and length or position of a well in a given aquifer system may be important but were neglected for the present study because of the uncertainty associated with flow path analysis also land use and geology were not considered but have already been discussed in detail with regard to the present data elsewhere liesch et al 2015 the data set used here is publicly available and consists of more than 8000 groundwater samples data set which have been analyzed for major and minor ion chemistry as well as u concentrations and have previously been used to identify the role of fertilizer inputs on u concentrations liesch et al 2015 2 materials and methods for the present study groundwater data was retrieved on 10 01 2017 from the federal database of the landesanstalt für umwelt messungen und naturschutz baden württemberg lubw germany http jdkgw lubw baden wuerttemberg de servlet is 200 a subset of 2000 samples has been analyzed previously liesch et al 2015 the data set is publically available and includes more than 8000 samples taken at roughly 2000 sampling locations the data is part of a continuous groundwater quality monitoring and covers samples taken between january 2000 and december 2015 most locations were sampled four times with intervals of two to three years some locations were sampled only once or twice so that a small bias towards the more frequently sampled locations may arise when calculating quantiles for example the probability calculations that are used to infer the relation between several hydrochemical parameters and the occurrence of u see methods below are not affected though the data for each sample consist of physicochemical as well as chemical parameters including 8201 uranium measurements using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry plum et al 2008 uranium data is accompanied by several other chemical and physico chemical parameters of which the following parameters were considered for the present analysis ph alkalinity ca mg na fe mn chloride nitrate nitrite sulfate dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved oxygen conductivity and depth to groundwater all parameters were analyzed

encompasses an area of 35 752 km2 and consists of a large variety of different hydrogeological settings fig 1 table s1 groundwater samples were taken from a diverse range of geological units including fractured u rich paleozoic rocks a mesozoic series of carbonate and porous sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated cenozoic sediments as a result of the different hydrogeological settings groundwater chemistry shows a large heterogeneity covering i slightly acidic waters with low mineralization in the paleozoic aquifers that mostly consist of igneous mostly granitic and metamorphic rocks ii mildly mineralized waters of the ca hco3 type are localized in mesozoic and quaternary aquifers waters of the ca so4 type as well as na cl rich waters are found in evaporitic triassic rocks locally a mixture may have been sampled when groundwater is in contact with more than one lithology highest uranium concentrations were found in upper and middle triassic hydrogeological units as well as in tertiary and quaternary sediments fig 1 lowest uranium concentrations often below detection limit were found in areas with a palaeozoic crystalline basement or in jurassic shale marl and claystones the hydrochemistry of the groundwater percolating each of the geological units therefore likely plays a role in u mobility uranium concentrations of rain in the study area are 0 005 mg l 1 and are not likely to contribute significantly to the uranium groundwater inventory plum et al 2009 roughly 1 3 of all samples were taken from wells that receive inputs from farmland liesch et al 2015 2 2 analysis of the data this study focuses on the links between geochemistry and the occurrence of uranium in groundwater in contrast to other studies with larger data sets multivariate statistics such as principle component analysis pca were not applied to decipher dependencies between different parameters and u e g smidt et al 2011b liesch et al 2015 while pcas yield valuable information on general linkages between parameters it does not provide quantitative information on the effect of individual parameters on other parameters and may sometimes even lead to delusive results liesch et al 2015 for example conducted a correlation matrix using 19 chemical and physicochemical parameters and found no significant correlation between u and ph this finding is somewhat misleading since ph is undoubtedly central to the mobility of u in the subsurface because of its effect on u speciation echevarria et al 2001 for the present analysis the dependency of u concentrations on each individual chemical parameter was analyzed separately by comparing the probability of u being above a threshold concentration across the range of reported values for a given parameter by doing so non linear relationships such as the ph u relation can easily be identified for this approach any given parameter was analyzed stepwise i e the range of values reported for a single parameter was divided into several equally sized smaller ranges then the probability of u being above a threshold value was calculated for each sub range each data point in figs 2 5 shows the percentage of samples with u concentrations above 1 μg l 1 when at least ten values were available for the calculation if there were less than 10 values available the data point was omitted the nonparametric kruskal wallis test was used to test for differences among data groups test results were evaluated at the 0 01 level of significance odds ratios were calculated following mchugh 2009 a worldwide comparison shows that current guidelines as to which u concentrations are considered to pose acceptable health risk vary substantially the world health organization who considers 30 μg l 1 as safe but a clear no effect concentration has not been definitively derived yet the us epa has adapted this value in europe germany and austria recently launched values of 10 and 15 μg l 1 respectively while most other european countries have no regulations at all because of these variations we chose to base the discussion in this study on a threshold value of 1 μg l 1 though the value is arbitrary it is well above the detection limit of most standard laboratory methods of uranium analysis and allows a statistically sound analysis of the current data set for the calculation of quantiles samples below the limit of detection lod were set to one half the lod assuming a normal distribution of values below the lod in most cases the lod for uranium was 0 5 μg l 1 2 3 characterization of groundwater redox state measurements of redox potential were not available for the current data set to investigate the influence of redox processes on the occurrence of u in groundwater all samples were classified according to a redox framework into oxic manganese nitrate iron and sulfate reducing according to table 1 the framework is based on threshold concentrations of chemical parameters which are indicative for certain redox conditions mcmahon and chapelle 2008 and have previously been used to characterize the redox dependent occurrence of u and other trace elements in groundwater burrow et al 2017 wright and belitz 2010 in reality redox conditions may not always be identified according to the scheme in table 1 due to mixing of groundwaters with different redox states that have not established a new equilibrium during after mixing this may be the case when long well screens are installed in redox stratified aquifers ayotte et al 2011 unfortunately no data on screen depth is available for this study because sulfide was not reported in the present data set iron and sulfate reducing conditions were not further separated the presence of sulfide from sulfate reduction may result in elevated dissolved iron concentrations through reductive dissolution of iron oxides which may lead to interpretation as iron reducing when all sulfide has completely reacted and deposited in the sediment as acid volatile sulfide bethke et al 2008 nitrate reduction has frequently been reported to increase u mobilization in reducing aquifers senko et al 2002 wu et al 2010 however since reduction of nitrate can proceed via different pathways an attempt was made to further subdivide nitrate reduction into the two most prominent pathways in most aquifers heterotrophic and autotrophic nitrate reduction are commonly reported heterotrophic reduction of nitrate is presumed to be the most common nitrate removal pathway in groundwater tiedje 1988 denitrifying microorganisms utilize organic carbon as the electron source resulting in an increase in alkalinity in groundwater the stoichiometry of the terminal process follows the chemical reaction 1 5 ch 2 o 4 no 3 2 n 2 4 hco 3 h 2 co 3 2 h 2 o although organic matter is present in almost all sediments some aquifers have shown to be dominated by autotrophic rather than heterotrophic reduction of nitrate via the reaction with inorganic sulfur e g tesoriero et al 2000 in this case the electron source are minerals containing reduced sulfur such as pyrite the process releases dissolved iron and sulfate as a result of pyrite oxidation according to the stoichiometric relation 2 5 fes 2 14 no 3 4 h 5 fe 2 7 n 2 10 so 4 2 2 h 2 o the presence of dissolved iron was therefore used to separate heterotrophic nitrate reduction from autotrophic nitrate reduction table 1 however the identification of autotrophic nitrate reduction is somewhat limited because iron may be further oxidized via the reaction 3 5 fe 2 no 3 7 h 2 o 5 feooh 0 5 n 2 9 h accordingly samples where iron has been precipitated as hydroxides will not be classified correctly likely resulting in an underestimation of autotrophic nitrate reduction in the present data set dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia may also occur in natural settings but is relatively unimportant accounting for less than 10 of nitrate conversion in soils tiedje 1988 and groundwater mcmahon and chapelle 2008 and was therefore not considered in this study an attempt to further characterize samples that did fall into one of the above defined categories has not been made 3 results the mean and median u concentrations of all samples are 1 4 μg l 1 and 0 8 μg l 1 respectively a total of 2664 samples or 32 had no detectable u concentrations 95 of all samples had u concentrations below 4 8 μg l 1 strongly elevated u concentrations of more than 10 μg l 1 were observed in 122 or 1 4 samples a distribution of the reported values is presented in fig s1 sorting the samples with respect to redox processes reveals that the occurrence of u is strongly coupled with the redox conditions prevailing in an aquifer fig 2 6653 81 of 8201 samples could be assigned to one of the five categories oxic manganese nitrate heterotrophic and autotrophic and iron sulfate reducing the rest of the samples did not fall into a specific category or could be characterized as mixed oxic groundwater was most common n 5844 followed by fe so4 reducing groundwater n 356 highest uranium concentrations were observed under manganese mean and median are 2 8 and 1 3 μg u l 1 respectively n 298 and nitrate reducing conditions notably groundwaters characterized as being dominated by either heterotrophic mean median 2 4 μg u l 1 1 2 μg u l 1 n 91 or autotrophic nitrate reduction mean median 2 2 μg u l 1 1 7 μg u l 1 n 78 show very similar u concentrations iron sulfate reducing groundwater shows very low uranium concentrations about 66 of all samples characterized as being iron sulfate reducing had uranium concentrations of below 1 μg l 1 in many cases being below the detection limit oxic groundwater with concentrations of dissolved oxygen above 0 1 mg l 1 shows uranium concentrations mostly below 3 μg l 1 with a mean and median of 1 3 μg l 1 and 0 8 μg l 1 respectively this is also evident when looking at the occurrence of u solely as a function of oxygen concentration in the complete data set fig s2 oxygen concentrations below 5 mg l 1 are associated with a higher probability of encountering u 1 μg l 1 there is a clear trend in the data set of higher electric conductivities being associated with higher probabilities of u being above 1 μg l 1 fig 3 this relation is also evident under iron and sulfate reducing conditions although the probability for u 1 μg l 1 is lower the occurrence of uranium is further dependent on ph and the presence of complexing agents such as bicarbonate which is shown in fig 4 in acidic groundwater with ph 6 the probability of encountering u concentrations above 1 μg 1 is very low 1 the occurrence of uranium above 1 μg l 1 is mostly associated with ph values above 6 the highest frequency is observed at a ph of around 7 with increasing alkalinity the probability of detecting u concentrations above 1 μg l 1 increases almost linearly for the data set used suggesting that carbonate chemistry plays a major role in controlling the occurrence of u in groundwater in the study area groundwater exhibiting an alkalinity of 6 mmol per litre or above show a probability of greater than 50 of showing u concentrations above 1 μg l 1 conversely to the observed trends with electric conductivity the probabilities are about 54 lower under iron and sulfate reducing conditions other geochemical parameters showing a positive relation to uranium concentrations are ca nitrate and dissolved organic carbon fig 5 with increasing ca concentrations the probability of detecting u above 1 μg l 1 increases as well this observation shows some similarity to the uranium alkalinity relationship further uranium concentrations above 1 μg l 1 are more frequent in groundwater with higher nitrate levels a possible relation to doc concentrations is also indicated by the data higher doc concentrations appear to occur with a higher likelihood of u being above 1 μg l 1 however the relationship is relatively weak i e the likelihood only increases from 40 to 55 across the entire range of doc concentrations 0 5 6 mg l 1 depth to water table appears to have some influence on the occurrence of uranium in groundwater fig 5 at a water table of less than 30 m below surface the chance for u above 1 μg l 1 is roughly 50 when the water table is deeper than 30 m below surface the chance decreases markedly 4 discussion 4 1 uranium from weathering of bedrock and the role of carbonate chemistry for uranium mobility in groundwater uranium may be present as the result of natural weathering geogenic background anthropogenic inputs and natural processes that lead to elevated u mobilization in the subsurface the potential for u mobilization from weathering under oxic conditions can be estimated when looking at the u concentrations in surface waters a number of regional geochemical mappings conducted in the last decades have shown that rivers and streams in the study area exhibit u concentrations ranging from 0 01 μg l 1 to approx 5 μg l 1 birke et al 2015 the observed concentration range in groundwater fig s1 is therefore mostly comparable to the range observed in surface waters in this region which contrasts findings of other studies burrow et al 2017 jurgens et al 2009 when electric conductivity ec is used as a proxy for mineral weathering the influence of weathering is reflected by the relation between ec and u concentrations in groundwater fig 3 therefore a natural source of u can most likely be expected in the investigated groundwater in fact the observed relation between ec and u shows that u accumulates in groundwater mostly as a function of weathering even in nitrate and manganese reducing groundwater this is also reflected in the observation that lower oxygen concentrations and thus higher oxygen consumption are associated with a higher probability for u concentrations above 1 μg l 1 fig s2 only under iron and sulfate reducing conditions the relation between mineralization and u is less pronounced fig 3 consequently the highly mineralized groundwaters that are found in regions with quaternary and tertiary sediments often exhibit detectable u concentrations while groundwater of low mineralization predominantly regions with palaeozoic and jurassic rocks rarely shows u concentrations above the limit of detection fig 1 yet it has to be noted that aquifers beneath farmland may receive additional inputs of nutrients from the application of mineral fertilizers which may increase ec as well however ec is also strongly linked to chloride concentrations chloride may result from different sources for example the dissolution of halite which is present in some of the sampled aquifers e g middle triassic evaporates in urban and rural areas chloride concentrations may additionally be affected by application of road salts for deicing purposes road salt application has led to a substantial increase in groundwater chloride concentrations in recent decades kelly 2008 the intrusion of deeper saline waters into shallow aquifers is unknown in this area but cannot completely be excluded and may also lead to elevated chloride concentrations most groundwaters in the study area are of the ca hco3 type and mineral surfaces are in equilibrium with ca and mg ions when nacl rich waters are introduced ca and mg ions are exchanged leading to a decrease in na cl ratio in solution thereby shifting the groundwater towards a ca cl type kim and koretsky 2013 shanley 1994 since the uranyl ion sorbs to mineral surfaces increases of sodium chloride concentrations in an aquifer may similarly enhance u concentrations in solution through cation exchange ion exchange induced by road salt for example is known to mobilize heavy metals and radium from soil and ground water jones et al 1992 mcnaboe et al 2017 ramakrishna and viraraghavan 2005 but has not been reported for u yet whether this process occurs or not can be tested when comparing the occurrence of u with the exchanged sodium naex naex can be calculated as the molar difference between chloride and sodium assuming that chloride behaves conservatively in the subsurface and has no other sources than halite dissolution molar na cl ratio of 1 1 fig 6 indicates that samples with a higher rate of naex tend to show a higher probability of u being above 1 μg l 1 thus excessive input of salts into aquifers may play an important yet unrecognized role for u mobilization although the here discussed relation between naex and u does not provide direct evidence for u mobilization from ion exchange by itself the data suggests that nacl concentrations have an effect on u mobilization and may have to be considered for example in areas such as in urban settings where road salt is used for deicing purposes the strong relation between the occurrence of u in groundwater and ph as well as alkalinity further suggests that weathering of carbonates plays a crucial role in governing uranium mobility in the aquatic environment under aerobic conditions in natural waters u vi exists predominantly as the uranyl ion uo2 2 at ph 5 0 but forms various ternary complexes with hydroxyl and carbonate at ph 5 grenthe et al 1992 the presence of bicarbonate from calcite dissolution as a potential ligand limits adsorption to mineral surfaces dong et al 2005 duff and amrhein 1996 ma et al 2014 because ph controls the formation of u co3 complexes sorption of u to soil decreases with increasing ph echevarria et al 2001 even under iron and sulfate reducing conditions the presence of bicarbonate increases the probability of finding u above 1 μg l 1 likely due to the stability of u co3 complexes zhou and gu 2005 as a result groundwater samples taken from the regions with crystalline basement have very low u concentrations likely because weathering of these rocks i e granite results in weakly buffered acidic soils in which u is hardly mobile fig 1 previous works in rivers and streams pointed out that the presence of bicarbonate is more important when predicting uranium concentrations than the content of uranium in catchment bedrock mangini et al 1979 in addition it was shown recently that irrigation with bicarbonate rich waters leads to an enhanced mobilization of uranium from soils to groundwater suggesting that arid regions are even more at risk of high u concentrations when bicarbonate rich groundwater is used for irrigation burrow et al 2017 thus inorganic complexation of the uranyl ion especially with co3 2 is central to the mobility of u in groundwater in this respect the role of liming practices on arable land needs to be explored in more detail liming is conducted on farmland to raise soil ph and increase the exchangeable divalent cation capacity of agriculturally used soils when carbonate is used it can be expected that the increase in alkalinity in the soil waters may increase the leaching of uranium from soils via carbonate complexation duff and amrhein 1996 mason et al 1997 zhou and gu 2005 besides the often discussed input of u with phosphate fertilizers this may therefore be another explanation why the occurrence of uranium is often associated with farmland 4 2 biogeochemical aspects of uranium mobility in the subsurface microbial activity and the associated redox conditions play a key role in the fate of u in the environment manganese and nitrate reducing groundwaters appeared to have the highest probabilities of showing u concentrations above 1 μg l 1 when the groundwater was characterized as manganese reducing up to 11 μg l 1 of u were observed which is well above the concentrations found in surface waters in this region birke et al 2015 when mn oxides are close to reduced u species a mobilization of u vi has been observed via the reduction of manganese to mn ii wang et al 2013 in some aquifers this may explain why dissolved mn and u are observed simultaneously in low oxygen environments the occurrence of nitrate reduction also seems to be a possible predictor for elevated u concentrations in an aquifer several causes can explain this observation the conversion of nitrate to n2 via the heterotrophic reduction pathway eq 1 involves the production of several intermediate nitrogen species tiedje 1988 some of these species such as nitrite are highly reactive towards u iv and can mobilize u in groundwater quickly via oxidative dissolution senko et al 2002 wu et al 2010 indeed the presence of nitrite in groundwater was also associated with high u concentrations similar to nitrate reducing groundwater fig s3 while samples with no detectable nitrite showed lower u concentrations thus the presence of reactive intermediates of heterotrophic nitrate reduction may be a good predictor for elevated u concentrations in groundwater microbial oxidation of pyrite using nitrate has been observed at the oxic anoxic interface in sandy aquifers where nitrate is introduced at the surface from extensive agriculture and is transported into formerly reducing parts of an aquifer jorgensen et al 2009 the process is accompanied by an increase in sulfate concentrations eq 2 which is also reflected in the regional data set used here i e the high sulfate concentrations are observed in samples where nitrate reduction coupled to pyrite oxidation is observed fig s4 reactions of u vi with pyrite lead to a reduction to u iv and subsequent immobilization of uranium pyrite therefore acts as a natural sink for u vi bruggeman and maes 2010 janot et al 2016 and its consumption with nitrate may result in elevated u concentrations in addition minerals containing reduced sulfur such as pyrite and mackinawite effectively inhibit u re oxidation through scavenging oxidants such as oxygen or nitrate finneran et al 2002 bi et al 2013 consequently a progressive oxidation of such minerals via nitrate consumption has been proposed to be a reason for elevated u concentrations in groundwater for example at the oxic nitrate reducing boundary when pyrite is present van berk and fu 2017 changes of the natural groundwater redox state for example through excessive fertilizer inputs can therefore easily result in elevated u concentrations in summary heterotrophic as well as autotrophic nitrate reduction can both be responsible for elevated uranium concentrations in low oxygen groundwater the simple presence of nitrate in groundwater does not necessarily correspond to elevated u concentrations lowest u concentrations were observed in groundwater characterized by iron and sulfate reducing conditions the occurrence of low u concentrations under iron reducing conditions is best explained by the overlapping redox potentials of the two redox couples of u iv vi and fe ii iii stewart et al 2011 the presence of dissolved fe ii is therefore often associated with low u concentrations and vice versa fig s6 laboratory experiments and field investigations have shown that fe iii reducing bacteria and some sulfate reducing bacteria are capable of reducing soluble u vi to insoluble u iv therefore immobilizing dissolved uranium in aquifers e g lovley et al 1991 lovley and phillips 1992 the maintenance of strongly reducing conditions is therefore one option when dealing with u contaminated soil or groundwater e g gavrilescu et al 2009 since iron and sulfate reducing groundwater is a sink for u janot et al 2016 introduction of oxygen or nitrate may lead to a substantial remobilization of u moon et al 2009 which needs to be considered in catchments with intense agricultural activity 4 3 depth to groundwater aquifers underneath soils with stagnant water tend to be low in oxygen the reducing conditions in saturated gleyic soils for example result from the slow resupply of oxygen during organic matter decomposition because diffusion of o2 is limited in saturated soils groundwater recharged in areas with hydromorphic soils are therefore usually reducing in the present data set reducing conditions are generally associated with a low depth to water table while the probability of oxic groundwater increases with an increase in depth to groundwater fig s5 since reducing conditions may either result in high nitrate and manganese reducing or low iron and sulftate reducing u concentrations depth to water table is not a good predictor for u concentrations in groundwater 4 4 uranium calcium relation the increasing abundance of uranium above 1 μg l 1 with increasing ca concentrations can be attributed to at least three different processes first the presence of ca promotes the formation of ca u vi co3 complexes that are more resistant to reduction than other soluble uranium species thereby stabilizing soluble uranium in reducing groundwater brooks et al 2003 stewart et al 2011 this is reflected by the fact that there was no difference between the total dataset and iron and sulfate reducing groundwaters fig 5a second a relation between u and ca may occur because both elements originate from the same source material in many aquifers e g carbonate minerals calcite especially biogenic calcite is known to contain various amounts of uranium kelly et al 2006 for example calcifying marine organisms such as coccolithophores are known to take up u within the crystal structure during growth russell et al 1994 marine deposits including the remains of calcareous organisms may therefore also be a source of u upon chemical weathering when the respective groundwater is undersaturated with respect to calcite third the presence of ca2 in solution can decrease u vi sorption on mineral surfaces under conditions at which the cauo2 co3 3 2 and ca2uo2 co3 3 0 species dominate u vi aqueous speciation dong et al 2005 fox et al 2006 in combination with the role of carbonate discussed above it appears that regions where the caco3 present in soil or bedrock dissolves are likely to exhibit detectable u concentrations 4 5 uranium dissolved organic matter dom interactions the data present in fig 5 shows some effect of doc on uranium in a system with dissolved organic matter and u vi uranium dom complexes are likely to form depending on solution ph redox and concentrations of other ligands cumberland et al 2016 moulin and moulin 1995 the presence of dom may even enhance mobility of u which has been shown in soil column experiments lesher et al 2013 it may also reduce the proportion of u reduced by pyrite under anoxic conditions bruggeman and maes 2010 however because of the stronger stability of the carbonate complex doc u complexes are only of secondary importance under the conditions found in most aquifers ranville et al 2007 trenfield et al 2011 the presence of doc concentrations may also reflect enzymatic degradation of sedimentary organic matter in soils u may be sorbed to organic matter zhou and gu 2005 bone et al 2017 if this pool of organic matter is microbially degraded the adsorbed u may be released into solution if elevated u concentrations are due to organic matter degradation the process requires that u has been accumulated with the organic matter prior to degradation which may be the case in anoxic peatlands for example banning et al 2013 binding of u to dom offers coagulation of dom with metal salts as a treatment option when u concentrations exceed quality standards 4 6 the possible role for nitrate and phosphate fertilizers on the occurrence of uranium in groundwater the co occurence of u and nitrate in many shallow wells across the usa poses questions about the role of fertilizer derived nitrate in mobilizing geogenic u nolan and weber 2015 indeed nitrate may influence the occurrence of uranium in groundwater for multiple reasons as discussed in section 4 2 however the co occurrence of nitrate and uranium may also be partly be explained by the use of phosphate fertilizer in addition to nitrate fertilizers indeed elevated u concentrations in german and polish rivers and streams have been attributed to intense agricultural activity on loess soils in the respective catchments birke et al 2009 skwarzec et al 2010 loess soils are well buffered aeolian deposits with various carbonate content which favor u mobility as discussed above the source of u in these soils however is suspected to be phosphate fertilizer schnug and lottermoser 2013 artificial fertilizers may contain up to 206 mg kg 1 u smidt et al 2011b which accumulates in the top soil a long term fertilizer experiment showed an enrichment of 0 09 mg kg 1 u in the topsoil after application of mineral fertilizer in contrast to a significant enrichment when stall mist was applied rogasik et al 2008 however contrasting results are reported regarding the mobilization of fertilizer derived u in soils while zielinski et al 2006 found that fertilized soils show a higher potential for u mobilization takeda et al 2006 found that almost all u applied by fertilizer had accumulated in the surface horizon of an agricultural soil following the application of fertilizer for 61 years an influence of phosphate fertilizers on the occurrence of u in groundwater of the present data set was recently identified albeit being relatively small liesch et al 2015 therefore the role of artificial fertilizers as potential inputs of u to the environment remains to be a matter of discussion in summary current evidence suggests that applications of u containing fertilizer to soils may have variable effects on the occurrence of uranium in groundwater below arable land which need to be evaluated from case to case 5 conclusions despite numerous research efforts a single mechanism has not been identified yet that explains the occurrence of u in groundwater and it is likely that no such mechanism will be found in the future given the complex geochemistry of uranium thus in case of elevated u concentrations it will be necessary for water suppliers to investigate geology and hydrochemistry of an aquifer thoroughly the results of this study provide some general rules that help to manage aquifers that are used as a drinking water resource a simplified form of the study results is presented in table 2 each of the values given indicates a threshold when u concentrations exceed 1 μg l 1 at a probability higher than 50 the odds ratios indicate that u concentrations above 1 μg l 1 are more likely to occur when the threshold value for a certain parameter is exceeded for example samples with ca concentrations above 200 mg l 1 had u concentrations above 1 μg l 1 4 7 times more often than samples with ca concentrations below 200 mg l 1 table 2 may therefore be considered as a first approach to a chemical risk assessment in summary the following rules and management options for natural groundwater not affected by mining operations or industrial contamination can be inferred from this study 1 in many cases the presence of u is simply the result of weathering of u bearing minerals as well as desorption from mineral surfaces in concert with weathering of carbonate minerals which increase solubility of u vi thus as long as waters are oxic enough to support u accumulation from mineral weathering uranium concentrations will increase in groundwater 2 competition of the carbonate uranyl ion with anions such as chloride nitrate and carbonate will increase the solubility of u thus in the initial stages of a risk assessment anthropogenic activities that lead to increasing inputs of chloride nitrate and carbonate into an aquifer need to be monitored potentially important activities with respect to u mobilization are irrigation practices that increase alkalinity or ionic strength in the subsurface fertilizer additions to arable land and road salt applications 3 introduction of dissolved oxygen or nitrate into formerly iron and sulfate reducing parts of an aquifer may lead to a substantial increase in u concentrations at the redox interface where reduced u species are mobilized via oxidative dissolution or desorption thus lowering of groundwater table and or excessive application of no3 fertilizer on farmland may result in extensive u mobilization in anoxic ground waters a description of the prevailing redox conditions within an aquifer in combination with an analysis of land use will help to elucidate if u can be expected to be mobile or not if the aquifer is anoxic the use of fertilizers within the catchment may have to be regulated to reduce the risk of nitrate dependent u mobilization 4 when u is already above quality standards changes in well operation may help to reduce u concentrations since elevated u concentrations may be centered around a redox interface in an aquifer or in highly alkaline zones it can be advantageous to install an additional well casing at the depth of the interface or pump water from deeper or shallower parts of the aquifer where different redox conditions and thus lower u concentrations can be expected acknowledgments we thank the landesanstalt für umwelt messungen und naturschutz baden württemberg lubw for providing the hydrochemical data wolfgang feuerstein of lubw

19827,understanding the mechanisms of solute transfer across the sediment water interface plays a crucial role in water quality prediction and management in this study different arranged particles are used to form typical rough and permeable beds large eddy simulation les is used to model the solute transfer from the overlying water to sediment beds three rough wall turbulence regimes i e smooth transitional and rough regime are separately considered and the effects of bed roughness on solute transfer are quantitatively analyzed results show that the classic laws related to schmidt numbers can well reflect the solute transfer under the smooth regime with small roughness reynolds numbers under the transitional regime the solute transfer coefficient k l is enhanced and the effect of schmidt number is weakened by increasing roughness reynolds number under the rough regime the solute transfer is suppressed by the transition layer brinkman layer and controlled by the bed permeability moreover it is found that water depth friction velocity and bed permeability can be used to estimate the solute transfer velocity k l under the completely rough regime graphical abstract image 1 keywords bed roughness permeable bed sediment water interface large eddy simulation mass transfer coefficient 1 introduction exchange at the sediment water interface swi is important in defining the oxygen demand in streams the release of nutrients and trace toxic contaminants to the surface water which is essential for the mass fluxes and the related biogeochemical and physical processes it is well known that the flux of dissolved oxygen do toward the bed is controlled not only by microbial and chemical oxygen uptake rates but also by solute transfer processes associated with the turbulent exchange between the overlying water and sediments e g steinberger and hondzo 1999 o connor and hondzo 2008 both the surface roughness and the bed permeability influence the turbulence near the swi and may affect the dynamics of solute transfer in aquatic ecosystems some studies have examined the solute transport to sediments in estuaries lakes and reservoirs glud et al 1998 lorke et al 2003 in those environments the bottom flow is slow and the sediment beds are usually assumed to be effectively impermeable and smooth traditionally the sharp decline in the time averaged solute concentration profile is used to define a diffusive sublayer dsl near sediments which has been modelled using the thin film theory boudreau and joergensen 2001 in this theory the bulk fluid exhibits a uniform solute concentration while a rapid decrease is depicted across a thin film in which solute is transported by molecular diffusion the solute flux j across the swi often calculated by fick s law of diffusion 1 j d c z z 0 where d is the molecular diffusion coefficient the bracket means time averaged variables so c is the mean concentration and c z is the time averaged vertical concentration gradient since the diffusive sublayer is very thin it is difficult to measure the concentration gradient in that layer eq 1 is simplified by defining a mass transfer velocity k l 2 j k l c b c s where c b is the bulk solute concentration and c s is the solute concentration at the swi using the thin film theory a typical form for k l over smooth bed is k l sc 2 3 kader and yaglom 1972 at low schmidt numbers and k l sc 0 7 at higher ones shaw and hanratty 1977 where k l k l u k l is mass transfer coefficient and u τ 0 ρ 0 5 is the friction velocity τ 0 is the bed shear stress in the stream and ρ is the density of water sc υ d is the schmidt number where υ is the kinematic viscosity for water and schmidt number is usually used to characterize fluid flows in which there are simultaneous momentum and mass diffusion convection processes the predictions of other researches for k l is quite similar over a smooth bed hondzo 1998 boudreau and joergensen 2001 however when beds become rough and permeable it is uncertain whether molecular diffusion is the only mode of transport or turbulent and interstitial flow are more important processes guess 1998 higashino and stefan 2011a for streams rivers or coastal areas flow near the bed surface is relatively high and hyporheic exchange is often affected by roughness harnanan et al 2015 inoue and nakamura 2011 and by bed permeability blois et al 2012 goharzadeh et al 2005 higashino 2013 in laboratory experiments the solute transfer across the swi is investigated with different kinds of roughness which consist of uniform particles nagaoka and ohgaki 1990 gravel sediments packman et al 2004 gravel pool riffle structures tonina and buffington 2007 sediments with narrow bars inoue and nakamura 2011 or gravels with fine materials above o connor and hondzo 2008 they found that the solute transfer may not be dominated by molecular diffusion for rough and permeable beds as the dsl thickness is negligible and turbulent fluctuations are more important moreover for very coarse gravel sediment beds a transition layer below the swi has been found manes et al 2009 vollmer et al 2002 the thickness of that layer was measured by goharzadeh et al 2005 who found it could be determined by analyzing flow velocity distributions in bed fig 1 schematically shows a kind of represented solute i e do transfer over a rough and permeable bed the mean velocity and do concentration are presented both in water and in sediments do concentration in the core of flow is regarded as the bulk concentration c b it decreases to c s at the swi and finally reaches the depth of penetration δ do the intense turbulence and frequent bursting events caused by roughness exist in water near the swi the upper layer of sediments is the transition layer where flow velocity decreases sharply while in darcy layer the flow velocity slightly fluctuates in vertical compared with rough and permeable beds the relationship between bed roughness and coherent motions is replaced by regular large scale coherent motions and the effect of transition layer is ignored over smooth and impermeable beds in addition over rough and permeable beds it is more advantageous to measure the vertical transport of solutes from simultaneous measurements of turbulent flow and solute concentration berg et al 2007 a mathematical expression for mean solute flux j is 3 j w c z 0 d c z z 0 where w is the instantaneous vertical velocity for an instantaneous flow or concentration variable θ the temporal fluctuation θ is defined as θ θ lu and willmarth 1973 luchik and tiederman 1988 mean solute flux across the swi is thus the sum of turbulent w c and diffusive d c z mechanisms although many experimental researches recognized the importance of roughness and permeability in solute transfer at the swi measurements still face many difficulties such as lack of three dimensional instantaneous data o connor and hondzo 2008 as a result of limitation of instruments it is very difficult to produces simultaneous measurements of flow and concentration the mechanism of how the solute transfer changes from the swi to darcy layer is also not clear yet many efforts have been made to design a numerical model to reproduce experimental observations and to investigate the solute transport near beds higashino et al 2004 scalo et al 2012 an assumption of relationship with schmidt number was adopted by standard models of solute transport at the swi thibodeaux et al 2010 while reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models considering near bed turbulence showed that the flow induced by turbulent pressure fluctuations could significantly enhance oxygen transport and sediment oxygen demand sod higashino et al 2004 2009 but these models were limited to smooth permeable surfaces and the pressure pulses at the swi were used to describe the renewal behavior with an approximate characterization of the turbulent pressure oscillations to drive the flow in the sediments according to darcy s law more recently higashino and stefan 2011b extended the model to coarse sands and considered a non darcy flow below the swi but the effects of bed roughness were still neglected because of the limited researches on the relations between coherent motions and bed roughness similarly bardini et al 2012 simulated the turbulent flow by rans equations in the stream and the advective and dispersive flow under the bed surface was estimated using the darcy s law and the continuity equation based on the evaluated pressure smooth bed was also adopted by scalo et al 2012 who developed a model coupling les of turbulent transport in the water column and darcy s law for the pore water driven transport the instantaneous transport events were analyzed but when bed permeability increases 10 5 cm2 and the bulk reynolds number gets higher 9000 the predicted concentrations are lower than experimental data kessler et al 2015 used darcy s law for the permeable sandy sediment and a reactive transport model was also adopted to determine the potential effect of bed form celerity on denitrification the hydraulic head over the bed form was approximated by a sinusoidal function as higashino et al 2009 did in the previous numerical model studies due to the wide range of scales exhibited by the velocity and scalar fields the water side and the sediments side were generally separated and the momentum and scalar transport from the water to the sediments were simulated based on empirical correlations and parameterization of smooth beds dade 1993 nakamura and stefan 1994 qian et al 2009 for a very fine sediment bed it may be acceptable to ignore the effect of roughness but for a coarser and more permeable sediment bed such as gravel bed the empirical correlations and assumptions might be inaccurate the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of roughness on solute transfer over permeable beds specifically we want to identify controlling factors in solute transfer under different typical rough regimes especially under the completely rough regime les is used to simulate three dimensional flow above and within the mimics of the real bed in natural environments the sediment bed is simulated by packed particles rather than darcy s law and diffusion models adopted by scalo et al 2012 it can help to obtain more effective and accurate results different solute transfer processes caused by typical sediment beds and flow regimes are quantitatively analyzed they control a variety of microbial and biogeochemical processes in different water environments near the sediment bed which in turn influence the water quality in the overlying and flowing water we will determine under which conditions the effects of molecular diffusion represented by schmidt number can be neglected and show how mass transfer coefficient changes with roughness reynolds number in addition we will propose a scaling relationship to quantify the transfer coefficient in the rough regime over permeable bed 2 numerical method the les technique is adopted to model the solute transfer in different typical water environments the second edition of lesocc2 large eddy simulation on curvilinear coordinates was used which was first developed at the institute for hydromechanics of the karlsruhe institute of technology frohlich and rodi 2002 and it has successfully simulated many environmental flows in an open channel bai et al 2013 fang et al 2014 after filtering the incompressible navier stokes n s equations and the convection

term which is used to estimate solute production or consumption inside the bed dissolved oxygen is adopted as a kind of representative solute to study the physics of transfer to permeable bed in this paper so s b was assumed to be zero in the overlying flow and a dominant sink for oxygen in the sediment since our focus is on sediment water exchange sweerts et al 1991 a sink term described by michaelis menten kinetics is used to represent the depletion by decomposing organic matter higashino and stefan 2011a 9 s b μ c c k o 2 c bed where μ c μ c l 2 υc b is the non dimensional maximum rate

do utilization and we adopt a typical value k o 2 0 2 mg l the most important and innovative part is the direct les simulation of flow and solute transport in the sediments without any kinds of models and assumptions such as models of pressure fluctuations induced by near bed coherent motions and models of darcy or non darcy pore water flow in sediments to simulate the flow through the particles the direct forcing immersed boundary method ibm peskin 1972 is incorporated into the les model the grids are divided into three types solid grids boundary grids and flow grids in the solid grids the velocity is forced to be zero in the flow grids the velocity is calculated through eqs 1 and 2 without any additional processes in the boundary grids a forcing source term is added to momentum equations to guarantee that the calculated velocities at the center of these grids are equal to actual values details of the model can be found in fang et al 2014 the numerical model used to compute the flow is a well validated finite volume method on curvilinear grids with a collocated variable arrangement hinterberger et al 2007 the convective fluxes in the momentum equations were approximated by a central difference scheme of second order accuracy and scalar transport fluxes were obtained by the hlpa scheme zhu 2010 the diffusive fluxes in both momentum and scalar transport equations were approximated using the central difference scheme a second order accurate runge kutta method was adopted for time discretization the poisson equation for pressure was solved after the final runge kutta step using the sip method of stone 1968 the code was parallelized using the message passing interface mpi protocol the computations were supported by thpcc tsinghua high performance computing center and tacc the texas advanced computing center at the university of texas at austin united states 3 computational setup sediments constructed by particles are more suitable to explore the effects of roughness on solute transfer over permeable beds since they are closer to real environments three kinds of beds with different surface topographies and permeability are conducted to represent the different bed surfaces in natural aqueous environments including lakes reservoirs fluvial and mountain rivers the detailed computational setups are shown in table 1 the roughness reynolds number re u υ can be used as an indicator of the rough wall turbulence regime where is the roughness height for the same bed surface is a constant and re is controlled by the friction flow velocity the hydraulically smooth regime for 0 re 5 the transitionally rough regime for 5 re 70 the completely rough regime for re 70 3 1 smooth channel for deep lakes or reservoirs in storage periods the bottom flow is slow and the sediments are very fine resulting in the low permeability so the bed is usually considered as smooth and impermeable the diffusion sublayer can effectively model solute transfer and this condition has been studied extensively the smooth channels with two solid wall are designed low and high schmidt numbers i e 1 100 and 200 see table 1 are analyzed by the thin film theory the size of the computational domain is set to be slightly larger than l x πh f and l y 3πh f 8 where h f is the channel depth at the walls z h f 2 no slip conditions are imposed the settings ensure that in both directions two point correlations are negligibly small for separation distances of the order of half the box size the friction reynolds number re f 0 5u h f υ is 650 which is essentially identical to that evaluated by calmet and magnaudet 1997 the grids settings initial concentration in water and constant concentration at the walls are also similar with calmet and magnaudet 1997 this case lies in the hydraulically smooth regime 0 re 5 it provides a verification of the present les approach through comparing with previous researches as well as a background for comparison with other cases in this study 3 2 permeable bed with small roughness for fluvial rivers the sand sized particles usually settle upon and between the gravel sized particles meanwhile fine benthic organic material can also settle onto the bed surface under low discharge conditions resulting in an anisotropic permeable bed with small roughness as shown in fig 2 a and b the permeable bed with small roughness is designed to study the solute transfer across the swi in which the roughness reynolds number re 4 13 20 and 96 is successively adopted covering the hydraulically smooth regime 0 re 5 the transitionally rough regime 5 re 70 and completely rough regime re 70 the sediments consist of a mixture of sand and gravel sized particles with the resulting d50 of about 5 mm and one layer of small particles with the diameter of 1 mm are settled above the mixed particles two sets of open channel experiments with that kind of bed geomorphology have been conducted by o connor and hondzo 2008 to study do transfer across the swi with the applied roughness reynolds number re of 4 and 20 which can be used for comparison with the simulated results the flow filed with each roughness reynolds number simultaneously transports three scalar fields i e a combination of three schmidt number sc 371 690 and 1020 corresponding to water temperatures of 25 c 15 c and 8 c for do to evaluate the impacts of molecular diffusion on solute transfer the maximum rate of do utilization μ c is set as 1000mg l d which is obtained from calibration with experimental results the boundary conditions of momentum equations are in the streamwise x and spanwise y directions periodic boundary is used for all quantities the wall function is adapted at the bottom and the water surface is assumed to be a rigid lid with a slip condition the water depth h f is 3 5 times the diameter of the biggest particle the boundary conditions of the scalar equation are the solute concentration is fixed at the water surface since the surface water is saturated with atmospheric oxygen the initial solute concentration is set as c b in water and zero in bed the grids are refined near the swi to capture more details about solute transfer as shown in fig 2 b the vertical minimum grid spaces δz min in wall units δz δz min u υ are 0 13 for re 4 0 38 for re 13 0 63 for re 20 and 3 18 for re 96 3 3 permeable bed with large roughness for flow over coarser sediment beds such as mountain rivers or the currents around a coral reef the flow is in completely rough regime boudreau and joergensen 2001 an underflow paralleling to the surface flow can also develop and the interaction between the surface and sub surface flow will cause a transition layer where darcy s law is no longer valid brinkman 1947 to study the characteristics of solute transfer over those beds the permeable beds with large roughness are also designed with re 114 231 and 477 the computational setup and grids are shown in fig 3 a and b the boundary conditions and scalar settings are similar with the permeable bed with small roughness the minimum grid spaces in wall units δz at the swi are 0 39 for re 114 0 80 for re 4 and 1 65 for re 477 the above hierarchy of sediment beds and flow regimes are linked to different solute transfer processes controlling a variety of microbial and biogeochemical processes in different water environments near the sediment bed which in turn influence the water quality in the overlying water 4 results and discussion in this section the results of smooth bed and the permeable bed with small roughness re 4 and 20 are first presented for verification then the case for the permeable bed with large roughness re 231 is used to investigate the flow and solute transfer both at the swi and in bed at last all cases with different roughness reynolds number are presented to discuss the influence of roughness on solute transfer over permeable beds 4 1 smooth channel re 0 for fine sediments without bed forms the molecular diffusion is the major mechanism for solute transfer through the swi which has been studied extensively as shown in figs 4 and 5 the distribution of the mean velocity and concentration profiles are plotted versus z h f 2 z u υ the mean velocity is normalized by the friction velocity u and the reference concentration c is used to normalize the concentration c as c c c 10 c d u c z z h f 2 because of the simple bed surface topography and the relatively slow flow the characteristic of various wall regions near bed is comparatively explicit close to the swi is the diffusive sublayer and dynamic sublayer the thickness of them i e δ c and δ u respectively are stable and can be got by a graphic estimate the profiles of c behave like sc z in the diffusive sublayer while the profiles of u are liner in the dynamic sublayer where z is the vertical coordinate in wall units fig 4 shows δ c δ u 5 at sc 1 and fig 5 shows the diffusive sublayer is much thinner than that of sc 1 at high schmidt number which is consistent with the theoretical results shaw and hanratty 1977 it means the molecular diffusion represented by schmidt number is a controlling factor over smooth beds above the diffusive layer there is a buffer layer using reynolds analogy kader and yaglom 1972 found that the mean concentration profiles followed by a logarithmic region in the buffer layer with the empirical expression as follows 11 c α ln z β s c where α 2 12 and an empirical expression for the function β sc is valid in the range 6 10 3 sc 4 104 figs 4 and 5 show that the present les agrees with the empirical expression 4 2 permeable bed with small roughness re 4 and 20 for permeable bed with small roughness the simulated results of cases with re 4 and 20 are directly compared to the laboratory data obtained by o connor and hondzo 2008 the flow parameters adopted in these experiments are summarized in table 2 we try to perform numerical simulations matching the fluid dynamic conditions of the experiments in fig 6 we compare the mean concentration profile computed by les with the experimental data from oc 1 and oc 2 the elevation z is normalized by the diameter of small particles d 1 mm the values of do utilization are calibrated by matching the numerical results against data for oc 1 then the resultant values are used for calculation to compare with oc 2 as shown in fig 6 the model predicts correct concentration at the swi and the penetration depth into the sediments for oc 2 with average relative error of 8 4 3 permeable bed with large roughness re 231 in this section we use a permeable bed with re 231 i e large roughness to investigate the solute transfer characteristics across the transition layer 4 3 1 length scale of the transition layer the approximate vertical extent of the transition layer is estimated via analysis of the flow in sediments the velocity fluctuates below a critical point and the depth of the critical point can be considered as the lower limit of the transition layer goharzadeh et al 2005 the same phenomena occurs in this study as shown in fig 7 the mean velocity inside the porous region is plotted with the streamwise mean velocity vector from z d 0 to z d 0 66 the mean velocity decreases monotonically while below which the velocity fluctuates the vertically averaged velocity below the critical point z d 0 66 is 0 0313u it is noticed that the mean velocity is negative at z d 0 66 because a vortex exists between two spheres below the transition layer the velocity component in the streamwise of pore water flow can be gotten by darcy s law higashino et al 2009 12 u x k h x k ρ g p x in which u x is the streamwise component of pore water flow in darcy layer h is the pressure head g is the gravitational acceleration p x is the pressure gradient in streamwise direction and k is the hydraulic conductivity which is related to permeability k in eq 13 13 k g υ k then we can get u x 0 0315u this result is quite close to that from fig 7 0 0313u confirming a darcy layer below the transition layer brinkman 1947 matched the stokes flow with the darcy flow and predicted a boundary layer thickness on the order of magnitude k however goharzadeh et al 2005 concluded that the boundary layer thickness was on the order of magnitude of the sediment diameter in the present work the thickness of the transition layer is 0 66d also suggesting the similarity between the magnitude of the thickness of transition layer and that of the grain size just as goharzadeh et al 2005 concluded 4 3 2 solute transfer in the transition layer we used quadrant analysis to investigate the solute transfer caused by turbulent motions in this transition layer quadrant analysis is a useful technique to describe how the turbulent fluctuations contribute to momentum or solute transfer through the swi the selected elevations are z d 1 2 0 3 and 0 representing darcy layer transition layer and the swi respectively the conventional quadrant method involves studying the relationship between temporal fluctuations of velocity components u and w correlation between u and w reveals the turbulent coherent structures e g outward interactions q1 u 0 w 0 ejections q2 u 0 w 0 inward interactions q3 u 0 w 0 sweeps q4 u 0 w 0 sweep events transport high momentum fluid downward to the sediments and ejection events transport low momentum fluid vertically upward away from the bed the ejection sweep phenomenon results in flushing of dead water which generally accumulates among the roughness elements so it is very important for the do transfer to sediments and the release of contaminants to overlying water grass 1971 in fig 8 the bubble maps are plotted with the dimensionless u and w and the size of bubbles represents the magnitude of dimensionless reynolds shear stress u w u 2 results show that in the darcy layer the dimensionless reynolds stresses are negligible with the magnitude of about 0 01 indicating that ejection sweep phenomenon is a modest factor in the momentum flux within the transition layer the magnitude of momentum increases but they seem to be similar in the four quadrants which is mainly caused by vortexes that exist between the top spheres at the swi the ejection sweep phenomenon is much more obvious with some instantaneous magnitudes even larger than 10 indicating the enhanced vertical transport of momentum toward the bed in a similar way the quadrant method is used to illustrate the relationship between the w and the concentration fluctuation c results indicate the existence of ejection and sweep motions of solute q1 w 0 c 0 q2 w 0 c 0 q3 w 0 c 0 q4 w 0 c 0 in fig 9 the fluctuations of vertical velocity are normalized by friction velocity u and the fluctuations of solute concentration are normalized by the bulk concentration c b the c is nearly zero in darcy layer so the quadrant map for that layer was omitted according to fig 9 the ejection sweep phenomenon is not a major factor in solute flux as motions are nearly isotropic in the transition layer which is caused by cavity vortex among roughness as shown in fig 7 the vortexes will increase concentration homogeneity in cavity i e smaller c and also reduce the exchange with overlying water therefore the water between roughness elements becomes dead water and the solute transfer to the deeper layer is limited even though the turbulent diffusivity at the swi is high 4 4 effect of roughness on mass transfer coefficient in this section all simulation results including the smooth channel permeable bed with small roughness and permeable bed with large roughness are summarized by the mass transfer coefficient k l calculated by eqns 2 and 3 to investigate the effect of roughness on solute transfer fig 10 shows the relationship between dimensionless mass transfer coefficient k l and schmidt number sc for flat channels the semi empirical correlation suggests that k l sc 2 3 kader and yaglom 1972 at low schmidt numbers and k l sc 0 7 at higher ones shaw and hanratty 1977 as shown in fig 10 the predicted points lie on the theoretical line for permeable beds with small roughness the predicted points also lie on the theoretical line when the roughness reynolds number in the smooth regime re 4 however when the roughness reynolds number increases to the transition regime re 13 20 the mass transfer coefficients are enhanced to similar level for different schmidt numbers indicating that the effect of sc number decreases for permeable beds with large roughness similar phenomenon is also observed that there is no apparent effect of sc number on the mass transfer coefficient the spatial distribution of solute concentration fluctuations c and vertical velocity fluctuations w u are shown in fig 11 to illustrate the enhanced effect of turbulent diffusion on solute transfer if the negative w u patches corresponds to the positive c patches or positive w u patches corresponds to the negative c patches at the same position we can speculate that turbulent diffusion dominates solute transfer at that position for smooth channels re 0 the horizontal plane at z 6 is adopted which is the edge of the diffusive sublayer for sc 1 for rough and permeable beds the horizontal plane at the swi z 0 is adopted for re 20 i e transition regime and re 231 i e completely rough regime it should be noticed that the maximum and minimum levels of w u in the legend for smooth channels are different from those for rough and permeable beds in fig 11 a the vertical velocity fluctuations w u are quite small due to the smooth and impermeable bed and elongated streaky patches can develop with relatively low density in fig 11 b and c both the magnitude of w u and density of patches increase as a result of bed permeability and high re illustrating the enhanced effect of turbulent diffusion moreover to evaluate the efficiency of turbulent diffusion the correlation coefficient r cw between c and w is calculated as 14 r c w a c w d s a c 2 d s a w 2 d s where a is the total area of the horizontal plane and ds is an infinitesimal area element results show that the r cw is 0 35 0 37 and 0 45 for fig 11 a c respectively it means with the increasing of bed roughness and permeability the turbulent diffusion which is represented by the correlation between w u and c is enhanced meanwhile the structures are more irregular in rough and permeable beds because strong vertical velocities prevent the development of elongated streaky structures another interesting result in fig 10 is that for permeable bed with small roughness as roughness reynolds number re increases from 20 to 96 k l only increases slightly and for permeable bed with large roughness i e re 114 231 and 477 there is a slightly declining trend of mass transfer coefficient with increasing roughness reynolds number this is caused by cavity vortexes in the transition layer which suppress the solute transfer to the deeper layer moreover the convergent value of k l for more permeable beds i e k h f 2 8 54 10 6 is larger than that for less permeable beds i e k h f 2 3 49 10 7 implying that bed permeability plays a dominant role in rough regime the reason may be the enhanced interaction between pore water flow in darcy layer and the flow in the transition layer 4 5 scaling model and comparison with experimental data based on the simulation results we try to propose a scaling model to determine the mass transfer coefficient in the completely rough regime it is assumed that the solute transfer at the swi in the completely rough regime is a function of friction velocity flow depth and bed permeability 15 k l f u h f k where k l is the mass transfer velocity defined by eq 2 eq 15 contains four variables that are composed of two dimensions l and t which results in the possibility of two groupings the selected dimensionless parameters and functional relationship can be written as 16 k l u f k h f 2 or in the form of a power law scaling 17 k l u a k h f 2 b where a is a dimensionless constant and b is determined by calibration using observed data because of the limited simulation data some experimental results with roughness reynolds number larger than 70 are also used to determine a and b nagaoka and ohgaki 1990 packman et al 2004 tonina and buffington 2007 inoue and nakamura 2011 and the corresponding conditions of sediment and fluid flow are listed in table 3 as shown in fig 12 positive correlations are observed for k l k l u with k h f 2 with the slope 0 2 and r 2 0 9 the final k l scaling equation is 18 k l u 1 3 k h f 2 0 2 re 70 in fig 13 the simulation results of permeable bed cases are plotted with more experimental results including both transition and rough regimes and the experimental conditions are also listed in table 3 there is a general tendency that k l k h f 2 0 2 increases with roughness reynolds number re in the transition regime and fluctuates around 1 3 in the completely rough regime however as the simulations and the proposed model do not consider the effects of bed forms which can enhance the mass exchange between overlying water and sediments some experimental results with bed forms already approach 1 3 in the transition regime elliott and brooks 1997 marion et al 2002 for very fine sediments e g organic silt early arrival of the limit value in the transition regime is also observed by inoue and nakamura 2011 which may be caused by the especially low permeability 5 discussion the presence of do in the overlying water and the legacy of contaminants in sediments are increasingly posing limits on the water quality the transport of these solutes is strongly influenced by the sediment water mass transfer coefficient standard models of mass transport at the swi assume that there is a chemical dependency represented by the relationship with schmidt number thibodeaux et al 2010 in section 4 4 the present work shows that this dependence is largely overcome by surface roughness and the dependence on schmidt number is often unimportant in the flow over a rough sediment bed observations do show a weakening of schmidt number dependence with roughness thibodeaux et al 2010 but observations are often limited by a small variations in schmidt number and surface roughness this study suggests that the schmidt number correlations typically used in the water quality community may underestimate mass transfer coefficients in the fully rough regime which is quite common in fast moving rivers and streams note that observations or correlations based upon observations adequately represent sediment water exchange the difficulty lies in extrapolating those correlations to other conditions in that our work suggests that the schmidt number dependence often assumed is incorrect for fully rough beds in addition by considering the influence of roughness over permeable bed this study successfully reproduce the observed do profiles o connor and hondzo 2008 in the transitionally rough regime in section 4 2 an explanation of that finding may be as follows for rivers with small scale roughness the roughness reynolds number falls in the smooth regime when the bottom flow is slow and the diffusive sublayer covers the roughness elements resulting in similar characteristics with the smooth channel as shown by case re 4 in fig 10 i e the schmidt number is a controlling factor in mass transfer coefficient as the flow velocity increases if we adopt the assumption of a smooth bed as previous models did higashino and stefan 2008 2011a scalo et al 2012 the thickness of diffusive layer will get thinner but it still plays a key role in controlling solute transport across the swi scalo et al 2012 performed les with bulk reynolds number re 9019 which is similar to our case with re 8970 simulated results showed lower scalar concentration than the experimental data higashino and stefan 2008 2011a also observed the disagreement between their model and the experimental data they both thought the fully considered bed permeability could improve the result but the underestimated concentration as well as turbulence driven transport around the swi still arose in subsequent investigations here the results in section 4 4 may shed some light to these issues as roughness reynolds number re increases the mass transfer coefficient k l is no longer a function of schmidt number which represents the molecular diffusive properties of the solute it suggests that the roughness disrupts the diffusive layer and causes turbulent motions which can transport solute more efficiently across the swi so fully considered bed roughness is also very important to improve the simulated results another important finding is that the transition layer in very coarse sediment beds suppresses the solute transfer to the deeper layer leading to an almost constant solute transfer coefficient with increasing roughness reynolds number re this tendency is qualitatively similar with some experiments on environmental engineering dipprey and sabersky 1963 dawson and trass 1972 inoue and nakamura 2011 but few explanations and quantitative analyses are found in previous researches by quadrant analysis in section 4 3 we found that the isotropic characteristics in turbulent diffusion is the main reason for this tendency higashino and stefan 2011b extended the previous analysis to coarser beds by adopting the near bed turbulence that was derived for a solid flat surface leading to no slip velocity at the swi thus their results deviated from experimental data for very coarse beds in the present study with the constructed rough and permeable beds we can reproduce the fully developed turbulent flow around the swi more accurately than the flat surface so the nature of the scalar transport caused by turbulence can be seen clearly based on the transfer mechanisms in the fully rough regime discussed in section 4 4 a scaling model is proposed in section 4 5 which shows a comforting coincidence with experimental data since the diffusive sublayer and concentration gradient in that layer is effectively meaningless in the fully rough regime the scaling relationship may be more helpful to estimate the solute flux between overlying water and sediments which is a basic task for water quality management 6 conclusion this study develops a unified 3d model for solute transfer from water to the sediment bed with les and the exchange at the sediment water interface is successfully predicted for rough and permeable beds the mechanism of solute transfer is further discussed covering a wide range of flow conditions especially in the completely rough regime re 70 and the main findings are as follows 1 over a rough and permeable bed the do concentration at the swi and the depth of penetration from o connor and hondzo 2008 results are successfully predicted by considering bed roughness under the transitionally rough regime 2 for permeable beds beyond the hydraulically smooth regime i e re 5 the ejection sweep events can enhance vertical solute transfer toward the bed and the solute transfer coefficient is no longer dependent on schmidt number 3 for permeable bed under the completely rough regime re 70 the transition layer suppresses the transfer to the deeper layer by cavity vortex the solute transfer coefficient k l is enhanced by the bed permeability rather than roughness reynolds number 4 using friction velocity u flow depth h f and bed permeability k the mass transfer velocity k l is estimated for the completely rough regime which shows reasonable agreement with experimental data from a variety of sources acknowledgments this

19827,understanding the mechanisms of solute transfer across the sediment water interface plays a crucial role in water quality prediction and management in this study different arranged particles are used to form typical rough and permeable beds large eddy simulation les is used to model the solute transfer from the overlying water to sediment beds three rough wall turbulence regimes i e smooth transitional and rough regime are separately considered and the effects of bed roughness on solute transfer are quantitatively analyzed results show that the classic laws related to schmidt numbers can well reflect the solute transfer under the smooth regime with small roughness reynolds numbers under the transitional regime the solute transfer coefficient k l is enhanced and the effect of schmidt number is weakened by increasing roughness reynolds number under the rough regime the solute transfer is suppressed by the transition layer brinkman layer and controlled by the bed permeability moreover it is found that water depth friction velocity and bed permeability can be used to estimate the solute transfer velocity k l under the completely rough regime graphical abstract image 1 keywords bed roughness permeable bed sediment water interface large eddy simulation mass transfer coefficient 1 introduction exchange at the sediment water interface swi is important in defining the oxygen demand in streams the release of nutrients and trace toxic contaminants to the surface water which is essential for the mass fluxes and the related biogeochemical and physical

with the turbulent exchange between the overlying water and sediments e g steinberger and hondzo 1999 o connor and hondzo 2008 both the surface roughness and the bed permeability influence the turbulence near the swi and may affect the dynamics of solute transfer in aquatic ecosystems some studies have examined the solute transport to sediments in estuaries lakes and reservoirs glud et al 1998 lorke et al 2003 in those environments the bottom flow is slow and the sediment beds are usually assumed to be effectively impermeable and smooth traditionally the sharp decline in the time averaged solute concentration profile is used to define a diffusive sublayer dsl near sediments which has been modelled using the thin film theory boudreau and joergensen 2001 in this theory the bulk fluid exhibits a uniform solute concentration while a rapid decrease is depicted across a thin film in which solute is transported by molecular diffusion the solute flux j across the swi often calculated by fick s law of diffusion 1 j d c z z 0 where d is the molecular diffusion coefficient the bracket means time averaged variables so c is the mean concentration and c z is the time averaged vertical concentration gradient since the diffusive sublayer is very thin it is difficult to measure the concentration gradient in that layer eq 1 is simplified by defining a mass transfer velocity k l 2 j k l c b c s where c b is the bulk solute concentration and c s is the solute concentration at the swi using the thin film theory a typical form for k l over smooth bed is k l sc 2 3 kader and yaglom 1972 at low schmidt numbers and k l sc 0 7 at higher ones shaw and hanratty 1977 where k l k l u k l is mass transfer coefficient and u τ 0 ρ 0 5 is the friction velocity τ 0 is the bed shear stress in the stream and ρ is the density of water sc υ d is the schmidt number where υ is the kinematic viscosity for water and schmidt number is usually used to characterize fluid flows in which there are simultaneous momentum and mass diffusion convection processes the predictions of other researches for k l is quite similar over a smooth bed hondzo 1998 boudreau and joergensen 2001 however when beds become rough and permeable it is uncertain whether molecular diffusion is the only mode of transport or turbulent and interstitial flow are more important processes guess 1998 higashino and stefan 2011a for streams rivers or coastal areas flow near the bed surface is relatively high and hyporheic exchange is often affected by roughness harnanan et al 2015 inoue and nakamura 2011 and by bed permeability blois et al 2012 goharzadeh et al 2005 higashino 2013 in laboratory experiments the solute transfer across the swi is investigated with different kinds of roughness which consist of uniform particles nagaoka and ohgaki 1990 gravel sediments packman et al 2004 gravel pool riffle structures tonina and buffington 2007 sediments with narrow bars inoue and nakamura 2011 or gravels with fine materials above o connor and hondzo 2008 they found that the solute transfer may not be dominated by molecular diffusion for rough and permeable beds as the dsl thickness is negligible and turbulent fluctuations are more important moreover for very coarse gravel sediment beds a transition layer below the swi has been found manes et al 2009 vollmer et al 2002 the thickness of that layer was measured by goharzadeh et al 2005 who found it could be determined by analyzing flow velocity distributions in bed fig 1 schematically shows a kind of represented solute i e do transfer over a rough and permeable bed the mean velocity and do concentration are presented both in water and in sediments do concentration in the core of flow is regarded as the bulk concentration c b it decreases to c s at the swi and finally reaches the depth of penetration δ do the intense turbulence and frequent bursting events caused by roughness exist in water near the swi the upper layer of sediments is the transition layer where flow velocity decreases sharply while in darcy layer the flow velocity slightly fluctuates in vertical compared with rough and permeable beds the relationship between bed roughness and coherent motions is replaced by regular large scale coherent motions and the effect of transition layer is ignored over smooth and impermeable beds in addition over rough and permeable beds it is more advantageous to measure the vertical transport of solutes from simultaneous measurements of turbulent flow and solute concentration berg et al 2007 a mathematical expression for mean solute flux j is 3 j w c z 0 d c z z 0 where w is the instantaneous vertical velocity for an instantaneous flow or concentration variable θ the temporal fluctuation θ is defined as θ θ lu and willmarth 1973 luchik and tiederman 1988 mean solute flux across the swi is thus the sum of turbulent w c and diffusive d c z mechanisms although many experimental researches recognized the importance of roughness and permeability in solute transfer at the swi measurements still face many difficulties such as lack of three dimensional instantaneous data o connor and hondzo 2008 as a result of limitation of instruments it is very difficult to produces simultaneous measurements of flow and concentration the mechanism of how the solute transfer changes from the swi to darcy layer is also not clear yet many efforts have been made to design a numerical model to reproduce experimental observations and to investigate the solute transport near beds higashino et al 2004 scalo et al 2012 an assumption of relationship with schmidt number was adopted by standard models of solute transport at the swi thibodeaux et al 2010 while reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models considering near bed turbulence showed that the flow induced by turbulent pressure fluctuations could significantly enhance oxygen transport and sediment oxygen demand sod higashino et al 2004 2009 but these models were limited to smooth permeable surfaces and the pressure pulses at the swi were used to describe the renewal behavior with an approximate characterization of the turbulent pressure oscillations to drive the flow in the sediments according to darcy s law more recently higashino and stefan 2011b extended the model to coarse sands and considered a non darcy flow below the swi but the effects of bed roughness were still neglected because of the limited researches on the relations between coherent motions and bed roughness similarly bardini et al 2012 simulated the turbulent flow by rans equations in the stream and the advective and dispersive flow under the bed surface was estimated using the darcy s law and the continuity equation based on the evaluated pressure smooth bed was also adopted by scalo et al 2012 who developed a model coupling les of turbulent transport in the water column and darcy s law for the pore water driven transport the instantaneous transport events were analyzed but when bed permeability increases 10 5 cm2 and the bulk reynolds number gets higher 9000 the predicted concentrations are lower than experimental data kessler et al 2015 used darcy s law for the permeable sandy sediment and a reactive transport model was also adopted to determine the potential effect of bed form celerity on denitrification the hydraulic head over the bed form was approximated by a sinusoidal function as higashino et al 2009 did in the previous numerical model studies due to the wide range of scales exhibited by the velocity and scalar fields the water side and the sediments side were generally separated and the momentum and scalar transport from the water to the sediments were simulated based on empirical correlations and parameterization of smooth beds dade 1993 nakamura and stefan 1994 qian et al 2009 for a very fine sediment bed it may be acceptable to ignore the effect of roughness but for a coarser and more permeable sediment bed such as gravel bed the empirical correlations and assumptions might be inaccurate the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of roughness on solute transfer over permeable beds specifically we want to identify controlling factors in solute transfer under different typical rough regimes especially under the completely rough regime les is used to simulate three dimensional flow above and within the mimics of the real bed in natural environments the sediment bed is simulated by packed particles rather than darcy s law and diffusion models adopted by scalo et al 2012 it can help to obtain more effective and accurate results different solute transfer processes caused by typical sediment beds and flow regimes are quantitatively analyzed they control a variety of microbial and biogeochemical processes in different water environments near the sediment bed which in turn influence the water quality in the overlying and flowing water we will determine under which conditions the effects of molecular diffusion represented by schmidt number can be neglected and show how mass transfer coefficient changes with roughness reynolds number in addition we will propose a scaling relationship to quantify the transfer coefficient in the rough regime over permeable bed 2 numerical method the les technique is adopted to model the solute transfer in different typical water environments the second edition of lesocc2 large eddy simulation on curvilinear coordinates was used which was first developed at the institute for hydromechanics of the karlsruhe institute of technology frohlich and rodi 2002 and it has successfully simulated many environmental flows in an open channel bai et al 2013 fang et al 2014 after filtering the incompressible navier stokes n s equations and the convection diffusion equation the dimensionless governing equations are 4 u i x i 0 5 u i t x j u i u j p x i x j υ u i x j u j x i τ i j x j 6 c t u i c x i ε 2 c x i 2 ϑ i x i s b where denotes resolved

reflects the influence of the subgrid scale turbulence structures on the large eddies the sgs stress τ ij is calculated through an eddy viscosity relation as 7 τ i j υ s g s u i x j u j x i 1 3 δ i j

germano et al 1991 to the scalar transport has been shown to be accurate calmet and magnaudet 1997 na 2004 so we also used the dynamic procedure to determine ε sgs the last term in eq 6 is the sink term which is used to estimate solute production or consumption inside the bed dissolved oxygen is adopted as a kind of representative solute to study the physics of transfer to permeable bed in this paper so s b was assumed to be zero in the overlying flow and a dominant sink for oxygen in the sediment since our focus is on sediment water exchange sweerts et al 1991 a sink term described by michaelis menten kinetics is used to represent the depletion by decomposing organic matter higashino and stefan 2011a 9 s b μ c c k o 2 c bed where μ c μ c l 2 υc b is the non dimensional maximum rate

do utilization and we adopt a typical value k o 2 0 2 mg l the most important and innovative part is the direct les simulation of flow and solute transport in the sediments without any kinds of models and assumptions such as models of pressure fluctuations induced by near bed coherent motions and models of darcy or non darcy pore water flow in sediments to simulate the flow through the particles the direct forcing immersed boundary method ibm peskin 1972 is incorporated into the les model the grids are divided into three types solid grids boundary grids and flow grids in the solid grids the velocity is forced to be zero in the flow grids the velocity is calculated through eqs 1 and 2 without any additional processes in the boundary grids a forcing source term is added to momentum equations to guarantee that the calculated velocities at the center of these grids are equal to actual values details of the model can be found in fang et al 2014 the numerical model used to compute the flow is a well validated finite volume method on curvilinear grids with a collocated variable arrangement hinterberger et al 2007 the convective fluxes in the momentum equations were approximated by a central difference scheme of second order accuracy and scalar transport fluxes were obtained by the hlpa scheme zhu 2010 the diffusive fluxes in both momentum and scalar transport equations were approximated using the central difference scheme a second order accurate runge kutta method was adopted for time discretization the poisson equation for pressure was solved after the final runge kutta step using the sip method of stone 1968 the code was parallelized using the message passing interface mpi protocol the computations were supported by thpcc tsinghua high performance computing center and tacc the texas advanced computing center at the university of texas at austin united states 3 computational setup sediments constructed by particles are more suitable to explore the effects of roughness on solute transfer over permeable beds since they are closer to real environments three kinds of beds with different surface topographies and permeability are conducted to represent the different bed surfaces in natural aqueous environments including lakes reservoirs fluvial and mountain rivers the detailed computational setups are shown in table 1 the roughness reynolds number re u υ can be used as an indicator of the rough wall turbulence regime where is the roughness height for the same bed surface is a constant and re is controlled by the friction flow velocity the hydraulically smooth regime for 0 re 5 the transitionally rough regime for 5 re 70 the completely rough regime for re 70 3 1 smooth channel for deep lakes or reservoirs in storage periods the bottom flow is slow and the sediments are very fine resulting in the low permeability so the bed is usually considered as smooth and impermeable the diffusion sublayer can effectively model solute transfer and this condition has been studied extensively the smooth channels with two solid wall are designed low and high schmidt numbers i e 1 100 and 200 see table 1 are analyzed by the thin film theory the size of the computational domain is set to be slightly larger than l x πh f and l y 3πh f 8 where h f is the channel depth at the walls z h f 2 no slip conditions are imposed the settings ensure that in both directions two point correlations are negligibly small for separation distances of the order of half the box size the friction reynolds number re f 0 5u h f υ is 650 which is essentially identical to that evaluated by calmet and magnaudet 1997 the grids settings initial concentration in water and constant concentration at the walls are also similar with calmet and magnaudet 1997 this case lies in the hydraulically smooth regime 0 re 5 it provides a verification of the present les approach through comparing with previous researches as well as a background for comparison with other cases in this study 3 2 permeable bed with small roughness for fluvial rivers the sand sized particles usually settle upon and between the gravel sized particles meanwhile fine benthic organic material can also settle onto the bed surface under low discharge conditions resulting in an anisotropic permeable bed with small roughness as shown in fig 2 a and b the permeable bed with small roughness is designed to study the solute transfer across the swi in which the roughness reynolds number re 4 13 20 and 96 is successively adopted covering the hydraulically smooth regime 0 re 5 the transitionally rough regime 5 re 70 and completely rough regime re 70 the sediments consist of a mixture of sand and gravel sized particles with the resulting d50 of about 5 mm and one layer of small particles with the diameter of 1 mm are settled above the mixed particles two sets of open channel experiments with that kind of bed geomorphology have been conducted by o connor and hondzo 2008 to study do transfer across the swi with the applied roughness reynolds number re of 4 and 20 which can be used for comparison with the simulated results the flow filed with each roughness reynolds number simultaneously transports three scalar fields i e a combination of three schmidt number sc 371 690 and 1020 corresponding to water temperatures of 25 c 15 c and 8 c for do to evaluate the impacts of molecular diffusion on solute transfer the maximum rate of do utilization μ c is set as 1000mg l d which is obtained from calibration with experimental results the boundary conditions of momentum equations are in the streamwise x and spanwise y directions periodic boundary is used for all quantities the wall function is adapted at the bottom and the water surface is assumed to be a rigid lid with a slip condition the water depth h f is 3 5 times the diameter of the biggest particle the boundary conditions of the scalar equation are the solute concentration is fixed at the water surface since the surface water is saturated with atmospheric oxygen the initial solute concentration is set as c b in water and zero in bed the grids are refined near the swi to capture more details about solute transfer as shown in fig 2 b the vertical minimum grid spaces δz min in wall units δz δz min u υ are 0 13 for re 4 0 38 for re 13 0 63 for re 20 and 3 18 for re 96 3 3 permeable bed with large roughness for flow over coarser sediment beds such as mountain rivers or the currents around a coral reef the flow is in completely rough regime boudreau and joergensen 2001 an underflow paralleling to the surface flow can also develop and the interaction between the surface and sub surface flow will cause a transition layer where darcy s law is no longer valid brinkman 1947 to study the characteristics of solute transfer over those beds the permeable beds with large roughness are also designed with re 114 231 and 477 the computational setup and grids are shown in fig 3 a and b the boundary conditions and scalar settings are similar with the permeable bed with small roughness the minimum grid spaces in wall units δz at the swi are 0 39 for re 114 0 80 for re 4 and 1 65 for re 477 the above hierarchy of sediment beds and flow regimes are linked to different solute transfer processes controlling a variety of microbial and biogeochemical processes in different water environments near the sediment bed which in turn influence the water quality in the overlying water 4 results and discussion in this section the results of smooth bed and the permeable bed with small roughness re 4 and 20 are first presented for verification then the case for the permeable bed with large roughness re 231 is used to investigate the flow and solute transfer both at the swi and in bed at last all cases with different roughness reynolds number are presented to discuss the influence of roughness on solute transfer over permeable beds 4 1 smooth channel re 0 for fine sediments without bed forms the molecular diffusion is the major mechanism for solute transfer through the swi which has been studied extensively as shown in figs 4 and 5 the distribution of the mean velocity and concentration profiles are plotted versus z h f 2 z u υ the mean velocity is normalized by the friction velocity u and the reference concentration c is used to normalize the concentration c as c c c 10 c d u c z z h f 2 because of the simple bed surface topography and the relatively slow flow the characteristic of various wall regions near bed is comparatively explicit close to the swi is the diffusive sublayer and dynamic sublayer the thickness of them i e δ c and δ u respectively are stable and can be got by a graphic estimate the profiles of c behave like sc z in the diffusive sublayer while the profiles of u are liner in the dynamic sublayer where z is the vertical coordinate in wall units fig 4 shows δ c δ u 5 at sc 1 and fig 5 shows the diffusive sublayer is much thinner than that of sc 1 at high schmidt number which is consistent with the theoretical results shaw and hanratty 1977 it means the molecular diffusion represented by schmidt number is a controlling factor over smooth beds above the diffusive layer there is a buffer layer using reynolds analogy kader and yaglom 1972 found that the mean concentration profiles followed by a logarithmic region in the buffer layer with the empirical expression as follows 11 c α ln z β s c where α 2 12 and an empirical expression for the function β sc is valid in the range 6 10 3 sc 4 104 figs 4 and 5 show that the present les agrees with the empirical expression 4 2 permeable bed with small roughness re 4 and 20 for permeable bed with small roughness the simulated results of cases with re 4 and 20 are directly compared to the laboratory data obtained by o connor and hondzo 2008 the flow parameters adopted in these experiments are summarized in table 2 we try to perform numerical simulations matching the fluid dynamic conditions of the experiments in fig 6 we compare the mean concentration profile computed by les with the experimental data from oc 1 and oc 2 the elevation z is normalized by the diameter of small particles d 1 mm the values of do utilization are calibrated by matching the numerical results against data for oc 1 then the resultant values are used for calculation to compare with oc 2 as shown in fig 6 the model predicts correct concentration at the swi and the penetration depth into the sediments for oc 2 with average relative error of 8 4 3 permeable bed with large roughness re 231 in this section we use a permeable bed with re 231 i e large roughness to investigate the solute transfer characteristics across the transition layer 4 3 1 length scale of the transition layer the approximate vertical extent of the transition layer is estimated via analysis of the flow in sediments the velocity fluctuates below a critical point and the depth of the critical point can be considered as the lower limit of the transition layer goharzadeh et al 2005 the same phenomena occurs in this study as shown in fig 7 the mean velocity inside the porous region is plotted with the streamwise mean velocity vector from z d 0 to z d 0 66 the mean velocity decreases monotonically while below which the velocity fluctuates the vertically averaged velocity below the critical point z d 0 66 is 0 0313u it is noticed that the mean velocity is negative at z d 0 66 because a vortex exists between two spheres below the transition layer the velocity component in the streamwise of pore water flow can be gotten by darcy s law higashino et al 2009 12 u x k h x k ρ g p x in which u x is the streamwise component of pore water flow in darcy layer h is the pressure head g is the gravitational acceleration p x is the pressure gradient in streamwise direction and k is the hydraulic conductivity which is related to permeability k in eq 13 13 k g υ k then we can get u x 0 0315u this result is quite close to that from fig 7 0 0313u confirming a darcy layer below the transition layer brinkman 1947 matched the stokes flow with the darcy flow and predicted a boundary layer thickness on the order of magnitude k however goharzadeh et al 2005 concluded that the boundary layer thickness was on the order of magnitude of the sediment diameter in the present work the thickness of the transition layer is 0 66d also suggesting the similarity between the magnitude of the thickness of transition layer and that of the grain size just as goharzadeh et al 2005 concluded 4 3 2 solute transfer in the transition layer we used quadrant analysis to investigate the solute transfer caused by turbulent motions in this transition layer quadrant analysis is a useful technique to describe how the turbulent fluctuations contribute to momentum or solute transfer through the swi the selected elevations are z d 1 2 0 3 and 0 representing darcy layer transition layer and the swi respectively the conventional quadrant method involves studying the relationship between temporal fluctuations of velocity components u and w correlation between u and w reveals the turbulent coherent structures e g outward interactions q1 u 0 w 0 ejections q2 u 0 w 0 inward interactions q3 u 0 w 0 sweeps q4 u 0 w 0 sweep events transport high momentum fluid downward to the sediments and ejection events transport low momentum fluid vertically upward away from the bed the ejection sweep phenomenon results in flushing of dead water which generally accumulates among the roughness elements so it is very important for the do transfer to sediments and the release of contaminants to overlying water grass 1971 in fig 8 the bubble maps are plotted with the dimensionless u and w and the size of bubbles represents the magnitude of dimensionless reynolds shear stress u w u 2 results show that in the darcy layer the dimensionless reynolds stresses are negligible with the magnitude of about 0 01 indicating that ejection sweep phenomenon is a modest factor in the momentum flux within the transition layer the magnitude of momentum increases but they seem to be similar in the four quadrants which is mainly caused by vortexes that exist between the top spheres at the swi the ejection sweep phenomenon is much more obvious with some instantaneous magnitudes even larger than 10 indicating the enhanced vertical transport of momentum toward the bed in a similar way the quadrant method is used to illustrate the relationship between the w and the concentration fluctuation c results indicate the existence of ejection and sweep motions of solute q1 w 0 c 0 q2 w 0 c 0 q3 w 0 c 0 q4 w 0 c 0 in fig 9 the fluctuations of vertical velocity are normalized by friction velocity u and the fluctuations of solute concentration are normalized by the bulk concentration c b the c is nearly zero in darcy layer so the quadrant map for that layer was omitted according to fig 9 the ejection sweep phenomenon is not a major factor in solute flux as motions are nearly isotropic in the transition layer which is caused by cavity vortex among roughness as shown in fig 7 the vortexes will increase concentration homogeneity in cavity i e smaller c and also reduce the exchange with overlying water therefore the water between roughness elements becomes dead water and the solute transfer to the deeper layer is limited even though the turbulent diffusivity at the swi is high 4 4 effect of roughness on mass transfer coefficient in this section all simulation results including the smooth channel permeable bed with small roughness and permeable bed with large roughness are summarized by the mass transfer coefficient k l calculated by eqns 2 and 3 to investigate the effect of roughness on solute transfer fig 10 shows the relationship between dimensionless mass transfer coefficient k l and schmidt number sc for flat channels the semi empirical correlation suggests that k l sc 2 3 kader and yaglom 1972 at low schmidt numbers and k l sc 0 7 at higher ones shaw and hanratty 1977 as shown in fig 10 the predicted points lie on the theoretical line for permeable beds with small roughness the predicted points also lie on the theoretical line when the roughness reynolds number in the smooth regime re 4 however when the roughness reynolds number increases to the transition regime re 13 20 the mass transfer coefficients are enhanced to similar level for different schmidt numbers indicating that the effect of sc number decreases for permeable beds with large roughness similar phenomenon is also observed that there is no apparent effect of sc number on the mass transfer coefficient the spatial distribution of solute concentration fluctuations c and vertical velocity fluctuations w u are shown in fig 11 to illustrate the enhanced effect of turbulent diffusion on solute transfer if the negative w u patches corresponds to the positive c patches or positive w u patches corresponds to the negative c patches at the same position we can speculate that turbulent diffusion dominates solute transfer at that position for smooth channels re 0 the horizontal plane at z 6 is adopted which is the edge of the diffusive sublayer for sc 1 for rough and permeable beds the horizontal plane at the swi z 0 is adopted for re 20 i e transition regime and re 231 i e completely rough regime it should be noticed that the maximum and minimum levels of w u in the legend for smooth channels are different from those for rough and permeable beds in fig 11 a the vertical velocity fluctuations w u are quite small due to the smooth and impermeable bed and elongated streaky patches can develop with relatively low density in fig 11 b and c both the magnitude of w u and density of patches increase as a result of bed permeability and high re illustrating the enhanced effect of turbulent diffusion moreover to evaluate the efficiency of turbulent diffusion the correlation coefficient r cw between c and w is calculated as 14 r c w a c w d s a c 2 d s a w 2 d s where a is the total area of the horizontal plane and ds is an infinitesimal area element results show that the r cw is 0 35 0 37 and 0 45 for fig 11 a c respectively it means with the increasing of bed roughness and permeability the turbulent diffusion which is represented by the correlation between w u and c is enhanced meanwhile the structures are more irregular in rough and permeable beds because strong vertical velocities prevent the development of elongated streaky structures another interesting result in fig 10 is that for permeable bed with small roughness as roughness reynolds number re increases from 20 to 96 k l only increases slightly and for permeable bed with large roughness i e re 114 231 and 477 there is a slightly declining trend of mass transfer coefficient with increasing roughness reynolds number this is caused by cavity vortexes in the transition layer which suppress the solute transfer to the deeper layer moreover the convergent value of k l for more permeable beds i e k h f 2 8 54 10 6 is larger than that for less permeable beds i e k h f 2 3 49 10 7 implying that bed permeability plays a dominant role in rough regime the reason may be the enhanced interaction between pore water flow in darcy layer and the flow in the transition layer 4 5 scaling model and comparison with experimental data based on the simulation results we try to propose a scaling model to determine the mass transfer coefficient in the completely rough regime it is assumed that the solute transfer at the swi in the completely rough regime is a function of friction velocity flow depth and bed permeability 15 k l f u h f k where k l is the mass transfer velocity defined by eq 2 eq 15 contains four variables that are composed of two dimensions l and t which results in the possibility of two groupings the selected dimensionless parameters and functional relationship can be written as 16 k l u f k h f 2 or in the form of a power law scaling 17 k l u a k h f 2 b where a is a dimensionless constant and b is determined by calibration using observed data because of the limited simulation data some experimental results with roughness reynolds number larger than 70 are also used to determine a and b nagaoka and ohgaki 1990 packman et al 2004 tonina and buffington 2007 inoue and nakamura 2011 and the corresponding conditions of sediment and fluid flow are listed in table 3 as shown in fig 12 positive correlations are observed for k l k l u with k h f 2 with the slope 0 2 and r 2 0 9 the final k l scaling equation is 18 k l u 1 3 k h f 2 0 2 re 70 in fig 13 the simulation results of permeable bed cases are plotted with more experimental results including both transition and rough regimes and the experimental conditions are also listed in table 3 there is a general tendency that k l k h f 2 0 2 increases with roughness reynolds number re in the transition regime and fluctuates around 1 3 in the completely rough regime however as the simulations and the proposed model do not consider the effects of bed forms which can enhance the mass exchange between overlying water and sediments some experimental results with bed forms already approach 1 3 in the transition regime elliott and brooks 1997 marion et al 2002 for very fine sediments e g organic silt early arrival of the limit value in the transition regime is also observed by inoue and nakamura 2011 which may be caused by the especially low permeability 5 discussion the presence of do in the overlying water and the legacy of contaminants in sediments are increasingly posing limits on the water quality the transport of these solutes is strongly influenced by the sediment water mass transfer coefficient standard models of mass transport at the swi assume that there is a chemical dependency represented by the relationship with schmidt number thibodeaux et al 2010 in section 4 4 the present work shows that this dependence is largely overcome by surface roughness and the dependence on schmidt number is often unimportant in the flow over a rough sediment bed observations do show a weakening of schmidt number dependence with roughness thibodeaux et al 2010 but observations are often limited by a small variations in schmidt number and surface roughness this study suggests that the schmidt number correlations typically used in the water quality community may underestimate mass transfer coefficients in the fully rough regime which is quite common in fast moving rivers and streams note that observations or correlations based upon observations adequately represent sediment water exchange the difficulty lies in extrapolating those correlations to other conditions in that our work suggests that the schmidt number dependence often assumed is incorrect for fully rough beds in addition by considering the influence of roughness over permeable bed this study successfully reproduce the observed do profiles o connor and hondzo 2008 in the transitionally rough regime in section 4 2 an explanation of that finding may be as follows for rivers with small scale roughness the roughness reynolds number falls in the smooth regime when the bottom flow is slow and the diffusive sublayer covers the roughness elements resulting in similar characteristics with the smooth channel as shown by case re 4 in fig 10 i e the schmidt number is a controlling factor in mass transfer coefficient as the flow velocity increases if we adopt the assumption of a smooth bed as previous models did higashino and stefan 2008 2011a scalo et al 2012 the thickness of diffusive layer will get thinner but it still plays a key role in controlling solute transport across the swi scalo et al 2012 performed les with bulk reynolds number re 9019 which is similar to our case with re 8970 simulated results showed lower scalar concentration than the experimental data higashino and stefan 2008 2011a also observed the disagreement between their model and the experimental data they both thought the fully considered bed permeability could improve the result but the underestimated concentration as well as turbulence driven transport around the swi still arose in subsequent investigations here the results in section 4 4 may shed some light to these issues as roughness reynolds number re increases the mass transfer coefficient k l is no longer a function of schmidt number which represents the molecular diffusive properties of the solute it suggests that the roughness disrupts the diffusive layer and causes turbulent motions which can transport solute more efficiently across the swi so fully considered bed roughness is also very important to improve the simulated results another important finding is that the transition layer in very coarse sediment beds suppresses the solute transfer to the deeper layer leading to an almost constant solute transfer coefficient with increasing roughness reynolds number re this tendency is qualitatively similar with some experiments on environmental engineering dipprey and sabersky 1963 dawson and trass 1972 inoue and nakamura 2011 but few explanations and quantitative analyses are found in previous researches by quadrant analysis in section 4 3 we found that the isotropic characteristics in turbulent diffusion is the main reason for this tendency higashino and stefan 2011b extended the previous analysis to coarser beds by adopting the near bed turbulence that was derived for a solid flat surface leading to no slip velocity at the swi thus their results deviated from experimental data for very coarse beds in the present study with the constructed rough and permeable beds we can reproduce the fully developed turbulent flow around the swi more accurately than the flat surface so the nature of the scalar transport caused by turbulence can be seen clearly based on the transfer mechanisms in the fully rough regime discussed in section 4 4 a scaling model is proposed in section 4 5 which shows a comforting coincidence with experimental data since the diffusive sublayer and concentration gradient in that layer is effectively meaningless in the fully rough regime the scaling relationship may be more helpful to estimate the solute flux between overlying water and sediments which is a basic task for water quality management 6 conclusion this study develops a unified 3d model for solute transfer from water to the sediment bed with les and the exchange at the sediment water interface is successfully predicted for rough and permeable beds the mechanism of solute transfer is further discussed covering a wide range of flow conditions especially in the completely rough regime re 70 and the main findings are as follows 1 over a rough and permeable bed the do concentration at the swi and the depth of penetration from o connor and hondzo 2008 results are successfully predicted by considering bed roughness under the transitionally rough regime 2 for permeable beds beyond the hydraulically smooth regime i e re 5 the ejection sweep events can enhance vertical solute transfer toward the bed and the solute transfer coefficient is no longer dependent on schmidt number 3 for permeable bed under the completely rough regime re 70 the transition layer suppresses the transfer to the deeper layer by cavity vortex the solute transfer coefficient k l is enhanced by the bed permeability rather than roughness reynolds number 4 using friction velocity u flow depth h f and bed permeability k the mass transfer velocity k l is estimated for the completely rough regime which shows reasonable agreement with experimental data from a variety of sources acknowledgments this

19828,to assess the fate and long term reactivity of bimetallic nanoparticles used in groundwater remediation it is important to trace the physicochemical transformation of nanoparticles during aging in water this study investigated the short term within 5 d and long term up to 90 d aging process of fe ni bimetallic nanoparticles fe ni bnps in simulated groundwater and the consequent effect on the particle reactivity results indicate that the morphological compositional and structural transformation of fe ni bnps happened during the aging in the 5 d short term aging fe0 corrosion occurred rapidly and was transformed to ferrous ions which were adsorbed onto the surface of fe ni bnps accompanied by the elevation of solution ph and the negative redox potential in the long term aging scanning electron microscopy sem images show that the particles transformed from spherical to rod like and further to sheet like and needle like x ray diffraction xrd analysis reveals that the main aging product was magnetite fe3o4 and or maghemite γ fe2o3 after aging for 60 90 d energy dispersive spectrometer eds analysis demonstrates that the mass ratio of fe ni increased with aging revealing that ni were possibly gradually entrapped and covered by the iron oxides besides the release of ni into solution was also detected during the aging the reactivity of the aged fe ni bnps was examined by studying its performance in tetracycline tc removal the aged fe ni bnps within 2 d kept similar removal efficiency of tc as the fresh particles however the removal efficiency of tc by fe ni bnps aged for 5 15 d dropped by 20 50 due to aggregation and oxidation of particles and the removal efficiency further decreased slowly with the prolongation of aging time up to 90 d this reveals that fe ni bnps were vulnerable to passivation in water environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords aging bimetallic nanoparticles characterization reactivity transformation 1 introduction bimetallic iron nanoparticles bnps comprised of nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi as the base metal and a small amount of noble metal as catalyst additives have been widely studied for the potential application in groundwater and soil remediation han and yan 2014 since fowkes and anderson first reported fe al bimetallic particles in 1970 fowkes et al 2002 various types of bnps e g fe ni fe cu fe pd and fe pt have been synthesized successfully leistner et al 2006 cao et al 2011 fang et al 2011 nie et al 2013 lin et al 2015 compared with monometallic iron nanoparticles bnps show much better performance in site remediation of contaminants lien and zhang 2007 choi et al 2008 lin et al 2015 in the bnps system fe0 has a lower redox potential and acts as an electron donator which is sacrificed to be oxidized the added noble metal usually acts as a catalyst to accelerate the production of atomic hydrogen or hydride thus increasing the reductive degradation and preventing formation of toxic byproducts zhu and lim 2007 lee and sedlak 2008 chun et al 2010 greenlee et al 2012 however the reactivity of bnps could be gradually reduced when exposed to water liu et al 2015 dong et al 2016a since the bnps have large specific area and high reactivity they tend to corrode in water environment guan et al 2015 dong et al 2017a and then the composition and structure of bnps could be transformed during the corrosion process greenlee et al 2012 previous studies showed that different kinds of iron oxides maghemite magnetite and lepidocrocite were generated with time of aging when fe0 nanoparticles were exposed to water reinsch et al 2013 dong et al 2016a 2017b xie et al 2017a dong et al 2017b correspondingly various kinds of structures spherical needle like sheet like and plate like were found during the aging time greenlee et al 2012 liu et al 2015 dong et al 2016a 2017b the differences in morphology and composition could be attributed to the geochemical conditions solution composition ph orp the preparation method of nanoparticles febh and feh2 produced respectively by the borohydride reduction method and the hydrogen reduction method and the aging time kim et al 2012 reinsch et al 2013 han and yan 2014 liu et al 2015 hence it is important to trace the physicochemical transformation of nanoparticles during short time and long time aging in order to better understand their fate and long term reactivity wiesner et al 2006 reinsch et al 2013 however most of the previous studies focused on the reactivity of fresh bnps toward contaminants nie et al 2013 kuang et al 2015 there were little study systematically probed the physical and chemical transformation of bnps during aging in groundwater and the consequent effect on the removal efficiency of target contaminant therefore in this study we prepared fe ni bnps and systematically investigated their short term in hours and days and long term aging in months in simulated groundwater and the performance of the aged fe ni bnps in contaminant removal the specific objectives of this study were to 1 probe the corrosion kinetics of fe ni bnps in simulated groundwater 2 investigate the morphological compositional and structural transformation of fe ni bnps in simulated groundwater during short term aging within 5d and long term aging up to 90 d and 3 study the removal efficiency of target contaminant by the aged fe ni bnps tetracycline tc a symbol of antibiotics which were commonly detected in the environments and pose potential risks to human health and the environment storteboom et al 2010 lu et al 2017 was chosen as the target contaminant in this study 2 materials and method 2 1 materials and chemical agents the chemical agents used in the experiments including fecl3 6h2o nicl2 6h2o nabh4 ethanol hcl naoh nacl nahco3 na2so4 and cacl26h2o were all of reagent grade and obtained from the local reagent suppliers of changsha tetracycline tc 98 purity was bought from hefei bomei biotechnology co ltd the stock solutions were all prepared by using deoxygenated ultrapure water purged with n2 for at least 30 min before use to guarantee an anaerobic environment suwannee river humic acid ha purchased from the international humic substances society usa was dissolved into ultrapure water followed by being filtered through a membrane 0 45 μm pore diameter for the preparation of ha stock solution simulated groundwater were prepared with 230 mg l 1 na 32 mg l 1 ca2 234 mg l 1 cl 183 mg l 1 hco3 96 mg l 1 so4 2 and 2 mg l 1 ha leeden 1990 the concentrations of the reagents were all within the typical ranges in natural groundwater dong et al 2012 the ph of the simulated groundwater was set at 7 00 to prevent from unexpected oxidation of the particles fe ni bnps were always freshly prepared before the experiments 2 2 synthesis of fe ni bnps fe ni bnps were prepared by sodium borohydride nabh4 reduction method as described in other study zhang et al 2014 briefly an appropriate amount of fecl3 6h2o and nicl2 6h2o were diluted in the mixture of 100 ml ultrapure water and 100 ml ethanol and transferred to a 500 ml three necked flask for mixing 30 min with a mechanical blender and then excessive amount of nabh4 was added into the flask drop by drop to make sure that the fe ni solution was completely reduced the solution was mixed for another 30 min after the addition of nabh4 during the whole synthesis process the mixture was purged with n2 to prevent from possible oxidation of fe ni then fe ni bnps were isolated with magnet and washed three times with deoxygenated ultrapure water and ethanol to eliminate excessive nabh4 finally the fe ni bnps were vacuum dried overnight at 50 c in this study fe ni bnps with three contents of ni 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt were prepared with the same process 2 3 aging of fe ni bnps the aging study was conducted with fe ni bnps 1 g l suspensions prepared in simulated groundwater in 50 ml borosilicate sample vials no air space then the samples were capped and placed in dark room for aging given that the particles will settle in the vial with aging time reducing the surface contact with groundwater the suspensions were vigorous shaken with hands once daily filip et al 2014 dong et al 2017b fe ni bnps were separated by magnet attraction followed by filtration using 0 45 μm membrane after desired times of aging short term 0 h 2 h 4 h 8 h 12 h 24 h 48 h 72 h 96 h and 120 h long term 15 d 30 d 60 d and 90 d and then vacuum dried for further characterization the variations of ph and oxidation reduction potential orp during aging were monitored by using a ph orp meter inesa phs 3c the aging samples were also filtered with 0 45 μm membrane for the determination of the total concentration of soluble fe and ni in the filtrates the concentrations of total fe in filtrates were quantified by a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu japan at 510 nm with phenanthroline spectrophotometry lin et al 2015 the concentrations of ni in filtrates were measured by using the flame atomic absorption spectrometry aas peaa700 america 2 4 removal of tc by fe ni bnps the fresh and aged fe ni bnps 1 g l with different contents of ni 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt were used to remove tc 100 mg l in simulated groundwater the reaction solution was filtered with 0 45 μm filter membrane at desired time 5 10 15 30 60 90 120 180 240 300 min and then the concentration of tc was measured by uv vis spectrophotometer at 357 nm li et al 2017a 2 5 spectroscopic characterization of fresh and aged fe ni bnps scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6700f japan was used to observe the surface morphology and structure of fe ni bnps energy dispersive spectrometer eds which was linked to sem could identify the chemical element existence in fe ni bnps and the corresponding proportion of element content x ray diffraction xrd analyses used to identify the transformation of chemical species in the aged fe ni bnps were conducted with cu kα radiation using a rigaku d max 2500 at 40 kv 250 ma continuous scans were collected from 10 to 80 at 2 θ with a speed of 0 01 every size step 3 results and discussion 3 1 corrosion of fe ni bnps during short term aging in the field application of iron based nanoparticles nps the variation of ph orp and dissolved iron concentration in the aqueous environment are commonly monitored to indirectly demonstrate the occurrence of corrosion reactions of the iron based nps reinsch et al 2013 guan et al 2015 dong et al 2017b the information is of great importance for the further determination of the life time and fate of the nps in the subsurface environment it was reported that the corrosion of metallic iron nps occurs rapidly and could be transformed to ferrous iron oxide in a short time of aging liu et al 2015 dong et al 2016a therefore to probe the corrosion kinetics of fe ni bnps in simulated groundwater a short term within 5 d aging of fe ni bnps with different ni contents 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt was conducted and the variations of ph orp and concentration of total soluble fe in solution during the aging were monitored fig 1 a c fig 1a displays the variation of ph in solution during the period of 5 d aging the three kinds of fe ni bnps had similar variation trends of ph which increased sharply in the initial 2 h and then changed little in the following aging time for fe ni bnps with ni content of 3 wt and 5 wt ph fluctuated between 8 8 and 9 1 and ph varied around 8 6 for fe ni bnps with ni content of 1 wt the variation of ph resulted from the corrosion of fe ni bnps in simulated groundwater the corrosion process might be described as follows crane and scott 2012 guan et al 2015 gao et al 2016 1 fe 2h fe2 h2 2 fe 2h2o fe2 h2 2oh 3 2fe2 2h2o 2fe3 h2 2oh 4 fe2 2oh fe oh 2 5 fe3 2h2o feooh 3h the trends of ph variation suggest that the corrosion of fe0 in water eqs 1 3 was fast since the ph increased sharply in the initial 2 h due to the large specific area and high reactivity of fe ni bnps the corrosion occurred rapidly which resulted in the rapid consumption of h and the large release of oh in the following time the reactions eqs 4 and 5 might proceed gradually which balanced the solution ph fig 1b presents the changes of orp in the simulated groundwater during 5 d aging of fe ni bnps the orp decreased sharply from 252 mv to 594 759 mv and 848 mv with ni loading of 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt respectively the decrease of orp was mainly ascribed to the corrosion of fe ni bnps since fe0 had strong reduction capacity and the loading of ni promoted the reduction process li et al 2017b therefore with the increase of ni loading the orp decreased faster the decrease of orp got slower after 2 d of aging which displayed a similar trend with the ph variation this might be ascribed to the slower corrosion of fe ni bnps after aging for 2 d resulting from the gradual surface passivation of fe ni bnps in the process of aging guan et al 2015 liu et al 2015 dong et al 2016a the results indicate that fe ni bnps are indeed efficient reductant but could possibly lose their ability rapidly due to progressive electron loss from anaerobic corrosion fig 1c shows the total concentration of soluble fe in filtrate of aged samples in consistent with the variation trend of ph and orp the soluble fe concentration increased sharply in the first few hours of aging higher content of ni in fe ni bnps resulted in higher concentration of soluble fe in the filtrate which should be ascribed to the ni accelerated corrosion of fe0 in the case of fe ni bnps ni 5 wt the concentration of fe firstly increased to 1 mg l and then decreased to 0 7 mg l which might be due to the adsorption or precipitation of iron ions on the particle surface with aging time while for the other samples the fe concentration fluctuated slightly and generally kept stable in the following aging time up to 5 d however the concentration of total soluble fe in filtrate was quite low and the maximum value with ni of 5 wt was only below 1 mg l although the initial concentration of fe ni bnps was 1 g l this phenomenon reveals that a majority of corrosion ions such as fe2 and fe3 might be adsorbed onto the surface of fe ni bnps or settled as precipitates as seen from the aging vials the color of fe ni bnps gradually transformed from black suspensions to green within 5 d of aging shown in figure s1 which indicates the formation of green rust the green rust could be evidently observed in the samples aged for 2 3 d and the green color turned deeper when the aging time was prolonged to 4 5 d the similar phenomena were also observed in other studies ritter et al 2002 dong et al 2017b dong et al 2017b investigated the aging of nzvi and found that the nzvi suspensions turned from black to blue green when the aging time was over 5 d and the color became deeper with the increasing aging time ritter et al 2002 showed that the green rust could be formed in both water and trichloroethylene tce solution due to the corrosion of iron overall the variation trends of ph orp and soluble fe concentration with aging time manifest that the corrosion of fe ni bnps was aggressive in the first few hours and was slowed down or even ceased in the following aging time on the contrary the color of the suspension changed all through the aging time which indicates that the corrosion products on the surface of fe ni bnps were not stable in the examined aging time these results reveal that although the corrosion of fe ni bnps was fast the physicochemical transformation of corrosion products on the surface of fe ni bnps would last for a longer time therefore it was presumed that the green rust observed in the short term aging could be an intermediate product which could further transform into other types of iron oxide in a prolonged aging time the transformation would be systematically introduced in the later section of long term aging 3 2 removal of tetracycline tc by fresh and aged fe ni bnps as demonstrated above the corrosion of fe ni bnps occurred rapidly in the simulated groundwater which could possibly lead to the rapid loss of their reactivity toward contaminants due to progressive electron loss from the anaerobic corrosion fe ni bnps have been employed to deal with a wide range of organic pollutants e g polybrominated diphenyl ethers trichloroethylene pentachlorophenol and microcystin lr fang et al 2011 han and yan 2014 lin et al 2015 gao et al 2016 in this section the removal of tetracycline tc was used to express the reactivity of the aged fe ni bnps tc is one of typical antibiotics which are used as pharmaceuticals first and then be used as feed additives poultry and aquaculture gu and karthikeyan 2005 li et al 2010 wang et al 2015 residues generated ended up partly in groundwater gottschall et al 2012 fu et al 2015 and then resulted in potential risks lu et al 2017 fig 2 a displays the removal of tc by fe ni bnps with ni content of 1 wt for fresh and 1 d aged fe ni bnps the removal of tc reached equilibrium after 1 h and tc was almost completely removed when the aging time was 2 d and 5 d the equilibrium time got to be 2 h and the removal efficiency decreased to 92 5 and 82 3 respectively fig 2b shows the removal of tc by fe ni bnps with ni content of 3 wt the removal efficiency of tc was only slightly decreased within 2 d aging but was remarkably decreased from approximately 100 72 6 after 5 d of aging similar phenomenon was found for fe ni bnps with ni content of 5 wt fig 2c and the removal efficiency decreased to 80 6 the results verify that fe ni bnps aged for 1 2 d still hold the similar reactivity towards contaminants as the fresh particles even though the corrosion of fe ni bnps occurred rapidly within a few hours as discussed in the previous section this proves that the initial corrosion process of fe ni bnps did not have much influence on their reactivity it was presumed that the surfaces of fe ni bnps were not passivated within 2 d of aging however the reactivity of fe ni bnps decreased significantly after 5 d of aging which might be ascribed to the gradual accumulation of precipitates of iron oxy hydroxides on the surface covering the reactive sites kim et al 2012 guan et al 2015 to further investigate the influence of long term aging on the reactivity of fe ni bnps fe ni bnps with ni content of 5 wt aged up to 90 d was chosen as a representative for the removal of tc fig 2c shows that the removal efficiency of tc decreased sharply with the increasing aging time from 5 d 80 6 to 15 d 51 4 and 90 d 38 9 the reason for the sharp drop in removal efficiency of tc could possibly be ascribed to the generation of passivation layer on the surface of fe ni bnps during the long term aging kim et al 2012 guan et al 2015 which hindered the contact between reaction sites of fe ni bnps and tc to clarify the physicochemical transformation of fe ni bnps during the long term aging the compositional and structural evolution of fe ni bnps were investigated over a period of 90 d and the results are shown in the following section 3 3 structural and compositional evolution of fe ni bnps during the long term aging 3 3 1 sem analysis fig 3 displays the sem images of fresh and aged fe ni bnps which demonstrates the morphological and structural changes of fe ni bnps at different aging time fig 3a presents the image of fresh fe ni bnps which were in spherical with the size of nanoscale for most of them these particles were formed together in chain structure which was due to magnetic and electronic interactions among the particles lin et al 2015 after 5 d of aging larger size aggregates were observed and these particles were no more spherical but were transformed to be rod like fig 3b when the aging time reaches 15 d and 30 d some sheet like particles were formed fig 3c and d for longer time of aging fig 3e and f the particles came to be flaky like and needle like especially for particles aged for 90 d similar morphology transformations during long time aging were observed in bare nzvi particles dong et al 2016a found that some needle like particles were observed after aging for 60 d and 90 d liu et al 2015 manifested that the primary core shell structure of nzvi disintegrated after 90 d of aging and plate like and sheet like minerals were the main products the structural transformations of the particles from spherical to the new structures e g rod like sheet like and needle like were as a result of the outward diffusion of iron ions from the nzvi core and formation of new oxide phases on the particle surface liu et al 2015 dong et al 2016a besides it should be noted that the aggregation and oxidation of particles led to the increase of particle size during aging thus they were no longer nanoscale after aging which had enormous influence on the reactivity of fe ni bnps since the specific surface area diminished a lot compared with the fresh prepared fe ni bnps with the size of nanoscale and this should be one factor that resulted in the sharp drop in the removal of tc by the aged fe ni bnps nevertheless the drastic physical transformation of fe ni bnps with aging conveys important information for the risk assessment of environmental application of the fe ni bnps in subsurface remediation 3 3 2 xrd analysis xrd analysis shows the composition evolution and crystalline change of fe ni bnps in simulated groundwater over a period of 90 d fig 4 for the fresh fe ni bnps 0 d the peak at 2 θ of 44 45 should be ascribed to fe0 nurmi et al 2005 dong et al 2017b however the peak of ni is not showed which might be due to the facts that the peak of ni is similar to that of fe and the loading of ni is too low to be detected by xrd similar phenomena were reported in other studies fang et al 2011 gao et al 2016 gao et al 2016 used xrd to characterize fe0 fe ni and fe pd and found that either ni or pd was not observed fang et al 2011 reported that ni was not detected in fe ni nanoparticles thus the existence of ni would be certified later by other technique i e eds in the aged samples the peak m represents magnetite fe3o4 and or maghemite γ fe2o3 the other peak l ascribes to lepidocrocite γ feooh as seen from the xrd patterns for the freshly prepared fe ni bnps the only peak is fe0 and its intensity got much weaker and almost disappeared after 5 d of aging indicating fe0 has been exhausted with aging l and m appeared in the 5 d aged fe ni bnps and the intensity increased with aging time from 5 d to 30 d when the aging time was prolonged to 60 d and 90 d there was no l detected and the only iron oxide was m which manifests that the fe ni bnps were completely transformed to iron oxide the loss of reactive fe0 and the formation of iron oxide with aging further explained the significant decrease of tc removal by the aged fe ni bnps 3 3 3 eds analysis given the presence of ni in the fe ni bnps plays an important role as a catalyst in keeping the high reactivity of the bnps the transformation of ni on the surface of fe0 with aging is necessary to be analyzed as shown in table 1 the results of eds analysis reveal that fe ni o were the main elements existing on the surface of fe ni bnps the existence of ni demonstrates the successful synthesis of fe ni bnps it was also found that the weight ratio of these elements changed with the aging time the weight ratio of o increased rapidly in the first 5 d which was 36 3 for the freshly prepared fe ni bnps and 48 5 for the 5 d aged bnps the sharp increase of o indicates that the fe ni bnps were oxidized fast in short term aging this was consistent with the finding in the previous short term aging experiment the fe0 corrosion process was fast and consequently some iron oxide appeared during the process leading to the increase of o for the following time the content of o increased gradually and reached to 66 9 correspondingly the weight ratio of fe decreased fast in the short term aging and got slow in the following aging time it decreased from 58 8 at 0 d to 32 8 at 90 d this further certified that the transformation of fe occurred throughout the aging time interestingly the weight ratio of ni decreased quickly during the aging process when the aging time was over 30 d the weight ratio of ni decreased significantly from initial value of 4 9 0 7 and the corresponding mass ratio of fe ni increased remarkably with the aging time this was likely due to the wrapping of ni by iron oxide han and yan 2014 given the dislodgment of ni would result in the reactivity loss of fe ni bnps this could be one of the reasons for the decreased reactivity in tc removal by the aged fe ni bnps zhu and lim 2007 also showed that the aged pd fe nanoparticles were less efficient due to the encapsulation by iron oxide nevertheless the decrease of weight ratio of ni could also possibly be due to the release of ni from the surface of fe ni bnps during the aging to examine the possible remobilization of ni from particle surface into solution the concentrations of ni in the filtrate of the aged samples were examined table 2 the results show that there were little ni released into solution with maximum value of 1 22 mg l detected after 90 d of aging compared with the initial ni content 1 g l fe ni bnps with ni content of 5 wt this further verified that most of ni was capsuled by iron oxide but not leached out to external environment during the aging besides the information verifies that the real application of fe ni bnps in environment may pose minimal risk to the safety of environment due to the dramatic structural and compositional transformation of fe ni bnps the concerns about the risk of engineered nanoparticles might be over exaggerated in the previous studies dong et al 2016b xie et al 2017b 4 conclusions in the short term aging of fe ni bnps the ph orp and concentration of soluble iron changed drastically in the first few hours and kept stable in the following aging time up to 5 d this demonstrates that the corrosion of fe ni bnps in simulated groundwater occurred rapidly within hours the results indicate that fe ni bnps are indeed efficient reductant but may lose their reactivity rapidly due to fast electron loss from corrosion physicochemical transformations of the corrosion products were observed in the long term aging process up to 90 d fe ni bnps transformed from nanoscale spherical particle to larger sized flaky like and needle like oxides with aging time fe0 rapidly disappeared and magnetite fe3o4 and or maghemite γ fe2o3 were the main aging products in addition most of ni on the surface of fe ni bnps were gradually wrapped by the iron oxides with the aging time the results reveal that the environmental application of fe ni bnps may pose very little risk to the safety of human health and the environment reactivity of the aged fe ni bnps was investigated by examining the removal of tetracycline tc take fe ni bnps 5 wt as an example the removal efficiency of tc was only slightly decreased within 2 d aging 100 but was remarkably decreased with the increasing aging time from 5 d 80 6 to 15 d 51 4 and 90 d 38 9 this should be due to the loss of reactive fe0 the accumulation of precipitates of iron oxides on the particle surface and the wrapping of ni by the iron oxide during the aging process acknowledgments this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china

understand their fate and long term reactivity wiesner et al 2006 reinsch et al 2013 however most of the previous studies focused on the reactivity of fresh bnps toward contaminants nie et al 2013 kuang et al 2015 there were little study systematically probed the physical and chemical transformation of bnps during aging in groundwater and the consequent effect on the removal efficiency of target contaminant therefore in this study we prepared fe ni bnps and systematically investigated their short term in hours and days and long term aging in months in simulated groundwater and the performance of the aged fe ni bnps in contaminant removal the specific objectives of this study were to 1 probe the corrosion kinetics of fe ni bnps in simulated groundwater 2 investigate the morphological compositional and structural transformation of fe ni bnps in simulated groundwater during short term aging within 5d and long term aging up to 90 d and 3 study the removal efficiency of target contaminant by the aged fe ni bnps tetracycline tc a symbol of antibiotics which were commonly detected in the environments and pose potential risks to human health and the environment storteboom et al 2010 lu et al 2017 was chosen as the target contaminant in this study 2 materials and method 2 1 materials and chemical agents the chemical agents used in the experiments including fecl3 6h2o nicl2 6h2o nabh4 ethanol hcl naoh nacl nahco3 na2so4 and cacl26h2o were all of reagent grade and obtained from the local reagent suppliers of changsha tetracycline tc 98 purity was bought from hefei bomei biotechnology co ltd the stock solutions were all prepared by using deoxygenated ultrapure water purged with n2 for at least 30 min before use to guarantee an anaerobic environment suwannee river humic acid ha purchased from the international humic substances society usa was dissolved into ultrapure water followed by being filtered through a membrane 0 45 μm pore diameter for the preparation of ha stock solution simulated groundwater were prepared with 230 mg l 1 na 32 mg l 1 ca2 234 mg l 1 cl 183 mg l 1 hco3 96 mg l 1 so4 2 and 2 mg l 1 ha leeden 1990 the concentrations of the reagents were all within the typical ranges in natural groundwater dong et al 2012 the ph of the simulated groundwater was set at 7 00 to prevent from unexpected oxidation of the particles fe ni bnps were always freshly prepared before the experiments 2 2 synthesis of fe ni bnps fe ni bnps were prepared by sodium borohydride nabh4 reduction method as described in other study zhang et al 2014 briefly an appropriate amount of fecl3 6h2o and nicl2 6h2o were diluted in the mixture of 100 ml ultrapure water and 100 ml ethanol and transferred to a 500 ml three necked flask for mixing 30 min with a mechanical blender and then excessive amount of nabh4 was added into the flask drop by drop to make sure that the fe ni solution was completely reduced the solution was mixed for another 30 min after the addition of nabh4 during the whole synthesis process the mixture was purged with n2 to prevent from possible oxidation of fe ni then fe ni bnps were isolated with magnet and washed three times with deoxygenated ultrapure water and ethanol to eliminate excessive nabh4 finally the fe ni bnps were vacuum dried overnight at 50 c in this study fe ni bnps with three contents of ni 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt were prepared with the same process 2 3 aging of fe ni bnps the aging study was conducted with fe ni bnps 1 g l suspensions prepared in simulated groundwater in 50 ml borosilicate sample vials no air space then the samples were capped and placed in dark room for aging given that the particles will settle in the vial with aging time reducing the surface contact with groundwater the suspensions were vigorous shaken with hands once daily filip et al 2014 dong et al 2017b fe ni bnps were separated by magnet attraction followed by filtration using 0 45 μm membrane after desired times of aging short term 0 h 2 h 4 h 8 h 12 h 24 h 48 h 72 h 96 h and 120 h long term 15 d 30 d 60 d and 90 d and then vacuum dried for further characterization the variations of ph and oxidation reduction potential orp during aging were monitored by using a ph orp meter inesa phs 3c the aging samples were also filtered with 0 45 μm membrane for the determination of the total concentration of soluble fe and ni in the filtrates the concentrations of total fe in filtrates were quantified by a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu japan at 510 nm with phenanthroline spectrophotometry lin et al 2015 the concentrations of ni in filtrates were measured by using the flame atomic absorption spectrometry aas peaa700 america 2 4 removal of tc by fe ni bnps the fresh and aged fe ni bnps 1 g l with different contents of ni 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt were used to remove tc 100 mg l in simulated groundwater the reaction solution was filtered with 0 45 μm filter membrane at desired time 5 10 15 30 60 90 120 180 240 300 min and then the concentration of tc was measured by uv vis spectrophotometer at 357 nm li et al 2017a 2 5 spectroscopic characterization of fresh and aged fe ni bnps scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6700f japan was used to observe the surface morphology and structure of fe ni bnps energy dispersive spectrometer eds which was linked to sem could identify the chemical element existence in fe ni bnps and the corresponding proportion of element content x ray diffraction xrd analyses used to identify the transformation of chemical species in the aged fe ni bnps were conducted with cu kα radiation using a rigaku d max 2500 at 40 kv 250 ma continuous scans were collected from 10 to 80 at 2 θ with a speed of 0 01 every size step 3 results and discussion 3 1 corrosion of fe ni bnps during short term aging in the field application of iron based nanoparticles nps the variation of ph orp and dissolved iron concentration in the aqueous environment are commonly monitored to indirectly demonstrate the occurrence of corrosion reactions of the iron based nps reinsch et al 2013 guan et al 2015 dong et al 2017b the information is of great importance for the further determination of the life time and fate of the nps in the subsurface environment it was reported that the corrosion of metallic iron nps occurs rapidly and could be transformed to ferrous iron oxide in a short time of aging liu et al 2015 dong et al 2016a therefore to probe the corrosion kinetics of fe ni bnps in simulated groundwater a short term within 5 d aging of fe ni bnps with different ni contents 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt was conducted and the variations of ph orp and concentration of total soluble fe in solution during the aging were monitored fig 1 a c fig 1a displays the variation of ph in solution during the period of 5 d aging the three kinds of fe ni bnps had similar variation trends of ph which increased sharply in the initial 2 h and then changed little in the following aging time for fe ni bnps with ni content of 3 wt and 5 wt ph fluctuated between 8 8 and 9 1 and ph varied around 8 6 for fe ni bnps with ni content of 1 wt the variation of ph resulted from the corrosion of fe ni bnps in simulated groundwater the corrosion process might be described as follows crane and scott 2012 guan et al 2015 gao et al 2016 1 fe 2h fe2 h2 2 fe 2h2o fe2 h2 2oh 3 2fe2 2h2o 2fe3 h2 2oh 4 fe2 2oh fe oh 2 5 fe3 2h2o feooh 3h the trends of ph variation suggest that the corrosion of fe0 in water eqs 1 3 was fast since the ph increased sharply in the initial 2 h due to the large specific area and high reactivity of fe ni bnps the corrosion occurred rapidly which resulted in the rapid consumption of h and the large release of oh in the following time the reactions eqs 4 and 5 might proceed gradually which balanced the solution ph fig 1b presents the changes of orp in the simulated groundwater during 5 d aging of fe ni bnps the orp decreased sharply from 252 mv to 594 759 mv and 848 mv with ni loading of 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt respectively the decrease of orp was mainly ascribed to the corrosion of fe ni bnps since fe0 had strong reduction capacity and the loading of ni promoted the reduction process li et al 2017b therefore with the increase of ni loading the orp decreased faster the decrease of orp got slower after 2 d of aging which displayed a similar trend with the ph variation this might be ascribed to the slower corrosion of fe ni bnps after aging for 2 d resulting from the gradual surface passivation of fe ni bnps in the process of aging guan et al 2015 liu et al 2015 dong et al 2016a the results indicate that fe ni bnps are indeed efficient reductant but could possibly lose their ability rapidly due to progressive electron loss from anaerobic corrosion fig 1c shows the total concentration of soluble fe in filtrate of aged samples in consistent with the variation trend of ph and orp the soluble fe concentration increased sharply in the first few hours of aging higher content of ni in fe ni bnps resulted in higher concentration of soluble fe in the filtrate which should be ascribed to the ni accelerated corrosion of fe0 in the case of fe ni bnps ni 5 wt the concentration of fe firstly increased to 1 mg l and then decreased to 0 7 mg l which might be due to the adsorption or precipitation of iron ions on the particle surface with aging time while for the other samples the fe concentration fluctuated slightly and generally kept stable in the following aging time up to 5 d however the concentration of total soluble fe in filtrate was quite low and the maximum value with ni of 5 wt was only below 1 mg l although the initial concentration of fe ni bnps was 1 g l this phenomenon reveals that a majority of corrosion ions such as fe2 and fe3 might be adsorbed onto the surface of fe ni bnps or settled as precipitates as seen from the aging vials the color of fe ni bnps gradually transformed from black suspensions to green within 5 d of aging shown in figure s1 which indicates the formation of green rust the green rust could be evidently observed in the samples aged for 2 3 d and the green color turned deeper when the aging time was prolonged to 4 5 d the similar phenomena were also observed in other studies ritter et al 2002 dong et al 2017b dong et al 2017b investigated the aging of nzvi and found that the nzvi suspensions turned from black to blue green when the aging time was over 5 d and the color became deeper with the increasing aging time ritter et al 2002 showed that the green rust could be formed in both water and trichloroethylene tce solution due to the corrosion of iron overall the variation trends of ph orp and soluble fe concentration with aging time manifest that the corrosion of fe ni bnps was aggressive in the first few hours and was slowed down or even ceased in the following aging time on the contrary the color of the suspension changed all through the aging time which indicates that the corrosion products on the surface of fe ni bnps were not stable in the examined aging time these results reveal that although the corrosion of fe ni bnps was fast the physicochemical transformation of corrosion products on the surface of fe ni bnps would last for a longer time therefore it was presumed that the green rust observed in the short term aging could be an intermediate product which could further transform into other types of iron oxide in a prolonged aging time the transformation would be systematically introduced in the later section of long term aging 3 2 removal of tetracycline tc by fresh and aged fe ni bnps as demonstrated above the corrosion of fe ni bnps occurred rapidly in the simulated groundwater which could possibly lead to the rapid loss of their reactivity toward contaminants due to progressive electron loss from the anaerobic corrosion fe ni bnps have been employed to deal with a wide range of organic pollutants e g polybrominated diphenyl ethers trichloroethylene pentachlorophenol and microcystin lr fang et al 2011 han and yan 2014 lin et al 2015 gao et al 2016 in this section the removal of tetracycline tc was used to express the reactivity of the aged fe ni bnps tc is one of typical antibiotics which are used as pharmaceuticals first and then be used as feed additives poultry and aquaculture gu and karthikeyan 2005 li et al 2010 wang et al 2015 residues generated ended up partly in groundwater gottschall et al 2012 fu et al 2015 and then resulted in potential risks lu et al 2017 fig 2 a displays the removal of tc by fe ni bnps with ni content of 1 wt for fresh and 1 d aged fe ni bnps the removal of tc reached equilibrium after 1 h and tc was almost completely removed when the aging time was 2 d and 5 d the equilibrium time got to be 2 h and the removal efficiency decreased to 92 5 and 82 3 respectively fig 2b shows the removal of tc by fe ni bnps with ni content of 3 wt the removal efficiency of tc was only slightly decreased within 2 d aging but was remarkably decreased from approximately 100 72 6 after 5 d of aging similar phenomenon was found for fe ni bnps with ni content of 5 wt fig 2c and the removal efficiency decreased to 80 6 the results verify that fe ni bnps aged for 1 2 d still hold the similar reactivity towards contaminants as the fresh particles even though the corrosion of fe ni bnps occurred rapidly within a few hours as discussed in the previous section this proves that the initial corrosion process of fe ni bnps did not have much influence on their reactivity it was presumed that the surfaces of fe ni bnps were not passivated within 2 d of aging however the reactivity of fe ni bnps decreased significantly after 5 d of aging which might be ascribed to the gradual accumulation of precipitates of iron oxy hydroxides on the surface covering the reactive sites kim et al 2012 guan et al 2015 to further investigate the influence of long term aging on the reactivity of fe ni bnps fe ni bnps with ni content of 5 wt aged up to 90 d was chosen as a representative for the removal of tc fig 2c shows that the removal efficiency of tc decreased sharply with the increasing aging time from 5 d 80 6 to 15 d 51 4 and 90 d 38 9 the reason for the sharp drop in removal efficiency of tc could possibly be ascribed to the generation of passivation layer on the surface of fe ni bnps during the long term aging kim et al 2012 guan et al 2015 which hindered the contact between reaction sites of fe ni bnps and tc to clarify the physicochemical transformation of fe ni bnps during the long term aging the compositional and structural evolution of fe ni bnps were investigated over a period of 90 d and the results are shown in the following section 3 3 structural and compositional evolution of fe ni bnps during the long term aging 3 3 1 sem analysis fig 3 displays the sem images of fresh and aged fe ni bnps which demonstrates the morphological and structural changes of fe ni bnps at different aging time fig 3a presents the image of fresh fe ni bnps which were in spherical with the size of nanoscale for most of them these particles were formed together in chain structure which was due to magnetic and electronic interactions among the particles lin et al 2015 after 5 d of aging larger size aggregates were observed and these particles were no more spherical but were transformed to be rod like fig 3b when the aging time reaches 15 d and 30 d some sheet like particles were formed fig 3c and d for longer time of aging fig 3e and f the particles came to be flaky like and needle like especially for particles aged for 90 d similar morphology transformations during long time aging were observed in bare nzvi particles dong et al 2016a found that some needle like particles were observed after aging for 60 d and 90 d liu et al 2015 manifested that the primary core shell structure of nzvi disintegrated after 90 d of aging and plate like and sheet like minerals were the main products the structural transformations of the particles from spherical to the new structures e g rod like sheet like and needle like were as a result of the outward diffusion of iron ions from the nzvi core and formation of new oxide phases on the particle surface liu et al 2015 dong et al 2016a besides it should be noted that the aggregation and oxidation of particles led to the increase of particle size during aging thus they were no longer nanoscale after aging which had enormous influence on the reactivity of fe ni bnps since the specific surface area diminished a lot compared with the fresh prepared fe ni bnps with the size of nanoscale and this should be one factor that resulted in the sharp drop in the removal of tc by the aged fe ni bnps nevertheless the drastic physical transformation of fe ni bnps with aging conveys important information for the risk assessment of environmental application of the fe ni bnps in subsurface remediation 3 3 2 xrd analysis xrd analysis shows the composition evolution and crystalline change of fe ni bnps in simulated groundwater over a period of 90 d fig 4 for the fresh fe ni bnps 0 d the peak at 2 θ of 44 45 should be ascribed to fe0 nurmi et al 2005 dong et al 2017b however the peak of ni is not showed which might be due to the facts that the peak of ni is similar to that of fe and the loading of ni is too low to be detected by xrd similar phenomena were reported in other studies fang et al 2011 gao et al 2016 gao et al 2016 used xrd to characterize fe0 fe ni and fe pd and found that either ni or pd was not observed fang et al 2011 reported that ni was not detected in fe ni nanoparticles thus the existence of ni would be certified later by other technique i e eds in the aged samples the peak m represents magnetite fe3o4 and or maghemite γ fe2o3 the other peak l ascribes to lepidocrocite γ feooh as seen from the xrd patterns for the freshly prepared fe ni bnps the only peak is fe0 and its intensity got much weaker and almost disappeared after 5 d of aging indicating fe0 has been exhausted with aging l and m appeared in the 5 d aged fe ni bnps and the intensity increased with aging time from 5 d to 30 d when the aging time was prolonged to 60 d and 90 d there was no l detected and the only iron oxide was m which manifests that the fe ni bnps were completely transformed to iron oxide the loss of reactive fe0 and the formation of iron oxide with aging further explained the significant decrease of tc removal by the aged fe ni bnps 3 3 3 eds analysis given the presence of ni in the fe ni bnps plays an important role as a catalyst in keeping the high reactivity of the bnps the transformation of ni on the surface of fe0 with aging is necessary to be analyzed as shown in table 1 the results of eds analysis reveal that fe ni o were the main elements existing on the surface of fe ni bnps the existence of ni demonstrates the successful synthesis of fe ni bnps it was also found that the weight ratio of these elements changed with the aging time the weight ratio of o increased rapidly in the first 5 d which was 36 3 for the freshly prepared fe ni bnps and 48 5 for the 5 d aged bnps the sharp increase of o indicates that the fe ni bnps were oxidized fast in short term aging this was consistent with the finding in the previous short term aging experiment the fe0 corrosion process was fast and consequently some iron oxide appeared during the process leading to the increase of o for the following time the content of o increased gradually and reached to 66 9 correspondingly the weight ratio of fe decreased fast in the short term aging and got slow in the following aging time it decreased from 58 8 at 0 d to 32 8 at 90 d this further certified that the transformation of fe occurred throughout the aging time interestingly the weight ratio of ni decreased quickly during the aging process when the aging time was over 30 d the weight ratio of ni decreased significantly from initial value of 4 9 0 7 and the corresponding mass ratio of fe ni increased remarkably with the aging time this was likely due to the wrapping of ni by iron oxide han and yan 2014 given the dislodgment of ni would result in the reactivity loss of fe ni bnps this could be one of the reasons for the decreased reactivity in tc removal by the aged fe ni bnps zhu and lim 2007 also showed that the aged pd fe nanoparticles were less efficient due to the encapsulation by iron oxide nevertheless the decrease of weight ratio of ni could also possibly be due to the release of ni from the surface of fe ni bnps during the aging to examine the possible remobilization of ni from particle surface into solution the concentrations of ni in the filtrate of the aged samples were examined table 2 the results show that there were little ni released into solution with maximum value of 1 22 mg l detected after 90 d of aging compared with the initial ni content 1 g l fe ni bnps with ni content of 5 wt this further verified that most of ni was capsuled by iron oxide but not leached out to external environment during the aging besides the information verifies that the real application of fe ni bnps in environment may pose minimal risk to the safety of environment due to the dramatic structural and compositional transformation of fe ni bnps the concerns about the risk of engineered nanoparticles might be over exaggerated in the previous studies dong et al 2016b xie et al 2017b 4 conclusions in the short term aging of fe ni bnps the ph orp and concentration of soluble iron changed drastically in the first few hours and kept stable in the following aging time up to 5 d this demonstrates that the corrosion of fe ni bnps in simulated groundwater occurred rapidly within hours the results indicate that fe ni bnps are indeed efficient reductant but may lose their reactivity rapidly due to fast electron loss from corrosion physicochemical transformations of the corrosion products were observed in the long term aging process up to 90 d fe ni bnps transformed from nanoscale spherical particle to larger sized flaky like and needle like oxides with aging time fe0 rapidly disappeared and magnetite fe3o4 and or maghemite γ fe2o3 were the main aging products in addition most of ni on the surface of fe ni bnps were gradually wrapped by the iron oxides with the aging time the results reveal that the environmental application of fe ni bnps may pose very little risk to the safety of human health and the environment reactivity of the aged fe ni bnps was investigated by examining the removal of tetracycline tc take fe ni bnps 5 wt as an example the removal efficiency of tc was only slightly decreased within 2 d aging 100 but was remarkably decreased with the increasing aging time from 5 d 80 6 to 15 d 51 4 and 90 d 38 9 this should be due to the loss of reactive fe0 the accumulation of precipitates of iron oxides on the particle surface and the wrapping of ni by the iron oxide during the aging process acknowledgments this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china

19829,reliable modelling of sulfide and methane production in sewer systems is required for efficient sewer emission management wastewater compositions affect sulfide and methane production kinetics through both its short term variation influencing the substrate availability to sewer biofilms and its long term variation affecting the sewer biofilm structure while the short term effect is well considered in existing sewer models with the use of monod or half order equations the long term effect has not been explicitly considered in current sewer models suitable for network modelling in this study the long term effect of wastewater compositions on sulfide and methane production activities in rising main sewers was investigated a detailed biofilm model was firstly developed and then calibrated and validated using experimental data measured during the entire biofilm development period of a laboratory sewer reactor based on scenario simulations using the detailed biofilm model empirical equations describing the long term effect of sulfate and scod soluble chemical oxygen demand concentrations on kh2s the maximum sulfide production rate of sewer biofilm and kch4 the maximum methane production rate of sewer biofilm were proposed these equations require further verification in future studies before their potential integration into network wide sewer models graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer biofilm wastewater compositions sulfide methane mathematical model maximum production rate 1 introduction sulfide and methane production has always been a major concern in sewer management sulfide in sewers is mainly generated through anaerobic respiration of sulfate reducing bacteria srb present in biofilms growing on sewer pipes jiang et al 2009b sun et al 2015a the production and emission of sulfide not only cause malodor to surrounding areas but also pose health risks to sewer workers due to its toxicity ganigué et al 2011 hvitved jacobsen 2002 sun et al 2015c moreover sulfide generated in sewers is believed to be an important inducer of sewer pipe corrosion and the repair and rehabilitation of corroded sewer pipes places an enormous economic burden on water industries brongers et al 2002 sydney et al 1996 methane is primarily produced through the metabolism of methanogenic archaea ma in the sewer biofilms guisasola et al 2008 methane being a potent greenhouse gas its production from sewers has been reported to be contributing significantly to the greenhouse gas footprint of wastewater systems gwrc 2011 liu et al 2015 also it can form an explosive mixture with air even at a low concentration posing occupational safety risks guisasola et al 2008 due to the aforementioned detrimental impacts the water industry has since long taken various measures to mitigate sulfide and methane in sewer systems jiang et al 2015 werf 2007 zhang et al 2008 these measures can be mainly classified into two categories 1 dosing chemicals into sewers either to react with sulfide or to inhibit sulfide and methane generation emission ganigué et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 and 2 collecting emitted extracted sewer gases and treating them in physicochemical or biological reactors apgar and witherspoon 2008 jiang et al 2015 sun et al 2017 to effectively manage sulfide and methane in sewers reliable prediction of sulfide and methane production is important as this would directly guide the dosage of chemicals or the design of gas treatment units sharma et al 2008b sulfide production modelling started in 1950s and several empirical models for evaluating sulfide production have been established since then boon and lister 1975 pomeroy 1959 pomeroy and parkhurst 1977 thistlewhwayte 1971 these early models predicted sulfide concentration using only a single empirical equation taking into consideration only some selected factors and neglected many others that are also important for the in sewer biotransformation processes to improve the prediction hvitved jacobsen and co workers developed the wastewater aerobic anaerobic transformations in sewers wats model hvitved jacobsen 2002 more recently our research group in collaboration with several major australian water utilities developed a dynamic sewer model sewex model sharma et al 2008a 2008b compared with empirical models these models fractionated chemical oxygen demand cod into several categories and associated sulfide production to certain fractions that could directly be used by sulfate reducing bacteria the models included a number of anaerobic and aerobic processes involving carbon sulfur and nitrogen cycles the sewex model was later expanded to also predict methane production in sewers guisasola et al 2009 jiang et al 2009a developed a detailed biofilm model to predict biofilm formation and activities however it is difficult to use this model to simulate large sewer networks due to the high computation demand in both the wats and sewex models the biofilm activity is assumed uniform throughout the entire network for example the biofilm activity in the current sewex models is represented by the maximum production rate i e parameter k in the monod kinetics r k s k s where r is the areal production rate k is the half saturation constant and s is the substrate concentration the uniform biofilm activity means that the maximum sulfide and methane production rate kh2s and kch4 are kept constant irrespective of the location or substrate conditions while applying the models however in the real sewer network wastewater composition changes due to ongoing biotransformation hence the biofilm activities could be varying across the network as different wastewater composition at different locations would affect the microbial population in biofilm and hence its activities especially the long term differences in sulfate and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod concentrations at different locations could result in different abundance of srb and ma in the biofilm and consequently different kh2s and kch4 mohanakrishnan et al 2009 therefore the current models may produce inaccurate predictions at locations where wastewater composition differs greatly from locations where data are collected to calibrate the model sharma et al 2008b one way to improve the model predictability is to conduct calibrations at multiple sewer locations however this would substantially increase the calibration costs also local calibration may also be limited by site constraints further this approach is not applicable to modelling effects of new water management strategies such as water conservation changed water consumption would result in changes in the wastewater composition and hence the biofilm activity sun et al 2015a modelling studies are required to assess the impact of such strategies on sewer emissions prior to the implementation of the strategy hence no data would be available for model calibration therefore the aim of this study is to investigate the long term impact of wastewater composition on sulfide and methane production activities of sewer biofilms and to develop empirical equations to predict the maximum sulfide and methane production rates kh2s and kch4 based on the long term variation of wastewater sulfate and scod concentrations after proper calibration and validation the empirical expressions generated could be integrated into the existing network models which is expected to enhance the model capability since sulfate and scod concentrations in sewers generally vary over wide ranges conducting detailed experiments with a wide range of substrate concentration conditions is practically difficult given the slow development of biofilm under each of these conditions here we adopt an alternative methodology as summarized in fig 1 firstly a detailed biofilm model describing sulfide and methane production in rising main sewers also called pressure mains which are sewers that always run full under pressure was developed which took into consideration the growth of srb ma and other heterotrophs microorganisms under anaerobic sewer conditions the model was then calibrated and validated using experimental data obtained from a lab scale rising main sewer reactor at different biofilm development stages and under different operational conditions after that simulation studies were carried out using the detailed biofilm model to evaluate the impact of long term variation of wastewater compositions i e sulfate and scod concentrations on sulfide and methane production activities based on the simulation results empirical equations describing the dependency of kh2s and kch4 on the long term sulfate and scod concentrations were developed these equations after further validation in future studies potentially eliminate the need to re calibrate kh2s and kch4 when cod and sulfate concentrations are subject to long term variations this will significantly simplify model calibration efforts in sewer modelling 2 materials and methods 2 1 detailed biofilm model development microbial processes occurred in rising main sewers are mainly anaerobic processes including hydrolysis fermentation acidogenesis sulfidogenesis and methanenogensis with a number of different microorganisms involved therefore a multispecies and multisubstrate one dimensional detailed biofilm model was constructed to simulate the microbial processes and community structure of biofilms in rising main sewers the schematic representation of the processes included in the detailed biofilm model is illustrated in fig 2 the model describes the relationships among seven soluble species and ten particulate species as listed in table s1 supporting information si for all the microorganisms both growth and decay processes were included in the model the stoichiometric matrix of the model is summarized in table s2 si the hydrolysis and decay of the microorganisms were considered to follow the first order kinetics as suggested in the anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 while the rates of growth of the microorganisms were modelling using monod type kinetics batstone et al 2002 the kinetic expressions of the reactions included in the model are listed in table s3 si the temperature effect on the rates of biochemical reaction was considered using the expression shown in equation 1 hvitved jacobsen 2002 1 r r 20 θ t t 20 where t is the temperature c r is reaction rate of a concerned biochemical process at temperature t mg l h r 20 is the reaction rate of the concerned process at 20 c mg l h θ t is a coefficient describing temperature dependency the sewer biofilm matrix was modeled by dividing its thickness from the substratum to the biofilm surface into 20 layers of equal thickness the biochemical conversion in each layer and mass transfer from one layer to another were modeled according to one dimensional conservation law as described by wanner and reichert 1996 the involved equations were implemented in aquasim wanner and morgenroth 2004 the mass transfer of soluble components from liquid phase to biofilm matrix surface and vise versa was modeled considering mass transfer resistance as described in the following equations dawson and trass 1972 rittmann and mccarty 1981 wanner and reichert 1996 2 j l b s l s b k 3 k 0 0153 r e 0 88 s c

microbial processes occurring in the bulk liquid were assumed being negligible guisasola et al 2009 2 2 sewer reactor operation an annular biofilm reactor mimicking a rising main sewer pipe section was set up in this study for collecting data for the biofilm model calibration and validation fig s1 the reactor consisted of an inner cylinder with a height of 295 mm and a diameter of 130 mm enclosed in an outer cylinder with a height of 345 mm and inner diameter of 160 mm wastewater was filled in the open space between the two cylinders and the total volume was 3 l the presence of wastewater allowed biofilm to grow on the inner wall of the outer cylinder and outer wall of the inner cylinder which were in contact with the wastewater resulting in a biofilm area to reactor volume a v ratio of 119 m 1 eight removable sliding sections 5 mm 200 mm were mounted in recessed slots on the inner wall of the outer cylinder for biofilm sampling mixing was provided by the rotation of the inner cylinder driven by a motor at a speed of 200 rpm the mixing was expected to create a uniform shear stress on the reactor walls biofilm surface so that biofilms grow relatively evenly on the wall the mixing resulted in an average shear stress of 2 11 n m2 which is typical in sewer systems enfinger and mitchell 2010 a reservoir was mounted on the top of the reactor to ensure the reactor was full of wastewater during its operation and sampling domestic sewage collected weekly from a local wet well brisbane queensland was used as the feed to the reactor the composition of the wastewater was monitored every week the sewage typically contained sulfate at a concentration of 10 25 mg s l sulfide at 3 mg s mg l soluble cod scod at 200 300 mg l volatile fatty acids vfas at 50 120 mgcod l and ammonium approximately at 50 mgn l negligible amounts of sulfite thiosulfate 1 mg s l nitrate and nitrite 1 mgn l were present the sewage was stored in a cold room 4 c to minimize biological transformations and was heated to 20 1 c prior to being pumped into the reactors fig 2 the sewage was fed to the reactor intermittently by a peristaltic pump masterflex 7520 47 to simulate the typical flow patterns of rising main sewers figs s1 and si for easier reactor monitoring each day was divided into three identical 8 h periods every pumping event lasted for 3 min delivering one reactor volume 3 l of wastewater into the reactor the hrt of the wastewater ranged between 30 min and 4 h which are in the range of hrt observed in a typical real sewer pipe figs s2 and si 2 3 experimental data collection the reactor performance was monitored during an 8 h cycle period every two weeks since the start up of the reactor sulfide concentrations during the 8 h cycle were continuously monitored using the s can vu vis sepcitro lyser messtechnik gmbh austria as previously described by sutherland stacey et al 2008 in addition samples were taken from the reactor before and after each pumping event and also at 2 5 h 5 h and 6 5 h for the analysis of dissolved methane sulfate and vfas batch tests were also carried out once the reactor reached the steady state to evaluate sulfide and methane production rates with different influent substrate concentrations during each batch test the reactor was firstly filled with fresh wastewater then different amount 0 ml 9 ml and 20 ml of sodium sulfate stock solution 5 g s l was added to the reactor to achieve different sulfate concentrations in the reactor the sulfide and methane concentrations were monitored during the 2 h tests the sulfide concentration was continuously monitored using s can vu vis sepcitro lyser and the methane concentration was analyzed by taking sample at 0 10 20 30 60 90 and 120 min the distribution of srb and ma in the biofilm was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish after cryosectioning the biofilm samples collected during the steady state operation the removable biofilm sampling slides were firstly taken from the reactor and the biofilm samples were fixed with freshly prepared 4 paraformaldehyde solution the fixed biofilm samples were then embedded in tissue tek oct compound sakura finetek tokyo japan and sectioned successively from the surface to the bottom of the biofilm maintaining a thickness of 10 μm using a research cryostat leica cm3050 s the cryosectioned samples were placed over the poly l lysine coated microscope slides and dehydrated using aqueous ethanol solution the in situ hybridization was conducted on each of the samples collected according to a protocol described by amann et al 1990 using a hybridization buffer solution at 46 c for 2 3 h srb population was determined by the overlapping the fluorescence signal of the probes delta495a cy3 delta495b cy3 and delta495c cy3 with those of probes srb385 cy5 srb385db cy5 and dabac 357 cy5 lücker et al 2007 ma population was determined by using a combination of the probes msmx860 cy5 mg1200b

the sampling and sample storage keller lehmann et al 2006 dissolved methane concentration in the wastewater sample was measured by gas chromatography shimadzu gc 9a equipped with a flame ionization detector fid sun et al 2015b during the sampling 5 ml filtered sewage using a 0 22 mm membrane was injected into a 12 ml vacuumed exetainer r vial with a hypodermic needle attached to a plastic syringe the vial was kept mixed and allowed to reach gas liquid equilibrium overnight methane in the gas phase was then extracted from the vial using a syringe and was injected into the gc for analysis the concentration of methane in the sewage sample was calculated using henry s law and considering the mass in both liquid and gas phases vfa concentration was measured with gas chromatography perkinelmer inc while nitrogen species nitrate nitrite and ammonium were analyzed using a lchat quikchem 8000 milwaukee flow injection analyzers fia chemical oxygen demands tcod and scod were determined by means of cod cuvette tests using test kits merck co with a measurement range of 25 1500 mg l 1 2 5 detailed biofilm model calibration and validation the developed model was implemented in aquasim 2 1 d the model includes 16 species specific biochemical processes and 33 stoichiometric and kinetic parameters as summarized in table s3 si most of these parameters were well established in previous studies therefore literature values were adopted for these parameters tables s4 and si sensitivity analysis reveals that the hydrolysis rate of easily biodegradable cod ks1 and the maximum growth rates of hac and srbac μhac and μsrbac are key parameters to predict the data sets therefore parameter estimation was carried out for these three parameters ks1 μhac and μsrbac through minimizing the sum of squares of the deviations between the model predictions and the experimental measured sulfide and methane profiles of the 8 h operational cycle during the different biofilm development stages the 95 confidence intervals of individual parameter estimates were calculated from the mean square fitting errors and the sensitivity of the model to the parameters according to dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 model validation was then carried out employing the model with the calibrated parameters to predict independent experimental data sets the measured sulfide and methane production with different influent substrate concentrations under the steady state conditions were compared with the model predicted values to validate the model also the experimentally determined distribution of srb and ma communities were compared with simulation results as part of the model validation 2 6 long term effect of sulfate and scod concentrations on sulfide and methane production activities the long term effect of sulfate and scod concentrations on sulfide and methane production activities of the sewer biofilm was evaluated using the validated biofilm model the biofilm model was employed to make an assessment of the activities under different combinations of influent sulfate concentration ranging from 5 mg s l to 30 mg s l with 5 mg s l steps and soluble cod scod concentration ranging from 100 mgcod l to 500 mgcod l with 50 mgcod l steps with dynamic feeding until steady state was reached the maximum sulfide and methane production rates were calculated using linear regression based on the linear parts of the simulated sulfide and methane concentration profiles empirical equations describing the dependency of kh2s and kch4 on the long term variation in sulfate and scod concentrations were attempted based on the simulated maximum sulfide and methane production rates using the detailed biofilm model under different influent sulfate and scod concentrations the best structure of empirical equations was selected based on the fit of the data obtained from both empirical model and detailed biofilm model simulation results the parameters in the empirical equations were estimated through minimizing the sum of squares of the deviations between the model predictions of the empirical model and detailed biofilm model the 95 confidence intervals of individual parameter estimates were calculated from the mean square fitting errors and the sensitivity of the model to the parameters according to dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 3 results and discussion 3 1 biofilm model calibration with routine operational profiles model calibration of this work involved estimating three key parameter values ks1 μhac and μsrbac for the system so that the sulfide and methane concentrations predicted by the model closely agreed with the measured 8 h profiles during the routine operation over the entire biofilm development stage the calibrated parameter values with their 95 confidence interval were listed in table s4 si the relatively narrow confidence interval indicated acceptable identifiabiltiy of these parameters the comparisons of model simulations and experimentally measured profiles on day 22 day 250 and day 605 were presented in fig 3 as examples the results suggested that with the calibrated parameters the model could well describe the dynamics of sulfide and methane concentrations at different biofilm development stages specifically as shown in fig 3a and b when the biofilm just started to develop both the sulfide and methane concentrations were low in the reactor 11 mg s l for sulfide and 10 mgcod l for methane also the sulfide and methane production activities were low indicated by the relatively smooth slope of sulfide and methane concentrations compared with that on day 250 and day 605 on day 250 the sulfide production activity of the biofilm has already reached steady state as the maximum sulfide production rate on day 250 14 5 mg s l h was comparable to that on day 605 14 8 mg s l h the sulfide concentrations in the reactor on day 250 were slightly higher than that on day 605 which was caused by the higher influent sulfate concentration on day 250 22 mg s l for day 250 vs 19 mg s l for day 605 in contrast the methane production activity of the sewer biofilm developed more slowly with the steady state conditions not being achieved after 250 day cultivation the maximum methane production rate increased from 30 mgcod l h to 43 mgcod l h from day 250 to day 605 the slower development of methane production activity as compared with the sulfide production activity could be explained by the lower growth rate of ma as compared with srb as well as ma having lower affinity to substrates acetate and hydrogen than srb guisasola et al 2009 sun et al 2014 the differences between the measured data and model predictions are relatively low r2 0 97 for sulfide and r2 0 95 for methane illustrating that the biofilm model developed in this study can satisfactorily capture all the trends described above 3 2 biofilm model validation with batch tests data the developed biofilm model with calibrated parameter was firstly validated with measured sulfide and methane productions obtained from batch tests carried out under three different substrate conditions during the steady state as shown in fig 4 the simulation results matched well with the measured sulfide and methane concentrations in all the three cases sulfide concentrations increased rapidly at the beginning of each test and then the increase slowed down gradually as a result of the decrease in substrate concentrations fig 4a there was an increase in sulfide production rate when the sulfate concentration in feed increased from 17 mg s l to 32 mg s l however the further increase of the feed sulfate concentration to 50 mg s l resulted in very little increase in the sulfide production rate the modelling results further revealed that with the increase of feed sulfate concentration from 17 mg s l to 32 mg s l sulfate penetration increased to deeper layers of the biofilm providing substrate to srb located in these layers this led to an increase in the sulfide production rate however a further increase of the feed sulfate concentration from 32 mg s l to 50 mg s l did not further increase the sulfide production rate because sulfate fully penetrated the biofilm in both cases as for methane both measured and modeled methane concentrations increased quickly in the first 30 min before the increase slowing down due to the decrease in substrate concentration fig 4b the methane production rates observed with different influent sulfate concentrations were similar indicating that short term difference in sulfate concentration would not significantly affect the methane production rates the methane production rate with the lowest influent sulfate concentration of 17 mg s l was slightly higher than the other two cases 44 mgcod l h 40 mgcod l h and 38 mgcod l h for the cases of 17 mg s l 32 mg s l 50 mg s l respectively this was because of a higher scod uptake by srb for sulfidogenesis in the latter two cases fig 3a which resulted in less scod mainly acetate and hydrogen availability to ma and the methane production rate decreased accordingly all the results above supported that the developed model adequately captured the activities of srb and ma which were predicted to coexist in sewer biofilms 3 3 biofilm model validation with measured microbial distribution the developed biofilm model was also validated with the observed pattern of microbial distribution in the biofilm determined by cryosection fish as shown in fig 5 the fish result indicated that srb population was mainly located in the outer layer of the biofilm with the relative abundance of srb decreasing from 19 to 0 from the biofilm surface to the substratum on the other hand ma primarily grew in the inner layers of the biofilm the relative abundance of ma was close to 80 at a depth of 100 μm from the substratum but it dropped to lower than 10 at the biofilm surface the model was able to reasonably describe the overall srb and ma distribution pattern in the biofilm although the predicted relative abundances of srb and ma were slightly higher than the measured ones near the biofilm surface these results further demonstrated the capability of the model to simulate sulfide and methane production activities in a sewer biofilm 3 4 long term effect of sulfate and scod concentrations on sulfide and methane production activities sewer biofilms developed under different substrate conditions for a long time have been demonstrated to have different microbial community structures resulting in different sulfide and methane production activities mohanakrishnan et al 2009 sun et al 2015a in order to shed light on the long term changes in the sulfate and scod concentrations on sulfate and methane production a simulation study using the detailed model discussed in the earlier sections was carried out the results are presented in fig 6 fig 6a shows that the increase in both sulfate and scod concentration has positive effect on sulfide production activities as they both serve as the substrates for sulfide production hvitved jacobsen 2002 muyzer and stams 2008 for a constant sulfate concentration an increase in the feed scod concentration would result in an increase of the maximum sulfide production rate up to a certain scod level beyond which the rate appears to remain steady the relatively smaller increase in the rate is most likely due to sulfate being a limiting substrate at high scod concentrations which could not support the additional growth of srb although scod was in excess on the other hand with a constant scod concentration the maximum sulfide production rate would increase continuously with an increase in sulfate concentration the cod limitation for the growth of srb was not observed under the simulated conditions sulfate and scod concentrations showed opposite impacts on the methane production activity of the rising main sewer biofilms fig 6b the maximum methane production rate increased with the increase of scod concentration as higher scod concentration would provide more substrate for methanogenesis on the other hand the maximum methane production rate decreased with the increase in sulfate concentration this could be explained by out competition of ma by srb under the high sulfate conditions raskin et al 1996 particularly in outer biofilm layers since srb has higher affinity to scod mainly hydrogen and acetate as compared to ma with the increase of sulfate concentration more scod was used for the srb growth in the biofilm kristjansson et al 1982 schönheit et al 1982 as a result less scod would be available for the growth of ma and consequently the methane production activity of the biofilm decreased we propose to use the following empirical equations to describe the dependency of the maximum sulfide and methane production rates kh2s and kch4 on long term average sulfate and scod concentrations 4 k h 2 s a 1 s s o 4 ln s s c o d b 1 5 k c h 4 a 2 s s o 4 b 2 s s c o d c where r h 2 s is areal sulfide production rate gs m2 day r c h 4 is areal methane production rate gcod m2 day s s o 4 is the long term average sulfate concentration in the wastewater mgs l the application range is 5 30 mg s l s s c o d is the long term average scod concentration in the wastewater mgcod l the application range is 100 500 mgcod l a1 b1 a2 b2 and c are constant parameters in the models the estimated values and 95 confidence interval of the five parameters a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 and c are shown in table 1 the relatively narrow confidence interval indicated acceptable identifiabiltiy of these parameters as shown in fig 6 the empirical equations well reproduce predictions by the detailed biofilm model the above empirical equations although adequately describe the dependency of the maximum sulfide and methane production rates kh2s and kch4 on long term average sulfate and scod concentrations are based on extrapolation of experimental data collected from a single set of experiments further experiments with different substrate conditions are strongly recommended for the calibration and validation of these empirical equations before these equations could be integrated into a sewer model 4 conclusions this study investigated long term effect of sulfate and cod concentrations on the sulfide and methane production activities of rising main sewer biofilm by developing a detailed biofilm model the biofilm model was calibrated and validated using the experimental data obtained from a sewer reactor operated during the entire biofilm development period the model is able to predict the coexistence and competition between sulfate reducing bacteria methanogenic archaea under anaerobic conditions a simulation study using the calibrated biofilm model suggests that the long term variations of wastewater sulfate and scod concentrations would affect both sulfide and methane production activities of the sewer biofilm the increase of sulfate concentration enhanced the maximum sulfide production rate kh2s but decreased the maximum methane production rate kch4 whereas the increase of scod concentration enhanced both maximum sulfide and methane production rates mathematical expressions describing the dependency of kh2s and kch4 on long term sulfate and scod concentrations is developed based on the detailed biofilm model simulations although these empirical equations require further validation using more comprehensive datasets they provide a

19829,reliable modelling of sulfide and methane production in sewer systems is required for efficient sewer emission management wastewater compositions affect sulfide and methane production kinetics through both its short term variation influencing the substrate availability to sewer biofilms and its long term variation affecting the sewer biofilm structure while the short term effect is well considered in existing sewer models with the use of monod or half order equations the long term effect has not been explicitly considered in current sewer models suitable for network modelling in this study the long term effect of wastewater compositions on sulfide and methane production activities in rising main sewers was investigated a detailed biofilm model was firstly developed and then calibrated and validated using experimental data measured during the entire biofilm development period of a laboratory sewer reactor based on scenario simulations using the detailed biofilm model empirical equations describing the long term effect of sulfate and scod soluble chemical oxygen demand concentrations on kh2s the maximum sulfide production rate of sewer biofilm and kch4 the maximum methane production rate of sewer biofilm were proposed these equations require further verification in future studies before their potential integration into network wide sewer models graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer biofilm wastewater compositions sulfide methane mathematical model maximum production rate 1 introduction sulfide and methane production has always been a major concern in sewer management sulfide in sewers is mainly generated through anaerobic respiration of sulfate reducing bacteria srb present in biofilms growing on sewer pipes jiang et al 2009b sun et al 2015a the production and emission of sulfide not only cause malodor to surrounding areas but also pose health risks to sewer workers due to its toxicity ganigué et al 2011 hvitved jacobsen 2002 sun et al 2015c moreover sulfide generated in sewers is believed to be an important inducer of sewer pipe corrosion and the repair and rehabilitation of corroded sewer pipes places an enormous economic burden on water industries brongers et al 2002 sydney et al 1996 methane is primarily produced through the metabolism of methanogenic archaea ma in the sewer biofilms guisasola et al 2008 methane being a potent greenhouse gas its production from sewers has been reported to be contributing significantly to the greenhouse gas footprint of wastewater systems gwrc 2011 liu et al 2015 also it can form an explosive mixture with air even at a low concentration posing occupational safety risks guisasola et al 2008 due to the aforementioned detrimental impacts the water industry has since long taken various measures to mitigate sulfide and methane in sewer systems jiang et al 2015 werf 2007 zhang et al 2008 these measures can be mainly classified into two categories 1 dosing chemicals into sewers either to react with sulfide or to inhibit sulfide and methane generation emission ganigué et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 and 2 collecting emitted extracted sewer gases and treating them in physicochemical or biological reactors apgar and witherspoon 2008 jiang et al 2015 sun et al 2017 to effectively manage sulfide and methane in sewers reliable prediction of sulfide and methane production is important as this would directly guide the dosage of chemicals or the design of gas treatment units sharma et al 2008b sulfide production modelling started in 1950s and several empirical models for evaluating sulfide production have been established since then boon and lister 1975 pomeroy 1959 pomeroy and parkhurst 1977 thistlewhwayte 1971 these early models predicted sulfide concentration using only a single empirical equation taking into consideration only some selected factors and neglected many others that are also important for the in sewer biotransformation processes to improve the prediction hvitved jacobsen and co workers developed the wastewater aerobic anaerobic transformations in sewers wats model hvitved jacobsen 2002 more recently our research group in collaboration with several major australian water utilities developed a dynamic sewer model sewex model sharma et al 2008a 2008b compared with empirical models these models fractionated chemical oxygen demand cod into several categories and associated sulfide production to certain fractions that could directly be used by sulfate reducing bacteria the models included a number of anaerobic and aerobic processes involving carbon sulfur and nitrogen cycles the sewex model was later expanded to also predict methane production in sewers guisasola et al 2009 jiang et al 2009a developed a detailed biofilm model to predict biofilm formation and activities however it is difficult to use this model to simulate large sewer networks due to the high computation demand in both the wats and sewex models the biofilm activity is assumed uniform throughout the entire network for example the biofilm activity in the current sewex models is represented by the maximum production rate i e parameter k in the monod kinetics r k s k s where r is the areal production rate k is the half saturation constant and s is the substrate concentration the uniform biofilm activity means that the maximum sulfide and methane production rate kh2s and kch4 are kept constant irrespective of the location or substrate conditions while applying the models however in the real sewer network wastewater composition changes due to ongoing biotransformation hence the biofilm activities could be varying across the network as different wastewater composition at different locations would affect the microbial population in biofilm and hence its activities especially the long term differences in sulfate and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod concentrations at different locations could result in different abundance of srb and ma in the biofilm and consequently different kh2s and kch4 mohanakrishnan et al 2009 therefore the current models may produce inaccurate predictions at locations where wastewater composition differs greatly from locations where data are collected to calibrate the model sharma et al 2008b one way to improve the model predictability is to conduct calibrations at multiple sewer locations however this would substantially increase the calibration costs also local calibration may also be limited by site constraints further this approach is not applicable to modelling effects of new water management strategies such as water conservation changed water consumption would result in changes in the wastewater composition and hence the biofilm activity sun et al 2015a modelling studies are required to assess the impact of such strategies on sewer emissions prior to the implementation of the strategy hence no data would be available for model calibration therefore the aim of this study is to investigate the long term impact of wastewater composition on sulfide and methane production activities of sewer biofilms and to develop empirical equations to predict the maximum sulfide and methane production rates kh2s and kch4 based on the long term variation of wastewater sulfate and scod concentrations after proper calibration and validation the empirical expressions generated could be integrated into the existing network models which is expected to enhance the model capability since sulfate and scod concentrations in sewers generally vary over wide ranges conducting detailed experiments with a wide range of substrate concentration conditions is practically difficult given the slow development of biofilm under each of these conditions here we adopt an alternative methodology as summarized in fig 1 firstly a detailed biofilm model describing sulfide and methane production in rising main sewers also called pressure mains which are sewers that always run full under pressure was developed which took into consideration the growth of srb ma and other heterotrophs microorganisms under anaerobic sewer conditions the model was then calibrated and validated using experimental data obtained from a lab scale rising main sewer reactor at different biofilm development stages and under different operational conditions after that simulation studies were carried out using the detailed biofilm model to evaluate the impact of long term variation of wastewater compositions i e sulfate and scod concentrations on sulfide and methane production activities based on the simulation results empirical equations describing the dependency of kh2s and kch4 on the long term sulfate and scod concentrations were developed these equations after further validation in future studies potentially eliminate the need to re calibrate kh2s and kch4 when cod and sulfate concentrations are subject to long term variations this will significantly simplify model calibration efforts in sewer modelling 2 materials and methods 2 1 detailed biofilm model development microbial processes occurred in rising main sewers are mainly anaerobic processes including hydrolysis fermentation acidogenesis sulfidogenesis and methanenogensis with a number of different microorganisms involved therefore a multispecies and multisubstrate one dimensional detailed biofilm model was constructed to simulate the microbial processes and community structure of biofilms in rising main sewers the schematic representation of the processes included in the detailed biofilm model is illustrated in fig 2 the model describes the relationships among seven soluble species and ten particulate species as listed in table s1 supporting information si for all the microorganisms both growth and decay processes were included in the model the stoichiometric matrix of the model is summarized in table s2 si the hydrolysis and decay of the microorganisms were considered to follow the first order kinetics as suggested in the anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 while the rates of growth of the microorganisms were modelling using monod type kinetics batstone et al 2002 the kinetic expressions of the reactions included in the model are listed in table s3 si the temperature effect on the rates of biochemical reaction was considered using the expression

concerned process at 20 c mg l h θ t is a coefficient describing temperature dependency the sewer biofilm matrix was modeled by dividing its thickness from the substratum to the biofilm surface into 20 layers of equal thickness the biochemical conversion in each layer and mass transfer from one layer to another were modeled according to one dimensional conservation law as described by wanner and reichert 1996 the involved equations were implemented in aquasim wanner and morgenroth 2004 the mass transfer of soluble components from liquid phase to biofilm matrix surface and vise versa was modeled considering mass transfer resistance as described in the following equations dawson and trass 1972 rittmann and mccarty 1981 wanner and reichert 1996 2 j l b s l s b k 3 k 0 0153 r e 0 88 s c

microbial processes occurring in the bulk liquid were assumed being negligible guisasola et al 2009 2 2 sewer reactor operation an annular biofilm reactor mimicking a rising main sewer pipe section was set up in this study for collecting data for the biofilm model calibration and validation fig s1 the reactor consisted of an inner cylinder with a height of 295 mm and a diameter of 130 mm enclosed in an outer cylinder with a height of 345 mm and inner diameter of 160 mm wastewater was filled in the open space between the two cylinders and the total volume was 3 l the presence of wastewater allowed biofilm to grow on the inner wall of the outer cylinder and outer wall of the inner cylinder which were in contact with the wastewater resulting in a biofilm area to reactor volume a v ratio of 119 m 1 eight removable sliding sections 5 mm 200 mm were mounted in recessed slots on the inner wall of the outer cylinder for biofilm sampling mixing was provided by the rotation of the inner cylinder driven by a motor at a speed of 200 rpm the mixing was expected to create a uniform shear stress on the reactor walls biofilm surface so that biofilms grow relatively evenly on the wall the mixing resulted in an average shear stress of 2 11 n m2 which is typical in sewer systems enfinger and mitchell 2010 a reservoir was mounted on the top of the reactor to ensure the reactor was full of wastewater during its operation and sampling domestic sewage collected weekly from a local wet well brisbane queensland was used as the feed to the reactor the composition of the wastewater was monitored every week the sewage typically contained sulfate at a concentration of 10 25 mg s l sulfide at 3 mg s mg l soluble cod scod at 200 300 mg l volatile fatty acids vfas at 50 120 mgcod l and ammonium approximately at 50 mgn l negligible amounts of sulfite thiosulfate 1 mg s l nitrate and nitrite 1 mgn l were present the sewage was stored in a cold room 4 c to minimize biological transformations and was heated to 20 1 c prior to being pumped into the reactors fig 2 the sewage was fed to the reactor intermittently by a peristaltic pump masterflex 7520 47 to simulate the typical flow patterns of rising main sewers figs s1 and si for easier reactor monitoring each day was divided into three identical 8 h periods every pumping event lasted for 3 min delivering one reactor volume 3 l of wastewater into the reactor the hrt of the wastewater ranged between 30 min and 4 h which are in the range of hrt observed in a typical real sewer pipe figs s2 and si 2 3 experimental data collection the reactor performance was monitored during an 8 h cycle period every two weeks since the start up of the reactor sulfide concentrations during the 8 h cycle were continuously monitored using the s can vu vis sepcitro lyser messtechnik gmbh austria as previously described by sutherland stacey et al 2008 in addition samples were taken from the reactor before and after each pumping event and also at 2 5 h 5 h and 6 5 h for the analysis of dissolved methane sulfate and vfas batch tests were also carried out once the reactor reached the steady state to evaluate sulfide and methane production rates with different influent substrate concentrations during each batch test the reactor was firstly filled with fresh wastewater then different amount 0 ml 9 ml and 20 ml of sodium sulfate stock solution 5 g s l was added to the reactor to achieve different sulfate concentrations in the reactor the sulfide and methane concentrations were monitored during the 2 h tests the sulfide concentration was continuously monitored using s can vu vis sepcitro lyser and the methane concentration was analyzed by taking sample at 0 10 20 30 60 90 and 120 min the distribution of srb and ma in the biofilm was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish after cryosectioning the biofilm samples collected during the steady state operation the removable biofilm sampling slides were firstly taken from the reactor and the biofilm samples were fixed with freshly prepared 4 paraformaldehyde solution the fixed biofilm samples were then embedded in tissue tek oct compound

implemented in aquasim 2 1 d the model includes 16 species specific biochemical processes and 33 stoichiometric and kinetic parameters as summarized in table s3 si most of these parameters were well established in previous studies therefore literature values were adopted for these parameters tables s4 and si sensitivity analysis reveals that the hydrolysis rate of easily biodegradable cod ks1 and the maximum growth rates of hac and srbac μhac and μsrbac are key parameters to predict the data sets therefore parameter estimation was carried out for these three parameters ks1 μhac and μsrbac through minimizing the sum of squares of the deviations between the model predictions and the experimental measured sulfide and methane profiles of the 8 h operational cycle during the different biofilm development stages the 95 confidence intervals of individual parameter estimates were calculated from the mean square fitting errors and the sensitivity of the model to the parameters according to dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 model validation was then carried out employing the model with the calibrated parameters to predict independent experimental data sets the measured sulfide and methane production with different influent substrate concentrations under the steady state conditions were compared with the model predicted values to validate the model also the experimentally determined distribution of srb and ma communities were compared with simulation results as part of the model validation 2 6 long term effect of sulfate and scod concentrations on sulfide and methane production activities the long term effect of sulfate and scod concentrations on sulfide and methane production activities of the sewer biofilm was evaluated using the validated biofilm model the biofilm model was employed to make an assessment of the activities under different combinations of influent sulfate concentration ranging from 5 mg s l to 30 mg s l with 5 mg s l steps and soluble cod scod concentration ranging from 100 mgcod l to 500 mgcod l with 50 mgcod l steps with dynamic feeding until steady state was reached the maximum sulfide and methane production rates were calculated using linear regression based on the linear parts of the simulated sulfide and methane concentration profiles empirical equations describing the dependency of kh2s and kch4 on the long term variation in sulfate and scod concentrations were attempted based on the simulated maximum sulfide and methane production rates using the detailed biofilm model under different influent sulfate and scod concentrations the best structure of empirical equations was selected based on the fit of the data obtained from both empirical model and detailed biofilm model simulation results the parameters in the empirical equations were estimated through minimizing the sum of squares of the deviations between the model predictions of the empirical model and detailed biofilm model the 95 confidence intervals of individual parameter estimates were calculated from the mean square fitting errors and the sensitivity of the model to the parameters according to dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 3 results and discussion 3 1 biofilm model calibration with routine operational profiles model calibration of this work involved estimating three key parameter values ks1 μhac and μsrbac for the system so that the sulfide and methane concentrations predicted by the model closely agreed with the measured 8 h profiles during the routine operation over the entire biofilm development stage the calibrated parameter values with their 95 confidence interval were listed in table s4 si the relatively narrow confidence interval indicated acceptable identifiabiltiy of these parameters the comparisons of model simulations and experimentally measured profiles on day 22 day 250 and day 605 were presented in fig 3 as examples the results suggested that with the calibrated parameters the model could well describe the dynamics of sulfide and methane concentrations at different biofilm development stages specifically as shown in fig 3a and b when the biofilm just started to develop both the sulfide and methane concentrations were low in the reactor 11 mg s l for sulfide and 10 mgcod l for methane also the sulfide and methane production activities were low indicated by the relatively smooth slope of sulfide and methane concentrations compared with that on day 250 and day 605 on day 250 the sulfide production activity of the biofilm has already reached steady state as the maximum sulfide production rate on day 250 14 5 mg s l h was comparable to that on day 605 14 8 mg s l h the sulfide concentrations in the reactor on day 250 were slightly higher than that on day 605 which was caused by the higher influent sulfate concentration on day 250 22 mg s l for day 250 vs 19 mg s l for day 605 in contrast the methane production activity of the sewer biofilm developed more slowly with the steady state conditions not being achieved after 250 day cultivation the maximum methane production rate increased from 30 mgcod l h to 43 mgcod l h from day 250 to day 605 the slower development of methane production activity as compared with the sulfide production activity could be explained by the lower growth rate of ma as compared with srb as well as ma having lower affinity to substrates acetate and hydrogen than srb guisasola et al 2009 sun et al 2014 the differences between the measured data and model predictions are relatively low r2 0 97 for sulfide and r2 0 95 for methane illustrating that the biofilm model developed in this study can satisfactorily capture all the trends described above 3 2 biofilm model validation with batch tests data the developed biofilm model with calibrated parameter was firstly validated with measured sulfide and methane productions obtained from batch tests carried out under three different substrate conditions during the steady state as shown in fig 4 the simulation results matched well with the measured sulfide and methane concentrations in all the three cases sulfide concentrations increased rapidly at the beginning of each test and then the increase slowed down gradually as a result of the decrease in substrate concentrations fig 4a there was an increase in sulfide production rate when the sulfate concentration in feed increased from 17 mg s l to 32 mg s l however the further increase of the feed sulfate concentration to 50 mg s l resulted in very little increase in the sulfide production rate the modelling results further revealed that with the increase of feed sulfate concentration from 17 mg s l to 32 mg s l sulfate penetration increased to deeper layers of the biofilm providing substrate to srb located in these layers this led to an increase in the sulfide production rate however a further increase of the feed sulfate concentration from 32 mg s l to 50 mg s l did not further increase the sulfide production rate because sulfate fully penetrated the biofilm in both cases as for methane both measured and modeled methane concentrations increased quickly in the first 30 min before the increase slowing down due to the decrease in substrate concentration fig 4b the methane production rates observed with different influent sulfate concentrations were similar indicating that short term difference in sulfate concentration would not significantly affect the methane production rates the methane production rate with the lowest influent sulfate concentration of 17 mg s l was slightly higher than the other two cases 44 mgcod l h 40 mgcod l h and 38 mgcod l h for the cases of 17 mg s l 32 mg s l 50 mg s l respectively this was because of a higher scod uptake by srb for sulfidogenesis in the latter two cases fig 3a which resulted in less scod mainly acetate and hydrogen availability to ma and the methane production rate decreased accordingly all the results above supported that the developed model adequately captured the activities of srb and ma which were predicted to coexist in sewer biofilms 3 3 biofilm model validation with measured microbial distribution the developed biofilm model was also validated with the observed pattern of microbial distribution in the biofilm determined by cryosection fish as shown in fig 5 the fish result indicated that srb population was mainly located in the outer layer of the biofilm with the relative abundance of srb decreasing from 19 to 0 from the biofilm surface to the substratum on the other hand ma primarily grew in the inner layers of the biofilm the relative abundance of ma was close to 80 at a depth of 100 μm from the substratum but it dropped to lower than 10 at the biofilm surface the model was able to reasonably describe the overall srb and ma distribution pattern in the biofilm although the predicted relative abundances of srb and ma were slightly higher than the measured ones near the biofilm surface these results further demonstrated the capability of the model to simulate sulfide and methane production activities in a sewer biofilm 3 4 long term effect of sulfate and scod concentrations on sulfide and methane production activities sewer biofilms developed under different substrate conditions for a long time have been demonstrated to have different microbial community structures resulting in different sulfide and methane production activities mohanakrishnan et al 2009 sun et al 2015a in order to shed light on the long term changes in the sulfate and scod concentrations on sulfate and methane production a simulation study using the detailed model discussed in the earlier sections was carried out the results are presented in fig 6 fig 6a shows that the increase in both sulfate and scod concentration has positive effect on sulfide production activities as they both serve as the substrates for sulfide production hvitved jacobsen 2002 muyzer and stams 2008 for a constant sulfate concentration an increase in the feed scod concentration would result in an increase of the maximum sulfide production rate up to a certain scod level beyond which the rate appears to remain steady the relatively smaller increase in the rate is most likely due to sulfate being a limiting substrate at high scod concentrations which could not support the additional growth of srb although scod was in excess on the other hand with a constant scod concentration the maximum sulfide production rate would increase continuously with an increase in sulfate concentration the cod limitation for the growth of srb was not observed under the simulated conditions sulfate and scod concentrations showed opposite impacts on the methane production activity of the rising main sewer biofilms fig 6b the maximum methane production rate increased with the increase of scod concentration as higher scod concentration would provide more substrate for methanogenesis on the other hand the maximum methane production rate decreased with the increase in sulfate concentration this could be explained by out competition of ma by srb under the high sulfate conditions raskin et al 1996 particularly in outer biofilm layers since srb has higher affinity to scod mainly hydrogen and acetate as compared to ma with the increase of sulfate concentration more scod was used for the srb growth in the biofilm kristjansson et al 1982 schönheit et al 1982 as a result less scod would be available for the growth of ma and consequently the methane production activity of the biofilm decreased we propose to use the following empirical equations to describe the dependency of the maximum sulfide and methane production rates kh2s and kch4 on long term average sulfate and scod concentrations 4 k h 2 s a 1 s s o 4 ln s s c o d b 1 5 k c h 4 a 2 s s o 4 b 2 s s c o d c where r h 2 s is areal sulfide production rate gs m2 day r c h 4 is areal methane production rate gcod m2 day s s o 4 is the long term average sulfate concentration in the wastewater mgs l the application range is 5 30 mg s l s s c o d is the long term average scod concentration in the wastewater mgcod l the application range is 100 500 mgcod l a1 b1 a2 b2 and c are constant parameters in the models the estimated values and 95 confidence interval of the five parameters a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 and c are shown in table 1 the relatively narrow confidence interval indicated acceptable identifiabiltiy of these parameters as shown in fig 6 the empirical equations well reproduce predictions by the detailed biofilm model the above empirical equations although adequately describe the dependency of the maximum sulfide and methane production rates kh2s and kch4 on long term average sulfate and scod concentrations are based on extrapolation of experimental data collected from a single set of experiments further experiments with different substrate conditions are strongly recommended for the calibration and validation of these empirical equations before these equations could be integrated into a sewer model 4 conclusions this study investigated long term effect of sulfate and cod concentrations on the sulfide and methane production activities of rising main sewer biofilm by developing a detailed biofilm model the biofilm model was calibrated and validated using the experimental data obtained from a sewer reactor operated during the entire biofilm development period the model is able to predict the coexistence and competition between sulfate reducing bacteria methanogenic archaea under anaerobic conditions a simulation study using the calibrated biofilm model suggests that the long term variations of wastewater sulfate and scod concentrations would affect both sulfide and methane production activities of the sewer biofilm the increase of sulfate concentration enhanced the maximum sulfide production rate kh2s but decreased the maximum methane production rate kch4 whereas the increase of scod concentration enhanced both maximum sulfide and methane production rates mathematical expressions describing the dependency of kh2s and kch4 on long term sulfate and scod concentrations is developed based on the detailed biofilm model simulations although these empirical equations require further validation using more comprehensive datasets they provide a
