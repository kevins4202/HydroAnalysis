9450,soil mulching e g straw mulching sm and ridge furrow plastic film mulching rp has been reported to promote rainfed crop production in semi arid regions but its applicability in improving maize yield and especially yield stability in semi humid drought prone regions has been rarely explored the capture and utilization of thermal light water and nutrients resources by maize plants under various soil mulching conditions are also poorly understood a consecutive five season field experiment was conducted on rainfed maize in a semi humid drought prone region of china during 2015 2019 to assess the effects of sm and rp on soil hydrothermal conditions radiation interception photosynthesis evapotranspiration and grain yield stability profitability and resources use efficiency compared with non mulching nm the results showed that rp enhanced soil hydrothermal conditions promoted the conversion of water from soil evaporation to plant transpiration and improved water productivity by 10 9 203 2 compared with nm p 0 05 although the growth duration was shortened the accumulative soil thermal time and intercepted photosynthetically active radiation under rp were still 4 4 and 3 9 higher with average increases in thermal time use efficiency by 23 and radiation use efficiency by 24 which resulted in significantly higher nutrients accumulation by 6 7 19 7 for nitrogen and 4 1 42 0 for phosphorous grain yield by 9 5 186 4 and yield stability by 38 1 these improvements were particularly pronounced in normal and dry years 2015 2016 and 2017 no significant difference existed in maize s capacity of absorbing water and nutrients and maize productivity between sm and rp under sufficient precipitation supply 2018 and 2019 the average net profit was highest under rp especially in dry and normal years while sm could achieve comparable net profit to rp in wet years overall rp was preferable for rainfed maize production in semi humid drought prone regions in any precipitation year while sm can be an alternative mulching practice in wet years these results can improve our understanding of how rp and sm enhance rainfed maize productivity by improving resources capture and use efficiency keywords soil mulching rainfed maize photosynthesis resources use efficiency semi humid drought prone region 1 introduction crop productivity is influenced by a variety of environmental variables e g soil water and temperature photosynthetically active radiation par and nutrient availability ashraf and harris 2013 crop biomass and ultimately grains are determined by the efficiency of converting these key production resources into biological materials yi et al 2010 rainfed agriculture comprises 75 of world s arable land and crop yields are severely limited by the adverse weather conditions yang et al 2021 making full use of limited resources and improving their use efficiency are the basic keys and the major challenges to increase the rainfed crop productivity zhang et al 2019a b zheng et al 2019 2021a the loess plateau of northwest china is mostly dominated by rainfed agriculture relying only on rainwater soil water supply is the major limiting factor to the growth and grain yield of rainfed maize while the radiation obtained is usually unlimited li et al 2009 reynolds et al 2007 wei et al 2018 water stress can reduce water loss by restricting leaf area via shedding or senescence for survival and reproduction mwale et al 2007a b therefore straw mulching sm and ridge furrow plastic film mulching rp have been extensively applied to conserve soil water storage by reducing surface runoff suppressing unproductive evaporation promoting rainwater penetration into deep soils and prolonging soil water availability in rainfed farming systems dang et al 2016 liu et al 2020 as water saving agriculture countermeasures in northwest of china sm and rp have increased maize yields by around 10 and 20 compared to conventional flat planting the increases in water productivity wp of rainfed maize under sm and rp were about 11 and 28 respectively gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 however their beneficial effect on crop yield and water productivity decreased with the increasing soil water availability in rainfed agriculture and there may be no significant difference between sm and rp in wetter than normal years gan et al 2013 yu et al 2018 2021 therefore yield stability the variability of yield across years is an important issue for the evaluation of suitable agricultural practices on food security in different precipitation years it is still not clear whether the yield stability of sm and rp differs from that of nm photosynthesis playing a determining role in crop production is greatly influenced by water stress soil water retention and modification of water extraction patterns by sm and rp can improve leaf growth and photosynthesis rate which contributes to high crop yields lamptey et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 plastic film mulching can modify soil surface microclimates through enhancing air resistance and sunshine reflectance and then substantially improve the photosynthetic capacity hou et al 2015 however the increase in soil temperature on the ridge promoted plant growth which in turn accelerated leaf senescence and reduced the light interception at later stage and may further decrease photosynthesis and carbon fixation per unit leaf area ding et al 2020 as for sm insufficient heat supply resulted from straw mulching on the soil surface was usually reported to limit the maize emergence and early development which was not conductive to dry matter accumulation and ultimately grain yield andrade et al 2010 zheng et al 2021c nevertheless straw mulching could delay the leaf senescence intercept more sunlight and then prolong photosynthetic physiological processes which may support higher photosynthesis capacity during grain filling and obtain higher crop yields yin et al 2016 the accumulated soil temperature and the proportion of intercepted radiation by crop canopy resulting from rp and sm during the crop growing seasons have not been adequately evaluated on the other hand sm and rp can bring about a series of changes in soil nitrogen n and phosphorous p which are important for crop production mo et al 2017 the combination of water light and heat may simultaneously stimulate physiological processes that transport nutrients from soil to vegetative organs and eventually to grains liu et al 2015 which finally leads to higher nutrients use efficiency under sm and rp it can be seen that no mulching straw mulching and ridge furrow plastic film mulching result in differences in photosynthetic capacity and resource utilization efficiency because soil hydrothermal and other factors under these techniques vary greatly most previous studies have concentrated on their effects on soil water and temperature dynamics however there is still a lack of the mechanism on radiation thermal water and nutrients absorption and utilization resulting from plastic film and straw mulching practices to enhance crop productivity and yield stability understanding the capture and utilization of thermal light water and nutrients resources by maize plants under soil mulching conditions is important for clarifying crops physiological progression establishing plants water nutrient management modeling and optimizing agricultural practices the aims of the present study were thus to i quantify the amounts of soil effective accumulated temperature intercepted photosynthetically active radiation water consumption and nutrients absorption under non mulching straw mulching and ridge furrow plastic film mulching ii explore the efficiency of these three mulching practices to capture resources for producing grain yield and iii assess the among year yield stability under these three various mulching practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description a five season field experiment was conducted from

in 2015 28th july 16th august and 2nd september in 2016 24th july 16th august and 13th september in 2017 26th july 21st august and 17th september in 2018 and 27th july 13th august and 22th september in 2019 respectively the content of chlorophyll a and b in the filtered solution was determined by a genesys 10 uv spectrophotometer at 665 and 649 nm on 25th july 15th august and 5th september in 2015 28th august 16th august and 2nd september in 2016 24th july 15th august and 10th september in 2017 27th july 21st august and 4th september in 2018 and 28th july 21st august and 26th september in 2019 respectively total chlorophyll content was calculated as 13 95 a665 6 88 a649 24 96 a649 7 32 a665 where a665 and a649 represented the absorbance value of the supernatant at 665 and 649 nm respectively li et al 2018 2 3 5 crop nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous uptake maize plant parts were ground weighed and digested with h2so4 h2o2 the tissue n concentration was then determined with an automatic kjeldahl apparatus foss co sweden bremner 1996 and the p concentration was determined with the mo sb vc method lian et al 2017 at harvest the uptake of n or p by maize plants was determined by multiplying the dry matter weight by the n or p concentration 2 3 6 plant transpiration and soil evaporation the plant transpiration over the five growing seasons was measured using the heat based sap flow sensors dynamax houston tx usa the detailed methods for installation and calibration of sap flow sensors were described by fan et al 2021 and zheng et al 2021a b hourly sap flow rate g h 1 plant 1 of each maize plant was recorded with a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific logan ut usa and then was converted to daily transpiration t mm day 1 soil evaporation e mm was measured with self made pvc micro lysimeters 20 cm in height and 10 5 cm in diameter zheng et al 2021a for nm and sm two pipes were installed in the row and between two rows respectively for rp two pipes were located on the ridge and furrow respectively daily e was taken as the difference between the weight of micro lysimeter at the beginning and end of the day 18 00 pm the e was assumed as zero on rainy days according to wang and wang 2017 2 3 7 grain yield and yield stability at harvest twelve plants were selected in the center of each experimental plot for determining grain yield gy at 14 water content the temporal stability of grain yield in different treatments was quantified using the coefficient of variation cv i e cv stdv across years mean gy across those years where stdv and gy

soil thermal time and thermal time use efficiency the cumulative soil thermal time during the entire growing season ttsoil was calculated as tt soil t soil t base mcmaster and wilhem 1997 where tsoil was the value of soil temperature at 10 cm and tbase was minimum active soil temperature 10 liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2019a the thermal time use efficiency tue kg ha 1 1 for grain yield was

water productivity wp kg ha 1 mm 1 was determined as wp gy et 2 4 3 intercepted photosynthetically active radiation and radiation use efficiency the intercepted photosynthetically active radiation ipar was estimated to be half of solar radiation as per liu et al 2010 and the cumulative amount of intercept par ipar mj m 2 over the maize growing season was computed as ipar 0 5 rs 1 e klai yang et al 2004 where rs was the solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 k was the light extinction coefficient 0 65 for maize monteith 1969 and daily lai m2 m 2 was estimated from nonlinear fitted equation of measured lai and the day after sowing das lai a dasb exp 0 077 das where a and b were fitted parameters by spss ding et al 2013 the radiation use efficiency rue g mj 1 for grain yield was determined as rue gy ipar 2 4 4 nutrient uptake efficiency and nutrient productive efficiency the nutrients use efficiency included nutrient uptake efficiency nupe kg 1 kg 1 and nutrient productive efficiency npe kg 1 kg 1 montemurro et al 2006 zhang et al 2019b nupe was calculated as n uptake by maize plant divided by n p application rate npe was the ratio of gy and n p application rate 2 5 statistical analyses the spss software spss inc chicago usa was used for the analysis of variance anova to assess the effect of the three mulching treatments on the measured parameters at the probability level of 0 05 the least significant difference test lsd was used to compare the means among treatments the sigmaplot 10 0 software was used to draw all figures 3 results 3 1 soil hydrothermal conditions soil temperature was largely affected by the three mulching practices and the difference was great at the initial stage of growth and gradually decreased over time fig s1 throughout the growing seasons topsoil temperature under rp was averagely increased by 0 82 in 2015 p 0 05 0 61 in 2016 p 0 05 0 72 in 2017 p 0 05 1 69 in 2018 p 0 05 and 1 31 in 2019 p 0 05 compare to that under nm respectively table 2 in contrast sm significantly decreased topsoil temperature by 1 30 and 0 89 in 2015 and 2017 in comparison to nm respectively however soil temperature under sm was insignificantly different from that under nm in 2016 2018 and 2019 the swc under sm and rp in the 0 60 cm soil layer were generally higher than that under nm before the mid season while the trends of swc were irregular after that fig s1 compared to nm rp improved the average soil water storage in the 60 cm soil by 4 5 mm significant in 2016 and sm increased it by 3 5 mm throughout the five growing seasons significant in 2017 and 2019 table 2 3 2 maize development stages generally the specific vegetative vs and reproductive stage rs of summer maize was accelerated by rp throughout the five seasons fig 2 compared with nm rp resulted in 0 1 day earlier seedling emergence and advanced the silking stage by 2 4 days from sowing to physiological maturity the whole growth period under rp was 2 7 days shorter than that under nm 2 3 days shorter during vs and 1 4 days shorter during rs in the sm plots straw on the soil surface caused slow seedling emergence about 1 day later but similar or earlier jointing and silking growth due to the better growth promoting water conditions however the duration of reproductive growth from silking to physiological maturity under sm treatment was slightly longer 1 3 days longer in comparison with the nm treatment 3 3 leaf area index and dry matter accumulation the lai increased dramatically from seedling to silking stage reached the peak at the early silking and then decreased because of leaf senescence fig 3 there was no significant difference in lai at the seedling emergence among the treatments but the difference gradually increased with the maize growth and development soil mulching positively affected lai in 2015 and 2017 but slightly in 2016 2018 and 2019 due to the adequate precipitation at the vegetative stage table 1 over all the five growing seasons the maximum lai under rp and sm were increased by 24 2 and 16 2 in 2015 8 3 and 4 5 in 2016 16 7 and 10 0 in 2017 7 2 and 1 9 in 2018 and 5 9 and 11 0 in 2019 respectively the extreme drought at reproductive stage in 2016 resulted in a significant decline of lai at the late growth stages and the heavy waterlogging from sowing to seedling in 2019 resulted in lower extension of lai at vegetative stage than the other years the increases in dry matter under rp and sm gradually increased with maize growth and development especially at the reproductive stage fig 4 over all the five growing seasons the dry matter accumulation at maturity under rp and sm were increased by 11 7 and 4 9 in 2015 49 1 and 17 3 in 2016 21 8 and 9 8 in 2017 9 4 and 9 8 in 2018 and 9 4 and 8 0 in 2019 compared with that under nm respectively among these five seasons the increases in dry matter under rp and sm relative to nm were greater in 2016 but lower in 2018 and 2019 compared with the other years this was presumably because the less precipitation at reproductive stage in 2016 stimulated soil water conservation capacity by soil mulching while the effects of soil mulching on maintaining soil water was minimized in the wet years 2018 and 2019 3 4 photosynthetic characteristics and leaf chlorophyll content compared with nm soil mulching significantly increased the photosynthetic pn and transpiration rates tr of summer maize fig 5 throughout the five growing seasons rp and sm showed increases in the average pn of 21 8 and 12 6 at jointing 20 8 and 9 4 at tasseling and 25 3 and 16 1 at filling stages compared with nm respectively the five season average transpiration rate stomatal conductance and total chlorophyll content were 22 1 29 5 and 9 3 higher under rp 11 4 11 2 and 7 3 higher under sm compared with those under nm respectively 3 5 grain yield and yield stability grain yield gy under rp was significantly increased by 27 0 in 2015 186 4 in 2016 42 3 in 2017 16 5 in 2018 and 9 5 in 2019 in comparison with that under nm respectively table 3 a significantly lower relative yield stability cv was observed under rp than nm and sm fig 6 therefore rp had a great positive effect on yield stability in all precipitation years indicating that rp effectively maintained the yield without considering the distribution of seasonal precipitation there was no significant difference in grain yield between nm and sm during the 2015 normal year 2016 dry year and 2019 wet year growing seasons p 0 05 however relative to nm sm significantly enhanced grain yield by 26 1 and 12 4 in 2017 and 2018 respectively the relative yield stability cv did not vary greatly between sm and nm indicating that the overall temporal variability in grain yield was similar sm and nm despite of higher yield level under sm fig 6 however the cv of rp 28 1 was significantly smaller than that of sm 45 1 and nm 45 3 indicating its capability of maintaining yield stability rp tended to improve grain yield average ri 1 56 and its positive effect tended to decrease with the increase of precipitation amount during the growing season especially precipitation at reproductive stage fig s2 the grain yield and ri under sm were not significantly different from those under rp when the seasonal precipitation was high 417 mm and 500 mm 3 6 resources use efficiency 3 6 1 soil thermal time dynamics and use efficiency the ttsoil of each treatment increased over time in a logistic form fig s3 there was no consistent tendency of ttsoil from sowing to seedling emergence stage table 4 the decrease in ttsoil under sm relative to nm continued at vegetative stage 46 0 c from seedling emergence to jointing and 20 0 c from jointing to silking respectively the ttsoil under sm at reproductive stage showed a decrease of 22 7 c in 2015 and 2016 in comparison to nm but showed an increase of 24 3 c in 2017 2019 because the inhibition effect of sm on soil temperature may be compensated by adequate precipitation at this stage and the effect may be minimized due to the decomposition of straw on the soil surface the increase of ttsoil under rp relative to nm was not obvious at vegetative stage 5 8 c from seedling emergence to jointing and 10 8 c from jointing to silking respectively but significant at reproductive stage 51 2 c sm and rp greatly promoted the transformation of the thermal resource into grains throughout the five growing seasons sm and rp increased tue by 19 5 p 0 05 and 23 7 p 0 05 in 2015 13 7 p 0 05 and 185 3 p 0 05 in 2016 33 3 p 0 05 and 38 7 p 0 05 in 2017 10 2 p 0 05 and 5 5 p 0 05 in 2018 and 9 7 p 0 05 and 3 0 p 0 05 in 2019 compared with nm respectively table 7 3 6 2 intercepted photosynthetically active radiation and radiation use efficiency compared with nm rp and sm stimulated ipar by 7 8 p 0 05 and 7 7 p 0 05 in 2015 1 3 p 0 05 and 2 2 p 0 05 in 2016 9 9 p 0 05 and 7 7 p 0 05 in 2017 1 9 p 0 05 and 4 4 p 0 05 in 2018 and 1 7 p 0 05 and 4 7 p 0 05 in 2019 respectively table 5 fig s3 the difference of ipar among the three mulching treatments appeared at the jointing silking stage when the difference of lai gradually appeared in all treatments in 2015 2017 seasons fig 3 table 1 however the difference of ipar mainly occurred after silking in the 2018 and 2019 seasons because of the non significant differences of lai at the vegetative stage resulting from adequate precipitation at this stage indicating the sensitive effect of lai on ipar a promoted conversion of radiation resource into grain yield was found in both rp and sm plots than in nm plots and the increase in rue was 17 7 p 0 05 190 1 p 0 05 29 5 p 0 05 14 4 p 0 05 and 7 7 p 0 05 in rp and 1 7 p 0 05 7 8 p 0 05 17 2 p 0 05 7 7 p 0 05 and 2 9 p 0 05 in sm over the five growing seasons respectively table 7 3 6 3 evapotranspiration and water productivity the et before jointing was always lower under sm and rp compared with that under nm but there was little difference in et among the three treatments after jointing and et under sm and rp then tended to be higher than that under nm after silking table 6 fig s3 over the five growing seasons rp significantly decreased et before jointing by 52 9 from sowing to seedling and 21 3 from seedling to jointing but increased it during later growth stages by 1 1 from jointing to silking and 11 2 from silking to maturity in addition the 5 year average et under sm was decreased by 6 7 and 13 0 during sowing seedling and seedling jointing while increased by 4 8 and 7 2 during jointing silking and silking maturity respectively generally growing season et of summer maize varied from 192 to 375 mm which was lower in 2016 and higher in 2018 and 2019 when more precipitation occurred no significant difference was observed but the wp among the three mulching treatments differed greatly table 7 the rp and sm treatments retained a relatively higher wp which was increased by 22 4 p 0 05 and 1 6 p 0 05 in 2015 by 203 2 p 0 05 and 11 7 p 0 05 in 2016 by 32 6 p 0 05 and 15 9 p 0 05 in 2017 by 16 7 p 0 05 and 9 9 p 0 05 in 2018 and by 10 9 p 0 05 and 9 8 p 0 05 in 2019 compared to that under nm respectively 3 6 4 nutrient n and p uptake and use efficiency and nutrient productive efficiency rp and sm greatly increased maize plant n and p uptakes relative to nm fig s3 meanwhile n and p use efficiency were greatly increased in the rp and sm plots over the nm indicating an improved translocation of nutrients from plant organs to maize grains table 7 the increases in nupe by maize plants under rp and sm were 9 4 p 0 05 and 4 7 p 0 05 in 2015 6 7 p 0 05 and 6 7 p 0 05 in 2016 12 4 p 0 05 and 5 8 p 0 05 in 2017 19 7 p 0 05 and 19 6 p 0 05 in 2018 and 7 1 p 0 05 and 7 5 p 0 05 in 2019 respectively the increases in npe were 26 9 p 0 05 186 8 p 0 05 42 4 p 0 05 16 5 p 0 05 and 9 5 p 0 05 under rp and 9 4 p 0 05 10 5 p 0 05 26 4 p 0 05 12 4 p 0 05 and 7 7 p 0 05 under sm during the five seasons respectively compared with nm the rp treatments increased pupe by 10 2 p 0 05 4 1 p 0 05 25 1 p 0 05 42 0 p 0 05 and 5 3 p 0 05 in 2015 2019 and increased ppe by 27 0 p 0 05 186 4 p 0 05 42 3 p 0 05 16 5 p 0 05 and 9 5 p 0 05 respectively sm increased pupe by 5 1 p 0 05 4 1 p 0 05 13 8 p 0 05 54 2 p 0 05 and 10 0 p 0 05 and increased ppe by 9 5 p 0 05 10 1 p 0 05 26 1 p 0 05 12 4 p 0 05 and 7 7 p 0 05 in the five seasons respectively it can be seen that in normal and dry years the response of rp to soil nutrients was better than that of sm but no significant difference existed between rp and sm in wet years 3 7 cost benefit analysis the total input included mulching material input mmi seed and fertilizer input sfi and labor input lmi table 8 because the straw was usually burned or returned to the soil in the region lu et al 2021a b the profit of crop stalks was ignored and only the income from grains was calculated in this study the total output to was basically grain yield produced and sold to grain yield maize yield price though drying sheering and mulching of straw required by sm plots and form of ridges and furrows required by rp plots increased the labor input the total output under sm and rp was greater than that under nm because of the improved grain yield table 3 totally net profit of sm was slightly lower than that of nm p 0 05 but the net profit np under rp was always highest averagely 1270 5 usd ha 1 in the five growing seasons the net profit was comparatively lower in years with relatively less precipitation especially in 2016 suffering with extreme drought thereby resulting in the negative income the result of total output total input to ti was similar to the net profit with relatively greater values under rp 4 discussion 4 1 soil temperature and water it is generally believed that transparent plastic film in rp can allow the solar radiation to reach the soil surface but prevent long wave solar radiation from topsoil to the open air which impede the escape of soil heat and improved the soil thermal conditions liu et al 2010 straw forms a physical barrier between the soil and atmosphere on the surface which could block radiation from the sun into the soil and then reduce the soil temperature li et al 2021 these researchers also pointed out that the warming effect by plastic film and cooling effect by straw mulching were greater at the early growth stages which was also found by our study fig s1 soil temperature under sm was sometimes similar or higher than that under nm in our study especially in wet years 2018 and 2019 fig s1 this can be explained by a point of view that soil heat beneath straw mulching was insulated and retained in the soil in overcast and cloudy weathers fang et al 2021 which could cause the straw mulched soil lose heat more slowly than the non mulched soil soil temperature was related to the soil effective accumulated temperature of plants 10 per day for maize development which determines the plant phenology lynn et al 2015 higher accumulated temperatures can speed up seed germination at the beginning of reproductive period subrahmaniyan et al 2018 compared to nm soil temperature at 10 cm depth was usually higher under rp and lower under sm fig s1 which caused shortening of growth duration by 2 7 days under rp and the prolonging of growth duration by 1 3 days with sm in comparison with nm although the improved soil water condition under sm was favorable for the physiological processes of maize the decreased soil temperature under sm caused negative influence on maize plant growth resulting in the extension of growth duration the ttsoil at each stage presented in table 4 was not always followed the order of rp nm sm because the soil effective accumulated temperature was also affected by the growing days of maize soil mulching can preserve soil water by directly inhibiting soil evaporation and enhancing water infiltration liao et al 2021 zheng et al 2021d in this study rp and sm improved soil water condition at the early growth stage for example swc under rp and sm at seedling and jointing stages were generally higher than that under nm as shown in fig s1 however the beneficial effect may be offset or even decreased over time especially after silking fig s1 these may cause no clear trend in mean soil water storage in the 0 60 cm soil layer over the growing season soil water was lost mainly from soil evaporation and plant transpiration so evapotranspiration et determined the soil water storage there were some possible reasons to explain the relatively better water conditions under rp and sm than nm before mid season but no irregular trend of swc after silking firstly when plants were small soil water was lost mainly through soil evaporation tugwell wootton et al 2020 our previous studies also affirmed the dominant role of soil evaporation in et when plants were small zheng et al 2021a resulting in higher et under nm than rp and sm and thus the lower swc under rp and sm relative to nm before maize reproductive stage table 6 fig s1 secondly maize grew vigorously and water loss gradually shifted from soil evaporation to plant transpiration at middle and later stages zheng et al 2021b mulched maize experienced faster growth and greater transpiration which can lead to higher transpiration under rp and sm after silking and thus the uncertain trend of swc among the three treatments table 6 fig s1 as reported by jia et al 2018b although some studies reported that the offset in swc improvement was more obvious when precipitation was rare li et al 2017a b zhang et al 2019b swc under rp and sm were still mildly higher than that under nm from silking to maturity in the dry year of 2016 this was likely because the persistent and severe soil drought in 2016 caused leaf drying and low plant transpiration after silking leading to the higher ratio of evaporation to et compared with that in the other years and then the inhibition effect of soil mulching on water vapor still worked greatly at this stage zheng et al 2021a however there was no consistent pattern of swc after silking in different years which still need further investigation 4 2 photosynthetic traits photosynthetic capacity is highly linked with soil water and is very important for biomass and yield wang et al 2015a ren et al 2016 better water availability at earlier growth stage under rp and sm than nm positively affected crop photosynthesis with increases in pn tr and stomatal conductance the maize plants in rp and sm plots generally suffered water stress after silking due to greater transpiration which may decrease leaf photosynthetic rate karimi et al 2015 however the plants can still maintain higher level of photosynthetic capacity fig 5 because water in the deeper soil can move to the root zone by capillarity to sustain the leaf function bu et al 2013 zhang et al 2022 also found higher photosynthetic rate under ridge furrow systems compared to non mulching despite of lower soil water content excessive water deficit will inhibit photosynthetic metabolism and decrease the photosynthetic potential thereby slowing down the photosynthetic rate shao et al 2021 this effect can explain why pn tr and stomatal conductance greatly decreased during reproductive growth period of 2016 when they suffered extremely hydraulic drought stress besides the enhanced photosynthesis under rp and sm may be the result of the improvement of light environment since mulching increased lai and could intercept more par in maize canopy yi et al 2010 zhang et al 2019a b the average pn and stomatal conductance throughout the maize season in the wet 2018 and 2019 seasons was about 5 and 15 lower than that in the normal 2015 and 2017 seasons respectively the reason for the higher photosynthesis parameters in the normal years than wet years may be that the moderate drying of vigorous growth could increase the tissue biochemical activity and then counteract the drought response induced by aba under water stress chai et al 2016 yang et al 2017a b 4 3 maize growth and nutrients uptake the improved soil temperature throughout seasons and better water availability at the earlier stage under rp greatly improved lai and dry matter accumulation relative to nm as for rp seeds were sown at the joint line of ridge and bare furrow water droplets attached to the inner side of the film flow down to maize base provide much water for seed germination in addition the warming effect of plastic film greatly accelerated the emergence seedling and plant growth as for sm its cooling effect on soil temperature prolonged the emergence time but was not harmful to the growth and ultimately yield due to sufficient effective accumulated temperature during entire season from mid june to late september for summer maize fig s3 also its inhibition effect on evaporation and promotion effect on transpiration is critical to vegetative growth and maize yield fang et al 2021 zheng et al 2021a grain yield were ranked as 2018 7721 8997 kg ha 1 2019 7688 8418 kg ha 1 2017 6075 8645 kg ha 1 2015 5936 7537 kg ha 1 2016 1367 3915 kg ha 1 which basically followed the trend of seasonal precipitation amount zheng et al 2021c d the positive effect of rp and sm on grain yield was diminished with the increase of precipitation amount fig s2 which was also supported by yu et al 2018 and zhang et al 2018 in this study rp produced significantly higher grain yield than nm and sm p 0 05 however rp and sm gave similar grain yield in the last two years p 0 05 the reason may be that the effect of soil water on grain yield was superior to that of soil temperature and the combined effect of improved soil water and temperature conditions on grain yield was better than that of sm in the normal and dry years however more water was retained in the soil profile resulting from higher precipitation amount during 2018 and 2019 growing seasons the effect of soil temperature on grain yield was thus offset by the effect of soil water leading to no significant difference in grain yield between rp and sm straw mulching and ridge furrow plastic film mulching greatly improved aboveground nutrients n and p accumulation during the whole growing season fig s3 similar results were also obtained by liu et al 2015 and nagegowda et al 2020 increased photosynthesis and plant growth because of better hydrothermal conditions in the rp and sm plots can promote root growth and thus the absorption area then in turn increase the nutrients uptake liu et al 2015 jia et al 2018a similar to maize yield drought and high temperature at reproductive stage limited plant n p uptake in 2016 and adequate precipitation resulted in no significant difference between sm and rp in nutrients uptake in 2018 and 2019 in total yield stability which is of agronomic importance as well was highest under rp fig 6 considering the negative impact of plastic film residues and the positive impacts of plant straw in increasing soil organic carbon sm can be regarded as an alternative in wet years while maintaining comparable maize productivity to that of rp steinmetz et al 2016 xu et al 2019 because the soil mulching practices are usually applied after sowing the application of these practices can be selected in advance by long range meteorological forecasting davey and brookshaw 2011 4 4 resources soil thermal time radiation water and nutrient use efficiency in arid and semi arid areas resource use is a basis for crop growth and its efficiency is important to researchers trying to achieve sustainable agricultural production liu et al 2010 in general there was sufficient heat supply under rp resulting from the heating effect of plastic film while soil thermal condition in sm treatment was relatively poor but the yield was not decreased by straw mulching and the reason may be that the sensitivity of dry matter assimilation to cumulative temperatures during reproductive growth is lower than that during vegetative growth stage zhang et al 2019a furthermore the reproductive growth stage was extended in sm compared to the control which could supply the sufficient thermal to stimulate the formation of crop grains as for the radiation increased lai enhanced the ability to capture light radiation under soil mulching more light was reflected from the plastic film to the maize canopy wang et al 2015a b c promoting the light use for rp treatment and carbon assimilation for grain yield also sm delayed maize growth period when maize canopy captured more solar radiation than nm and leading to more dry matter accumulation mulching practices significantly increased wp by greatly converting ineffective soil evaporation to efficient plant transpiration in the rp sm treatment during the five years although similar et were found among these practices table 6 this finding is consistent with the report by lin et al 2016 who found that maize with plastic film and straw mulching displayed a higher wp than non mulched plants but no significant difference in et was observed rp and sm significantly increased nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiency in this study which was mainly because soil mulching promoted dry matter accumulation by enhancing physiological characteristics and root growth in conclusion resources use efficiency is critical in the migration of maize assimilates from the source to reservoir and determination of grain yield rp and sm are comprehensive resource management practices for rainfed maize compared with nm especially rp with much higher grain yield and yield stability in any precipitation year due to the higher resources use efficiency 5 conclusions the capture and utilization of thermal light water and nutrients resources was sensitive to variations in soil water and thermal conditions resulting from soil mulching practices in the maize fields in semi humid drought prone regions the thermal effect of ridge furrow plastic film mulching accelerated the growth and development of maize captured more par for photosynthesis from sowing to maturity and then increased dry matter accumulation and grain yield though the shorten period by rp reduced the total light interception its efficiency of converting radiation to grains was higher in comparison to nm and sm rp is likely to be generally more preferable given its higher stability in maintaining yield and profitability especially in drought years however no significant difference in maize s capacity of absorbing water and nutrients and the crop productivity between sm and rp with sufficient precipitation supply therefore straw mulching can be recommended as an alternative agricultural practice in wet precipitation years and may minimize the adverse effects of plastic film residue in the soil in rainfed regions future work would be needed to address the environmental issues such as white pollution

9450,soil mulching e g straw mulching sm and ridge furrow plastic film mulching rp has been reported to promote rainfed crop production in semi arid regions but its applicability in improving maize yield and especially yield stability in semi humid drought prone regions has been rarely explored the capture and utilization of thermal light water and nutrients resources by maize plants under various soil mulching conditions are also poorly understood a consecutive five season field experiment was conducted on rainfed maize in a semi humid drought prone region of china during 2015 2019 to assess the effects of sm and rp on soil hydrothermal conditions radiation interception photosynthesis evapotranspiration and grain yield stability profitability and resources use efficiency compared with non mulching nm the results showed that rp enhanced soil hydrothermal conditions promoted the conversion of water from soil evaporation to plant transpiration and improved water productivity by 10 9 203 2 compared with nm p 0 05 although the growth duration was shortened the accumulative soil thermal time and intercepted photosynthetically active radiation under rp were still 4 4 and 3 9 higher with average increases in thermal time use efficiency by 23 and radiation use efficiency by 24 which resulted in significantly higher nutrients accumulation by 6 7 19 7 for nitrogen and 4 1 42 0 for phosphorous grain yield by 9 5 186 4 and yield stability by 38 1 these improvements were particularly pronounced in normal and dry years 2015 2016 and 2017 no significant difference existed in maize s capacity of absorbing water and nutrients and maize productivity between sm and rp under sufficient precipitation supply 2018 and 2019 the average net profit was highest under rp especially in dry and normal years while sm could achieve comparable net profit to rp in wet years overall rp was preferable for rainfed maize production in semi humid drought prone regions in any precipitation year while sm can be an alternative mulching practice in wet years these results can improve our understanding of how rp and sm enhance rainfed maize productivity by improving resources capture and use efficiency keywords soil mulching rainfed maize photosynthesis resources use efficiency semi humid drought prone region 1 introduction crop productivity is influenced by a variety of environmental variables e g soil water and temperature photosynthetically active radiation par and nutrient availability ashraf and harris 2013 crop biomass and ultimately grains are determined by the efficiency of converting these key production resources into biological materials yi et al 2010 rainfed agriculture comprises 75 of world s arable land and crop yields are severely limited by the adverse weather conditions yang et al 2021 making full use of limited resources and improving their use efficiency are the basic keys and the major challenges to increase the rainfed crop productivity zhang et al 2019a b zheng et al 2019 2021a the loess plateau of northwest china is mostly dominated by rainfed agriculture relying only on rainwater soil water supply is the major limiting factor to the growth and grain yield of rainfed maize while the radiation obtained is usually unlimited li et al 2009 reynolds et al 2007 wei et al 2018 water stress can reduce water loss by restricting leaf area via shedding or senescence for survival and reproduction mwale et al 2007a b therefore straw mulching sm and ridge furrow plastic film mulching rp have been extensively applied to conserve soil water storage by reducing surface runoff suppressing unproductive evaporation promoting rainwater penetration into deep soils and prolonging soil water availability in rainfed farming systems dang et al 2016 liu et al 2020 as water saving agriculture countermeasures in northwest of china sm and rp have increased maize yields by around 10 and 20 compared to conventional flat planting the increases in water productivity wp of rainfed maize under sm and rp were about 11 and 28 respectively gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 however their beneficial effect on crop yield and water productivity decreased with the increasing soil water availability in rainfed agriculture and there may be no significant difference between sm and rp in wetter than normal years gan et al 2013 yu et al 2018 2021 therefore yield stability the variability of yield across years is an important issue for the evaluation of suitable agricultural practices on food security in different precipitation years it is still not clear whether the yield stability of sm and rp differs from that of nm photosynthesis playing a determining role in crop production is greatly influenced by water stress soil water retention and modification of water extraction patterns by sm and rp can improve leaf growth and photosynthesis rate which contributes to high crop yields lamptey et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 plastic film mulching can modify soil surface microclimates through enhancing air resistance and sunshine reflectance and then substantially improve the photosynthetic capacity hou et al 2015 however the increase in soil temperature on the ridge promoted plant growth which in turn accelerated leaf senescence and reduced the light interception at later stage and may further decrease photosynthesis and carbon fixation per unit leaf area ding et al 2020 as for sm insufficient heat supply resulted from straw mulching on the soil surface was usually reported to limit the maize emergence and early development which was not conductive to dry matter accumulation and ultimately grain yield andrade et al 2010 zheng et al 2021c nevertheless straw mulching could delay the leaf senescence intercept more sunlight and then prolong photosynthetic physiological processes which may support higher photosynthesis capacity during grain filling and obtain higher crop yields yin et al 2016 the accumulated soil temperature and the proportion of intercepted radiation by crop canopy resulting from rp and sm during the crop growing seasons have not been adequately evaluated on the other hand sm and rp can bring about a series of changes in soil nitrogen n and phosphorous p which are important for crop production mo et al 2017 the combination of water light and heat may simultaneously stimulate physiological processes that transport nutrients from soil to vegetative organs and eventually to grains liu et al 2015 which finally leads to higher nutrients use efficiency under sm and rp it can be seen that no mulching straw mulching and ridge furrow plastic film mulching result in differences in photosynthetic capacity and resource utilization efficiency because soil hydrothermal and other factors under these techniques vary greatly most previous studies have concentrated on their effects on soil water and temperature dynamics however there is still a lack of the mechanism on radiation thermal water and nutrients absorption and utilization resulting from plastic film and straw mulching practices to enhance crop productivity and yield stability understanding the capture and utilization of thermal light water and nutrients resources by maize plants under soil mulching conditions is important for clarifying crops physiological progression establishing plants water nutrient management modeling and optimizing agricultural practices the aims of the present study were thus to i quantify the amounts of soil effective accumulated temperature intercepted photosynthetically active radiation water consumption and nutrients absorption under non mulching straw mulching and ridge furrow plastic film mulching ii explore the efficiency of these three mulching practices to capture resources for producing grain yield and iii assess the among year yield stability under these three various mulching practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description a five season field experiment was conducted from

lai and the day after sowing das lai a dasb exp 0 077 das where a and b were fitted parameters by spss ding et al 2013 the radiation use efficiency rue g mj 1 for grain yield was determined as rue gy ipar 2 4 4 nutrient uptake efficiency and nutrient productive efficiency the nutrients use efficiency included nutrient uptake efficiency nupe kg 1 kg 1 and nutrient productive efficiency npe kg 1 kg 1 montemurro et al 2006 zhang et al 2019b nupe was calculated as n uptake by maize plant divided by n p application rate npe was the ratio of gy and n p application rate 2 5 statistical analyses the spss software spss inc chicago usa was used for the analysis of variance anova to assess the effect of the three mulching treatments on the measured parameters at the probability level of 0 05 the least significant difference test lsd was used to compare the means among treatments the sigmaplot 10 0 software was used to draw all figures 3 results 3 1 soil hydrothermal conditions soil temperature was largely affected by the three mulching practices and the difference was great at the initial stage of growth and gradually decreased over time fig s1 throughout the growing seasons topsoil temperature under rp was averagely increased by 0 82 in 2015 p 0 05 0 61 in 2016 p 0 05 0 72 in 2017 p 0 05 1 69 in 2018 p 0 05 and 1 31 in 2019 p 0 05 compare to that under nm respectively table 2 in contrast sm significantly decreased topsoil temperature by 1 30 and 0 89 in 2015 and 2017 in comparison to nm respectively however soil temperature under sm was insignificantly different from that under nm in 2016 2018 and 2019 the swc under sm and rp in the 0 60 cm soil layer were generally higher than that under nm before the mid season while the trends of swc were irregular after that fig s1 compared to nm rp improved the average soil water storage in the 60 cm soil by 4 5 mm significant in 2016 and sm increased it by 3 5 mm throughout the five growing seasons significant in 2017 and 2019 table 2 3 2 maize development stages generally the specific vegetative vs and reproductive stage rs of summer maize was accelerated by rp throughout the five seasons fig 2 compared with nm rp resulted in 0 1 day earlier seedling emergence and advanced the silking stage by 2 4 days from sowing to physiological maturity the whole growth period under rp was 2 7 days shorter than that under nm 2 3 days shorter during vs and 1 4 days shorter during rs in the sm plots straw on the soil surface caused slow seedling emergence about 1 day later but similar or earlier jointing and silking growth due to the better growth promoting water conditions however the duration of reproductive growth from silking to physiological maturity under sm treatment was slightly longer 1 3 days longer in comparison with the nm treatment 3 3 leaf area index and dry matter accumulation the lai increased dramatically from seedling to silking stage reached the peak at the early silking and then decreased because of leaf senescence fig 3 there was no significant difference in lai at the seedling emergence among the treatments but the difference gradually increased with the maize growth and development soil mulching positively affected lai in 2015 and 2017 but slightly in 2016 2018 and 2019 due to the adequate precipitation at the vegetative stage table 1 over all the five growing seasons the maximum lai under rp and sm were increased by 24 2 and 16 2 in 2015 8 3 and 4 5 in 2016 16 7 and 10 0 in 2017 7 2 and 1 9 in 2018 and 5 9 and 11 0 in 2019 respectively the extreme drought at reproductive stage in 2016 resulted in a significant decline of lai at the late growth stages and the heavy waterlogging from sowing to seedling in 2019 resulted in lower extension of lai at vegetative stage than the other years the increases in dry matter under rp and sm gradually increased with maize growth and development especially at the reproductive stage fig 4 over all the five growing seasons the dry matter accumulation at maturity under rp and sm were increased by 11 7 and 4 9 in 2015 49 1 and 17 3 in 2016 21 8 and 9 8 in 2017 9 4 and 9 8 in 2018 and 9 4 and 8 0 in 2019 compared with that under nm respectively among these five seasons the increases in dry matter under rp and sm relative to nm were greater in 2016 but lower in 2018 and 2019 compared with the other years this was presumably because the less precipitation at reproductive stage in 2016 stimulated soil water conservation capacity by soil mulching while the effects of soil mulching on maintaining soil water was minimized in the wet years 2018 and 2019 3 4 photosynthetic characteristics and leaf chlorophyll content compared with nm soil mulching significantly increased the photosynthetic pn and transpiration rates tr of summer maize fig 5 throughout the five growing seasons rp and sm showed increases in the average pn of 21 8 and 12 6 at jointing 20 8 and 9 4 at tasseling and 25 3 and 16 1 at filling stages compared with nm respectively the five season average transpiration rate stomatal conductance and total chlorophyll content were 22 1 29 5 and 9 3 higher under rp 11 4 11 2 and 7 3 higher under sm compared with those under nm respectively 3 5 grain yield and yield stability grain yield gy under rp was significantly increased by 27 0 in 2015 186 4 in 2016 42 3 in 2017 16 5 in 2018 and 9 5 in 2019 in comparison with that under nm respectively table 3 a significantly lower relative yield stability cv was observed under rp than nm and sm fig 6 therefore rp had a great positive effect on yield stability in all precipitation years indicating that rp effectively maintained the yield without considering the distribution of seasonal precipitation there was no significant difference in grain yield between nm and sm during the 2015 normal year 2016 dry year and 2019 wet year growing seasons p 0 05 however relative to nm sm significantly enhanced grain yield by 26 1 and 12 4 in 2017 and 2018 respectively the relative yield stability cv did not vary greatly between sm and nm indicating that the overall temporal variability in grain yield was similar sm and nm despite of higher yield level under sm fig 6 however the cv of rp 28 1 was significantly smaller than that of sm 45 1 and nm 45 3 indicating its capability of maintaining yield stability rp tended to improve grain yield average ri 1 56 and its positive effect tended to decrease with the increase of precipitation amount during the growing season especially precipitation at reproductive stage fig s2 the grain yield and ri under sm were not significantly different from those under rp when the seasonal precipitation was high 417 mm and 500 mm 3 6 resources use efficiency 3 6 1 soil thermal time dynamics and use efficiency the ttsoil of each treatment increased over time in a logistic form fig s3 there was no consistent tendency of ttsoil from sowing to seedling emergence stage table 4 the decrease in ttsoil under sm relative to nm continued at vegetative stage 46 0 c from seedling emergence to jointing and 20 0 c from jointing to silking respectively the ttsoil under sm at reproductive stage showed a decrease of 22 7 c in 2015 and 2016 in comparison to nm but showed an increase of 24 3 c in 2017 2019 because the inhibition effect of sm on soil temperature may be compensated by adequate precipitation at this stage and the effect may be minimized due to the decomposition of straw on the soil surface the increase of ttsoil under rp relative to nm was not obvious at vegetative stage 5 8 c from seedling emergence to jointing and 10 8 c from jointing to silking respectively but significant at reproductive stage 51 2 c sm and rp greatly promoted the transformation of the thermal resource into grains throughout the five growing seasons sm and rp increased tue by 19 5 p 0 05 and 23 7 p 0 05 in 2015 13 7 p 0 05 and 185 3 p 0 05 in 2016 33 3 p 0 05 and 38 7 p 0 05 in 2017 10 2 p 0 05 and 5 5 p 0 05 in 2018 and 9 7 p 0 05 and 3 0 p 0 05 in 2019 compared with nm respectively table 7 3 6 2 intercepted photosynthetically active radiation and radiation use efficiency compared with nm rp and sm stimulated ipar by 7 8 p 0 05 and 7 7 p 0 05 in 2015 1 3 p 0 05 and 2 2 p 0 05 in 2016 9 9 p 0 05 and 7 7 p 0 05 in 2017 1 9 p 0 05 and 4 4 p 0 05 in 2018 and 1 7 p 0 05 and 4 7 p 0 05 in 2019 respectively table 5 fig s3 the difference of ipar among the three mulching treatments appeared at the jointing silking stage when the difference of lai gradually appeared in all treatments in 2015 2017 seasons fig 3 table 1 however the difference of ipar mainly occurred after silking in the 2018 and 2019 seasons because of the non significant differences of lai at the vegetative stage resulting from adequate precipitation at this stage indicating the sensitive effect of lai on ipar a promoted conversion of radiation resource into grain yield was found in both rp and sm plots than in nm plots and the increase in rue was 17 7 p 0 05 190 1 p 0 05 29 5 p 0 05 14 4 p 0 05 and 7 7 p 0 05 in rp and 1 7 p 0 05 7 8 p 0 05 17 2 p 0 05 7 7 p 0 05 and 2 9 p 0 05 in sm over the five growing seasons respectively table 7 3 6 3 evapotranspiration and water productivity the et before jointing was always lower under sm and rp compared with that under nm but there was little difference in et among the three treatments after jointing and et under sm and rp then tended to be higher than that under nm after silking table 6 fig s3 over the five growing seasons rp significantly decreased et before jointing by 52 9 from sowing to seedling and 21 3 from seedling to jointing but increased it during later growth stages by 1 1 from jointing to silking and 11 2 from silking to maturity in addition the 5 year average et under sm was decreased by 6 7 and 13 0 during sowing seedling and seedling jointing while increased by 4 8 and 7 2 during jointing silking and silking maturity respectively generally growing season et of summer maize varied from 192 to 375 mm which was lower in 2016 and higher in 2018 and 2019 when more precipitation occurred no significant difference was observed but the wp among the three mulching treatments differed greatly table 7 the rp and sm treatments retained a relatively higher wp which was increased by 22 4 p 0 05 and 1 6 p 0 05 in 2015 by 203 2 p 0 05 and 11 7 p 0 05 in 2016 by 32 6 p 0 05 and 15 9 p 0 05 in 2017 by 16 7 p 0 05 and 9 9 p 0 05 in 2018 and by 10 9 p 0 05 and 9 8 p 0 05 in 2019 compared to that under nm respectively 3 6 4 nutrient n and p uptake and use efficiency and nutrient productive efficiency rp and sm greatly increased maize plant n and p uptakes relative to nm fig s3 meanwhile n and p use efficiency were greatly increased in the rp and sm plots over the nm indicating an improved translocation of nutrients from plant organs to maize grains table 7 the increases in nupe by maize plants under rp and sm were 9 4 p 0 05 and 4 7 p 0 05 in 2015 6 7 p 0 05 and 6 7 p 0 05 in 2016 12 4 p 0 05 and 5 8 p 0 05 in 2017 19 7 p 0 05 and 19 6 p 0 05 in 2018 and 7 1 p 0 05 and 7 5 p 0 05 in 2019 respectively the increases in npe were 26 9 p 0 05 186 8 p 0 05 42 4 p 0 05 16 5 p 0 05 and 9 5 p 0 05 under rp and 9 4 p 0 05 10 5 p 0 05 26 4 p 0 05 12 4 p 0 05 and 7 7 p 0 05 under sm during the five seasons respectively compared with nm the rp treatments increased pupe by 10 2 p 0 05 4 1 p 0 05 25 1 p 0 05 42 0 p 0 05 and 5 3 p 0 05 in 2015 2019 and increased ppe by 27 0 p 0 05 186 4 p 0 05 42 3 p 0 05 16 5 p 0 05 and 9 5 p 0 05 respectively sm increased pupe by 5 1 p 0 05 4 1 p 0 05 13 8 p 0 05 54 2 p 0 05 and 10 0 p 0 05 and increased ppe by 9 5 p 0 05 10 1 p 0 05 26 1 p 0 05 12 4 p 0 05 and 7 7 p 0 05 in the five seasons respectively it can be seen that in normal and dry years the response of rp to soil nutrients was better than that of sm but no significant difference existed between rp and sm in wet years 3 7 cost benefit analysis the total input included mulching material input mmi seed and fertilizer input sfi and labor input lmi table 8 because the straw was usually burned or returned to the soil in the region lu et al 2021a b the profit of crop stalks was ignored and only the income from grains was calculated in this study the total output to was basically grain yield produced and sold to grain yield maize yield price though drying sheering and mulching of straw required by sm plots and form of ridges and furrows required by rp plots increased the labor input the total output under sm and rp was greater than that under nm because of the improved grain yield table 3 totally net profit of sm was slightly lower than that of nm p 0 05 but the net profit np under rp was always highest averagely 1270 5 usd ha 1 in the five growing seasons the net profit was comparatively lower in years with relatively less precipitation especially in 2016 suffering with extreme drought thereby resulting in the negative income the result of total output total input to ti was similar to the net profit with relatively greater values under rp 4 discussion 4 1 soil temperature and water it is generally believed that transparent plastic film in rp can allow the solar radiation to reach the soil surface but prevent long wave solar radiation from topsoil to the open air which impede the escape of soil heat and improved the soil thermal conditions liu et al 2010 straw forms a physical barrier between the soil and atmosphere on the surface which could block radiation from the sun into the soil and then reduce the soil temperature li et al 2021 these researchers also pointed out that the warming effect by plastic film and cooling effect by straw mulching were greater at the early growth stages which was also found by our study fig s1 soil temperature under sm was sometimes similar or higher than that under nm in our study especially in wet years 2018 and 2019 fig s1 this can be explained by a point of view that soil heat beneath straw mulching was insulated and retained in the soil in overcast and cloudy weathers fang et al 2021 which could cause the straw mulched soil lose heat more slowly than the non mulched soil soil temperature was related to the soil effective accumulated temperature of plants 10 per day for maize development which determines the plant phenology lynn et al 2015 higher accumulated temperatures can speed up seed germination at the beginning of reproductive period subrahmaniyan et al 2018 compared to nm soil temperature at 10 cm depth was usually higher under rp and lower under sm fig s1 which caused shortening of growth duration by 2 7 days under rp and the prolonging of growth duration by 1 3 days with sm in comparison with nm although the improved soil water condition under sm was favorable for the physiological processes of maize the decreased soil temperature under sm caused negative influence on maize plant growth resulting in the extension of growth duration the ttsoil at each stage presented in table 4 was not always followed the order of rp nm sm because the soil effective accumulated temperature was also affected by the growing days of maize soil mulching can preserve soil water by directly inhibiting soil evaporation and enhancing water infiltration liao et al 2021 zheng et al 2021d in this study rp and sm improved soil water condition at the early growth stage for example swc under rp and sm at seedling and jointing stages were generally higher than that under nm as shown in fig s1 however the beneficial effect may be offset or even decreased over time especially after silking fig s1 these may cause no clear trend in mean soil water storage in the 0 60 cm soil layer over the growing season soil water was lost mainly from soil evaporation and plant transpiration so evapotranspiration et determined the soil water storage there were some possible reasons to explain the relatively better water conditions under rp and sm than nm before mid season but no irregular trend of swc after silking firstly when plants were small soil water was lost mainly through soil evaporation tugwell wootton et al 2020 our previous studies also affirmed the dominant role of soil evaporation in et when plants were small zheng et al 2021a resulting in higher et under nm than rp and sm and thus the lower swc under rp and sm relative to nm before maize reproductive stage table 6 fig s1 secondly maize grew vigorously and water loss gradually shifted from soil evaporation to plant transpiration at middle and later stages zheng et al 2021b mulched maize experienced faster growth and greater transpiration which can lead to higher transpiration under rp and sm after silking and thus the uncertain trend of swc among the three treatments table 6 fig s1 as reported by jia et al 2018b although some studies reported that the offset in swc improvement was more obvious when precipitation was rare li et al 2017a b zhang et al 2019b swc under rp and sm were still mildly higher than that under nm from silking to maturity in the dry year of 2016 this was likely because the persistent and severe soil drought in 2016 caused leaf drying and low plant transpiration after silking leading to the higher ratio of evaporation to et compared with that in the other years and then the inhibition effect of soil mulching on water vapor still worked greatly at this stage zheng et al 2021a however there was no consistent pattern of swc after silking in different years which still need further investigation 4 2 photosynthetic traits photosynthetic capacity is highly linked with soil water and is very important for biomass and yield wang et al 2015a ren et al 2016 better water availability at earlier growth stage under rp and sm than nm positively affected crop photosynthesis with increases in pn tr and stomatal conductance the maize plants in rp and sm plots generally suffered water stress after silking due to greater transpiration which may decrease leaf photosynthetic rate karimi et al 2015 however the plants can still maintain higher level of photosynthetic capacity fig 5 because water in the deeper soil can move to the root zone by capillarity to sustain the leaf function bu et al 2013 zhang et al 2022 also found higher photosynthetic rate under ridge furrow systems compared to non mulching despite of lower soil water content excessive water deficit will inhibit photosynthetic metabolism and decrease the photosynthetic potential thereby slowing down the photosynthetic rate shao et al 2021 this effect can explain why pn tr and stomatal conductance greatly decreased during reproductive growth period of 2016 when they suffered extremely hydraulic drought stress besides the enhanced photosynthesis under rp and sm may be the result of the improvement of light environment since mulching increased lai and could intercept more par in maize canopy yi et al 2010 zhang et al 2019a b the average pn and stomatal conductance throughout the maize season in the wet 2018 and 2019 seasons was about 5 and 15 lower than that in the normal 2015 and 2017 seasons respectively the reason for the higher photosynthesis parameters in the normal years than wet years may be that the moderate drying of vigorous growth could increase the tissue biochemical activity and then counteract the drought response induced by aba under water stress chai et al 2016 yang et al 2017a b 4 3 maize growth and nutrients uptake the improved soil temperature throughout seasons and better water availability at the earlier stage under rp greatly improved lai and dry matter accumulation relative to nm as for rp seeds were sown at the joint line of ridge and bare furrow water droplets attached to the inner side of the film flow down to maize base provide much water for seed germination in addition the warming effect of plastic film greatly accelerated the emergence seedling and plant growth as for sm its cooling effect on soil temperature prolonged the emergence time but was not harmful to the growth and ultimately yield due to sufficient effective accumulated temperature during entire season from mid june to late september for summer maize fig s3 also its inhibition effect on evaporation and promotion effect on transpiration is critical to vegetative growth and maize yield fang et al 2021 zheng et al 2021a grain yield were ranked as 2018 7721 8997 kg ha 1 2019 7688 8418 kg ha 1 2017 6075 8645 kg ha 1 2015 5936 7537 kg ha 1 2016 1367 3915 kg ha 1 which basically followed the trend of seasonal precipitation amount zheng et al 2021c d the positive effect of rp and sm on grain yield was diminished with the increase of precipitation amount fig s2 which was also supported by yu et al 2018 and zhang et al 2018 in this study rp produced significantly higher grain yield than nm and sm p 0 05 however rp and sm gave similar grain yield in the last two years p 0 05 the reason may be that the effect of soil water on grain yield was superior to that of soil temperature and the combined effect of improved soil water and temperature conditions on grain yield was better than that of sm in the normal and dry years however more water was retained in the soil profile resulting from higher precipitation amount during 2018 and 2019 growing seasons the effect of soil temperature on grain yield was thus offset by the effect of soil water leading to no significant difference in grain yield between rp and sm straw mulching and ridge furrow plastic film mulching greatly improved aboveground nutrients n and p accumulation during the whole growing season fig s3 similar results were also obtained by liu et al 2015 and nagegowda et al 2020 increased photosynthesis and plant growth because of better hydrothermal conditions in the rp and sm plots can promote root growth and thus the absorption area then in turn increase the nutrients uptake liu et al 2015 jia et al 2018a similar to maize yield drought and high temperature at reproductive stage limited plant n p uptake in 2016 and adequate precipitation resulted in no significant difference between sm and rp in nutrients uptake in 2018 and 2019 in total yield stability which is of agronomic importance as well was highest under rp fig 6 considering the negative impact of plastic film residues and the positive impacts of plant straw in increasing soil organic carbon sm can be regarded as an alternative in wet years while maintaining comparable maize productivity to that of rp steinmetz et al 2016 xu et al 2019 because the soil mulching practices are usually applied after sowing the application of these practices can be selected in advance by long range meteorological forecasting davey and brookshaw 2011 4 4 resources soil thermal time radiation water and nutrient use efficiency in arid and semi arid areas resource use is a basis for crop growth and its efficiency is important to researchers trying to achieve sustainable agricultural production liu et al 2010 in general there was sufficient heat supply under rp resulting from the heating effect of plastic film while soil thermal condition in sm treatment was relatively poor but the yield was not decreased by straw mulching and the reason may be that the sensitivity of dry matter assimilation to cumulative temperatures during reproductive growth is lower than that during vegetative growth stage zhang et al 2019a furthermore the reproductive growth stage was extended in sm compared to the control which could supply the sufficient thermal to stimulate the formation of crop grains as for the radiation increased lai enhanced the ability to capture light radiation under soil mulching more light was reflected from the plastic film to the maize canopy wang et al 2015a b c promoting the light use for rp treatment and carbon assimilation for grain yield also sm delayed maize growth period when maize canopy captured more solar radiation than nm and leading to more dry matter accumulation mulching practices significantly increased wp by greatly converting ineffective soil evaporation to efficient plant transpiration in the rp sm treatment during the five years although similar et were found among these practices table 6 this finding is consistent with the report by lin et al 2016 who found that maize with plastic film and straw mulching displayed a higher wp than non mulched plants but no significant difference in et was observed rp and sm significantly increased nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiency in this study which was mainly because soil mulching promoted dry matter accumulation by enhancing physiological characteristics and root growth in conclusion resources use efficiency is critical in the migration of maize assimilates from the source to reservoir and determination of grain yield rp and sm are comprehensive resource management practices for rainfed maize compared with nm especially rp with much higher grain yield and yield stability in any precipitation year due to the higher resources use efficiency 5 conclusions the capture and utilization of thermal light water and nutrients resources was sensitive to variations in soil water and thermal conditions resulting from soil mulching practices in the maize fields in semi humid drought prone regions the thermal effect of ridge furrow plastic film mulching accelerated the growth and development of maize captured more par for photosynthesis from sowing to maturity and then increased dry matter accumulation and grain yield though the shorten period by rp reduced the total light interception its efficiency of converting radiation to grains was higher in comparison to nm and sm rp is likely to be generally more preferable given its higher stability in maintaining yield and profitability especially in drought years however no significant difference in maize s capacity of absorbing water and nutrients and the crop productivity between sm and rp with sufficient precipitation supply therefore straw mulching can be recommended as an alternative agricultural practice in wet precipitation years and may minimize the adverse effects of plastic film residue in the soil in rainfed regions future work would be needed to address the environmental issues such as white pollution

9451,this paper investigates the impact of erratic rainfall and related water problems on agricultural productivity the paper also aims to shed light on the conceptual importance of understanding the incidence and impacts of rainfall shocks for choosing feasible agricultural water risk management strategies both at household and policy levels to achieve these goals we develop a conceptual framework use national representative data from zambia s crop estimates survey for 2017 2018 farming season employ fixed effects regression approach and find that dry spells excessive floods incidence of water logging are all detrimental to crop productivity the crop based equations also reveal the differential impacts of the rainfall shocks on different crops since the effect of water factors including dry spells floods and water logging on agricultural productivity is dependent on the crop types it is important for the zambian government as well as other countries to take this into account when planning and implementing strategies for agricultural water risk management keywords erratic rainfall agricultural productivity zambia water management 1 introduction agriculture plays a key role in the zambia s economy and its share in total gdp is currently around 7 it is the primary source of livelihoods for many people in the country in 2012 the sector which comprises agriculture forestry and fishing employed more than 50 of the population although the size of the employed population came down to about 26 in 2017 after aligning the definition of the labor force to the 19th international conference of labor statisticians definitions of 2013 of the 26 nearly 60 of the employed people in agriculture are in rural areas central statistics office 2019 despite the reduction in the share of employed population agriculture still remains the highest employer this is not surprising because the proportion of people dependent on agriculture is even more and stands at more than 85 for the entire sub saharan region the world bank 2015 as more than 50 of people that are dependent on agriculture live in rural areas and are very poor it becomes imperative to improve agricultural incomes and or agricultural productivity in order to significantly improve the livelihoods of many people in zambia and other countries in similar situations in africa binswanger and townsend 2000 evidence based policy planning and implementation aimed at understanding drivers of agricultural performance can improve productivity and lead to livelihoods positive change fan 2009 the comprehensive african agriculture development program caadp the malabo declaration and indeed the agenda 2064 of the african union to which zambia is a party all seek to ensure african economic development as a means for securing better livelihoods for the poorest many in africa the caadp and malabo declarations specifically focus on agricultural transformation for shared prosperity the key commitments by african heads of state in those declarations include the ending of hunger eradicating poverty and ensuring that agriculture contributes half of the poverty reduction that africa may achieve by 2025 the role of agricultural research investments in agriculture water management and strengthening resilience are also touted as important in achieving these declarations perhaps because previous research has also shown that improving agricultural productivity sustainability as well as profitability is considered a plausible and more practical pathway to poverty reduction for many of the rural households in africa diao et al 2010 collier and dercon 2014 nevertheless agricultural productivity in general in africa is low although there are some positive changes loayza and raddatz 2010 for instance zambia s cereal yields are low and stand at just around the african union target of 2 tons per hectare although there are spatial variations compared to 10 tons per hectare in other countries usa canada chile outside africa the drivers of the widely observed poor agricultural performance in africa are several and related to the stability and accessibility of the main factors of production among other things improving agricultural productivity can reduce poverty through several pathways such as through increasing real incomes employment generation rural non farm multiplier effects and food price effects benin et al 2016 fan 2009 so the impacts are both direct and indirect for example agricultural productivity can reduce poverty directly by raising farm incomes and indirectly by stimulating demand for inputs and outputs leading to mushrooming of businesses upstream and downstream gollin et al 2014 however rainfall variability dry spells rainfall shocks and other undesired water related factors lead to high costs for smallholder farmers because poor water access can limit future technology uptakes or poor farmers may invest more in other inputs that may not be productivity enhancing amare and shiferaw 2017 in any case erratic rainfall would have a negative effect on agricultural productivity through any one or all of the pathways in subject especially in a predominantly rain fed agricultural system as zambia where the proportion of land irrigated to total arable land stands at under 7 chilonda et al 2013 this study aims to generate empirical evidence on the incidence and impacts of rainfall shocks on agricultural productivity in zambia to guide agricultural water risk management strategies specifically the paper analyses the effects of dry spells erratic rainfall on agricultural productivity in order to understand the role of investments in water management on food production in zambia it also seeks to highlight the differential productivity impacts of erratic rainfall in that 2017 2018 agricultural year depending on the crop in focus to address these objectives fixed effects panel regression models are applied using nationally representative household survey data at farm level and 2017 2018 crop estimates for zambia the study specifically focused on six key agricultural value chains namely maize groundnut sweet potato sunflower soybean and mixed beans all of which are of importance for rural livelihoods the contribution of this paper stems from two stylized facts first despite several studies that have investigated the differential impacts of rainfalls irrigations and rainfall shocks among agricultural sectors they fail to show the practical importance of the empirical tests and hence unable to convince and guide policy actions in this paper a conceptual framework is developed that shows the practical links between the heterogeneous impacts of rainfall shocks and strategic choice of water risk management options thus the empirical tests and findings are made more consistent and insightful as a basis for policy formulation and actions second by using a large national dataset that is representative this paper avoids sample bias problems furthermore the use of dry spells information minimizes endogeneity issues because dry spells are vis major and hence outside the choice of the individual farmer therefore this paper fills knowledge gaps that exist in africa s agricultural productivity literature on the impact of erratic rainfall and the differential heterogeneous impacts they have on productivity depending on crop type and the district levels geographical political administrative regions in which the crops are grown and its implication on water management the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 1 1 and section 1 2 present highlights on the agricultural water management in zambia and a conceptual framework respectively section 2 presents the study methods while the empirical results and a discussion thereof are presented in section 4 and section 5 before a conclusion is presented in the final section highlighting key findings and policy implications 1 1 agricultural water management in zambia in zambia 67 of farmers are smallholders cultivating less than two hectares of land iapri indaba agricultural policy researchinstitute 2016 erratic rainfall is an additional burden to challenges such as fragile soils and poor access to agricultural inputs markets and improved agricultural practices rains in some southern african countries incuding zambia malawi and central southerntanzania are largely unimodal starting in october and ending in april but exhibit high spatial temporal variability muthoni et al 2019 variability in rainfall is mainly determined by north south movement of the intertropical convergence zone itcz diem et al 2014 and changes in sea surface temperatures especially in the tropical pacific maidment et al 2015 zambia experiences a spate of erratic rainfall in some parts of the country from time and again although generally its annual rainfall reveals an increasing trajectory there are spatial variation in rainfall reception over time and recently the northern province has seen a significant decrease in annual rainfall of about 0 1 to 4 mm year 1 muthoni et al 2019 on the other hand in recent years other parts of zambia including almost the entire western southern central lusaka and copperbelt provinces and extended to limited sections of all the other provinces have seen an increase in annual rainfall of around 0 16 mm year 1 muthoni et al 2019 in the 2017 2018 period for which the data apply zambia s annual rainfall stood at 893 mm per annum compared to the normal expected rainfall amounts of 946 5 mm per annum if the water resources that zambia has were developed fully for irrigation and drainage the effects of erratic rainfall would perhaps be modest because irrigated agriculture would compensate for lost output from rain fed agriculture at the very least however while there are many agricultural water management initiatives in some of the districts of zambia many parts of zambia have underdeveloped water resources ngoma et al 2019 ngoma et al 2019 show that there are some irrigation efforts in zambia but such efforts have not yet led to a significant share of irrigation of arable land and more effort is needed thus the impact of any small dry spell in zambia is likely to be felt heavily by farmers in the affected areas especially given that internal trade of commodities is not as frictionless as may be desirable water management is important for productivity as it is shown in many studies that crop yields are higher in irrigated areas than in rain fed areas because of the erratic nature of rainfall rosegrant and perez 1997 lipton et al 2003 1 2 conceptual framework this section provides the conceptual foundation of the link between agricultural water risk management and the nature and extent of the risks the aim is to develop empirically testable hypotheses that can guide and show the practical use of the empirical analyses and findings in agricultural water risk management it is assumed that there exists three broadly classified agricultural water risk management strategies firstly there is the preventive agricultural water management strategy which includes constructing irrigation structures water drainage flood control and other similar strategies secondly there are crop production or food security strategies such as crop diversification or selection specialization thirdly there are coping strategies such as the use of agricultural insurance either in the form of crop index insurance or weather index insurance however the choice of these agricultural water risk management strategies should depend on two factors these factors measure the size and consequences of the risks occurring at a given location the first one isthe incidence pattern of the risks shocks in affecting households at given space and time this measures the correlation of the risks incidence at province level and is measured by the distribution of the rainfall shocks in affecting households in a province at a time this relates to whether the risks are jointly and equally affecting households at any given space and time the second one the differential idiosyncratic impacts of the shocks on agricultural sub sectors commodities and is measured by the correlation of the risks impacts across crops this relates to whether the risk is idiosyncratic or covariate in affecting different crops these two indicators show the nature and extent of agricultural risks caused by rainfall shocks using these indicators one can identify the type of agricultural water risk management strategy that would be feasible at province level fig 1 describes how the correlations of the incidences and impacts of rainfall shocks affect the choice of agricultural water risk management strategies the horizontal line measures the correlation of the risks incidence the correlations become negative if only one of the risks occur at a given time and space that means households in a given village are being affected by one rainfall shock at a given time the correlation becomes positive if households are hit by more than one shocks at a time the vertical line represents the correlation of the productivity impacts of the risks across crops the correlation of the impacts is considered as positive if the impacts of the shocks are uniform across crops and shocks it is considered as negative if the impacts of the shocks are heterogeneous across crops depending on the direction of correlations of the two line we get four panels or quarters which define the priority agricultural water management strategy the north east ne panel of fig 1 connects the positive correlations of both the incidence and impacts of the shocks this means that more than one shock affect households at a time and the shocks affect all the crops uniformly this is a widespread risk for the household to manage either through crop diversification or agricultural insurance possibly the insurance premium will be excessively very large thus the most feasible option is to invest in water management practices such irrigation drainage and flood controlling structures both by the household and the public support system the south east se panel connects the positive correlation of incidence and the negative correlation of the impacts of the shocks even if the shocks affect households simultaneously at a time their impact on crops are heterogeneous hence households can simply manage the risk through crop diversification the south west sw panel connects the negative effects of the shocks both on households and crops in this panel households are affected by only one shock at a time and that shock affects crops heterogeneously this is the lowest risk of all cases thus a crop index insurance could be sufficient to manage the rainfall risks the north west nw panel connects the uniform positive impacts of the chocks on crops and the negative correlation of the incidence of the shocks at given location province in our case the shocks affect the households alternatively but that shock affects the crops uniformly in this case the strategy depends on the number of households being affected by the shock at a time if only few households are affected by the dominant shock in a given location which is likely for the case of flood or waterlogging weather index insurance will be a feasible option if most households are affected by the shock which is likely for dry spell insurance would be more costly than investment on agricultural water management practices thus the most feasible strategy could be investment in agricultural water managing practices therefore agricultural water risk management strategy at a given location must depend on the empirical answers to the following research questions 1 how correlated are the incidence of the shocks at household and regional level 2 how heterogeneous are the impacts of the shocks across crops the subsequent sections are designed to provide empirical evidences to address these questions and draw strategic options that best fit the zambian agricultural water risk management 2 materials and methods 2 1 the data the data used in this study are from the central statistical office of zambia currently known as zambia statistical agency from a crop forecast survey cfs 2017 2018 for small and medium scale holdings collected jointly by the ministry of agriculture and central statistical office republic of zambia cfss each year ask a randomly selected set of respondent farmers to provide information about their area production and yield outcomes this data set is rich and contains information on the household social economic characteristics demographical information plot level data and production estimates for different crops as well as many other pieces of useful information the cfs collects data from a randomly selected set of farmers the nationally representative sample covered 13 512 farming households during the 2017 2018 agricultural season farming 30 133 plots of land the dataset is restricted to farm households for which data on dry spells flooding and water logging are available this results in total applicable households of 8000 operating about 19 786 plots of land the household level information includes number of people in the household distance from the household to markets access to extension services gender of the household head age of the household head and education of the household head among others the plot information includes number of plots crops grown soil quality slope of the farm farm size e g area planted and area to be harvested input use yield and expected production and others 2 2 description of variables while productivity may be measured as total factor productivity or by any of the partial factor productivity measures for instance land or labor productivity our chosen approach is to measure it by land productivity an increase in land productivity is important in the presence of diminishing land sizes owing to burgeoning population pressure on land food security for the billions of people on the planet will be met more certainly with increases in land productivity producing more on each field land productivity is measured by the amount of output per unit of land employed for a given crop where all crops are bundled together in the analysis output is measured in monetary value but where an individual crop productivity is concerned output is measured in quantity value the key variables of interest that may drive agricultural productivity include dummy variables representing whether the household reported the incidence of dry spell erratic rainfall incidence of floods heavy rainfall and incidence of water logging these variables are very important for productivity waongo et al 2015 this is not only because water is essential for all agricultural production in africa especially where irrigation is absent but also because any finding that these variables are indeed significant in the productivity models indicates that farmers are unable to replace lost productivity through alternative water management for example irrigation and drainage where irrigation is a significant component of a household s farming erratic rainfall effects would easily be offset by positive effects of irrigation flooding as well as water logging might be water management problems but they are also accidental problems associated with incidence of torrential rainfalls other control variables are also considered in the analysis these include the slope of the plot farmed the tillage system employed farm size fertilizer use which is a proxy for farm technology whether the farm is in urban or rural centers whether the household received extension services farmer experience soil quality as well as weeding practices at the plot level amare et al 2018 locational dummies by wards which may proxy the privileges that farmers may get by the fact of being located within certain political administrative units are also included a ward in zambia is managed by a ward councilor and it is often the case that where a ward has a powerful councilor many programs by government may flow into the community to the benefit of farmers accounting for such political boundaries at a localized scale confers the possibility of significantly controlling for those other factors the signs of the wards can be either negative or positive depending on the nature of that ward other control variables include the distance to the market which is a variable that can capture the transaction cost of market access by a farm household the further households are expected to be less efficient because they may not access farm inputs and other pieces of information which may be useful for farming amare et al 2018 it is expected that the effect of distances to the markets from a household may be negative in direction the descriptive statistics for the major variables are presented in table 1 table 1 shows that about 4 of the farm parcels had reported water logging problems while 59 reported experiencing dry spells and 2 reported flooding the rest did not report any of these problems as key problems that experienced that year soils are generally not reported as bad while many of the famers did not weed their fields and a few received bad farming advice the key message from this table is that agricultural water issues are important among the sampled households and thus this sample can convey important information on effects of water related problems on agriculture production in table 2 it can be seen that there are seeming productivity differences between the crops and across the water problems implying that it is important to analyze individual crop separately because different water problems affect the crops differently similarly table 3 shows that the water problems affect productivity in the different provinces differently this implies that controlling for provinces or subunits such as wards within the provinces is useful for purposes of obtaining inferential statistics within a multivariate framework at the same time table 3 shows that average land productivity varies differently across provinces and across water problems without further analysis one notes that water related problems such as erratic rainfall and water logging are the important causes of reduction in yield for most farmers in zambia in order to clarify our understanding of the relationship between water related problems and productivity it is useful to control for other factors that drive productivity the strategy for achieving this step is outlined in the next section 2 3 empirical estimation approach both descriptive and econometrics analyses are used to empirically test the questions raised in section 1 as explained in the conceptual framework water risk management should depend on the correlations of the incidence of the problems and their differential impacts across crops hence a descriptive approach was used to measure incidental correlation of water problems risks and econometrics approach to measure the differential impacts of the problems on productivity of crops since time series data to estimate the correlations of the shocks overtime were not available the incidental correlations of the risks were approximated by the percentage of households affected by each shock in a province at a time in our datasets households are asked to report the dominant problem that has affected their harvest hence a household has reported only one shock this restricts the possibility of measuring the correlation of the incidences at household level this was rather measured at province level if the shocks have uniform distribution in affecting sample households this was regarded as positive correlation if most households report only one shock then this was regarded as negative correlation mathematically the correlation of incidence were calculated by differencing the maximum incidence from the sum of the two lowest incidences this means if the shocks affect equal number of farmers in a given province each shock will have a probability of 33 33 which means they have equal uniform probability of occurring at time then the correlation of incidence will be positive 33 3 33 3 33 3 33 3 on the contrary if all sample households report only one shock then maximum incidence will be 100 and the other 0 which gives us a correlation of incidences as 100 thus the correlation of incidence ranges from 100 0 to 33 3 this range holds if all sample households report any one of the risks the study employed a cobb douglas production function approach to study the factors and the nature of the effects of water related indicators erratic rainfall flooding heavy rainfall and water logging on productivity jin et al 2012 productivity of plot yji is measured as output in kg per hectare for each crop and estimated using the following specification 1 in y ji α ji β 1 ds i β 2 wl i β 3 fl i β h x ji β f f i v j ε ij in this model y ji is agricultural productivity of a household i at plot j ε ij is the iid idiosyncratic error term and is uncorrelated with any of the explanatory variable β i are coefficients of regressors and especially β 1 β 2 β 3 are coefficients for the water risk variables ds i wl i and fl i for dry spell waterlogging and floods respectively x i are field level characteristics and quantities of inputs farm size soil quality slope methods of tillage at the field level whereas f i are household level variables including the age of the household head but also includes distances to markets the v i are household fixed effects the technology related variables including fertilizer application are expected to be positively related to productivity the water related problems of erratic rainfall flooding and water logging are expected to be detrimental to agricultural productivity the subscript i stands for household this formulation is also in line with several past studies including jin et al 2012 and amare et al 2018 an econometric technique is followed to estimate the effects of erratic rainfall flooding and water logging incidences on agricultural productivity in eq 1 eq 1 was estimated using the fixed effects technique and not ordinary least squares ols because when estimating agricultural productivity equation unobserved characteristics such as information about inputs farmer abilities other variables of soil quality and others are likely to be correlated with productivity and the key variables of interest water indicators and income status such a correlation signals potential endogeneity problem and ols estimators could be biased wooldridge 2002 exploiting the panel data nature of the dataset by using fixed effects estimation may ensure that parameters are not due to household level house invariant unobserved characteristics respectively amare et al 2018 the model in 1 is applied firstly to all top 6 crops maize groundnut sweet potato sunflower soybean and mixed beans combined and then to each crop individually in order to understand the hetergeneous impacts of water variables on productivity depending on crop type 3 results 3 1 incidences of dry spell waterlogging and floods table 4 presents the distribution of the shocks across provinces and their correlations with a province the last two columns present the total probability of the risks and the correlation of the incidences respectively the total probability is measured by the percentage of households affected by any one water risk in a province at a given year it is the sum of the percentages reported under each water problem the last column presents the correlations of the incidences calculated based on the method explained in section 3 3 following our argument presented in the forgoing section this descriptive result indicates 1 the possibility of managing the shocks either through crop or weather index insurances 2 the need for different water risk management strategy for the different provinces however understanding the differential productivity impacts across shocks and crops is needed to identify specific feasible water risk management strategy for each province and the country the next section presents the econometrics result of the estimation on this matter 3 2 differential impacts on productivity table 5 5 reports the estimates of the cobb douglas production function used in equation number 1 where the outcome variable is agricultural productivity measured by natural logarithm of household level aggregate value of production per hectare as in column 2 where value is driven by multiplying the output by each crop s market value per kg this column presents estimates from a model with a specification that includes all major crop value chains in zambia namely maize groundnut sunflower sweet potato soybean and mixed beans the specification also includes household and plot characteristics household fixed effects and water management and access indicators the second third fourth fifth and sixth columns present results of equation number 1 where the outcome variable agricultural productivity is measured by the natural logarithm of each crop s output per ha the columns present results for drivers of productivity for each of the major crops namely maize groundnut sweet potato sunflower soybean and mixed beans in order to expressly capture the differential impacts of water management and access variables on these key value chains 4 discussion the results in table 4 indicate that the level of water risks is different across provinces while as much as 89 of the samples are affected by water risks in lusaka only 17 of the households are affected in north western province the result also indicates that the shocks are negatively correlated in all provinces this means that the shocks occur alternatively or there exist a dominant water problem at a given province at a given time however the magnitude of correlation significantly vary across provinces as much as 70 in southern province where dry spell is the dominant risk affecting most households at a time and as low as 4 in luapula where water risk is less important but all the risks occur closely uniformly at time as expected the dry spells floods heavy rainfall water logging have a general negative effect on agricultural productivity but water logging had a more pronounced detrimental effect on yields of soybean with a highly significant coefficient of 1 8 which corroborates previous studies including maekawa et al 2011 in japan and even in the united states excess water after intense rainfall is the most serious cause of damage to crop production second to drought boyer 1982 waterlogging and ﬂooding depress growth and yield in soybean matsunami et al 2007 overall dry spells are detrimental for agricultural productivity and it has differential effects which vary depending on the type of crop being analyzed the overall reduction in production due to erratic rainfall is around 24 but it is 25 for maize can be as large as 83 for groundnut only about 7 for sweet potatoes the effects appear negative but statistically insignificant for soybean mixed bean and sunflower the negative effects of erratic rainfall is likely due to the direct effect from limited water availability and perhaps owing to the fact that frequent dry spells may discourage farmers from investing other complimentary inputs in production see amare et al 2018 dercon and christiaensen 2011 for a similar argument this already suggest that addressing water management challenges may have positive knock on effects on markets for other factors of production through increased demand further if irrigation was easily available as a tool for supplementing rainfall dry spells would have dampened negative effects on production and productivity because irrigation would compensate for the rain water deficit thus the pronounced negative effect of erratic rainfall on productivity is indirect evidence of low and insufficient irrigation coverage in zambia indeed the 2018 african union biennial reviews report for zambia mentions that zambia s share of land equipped for irrigation although growing in zambia is low and stands at just under 7 that sweet potato appears to suffer a small share of the impact from erratic rainfall while groundnut suffers a larger negative impact may be explained by the fact that generally potatoes are physiologically not water sensitive but drought resistant compared to most other crops daryanto et al 2016 adeleye et al 2011 peña gallardo et al 2019 on the other hand groundnut can be lost easily if dry spells hit them just before or during flowering because pod and kernel development are progressively inhibited by drought stress due to insufficient plant turgor and lack of assimilates reddy et al 2003 where water stress has been reduced by supplemental irrigation for example prabowo et al 1990 reported that pod yield increased in spanish type groundnut 100 day maturity to 2 4 t ha 1 compared with 0 53 t ha 1 under moisture stress implying that water stress can account to almost 80 of yield reduction while erratic and insufficient rainfall is the frequently reported water related problem among farmers in zambia there are often some incidences of flooding and heavy rainfall at some random parts of the year and when they happen they negate groundnut productivity but a surprising finding is that such heavy rainfall may advantage the performance of mixed beans the effect of floods in general is not pronounced in maize sweet potatoes and the other crops but this may be because floods are a rarity after all and when heavy rainfall is received it may be proceeded by periods of dry spells canceling the negative effects of floods in any case the differential impacts of water indicators including erratic rainfall flooding and water logging underscore the importance of crop specific policies for productivity improvement through water management at the same time the overall negative effect of poor water conditions on agricultural productivity provides further evidence that water development for irrigation must be on zambia s top priority policy menu it must be stated that it has not escaped our notice that the time of dry spells and flooding may be important for crop productivity and we are unable to account for this owing to data limitation but this effect may also partly be offset by the fact that our analysis is crop specific and the results still offer significant insights into the effects of erratic rainfall on productivity of these crops in zambia agricultural production and hence productivity takes place within a context of various conditioning factors managerial skill by the farmer for example appears generally non significant statistically for many of the crops although it matters for groundnut production while soil quality have a general negative effect on all crops this was more pronounced in groundnut and soybean perhaps because generally legumes farming is not accompanied by fertilizer application in zambia extension services are important for ground nut productivity but poor services depress productivity fertilizer use is good for productivity of maize the other crops are legumes and generally fertilizers are not applied in their production the most demand for fertilizers in zambian agriculture is in maize production tobacco and sugarcane farming a differentiation of the urbanization levels of where crops are grown shows no systematic differences in productivity between urban centers and rural centers but the tendency is that urban farming is less productive and in groundnut farming this effect is more pronounced the significance of fertilizer use in the maize equation may also signify that land markets are not as perfect because if they were a farmer without access to enough fertilizer would simply rent it out to those with fertilizer such that fertilizer use would not matter when one compares productivity across households that fertilizer use is important is consistent with previous findings including for example de janvry and sadoulet 2009 mendola 2007 although the analysis does not always show a significant effect of slope on productivity the general tendency is that steep slopes perhaps because they do not effectively hold water and nutrients reduce the productivity of a field which is consistent with many other previous findings the type of tillage system compared to zero tillage system appears to show that ploughing and hand hoeing are not as effective in enhancing productivity compared to zero tillage systems that do not disturb the soil too much but in both cases hand hoeing and ploughing are associated with good sweet potato performance not weeding the field is associated with a reduction in productivity overall and for maize the effect is negative for groundnut but it is not statistically significant weeding is important for productivity of maize fields and extension services should target such messages to farmers more vigorously which corroborates the findings in mar et al 2018 who goes on to emphasize the need for a strong bond between farmers and extension officers for enhancement of technology and technique adoption in lower myanmar it is also noted that some of the political administrative regions wards are important for productivity which implies that not accounting for them would lead to a variable omission and would undermine the unbiasedness of the other estimates this also corroborates the findings in mar et al 2018 which showed that pulse production was dependent on locality of the household this study suggests the following first since the impacts are heterogeneous and the risks occur alternatively crop index insurance could be considered as an important strategy to manage the consequences of the risks second an effective water risk management strategy may consider different approaches across provinces in areas where the total water risk incidence is larger such as lusaka a mix of strategies which include crop diversification could be considered admittedly the empirical measurement of the correlation of incidences is constrained by data therefore a further analysis is needed to apply the approach proposed in this paper based on time series and or joint incidence data at household level to verify the empirical findings and propose specific strategies of significant importance as well is the finding that farm size appears to negatively affect agricultural productivity overall and specifically for maize groundnut and sweet potato the relationship is statistically significant this finding is consistent with amare et al 2018 barrett 1996 as well as carletto et al 2013 the implication of this inverse farm size productivity relationship is that there is room for improving farm productivity in zambia through land allocations from large or medium holders to small holders it may also simply underscore the importance of capital and labor markets in deriving productivity theoretically if markets for land capital and labor were efficient perhaps the effect of size on land productivity would be dampened as large farms would have the required capital for operation and indeed where such is absent the land would move from inefficient land owners to efficient farmers through land markets capital markets are also important for zambia s agricultural production and this is why farm households with fertilizer access achieve higher crop productivity zambia s efforts on farm input subsidies is a good effort towards resolving fertilizer and input problems among smallholder farmers however like discussed by morris et al 2007 this should be achieved through market smart fertilizer subsidies which encourage private sector investments promote competition in fertilizer markets empower farmers to choose their own most appropriate method of managing soil fertility that suit their farming practices and should be economically sustainable there is also need to enhance farmer s trainings and awareness creation focusing on effective crop management in order to enhance productivity 5 conclusion as the population of zambia increases and land remains constant agricultural productivity is likely to become more important than ever before in order to bring out many of the zambian farmers out of poverty and provide food security to many of them while the importance of agricultural productivity is known there is no clear cut rule of thumb that may guarantee accelerated agricultural productivity to meet the burgeoning demands for food and incomes as population structures change both in urban and rural areas understanding the factors that limit agricultural productivity may be considered as a conditio sine qua non for agricultural based poverty eradication strategies the descriptive analysis indicates that the number of households affected by the shocks are significantly different in a province one shock seems more dominant than the others at time which is an important indication of the possibility to design not only technological but also financial strategies to manage the risks the econometric results also revealed the differential impacts of erratic rainfall and the other water variables on different crops these results corroborate previous ones by dercon and christiaensen 2011 as well as amare et al 2018 and many others which show that if rainfall is erratic then crop productivity may be negatively affected they also corroborate results from olayide et al 2016 who studied the differential impacts of irrigation and rainfall on agricultural production in nigeria using time series data using generalized method of moments gmm and autoregressive integrated moving average arima and found that irrigation and rainfall had positive effects on nigerian agriculture but that such effects varied from one agricultural sector to another the findings in this study further show that the effect of erratic rainfall flooding and water logging are different and to the extent that locational dummy variables are significant and different there is also evidence of heterogeneous effects of water stress indicators on crop productivity water stress dry spells have a higher effect on groundnut then maize and is least devastating on sweet potatoes since the effect of water factors including dry spells floods and water logging effect on agricultural productivity is dependent on the crop types it is important for the zambian government to take this into account when implementing strategies for agricultural water management maize and groundnut are affected significantly by erratic rainfall but sweet potatoes soybean mixed bean appear not to be equally affected this does not imply that that such crops should not receive particular attention in water management discourse but that where resource constraints are a limiting factor some crops may need more focus than those that are drought resistant further such evidence is useful for planning a diversification strategy in any case understanding such heterogeneous impacts is important even for understanding how an incidence of dry spell or flooding may affect agriculture production and through that line food security the significance of water indicators in the productivity equations is evidence that household production is rain dependent and therefore it is imperative that the zambian government should up the

9451,this paper investigates the impact of erratic rainfall and related water problems on agricultural productivity the paper also aims to shed light on the conceptual importance of understanding the incidence and impacts of rainfall shocks for choosing feasible agricultural water risk management strategies both at household and policy levels to achieve these goals we develop a conceptual framework use national representative data from zambia s crop estimates survey for 2017 2018 farming season employ fixed effects regression approach and find that dry spells excessive floods incidence of water logging are all detrimental to crop productivity the crop based equations also reveal the differential impacts of the rainfall shocks on different crops since the effect of water factors including dry spells floods and water logging on agricultural productivity is dependent on the crop types it is important for the zambian government as well as other countries to take this into account when planning and implementing strategies for agricultural water risk management keywords erratic rainfall agricultural productivity zambia water management 1 introduction agriculture plays a key role in the zambia s economy and its share in total gdp is currently around 7 it is the primary source of livelihoods for many people in the country in 2012 the sector which comprises agriculture forestry and fishing employed more than 50 of the population although the size of the employed population came down to about 26 in 2017 after aligning the definition of the labor force to the 19th international conference of labor statisticians definitions of 2013 of the 26 nearly 60 of the employed people in agriculture are in rural areas central statistics office 2019 despite the reduction in the share of employed population agriculture still remains the highest employer this is not surprising because the proportion of people dependent on agriculture is even more and stands at more than 85 for the entire sub saharan region the world bank 2015 as more than 50 of people that are dependent on agriculture live in rural areas and are very poor it becomes imperative to improve agricultural incomes and or agricultural productivity in order to significantly improve the livelihoods of many people in zambia and other countries in similar situations in africa binswanger and townsend 2000 evidence based policy planning and implementation aimed at understanding drivers of agricultural performance can improve productivity and lead to livelihoods positive change fan 2009 the comprehensive african agriculture development program caadp the malabo declaration and indeed the agenda 2064 of the african union to which zambia is a party all seek to ensure african economic development as a means for securing better livelihoods for the poorest many in africa the caadp and malabo declarations specifically focus on agricultural transformation for shared prosperity the key commitments by african heads of state in those declarations include the ending of hunger eradicating poverty and ensuring that agriculture contributes half of the poverty reduction that africa may achieve by 2025 the role of agricultural research investments in agriculture water management and strengthening resilience are also touted as important in achieving these declarations perhaps because previous research has also shown that improving agricultural productivity sustainability as well as profitability is considered a plausible and more practical pathway to poverty reduction for many of the rural households in africa diao et al 2010 collier and dercon 2014 nevertheless agricultural productivity in general in africa is low although there are some positive changes loayza and raddatz 2010 for instance zambia s cereal yields are low and stand at just around the african union target of 2 tons per hectare although there are spatial variations compared to 10 tons per hectare in other countries usa canada chile outside africa the drivers of the widely observed poor agricultural performance in africa are several and related to the stability and accessibility of the main factors of production among other things improving agricultural productivity can reduce poverty through several pathways such as through increasing real incomes employment generation rural non farm multiplier effects and food price effects benin et al 2016 fan 2009 so the impacts are both direct and indirect for example agricultural productivity can reduce poverty directly by raising farm incomes and indirectly by stimulating demand for inputs and outputs leading to mushrooming of businesses upstream and downstream gollin et al 2014 however rainfall variability dry spells rainfall shocks and other undesired water related factors lead to high costs for smallholder farmers because poor water access can limit future technology uptakes or poor farmers may invest more in other inputs that may not be productivity enhancing amare and shiferaw 2017 in any case erratic rainfall would have a negative effect on agricultural productivity through any one or all of the pathways in subject especially in a predominantly rain fed agricultural system as zambia where the proportion of land irrigated to total arable land stands at under 7 chilonda et al 2013 this study aims to generate empirical evidence on the incidence and impacts of rainfall shocks on agricultural productivity in zambia to guide agricultural water risk management strategies specifically the paper analyses the effects of dry spells erratic rainfall on agricultural productivity in order to understand the role of investments in water management on food production in zambia it also seeks to highlight the differential productivity impacts of erratic rainfall in that 2017 2018 agricultural year depending on the crop in focus to address these objectives fixed effects panel regression models are applied using nationally representative household survey data at farm level and 2017 2018 crop estimates for zambia the study specifically focused on six key agricultural value chains namely maize groundnut sweet potato sunflower soybean and mixed beans all of which are of importance for rural livelihoods the contribution of this paper stems from two stylized facts first despite several studies that have investigated the differential impacts of rainfalls irrigations and rainfall shocks among agricultural sectors they fail to show the practical importance of the empirical tests and hence unable to convince and guide policy actions in this paper a conceptual framework is developed that shows the practical links between the heterogeneous impacts of rainfall shocks and strategic choice of water risk management options thus the empirical tests and findings are made more consistent and insightful as a basis for policy formulation and actions second by using a large national dataset that is representative this paper avoids sample bias problems furthermore the use of dry spells information minimizes endogeneity issues because dry spells are vis major and hence outside the choice of the individual farmer therefore this paper fills knowledge gaps that exist in africa s agricultural productivity literature on the impact of erratic rainfall and the differential heterogeneous impacts they have on productivity depending on crop type and the district levels geographical political administrative regions in which the crops are grown and its implication on water management the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 1 1 and section 1 2 present highlights on the agricultural water management in zambia and a conceptual framework respectively section 2 presents the study methods while the empirical results and a discussion thereof are presented in section 4 and section 5 before a conclusion is presented in the final section highlighting key findings and policy implications 1 1 agricultural water management in zambia in zambia 67 of farmers are smallholders cultivating less than two hectares of land iapri indaba agricultural policy researchinstitute 2016 erratic rainfall is an additional burden to challenges such as fragile soils and poor access to agricultural inputs markets and improved agricultural practices rains in some southern african countries incuding zambia malawi and central southerntanzania are largely unimodal starting in october and ending in april but exhibit high spatial temporal variability muthoni et al 2019 variability in rainfall is mainly determined by north south movement of the intertropical convergence zone itcz diem et al 2014 and changes in sea surface temperatures especially in the tropical pacific maidment et al 2015 zambia experiences a spate of erratic rainfall in some parts of the country from time and again although generally its annual rainfall reveals an increasing trajectory there are spatial variation in rainfall reception over time and recently the northern province has seen a significant decrease in annual rainfall of about 0 1 to 4 mm year 1 muthoni et al 2019 on the other hand in recent years other parts of zambia including almost the entire western southern central lusaka and copperbelt provinces and extended to limited sections of all the other provinces have seen an increase in annual rainfall of around 0 16 mm year 1 muthoni et al 2019 in the 2017 2018 period for which the data apply zambia s annual rainfall stood at 893 mm per annum compared to the normal expected rainfall amounts of 946 5 mm per annum if the water resources that zambia has were developed fully for irrigation and drainage the effects of erratic rainfall would perhaps be modest because irrigated agriculture would compensate for lost output from rain fed agriculture at the very least however while there are many agricultural water management initiatives in some of the districts of zambia many parts of zambia have underdeveloped water resources ngoma et al 2019 ngoma et al 2019 show that there are some irrigation efforts in zambia but such efforts have not yet led to a significant share of irrigation of arable land and more effort is needed thus the impact of any small dry spell in zambia is likely to be felt heavily by farmers in the affected areas especially given that internal trade of commodities is not as frictionless as may be desirable water management is important for productivity as it is shown in many studies that crop yields are higher in irrigated areas than in rain fed areas because of the erratic nature of rainfall rosegrant and perez 1997 lipton et al 2003 1 2 conceptual framework this section provides the conceptual foundation of the link between agricultural water risk management and the nature and extent of the risks the aim is to develop empirically testable hypotheses that can guide and show the practical use of the empirical analyses and findings in agricultural water risk management it is assumed that there exists three broadly classified agricultural water risk management strategies firstly there is the preventive agricultural water management strategy which includes constructing irrigation structures water drainage flood control and other similar strategies secondly there are crop production or food security strategies such as crop diversification or selection specialization thirdly there are coping strategies such as the use of agricultural insurance either in the form of crop index insurance or weather index insurance however the choice of these agricultural water risk management strategies should depend on two factors these factors measure the size and consequences of the risks occurring at a given location the first one isthe incidence pattern of the risks shocks in affecting households at given space and time this measures the correlation of the risks incidence at province level and is measured by the distribution of the rainfall shocks in affecting households in a province at a time this relates to whether the risks are jointly and equally affecting households at any given space and time the second one the differential idiosyncratic impacts of the shocks on agricultural sub sectors commodities and is measured by the correlation of the risks impacts across crops this relates to whether the risk is idiosyncratic or covariate in affecting different crops these two indicators show the nature and extent of agricultural risks caused by rainfall shocks using these indicators one can identify the type of agricultural water risk management strategy that would be feasible at province level fig 1 describes how the correlations of the incidences and impacts of rainfall shocks affect the choice of agricultural water risk management strategies the horizontal line measures the correlation of the risks incidence the correlations become negative if only one of the risks occur at a given time and space that means households in a given village are being affected by one rainfall shock at a given time the correlation becomes positive if households are hit by more than one shocks at a time the vertical line represents the correlation of the productivity impacts of the risks across crops the correlation of the impacts is considered as positive if the impacts of the shocks are uniform across crops and shocks it is considered as negative if the impacts of the shocks are heterogeneous across crops depending on the direction of correlations of the two line we get four panels or quarters which define the priority agricultural water management strategy the north east ne panel of fig 1 connects the positive correlations of both the incidence and impacts of the shocks this means that more than one shock affect households at a time and the shocks affect all the crops uniformly this is a widespread risk for the household to manage either through crop diversification or agricultural insurance possibly the insurance premium will be excessively very large thus the most feasible option is to invest in water management practices such irrigation drainage and flood controlling structures both by the household and the public support system the south east se panel connects the positive correlation of incidence and the negative correlation of the impacts of the shocks even if the shocks affect households simultaneously at a time their impact on crops are heterogeneous hence households can simply manage the risk through crop diversification the south west sw panel connects the negative effects of the shocks both on households and crops in this panel households are affected by only one shock at a time and that shock affects crops heterogeneously this is the lowest risk of all cases thus a crop index insurance could be sufficient to manage the rainfall risks the north west nw panel connects the uniform positive impacts of the chocks on crops and the negative correlation of the incidence of the shocks at given location province in our case the shocks affect the households alternatively but that shock affects the crops uniformly in this case the strategy depends on the number of households being affected by the shock at a time if only few households are affected by the dominant shock in a given location which is likely for the case of flood or waterlogging weather index insurance will be a feasible option if most households are affected by the shock which is likely for dry spell insurance would be more costly than investment on agricultural water management practices thus the most feasible strategy could be investment in agricultural water managing practices therefore agricultural water risk management strategy at a given location must depend on the empirical answers to the following research questions 1 how correlated are the incidence of the shocks at household and regional level 2 how heterogeneous are the impacts of the shocks across crops the subsequent sections are designed to provide empirical evidences to address these questions and draw strategic options that best fit the zambian agricultural water risk management 2 materials and methods 2 1 the data the data used in this study are from the central statistical office of zambia currently known as zambia statistical agency from a crop forecast survey cfs 2017 2018 for small and medium scale holdings collected jointly by the ministry of agriculture and central statistical office republic of zambia cfss each year ask a randomly selected set of respondent farmers to provide information about their area production and yield outcomes this data set is rich and contains information on the household social economic characteristics demographical information plot level data and production estimates for different crops as well as many other pieces of useful information the cfs collects data from a randomly selected set of farmers the nationally representative sample covered 13 512 farming households during the 2017 2018 agricultural season farming 30 133 plots of land the dataset is restricted to farm households for which data on dry spells flooding and water logging are available this results in total applicable households of 8000 operating about 19 786 plots of land the household level information includes number of people in the household distance from the household to markets access to extension services gender of the household head age of the household head and education of the household head among others the plot information includes number of plots crops grown soil quality slope of the farm farm size e g area planted and area to be harvested input use yield and expected production and others 2 2 description of variables while productivity may be measured as total factor productivity or by any of the partial factor productivity measures for instance land or labor productivity our chosen approach is to measure it by land productivity an increase in land productivity is important in the presence of diminishing land sizes owing to burgeoning population pressure on land food security for the billions of people on the planet will be met more certainly with increases in land productivity producing more on each field land productivity is measured by the amount of output per unit of land employed for a given crop where all crops are bundled together in the analysis output is measured in monetary value but where an individual crop productivity is concerned output is measured in quantity value the key variables of interest that may drive agricultural productivity include dummy variables representing whether the household reported the incidence of dry spell erratic rainfall incidence of floods heavy rainfall and incidence of water logging these variables are very important for productivity waongo et al 2015 this is not only because water is essential for all agricultural production in africa especially where irrigation is absent but also because any finding that these variables are indeed significant in the productivity models indicates that farmers are unable to replace lost productivity through alternative water management for example irrigation and drainage where irrigation is a significant component of a household s farming erratic rainfall effects would easily be offset by positive effects of irrigation flooding as well as water logging might be water management problems but they are also accidental problems associated with incidence of torrential rainfalls other control variables are also considered in the analysis these include the slope of the plot farmed the tillage system employed farm size fertilizer use which is a proxy for farm technology whether the farm is in urban or rural centers whether the household received extension services farmer experience soil quality as well as weeding practices at the plot level amare et al 2018 locational dummies by wards which may proxy the privileges that farmers may get by the fact of being located within certain political administrative units are also included a ward in zambia is managed by a ward councilor and it is often the case that where a ward has a powerful councilor many programs by government may flow into the community to the benefit of farmers accounting for such political boundaries at a localized scale confers the possibility of significantly controlling for those other factors the signs of the wards can be either negative or positive depending on the nature of that ward other control variables include the distance to the market which is a variable that can capture the transaction cost of market access by a farm household the further households are expected to be less efficient because they may not access farm inputs and other pieces of information which may be useful for farming amare et al 2018 it is expected that the effect of distances to the markets from a household may be negative in direction the descriptive statistics for the major variables are presented in table 1 table 1 shows that about 4 of the farm parcels had reported water logging problems while 59 reported experiencing dry spells and 2 reported flooding the rest did not report any of these problems as key problems that experienced that year soils are generally not reported as bad while many of the famers did not weed their fields and a few received bad farming advice the key message from this table is that agricultural water issues are important among the sampled households and thus this sample can convey important information on effects of water related problems on agriculture production in table 2 it can be seen that there are seeming productivity differences between the crops and across the water problems implying that it is important to analyze individual crop separately because different water problems affect the crops differently similarly table 3 shows that the water problems affect productivity in the different provinces differently this implies that controlling for provinces or subunits such as wards within the provinces is useful for purposes of obtaining inferential statistics within a multivariate framework at the same time table 3 shows that average land productivity varies differently across provinces and across water problems without further analysis one notes that water related problems such as erratic rainfall and water logging are the important causes of reduction in yield for most farmers in zambia in order to clarify our understanding of the relationship between water related problems and productivity it is useful to control for other factors that drive productivity the strategy for achieving this step is outlined in the next section 2 3 empirical estimation approach both descriptive and econometrics analyses are used to empirically test the questions raised in section 1 as explained in the conceptual framework water risk management should depend on the correlations of the incidence of the problems and their differential impacts across crops hence a descriptive approach was used to measure incidental correlation of water problems risks and econometrics approach to measure the differential impacts of the problems on productivity of crops since time series data to estimate the correlations of the shocks overtime were not available the incidental correlations of the risks were approximated by the percentage of households affected by each shock in a province at a time in our datasets households are asked to report the dominant problem that has affected their harvest hence a household has reported only one shock this restricts the possibility of measuring the correlation of the incidences at household level this was rather measured at province level if the shocks have uniform distribution in affecting sample households this was regarded as positive correlation if most households report only one shock then this was regarded as negative correlation mathematically the correlation of incidence were calculated by differencing the maximum incidence from the sum of the two lowest incidences this means if the shocks affect equal number of farmers in a given province each shock will have a probability of 33 33 which means they have equal uniform probability of occurring at time then the correlation of incidence will be positive 33 3 33 3 33 3 33 3 on the contrary if all sample households report only one shock then maximum incidence will be 100 and the other 0 which gives us a correlation of incidences as 100 thus the correlation of incidence ranges from 100 0 to 33 3 this range holds if all sample households report any one of the risks the study employed a cobb douglas production function approach to study the factors and the nature of the effects of water related indicators erratic rainfall flooding heavy rainfall and water logging on productivity jin et al 2012 productivity of plot yji is measured as output in kg per hectare for each crop and estimated using the following specification 1 in y ji α ji β 1 ds i β 2 wl i β 3 fl i β h x ji β f f i v j ε ij in this model y ji is agricultural productivity of a household i at plot j ε ij is the iid idiosyncratic error term and is uncorrelated with any of the explanatory variable β i are coefficients of regressors and especially β 1 β 2 β 3 are coefficients for the water risk variables ds i wl i and fl i for dry spell waterlogging and floods respectively x i are field level characteristics and quantities of inputs farm size soil quality slope methods of tillage at the field level whereas f i are household level variables including the age of the household head but also includes distances to markets the v i are household fixed effects the technology related variables including fertilizer application are expected to be positively related to productivity the water related problems of erratic rainfall flooding and water logging are expected to be detrimental to agricultural productivity the subscript i stands for household this formulation is also in line with several past studies including jin et al 2012 and amare et al 2018 an econometric technique is followed to estimate the effects of erratic rainfall flooding and water logging incidences on agricultural productivity in eq 1 eq 1 was estimated using the fixed effects technique and not ordinary least squares ols because when estimating agricultural productivity equation unobserved characteristics such as information about inputs farmer abilities other variables of soil quality and others are likely to be correlated with productivity and the key variables of interest water indicators and income status such a correlation signals potential endogeneity problem and ols estimators could be biased wooldridge 2002 exploiting the panel data nature of the dataset by using fixed effects estimation may ensure that parameters are not due to household level house invariant unobserved characteristics respectively amare et al 2018 the model in 1 is applied firstly to all top 6 crops maize groundnut sweet potato sunflower soybean and mixed beans combined and then to each crop individually in order to understand the hetergeneous impacts of water variables on productivity depending on crop type 3 results 3 1 incidences of dry spell waterlogging and floods table 4 presents the distribution of the shocks across provinces and their correlations with a province the last two columns present the total probability of the risks and the correlation of the incidences respectively the total probability is measured by the percentage of households affected by any one water risk in a province at a given year it is the sum of the percentages reported under each water problem the last column presents the correlations of the incidences calculated based on the method explained in section 3 3 following our argument presented in the forgoing section this descriptive result indicates 1 the possibility of managing the shocks either through crop or weather index insurances 2 the need for different water risk management strategy for the different provinces however understanding the differential productivity impacts across shocks and crops is needed to identify specific feasible water risk management strategy for each province and the country the next section presents the econometrics result of the estimation on this matter 3 2 differential impacts on productivity table 5 5 reports the estimates of the cobb douglas production function used in equation number 1 where the outcome variable is agricultural productivity measured by natural logarithm of household level aggregate value of production per hectare as in column 2 where value is driven by multiplying the output by each crop s market value per kg this column presents estimates from a model with a specification that includes all major crop value chains in zambia namely maize groundnut sunflower sweet potato soybean and mixed beans the specification also includes household and plot characteristics household fixed effects and water management and access indicators the second third fourth fifth and sixth columns present results of equation number 1 where the outcome variable agricultural productivity is measured by the natural logarithm of each crop s output per ha the columns present results for drivers of productivity for each of the major crops namely maize groundnut sweet potato sunflower soybean and mixed beans in order to expressly capture the differential impacts of water management and access variables on these key value chains 4 discussion the results in table 4 indicate that the level of water risks is different across provinces while as much as 89 of the samples are affected by water risks in lusaka only 17 of the households are affected in north western province the result also indicates that the shocks are negatively correlated in all provinces this means that the shocks occur alternatively or there exist a dominant water problem at a given province at a given time however the magnitude of correlation significantly vary across provinces as much as 70 in southern province where dry spell is the dominant risk affecting most households at a time and as low as 4 in luapula where water risk is less important but all the risks occur closely uniformly at time as expected the dry spells floods heavy rainfall water logging have a general negative effect on agricultural productivity but water logging had a more pronounced detrimental effect on yields of soybean with a highly significant coefficient of 1 8 which corroborates previous studies including maekawa et al 2011 in japan and even in the united states excess water after intense rainfall is the most serious cause of damage to crop production second to drought boyer 1982 waterlogging and ﬂooding depress growth and yield in soybean matsunami et al 2007 overall dry spells are detrimental for agricultural productivity and it has differential effects which vary depending on the type of crop being analyzed the overall reduction in production due to erratic rainfall is around 24 but it is 25 for maize can be as large as 83 for groundnut only about 7 for sweet potatoes the effects appear negative but statistically insignificant for soybean mixed bean and sunflower the negative effects of erratic rainfall is likely due to the direct effect from limited water availability and perhaps owing to the fact that frequent dry spells may discourage farmers from investing other complimentary inputs in production see amare et al 2018 dercon and christiaensen 2011 for a similar argument this already suggest that addressing water management challenges may have positive knock on effects on markets for other factors of production through increased demand further if irrigation was easily available as a tool for supplementing rainfall dry spells would have dampened negative effects on production and productivity because irrigation would compensate for the rain water deficit thus the pronounced negative effect of erratic rainfall on productivity is indirect evidence of low and insufficient irrigation coverage in zambia indeed the 2018 african union biennial reviews report for zambia mentions that zambia s share of land equipped for irrigation although growing in zambia is low and stands at just under 7 that sweet potato appears to suffer a small share of the impact from erratic rainfall while groundnut suffers a larger negative impact may be explained by the fact that generally potatoes are physiologically not water sensitive but drought resistant compared to most other crops daryanto et al 2016 adeleye et al 2011 peña gallardo et al 2019 on the other hand groundnut can be lost easily if dry spells hit them just before or during flowering because pod and kernel development are progressively inhibited by drought stress due to insufficient plant turgor and lack of assimilates reddy et al 2003 where water stress has been reduced by supplemental irrigation for example prabowo et al 1990 reported that pod yield increased in spanish type groundnut 100 day maturity to 2 4 t ha 1 compared with 0 53 t ha 1 under moisture stress implying that water stress can account to almost 80 of yield reduction while erratic and insufficient rainfall is the frequently reported water related problem among farmers in zambia there are often some incidences of flooding and heavy rainfall at some random parts of the year and when they happen they negate groundnut productivity but a surprising finding is that such heavy rainfall may advantage the performance of mixed beans the effect of floods in general is not pronounced in maize sweet potatoes and the other crops but this may be because floods are a rarity after all and when heavy rainfall is received it may be proceeded by periods of dry spells canceling the negative effects of floods in any case the differential impacts of water indicators including erratic rainfall flooding and water logging underscore the importance of crop specific policies for productivity improvement through water management at the same time the overall negative effect of poor water conditions on agricultural productivity provides further evidence that water development for irrigation must be on zambia s top priority policy menu it must be stated that it has not escaped our notice that the time of dry spells and flooding may be important for crop productivity and we are unable to account for this owing to data limitation but this effect may also partly be offset by the fact that our analysis is crop specific and the results still offer significant insights into the effects of erratic rainfall on productivity of these crops in zambia agricultural production and hence productivity takes place within a context of various conditioning factors managerial skill by the farmer for example appears generally non significant statistically for many of the crops although it matters for groundnut production while soil quality have a general negative effect on all crops this was more pronounced in groundnut and soybean perhaps because generally legumes farming is not accompanied by fertilizer application in zambia extension services are important for ground nut productivity but poor services depress productivity fertilizer use is good for productivity of maize the other crops are legumes and generally fertilizers are not applied in their production the most demand for fertilizers in zambian agriculture is in maize production tobacco and sugarcane farming a differentiation of the urbanization levels of where crops are grown shows no systematic differences in productivity between urban centers and rural centers but the tendency is that urban farming is less productive and in groundnut farming this effect is more pronounced the significance of fertilizer use in the maize equation may also signify that land markets are not as perfect because if they were a farmer without access to enough fertilizer would simply rent it out to those with fertilizer such that fertilizer use would not matter when one compares productivity across households that fertilizer use is important is consistent with previous findings including for example de janvry and sadoulet 2009 mendola 2007 although the analysis does not always show a significant effect of slope on productivity the general tendency is that steep slopes perhaps because they do not effectively hold water and nutrients reduce the productivity of a field which is consistent with many other previous findings the type of tillage system compared to zero tillage system appears to show that ploughing and hand hoeing are not as effective in enhancing productivity compared to zero tillage systems that do not disturb the soil too much but in both cases hand hoeing and ploughing are associated with good sweet potato performance not weeding the field is associated with a reduction in productivity overall and for maize the effect is negative for groundnut but it is not statistically significant weeding is important for productivity of maize fields and extension services should target such messages to farmers more vigorously which corroborates the findings in mar et al 2018 who goes on to emphasize the need for a strong bond between farmers and extension officers for enhancement of technology and technique adoption in lower myanmar it is also noted that some of the political administrative regions wards are important for productivity which implies that not accounting for them would lead to a variable omission and would undermine the unbiasedness of the other estimates this also corroborates the findings in mar et al 2018 which showed that pulse production was dependent on locality of the household this study suggests the following first since the impacts are heterogeneous and the risks occur alternatively crop index insurance could be considered as an important strategy to manage the consequences of the risks second an effective water risk management strategy may consider different approaches across provinces in areas where the total water risk incidence is larger such as lusaka a mix of strategies which include crop diversification could be considered admittedly the empirical measurement of the correlation of incidences is constrained by data therefore a further analysis is needed to apply the approach proposed in this paper based on time series and or joint incidence data at household level to verify the empirical findings and propose specific strategies of significant importance as well is the finding that farm size appears to negatively affect agricultural productivity overall and specifically for maize groundnut and sweet potato the relationship is statistically significant this finding is consistent with amare et al 2018 barrett 1996 as well as carletto et al 2013 the implication of this inverse farm size productivity relationship is that there is room for improving farm productivity in zambia through land allocations from large or medium holders to small holders it may also simply underscore the importance of capital and labor markets in deriving productivity theoretically if markets for land capital and labor were efficient perhaps the effect of size on land productivity would be dampened as large farms would have the required capital for operation and indeed where such is absent the land would move from inefficient land owners to efficient farmers through land markets capital markets are also important for zambia s agricultural production and this is why farm households with fertilizer access achieve higher crop productivity zambia s efforts on farm input subsidies is a good effort towards resolving fertilizer and input problems among smallholder farmers however like discussed by morris et al 2007 this should be achieved through market smart fertilizer subsidies which encourage private sector investments promote competition in fertilizer markets empower farmers to choose their own most appropriate method of managing soil fertility that suit their farming practices and should be economically sustainable there is also need to enhance farmer s trainings and awareness creation focusing on effective crop management in order to enhance productivity 5 conclusion as the population of zambia increases and land remains constant agricultural productivity is likely to become more important than ever before in order to bring out many of the zambian farmers out of poverty and provide food security to many of them while the importance of agricultural productivity is known there is no clear cut rule of thumb that may guarantee accelerated agricultural productivity to meet the burgeoning demands for food and incomes as population structures change both in urban and rural areas understanding the factors that limit agricultural productivity may be considered as a conditio sine qua non for agricultural based poverty eradication strategies the descriptive analysis indicates that the number of households affected by the shocks are significantly different in a province one shock seems more dominant than the others at time which is an important indication of the possibility to design not only technological but also financial strategies to manage the risks the econometric results also revealed the differential impacts of erratic rainfall and the other water variables on different crops these results corroborate previous ones by dercon and christiaensen 2011 as well as amare et al 2018 and many others which show that if rainfall is erratic then crop productivity may be negatively affected they also corroborate results from olayide et al 2016 who studied the differential impacts of irrigation and rainfall on agricultural production in nigeria using time series data using generalized method of moments gmm and autoregressive integrated moving average arima and found that irrigation and rainfall had positive effects on nigerian agriculture but that such effects varied from one agricultural sector to another the findings in this study further show that the effect of erratic rainfall flooding and water logging are different and to the extent that locational dummy variables are significant and different there is also evidence of heterogeneous effects of water stress indicators on crop productivity water stress dry spells have a higher effect on groundnut then maize and is least devastating on sweet potatoes since the effect of water factors including dry spells floods and water logging effect on agricultural productivity is dependent on the crop types it is important for the zambian government to take this into account when implementing strategies for agricultural water management maize and groundnut are affected significantly by erratic rainfall but sweet potatoes soybean mixed bean appear not to be equally affected this does not imply that that such crops should not receive particular attention in water management discourse but that where resource constraints are a limiting factor some crops may need more focus than those that are drought resistant further such evidence is useful for planning a diversification strategy in any case understanding such heterogeneous impacts is important even for understanding how an incidence of dry spell or flooding may affect agriculture production and through that line food security the significance of water indicators in the productivity equations is evidence that household production is rain dependent and therefore it is imperative that the zambian government should up the

9452,land degradation is one of the world s most pressing environmental problems and a constraint to agricultural production application of diverse organic amendments provides a management strategy to compensate for soil organic carbon depletion and reduce land degradation the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of different organic amendments on soil properties crop growth and water fertilizer productivity under arid conditions soil in a maize field located in the upper reaches of yellow river was amended with sheep manure compost and maize stover respectively five different application rates 2 4 6 8 and 10 t ha 1 were carried out for the compost and maize stover 6 t ha 1 combined with two different decomposing agents were implemented main component of the decomposing agent was bacillus subtilis and trichoderma harzianum respectively soil aggregation and physical chemical properties were generally improved with the incorporation of compost and maize stover the addition of compost and maize stover reduced the bulk density and increased the field capacity soil organic matter aggregate stability and the saturated hydraulic conductivity the emergence rate and maize growth properties improved in the organic materials amended plots however soil properties and crop growth non monotonically varied with application rate of compost the addition of different decomposing agents in maize stover amended plots did not show significant impact on most soil properties but improved soil nutrient status crop growth and yield with different levels compared with maize stover alone comprehensive analysis of yield crop water productivity and partial factor productivity for nitrogen incorporation of compost at a rate of 5 6 t ha 1 or 6 t ha 1 maize

al 2020 lucas et al 2014 numerous studies have reported that the application of compost improved soil aggregation and macropore volume sarker et al 2022 however there were also many results showed no significant changes kranz et al 2020 and references therein ferreras et al 2006 reported a significant correlation between soil aggregate stability and organic matter concentration after short term six months application of compost 10 and 20 t ha 1 yazdanpanah et al 2016 reported that compost amended soil had higher water stable aggregates 0 25 mm and more macropore fractions as well as greater hydraulic conductivity than the non amended soil the macropore fraction was more sensitive to the application of compost than the micropore fraction in contrast guidi et al 1988 reported that compost application at rates of 0 1 0 3 t ha 1 in sandy clay loam had negligible effect on the stability and pore size distribution of soil aggregates during the growing season of maize under natural field conditions straw has multiple beneficial effects on soil physical conditions over a wide range of climate soil and cropping systems siedt et al 2021 incorporation of straw was found to increase in soil water holding capacity and retention ability blanco canqui and lal 2009 reported that maize stover removal decreased soil structural stability and short term removal influences were terrain dependent i e the influence of maize stover removal was greater in sloping soils than in flat and glaciated soils tormena et al 2016 observed that moderate and high rates of maize stover harvest 50 and 90 respectively significantly increased structural quality compared with no harvest with no tillage following seven years of continuous experiments zhao et al 2018 reported that straw return increased mass proportion of macroaggregates but had negligible influence on proportion of microaggregates in the summer maize winter wheat rotation field in contrast soon and lupwayi 2012 reported that soil aggregation was not affected by straw management in a cold semiarid region zhang et al 2017 reported that wheat straw incorporation at a rate of 8 t ha 1 after three years had no significant effect on loess soil aggregation garnier et al 2004 found the presence of straw in soil decreased hydraulic conductivity due to the increase in tortuosity therefore as the ingredients and chemical composition of organic amendments vary among different sources their performances varied widely under different conditions soil organic amendments are added to increase organic content and fertility so that the availability of nutrients for crop was improved oo et al 2013 schmid et al 2016 yazdanpanah et al 2016 dwinta et al 2017 reported that the application of straw compost neem compost and cow manure significantly improved soil available nitrogen content and increased crop nitrogen uptake zhao et al 2018 reported that straw return significantly increased soil organic carbon content in different soil aggregate size classes relative to no straw return after seven years wang et al 2015 found that incorporation of maize stover significantly increased soil organic matter content huang et al 2021 reported that straw mulching and straw burying increased soil available nitrogen content oldfield et al 2018 demonstrated that higher concentrations of organic matter whether native or amended were associated with higher soil water holding capacity and nutrients the application of organic amendments on agricultural soils may increase in crop yield and productivity due to improvement of soil physio chemical properties and microbe mediated soil functions on the basis of meta analysis luo et al 2018 showed that incorporation of organic amendments increased crop yields on average of 27 than mineral only fertilization on a global scale however the effects largely depend on the type and application frequency of organic amendments cesarano et al 2017 ullah et al 2021 appraised the effects of organic amendment as a single or combined treatment to enhance crop productivity under drought stress and confirmed their efficiency in improving the growth and yield of crops under drought stress oldfield et al 2018 attempted to separate the influence of native organic matter and amended organic matter compost on crop productivity and found that native and amended organic matter had similar effects on soil properties and crop productivity in contrast soon and lupwayi 2012 detected grain yields were unaffected by straw management or crop residue input in a cold semiarid region in addition the performance of organic amendments on crop productivity also depends on their application patterns chen et al 2007 the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different organic amendments on soil properties and crop production under arid conditions the specific purposes are 1 to investigate the incorporation of different organic amendments on soil physical and chemical properties 2 to understand the effects of different organic amendments on maize growth yield and water fertilizer productivity 3 to propose a proper application strategy for different organic amendments under arid conditions sheep manure compost and maize zea mays l stover were chosen as the amendments to reclaim soils with consideration of easy availability applicability sustainability and cost the compost was incorporated at five different rates and maize stover was retained in identical amounts but combined with different decomposing agents 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description field experiments were conducted at the hetao experimental station located in the upper reaches of yellow river in 2020 and 2021 latitude 40 44 n longitude 107 17 e altitude 1031 m fig 1 climate in the study area is temperate continental climate characterized by low rainfall and high evaporation annual rainfall was around 160 mm with marked seasonality and annual potential evaporation was 2300 mm irrigation is essential for crop production in the hetao irrigation district because of the large discrepancy between annual precipitation and potential evaporation the large irrigation depth 400 500 mm in maize growing season and 220 260 mm for post harvest irrigation results in shallow groundwater 0 5 3 0 m and soil salinization mean annual temperature is 6 8 c and annual total sunshine duration is around 3230 h monthly meteorological data during the growing season of maize are presented in table 2 the daily reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated through the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 soil in the experimental site is classified as the anthropogenic alluvial soil according to chinese soil classification and terminology soil pedogenesis irrigation and tillage history resulted in relatively high bulk density of root zone soil soil at a depth of 0 100 cm was sampled and analyzed by the mastersizer 2000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer soil texture was classified according to the us texture classification triangle soil was loam sandy loam silt loam at a depth of 0 20 20 40 and 40 100 cm respectively table 1 shows root zone soil properties in the experimental site 2 2 incorporation of organic amendments two different types of organic amendments sheep manure compost and maize stover were incorporated into a maize field respectively the application rate of compost was 2 4 6 8 and 10 t ha 1 c2 c4 c6 c8 and c10 respectively the incorporation of maize stover contained three treatments i e 6 t ha 1 maize stover alone s6 and 6 t ha 1 maize stover combined with two different decomposing agents 75 kg ha 1 the principal components of decomposing agents were bacillus subtilis s6s and trichoderma harzianum s6h respectively bacillus subtilis is a bacterial strain and trichoderma harzianum is a fungal strain with high cellulase activity at low temperature the decomposing agent was a mixture of streptomyce and bacillus subtilis or trichoderma harzianum organic amendment was uniformly spread on soil surface and rotary tilled before seeding the tillage depth was 20 cm the plots without any organic amendment incorporation were considered the control ck the experimental design was a randomized block with three replications to minimize the influence of spatial heterogeneity each plot had an area of 96 m2 20 4 8 m2 2 3 crop planting irrigation and fertilization the test maize zea mays l was the cultivar zhenghong 558 in 2020 and kehe 669 in 2021 respectively maize was sowed on apr 28 and may 11 and harvested on sept 23 and 24 in 2020 and 2021 respectively the planting pattern was alternate wide and narrow rows which had the spacing of 70 and 50 cm respectively the wide row was mulched with polypropylene film with a breadth of 80 cm the maize seedlings were sowed close to the border of wide row with plant spacing of 30 cm the planting density was 60 000 plants per hectare irrigation fertilizer and field management practices were the same for all treatments border irrigation at a depth of 105 mm each time was conducted in the seedling jointing tasselling and milking stages respectively irrigation water source was groundwater with ec 0 83 ds m 1 and ph 7 35 the initial fertilizer consisted of 48 kg ha 1 of urea 295 kg ha 1 of diammonium phosphate n 18 p 46 and 120 kg ha 1 of potassium sulphate k 50 the supplementary urea fertilizer was applied at a rate of 163 109 and 109 kg ha 1 in the seedling tasselling and milking stages for each treatment respectively the supplementary fertilizer urea was spread uniformly between the polypropylene films prior to irrigation fertilizer and irrigation regimes were consistent with local farming practices 2 4 measurement of soil and plant growth properties soil physical and chemical properties were measured either in situ or through sampling soil samples used to measure wetness and available nitrogen were collected with an auger every 10 cm from 0 to 20 cm and every 20 cm from 20 to 100 cm respectively soil water content was measured by the gravimetric method the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil at a depth of 0 20 cm was measured in situ using the guelph permeameter soil organic carbon was determined by oxidizing organic matter in soil samples with k2cr2o7 in concentrate sulphuric acid for 30 min followed by titration of the excess of k2cr2o7 with ferrous ammonium sulphate soil electrical conductivity ec1 5 and ph were determined by abstracting the 1 5 soil water suspensions soil solution was extracted from the mixture of soil and 2 mol l 1 kcl solution at a ratio of 1 5 then the ammonium and nitrate nitrogen were measured using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer p4 uv visible spectrophotometer mapada china soil aggregate size distribution was measured using dry and wet sieving dong et al 2021 the nominal opening sizes of dry sieving were 10 7 5 3 2 1 0 5 and 0 25 mm respectively seven aggregate size classes were obtained by wet sieving with a series of sizes of 5 3 2 1 0 5 and 0 25 mm respectively the aggregate size distribution after dry and wet sieving was expressed as the mean weight diameter mwd the mean weight diameter of soil aggregates was calculated by the formula 1 mwd i 1 n w i x i i 1 n w i where x i is the average diameter of two consecutive sieves and w i represents the weight ratio of aggregate remaining on the i th sieve the percentage of aggregate destruction pad was calculated as 2 pad w d w w w d 100 where w d is the weight ratio of dry aggregate size and w w is the weight ratio of wet aggregate size over 0 25 mm the leaf area index lai of maize was measured by the ceptometer accupar l80 decagon devices pullman wa the height and stem diameter of maize were measured in different growth stages for ten fixed plants in each plot six plants were sampled for each plot to measure the aboveground biomass and allocation in organs in different growth stages maize plants were dried at 105 for 1 h to inactivate enzyme and then dried at 75 until constant weight the yield and yield components of maize were measured in the late of maturity stage ten plants were consecutively sampled in each plot i e 30 plants for each treatment the grains with water content of 14 were considered the standard yield of maize 2 5 calculation and data analysis the actual evapotranspiration eta of maize was estimated through soil water balance equation 3 et a p e i s μ h e h s r where p e is the precipitation in maize growing season mm i is the irrigation depth in maize growing season mm δs is the variation in soil water storage at a depth of 0 100 cm mm r is surface runoff mm μ is the specific yield h e and h s are the groundwater depth at the end and start of maize growing season respectively no runoff was detected during maize growing season so r is zero μ is 0 033 according to ren et al 2016 crop water productivity cwp is a term to describe the relationship between crop yield and the amount of water related to crop production the amount of water related to crop production can be expressed by actual evapotranspiration and irrigation depth crop water productivity was calculated by 4 cwp et yield of maize et a 5 cwp irrig yield of maize irrigation depth partial factor productivity is a term to describe the fertilizer using efficiency in crop growing season partial factor productivity of nitrogen was calculated by 6 pfp n yield of maize nitrogen fertilizer application rate the performances of organic amendments were analyzed by one way analysis of variance anova the least significant difference lsd test was employed to assess the differences among the treatments at a significant level of p 0 05 statistical analysis was carried out using spss 20 0 spss inc chicago usa 3 results 3 1 variation in soil physical and chemical properties across the amendments soil physical and chemical properties after two year application of organic amendments are presented in table 3 soil bulk density generally reduced with the addition of compost and maize stover compared with the control 1 58 g cm 3 the bulk density nonmonotonically varied with the application rate of compost soil amended with 4 and 6 t ha 1 compost had the smallest bulk density 1 44 g cm 3 and that amended with 2 t ha 1 compost had the largest bulk density 1 52 g cm 3 in the plots of maize stover treatments the addition of decomposing agents did not significantly alter the bulk density of soil corresponding variation in the field capacity was consistent with that of the bulk density the field capacity in plots with lower bulk density was relatively larger than that with higher soil bulk density soil organic matter som content significantly increased with the application of compost and maize stover compared with the control som in plots without any organic amendment was 15 7 g kg 1 the residual som after two growing seasons increased linearly with the application rate of compost som 0 5 rate 18 6 r 2 0 97 som in compost amended plots was slightly higher than that in maize stover amended plots the addition of decomposing agents did not significantly influence on som in maize stover amended plots soil aggregate size and stability varied with the incorporation of compost and maize stover fig 2 and table 3 the addition of organic amendment increased the mwd of dry and wet sieved aggregates compared with the control the mwd of dry sieved aggregates in compost amended soil non monotonically varied with the application rate and ranged from 3 27 mm to 3 96 mm the largest mwd of dry sieved aggregates was obtained in the plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost over application of compost 8 and 10 t ha 1 did not evidently increase the mwd of dry sieved aggregates in different maize stover treatments the mwd of dry sieved aggregates did not show significant difference it implied that the addition of decomposing agents did not alter dry sieved aggregate fractions in the two year experiments the mwds of wet sieved aggregates after slaking varied consistently with those by dry sieving the percentage of aggregate destruction pad reduced by addition of compost and maize stover compared with the control 88 the smallest pad 70 6 was found in plots amended with 8 t ha 1 compost the pad in maize stover treatments ranged from 63 9 to 65 9 significantly smaller than that in the control the addition of decomposing agents did not evidently impact the pad in addition the pad of soils amended with maize stover was smaller than that amended with same amount of compost the incorporation of organic amendments improved soil hydraulic conductivity in most cases saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil in the control was 4 5 10 6 m s 1 the hydraulic conductivity non monotonically varied with the application rate of compost the highest hydraulic conductivity 9 8 10 6 m s 1 was obtained in the plots amended with 4 and 6 t ha 1 compost however over application of compost 10 t ha 1 reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity 4 0 10 6 m s 1 the hydraulic conductivity varied with the presence absence of decomposing agents in maize stover amended soil the incorporation of maize stover alone did not significantly improve the hydraulic conductivity 4 8 10 6 m s 1 compared with the control however the addition of decomposing agents clearly increased hydraulic conductivity with different levels in addition the hydraulic conductivity in plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost was clearly higher than that in plots amended with 6 t ha 1 maize stover regardless of decomposing agents 3 2 soil water and nutrient dynamics soil wetness profiles at different growth stages of maize are presented in fig 3 panels a d and e h illustrate soil wetness distribution at the same day in the seedling jointing tasseling and milking stages in compost and maize stover amended plots respectively soil wetness in root zone was the balance among irrigation evaporation root uptake and percolation into deeper layers soil wetness mainly varied in the root zone of 0 50 cm in different organic materials amended plots soil wetness beneath 50 cm was almost around 0 4 cm3 cm 3 in different growth stages under different treatments in general the highest and lowest soil wetness in root zone in different growth stages obtained in the plots amended with 8 and 6 t ha 1 compost respectively soil wetness had no distinct difference among the other compost amended plots and the control soil wetness in maize stover treatments did not show distinct difference and had similar variation to the control seasonal variation in available soil nitrogen for different organic amendment treatments is shown in fig 4 temporal variation in soil available nitrogen at a depth of 0 20 and 20 40 cm was consistent but soil available nitrogen at a depth of 0 20 cm was generally higher than that at 20 40 cm depth soil had higher available nitrogen in the seedling and jointing stages and relatively lower available nitrogen in the tasseling and milking stages it noted that the sampling time in the tasseling and milking stages was prior to the irrigation and fertilization event soil at a depth of 0 20 cm in plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost had the highest available nitrogen in most growth stages soil available nitrogen at 20 40 cm depth showed no clear variation among different compost treatments but compost amended plots had relatively higher available nitrogen than the control in most growth stages maize stover treatments had higher available nitrogen at a depth of 0 20 cm in most growth stages and had higher available nitrogen at a depth of 20 40 cm only in seedling stage and maturity stage in addition soil amended with maize stover and bacillus subtilis had the highest available nitrogen in most growth stages among different maize stover treatments 3 3 plant growth and biomass response to organic amendment incorporation the emergence rate of maize under different organic amendment treatments is shown in fig 5 the emergence rate was not significantly influenced by the incorporation of compost and maize stover in the first experimental year however the emergence rate in the second experimental year increased in the plots amended with compost and maize stover the plots amended with 4 and 6 t ha 1 compost had the highest emergence rate 88 the emergence rate in the maize stover amended plots did not vary in the presence absence of decomposing agent maize growth properties after two year consecutive incorporation of organic amendments are presented in fig 6 panels a c and d f illustrate plant height stem diameter and lai for different compost and maize stover treatments respectively maize plants grew rapidly in the jointing stage and maintained the height in the tasseling milking and maturity stages plant growth had no distinct difference in the seedling stage 50 d after sowing for different organic amendment treatments the addition of compost and maize stover improved plant growth starting from the jointing stage compared with the control in comparison of different compost treatments the plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost obtained the best plants growth properties with the largest plant height stem diameter and lai in maize stover amended plots the addition of decomposing agents did not impact the stem diameter but improved the plant height and lai fig 7 illustrates dry aboveground biomass and its components in the organs for different treatments obtained in late maturity stage generally compost and maize stover incorporation improved aboveground biomass in most cases but dry aboveground biomass non monotonically varied with the application rate of compost the treatment of 4 and 6 t ha 1 compost obtained the highest aboveground biomass per plant in both experimental years over or deficit incorporation of compost had no significant difference in aboveground biomass compared with the control among maize stover treatments the addition of decomposing agents slightly increased aboveground biomass the plots amended with maize stover and bacillus subtilis obtained the highest aboveground biomass for all compost and maize stover treatments biomass proportions in different organs were not evidently influenced compared with the control 3 4 impact of organic amendments on maize yield and productivity grain yield and yield components of maize under different organic amendment treatments are presented in table 4 the incorporation of compost did not always improve grain yield the highest grain yield 16 1 and 12 1 t ha 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively was obtained in the plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost in both experimental years deficient and over application 2 and 10 t ha 1 of compost in the first experimental year even slightly reduced grain yield compared with the control but the reduction did not have a statistical significance however grain yield increased in the second experimental for all compost treatments even though the increase in the plots amended with 2 and 10 t ha 1 compost was not significant as well the yield components including ear length and diameter kernel per ear and 100 kernel weight improved in the plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost compared with the control in both experimental years the incorporation of maize stover alone did not improve grain yield in the first experimental year but promoted grain yield significantly in the second experimental year the addition of decomposing agent in maize stover treatments significantly improved grain yield in both experimental years grain yield in the plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost was clearly higher than that with 6 t ha 1 maize stover alone however grain yield in the plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost had no significant difference to that with 6 t ha 1 maize stover in combination with decomposing agent it noted that grain yield had an evident difference between two experimental years the large difference was attributed to several factors i the change of maize cultivar ii decrease in rainfall in the growing season table 2 iii spider mite damage and iv soil compaction by the machinery due to the engineering construction in 2021 table 5 shows actual evapotranspiration of maize crop water productivity in terms of evapotranspiration cwpet and irrigation depth cwpirrig and partial factor productivity of nitrogen pfpn for different compost and maize stover treatments actual evapotranspiration of maize in the control was around 590 and 480 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively the incorporation of compost slightly increased actual evapotranspiration in most cases but the increase did not show statistically significant the incorporation of maize stover had no significant impact on actual evapotranspiration regardless of decomposing agent thus crop water productivity in terms of evapotranspiration was mainly determined by the yield the plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost had the highest yield thus having the highest cwpet 2 7 and 2 5 kg m 3 in 2020 and 2021 respectively in the maize stover treatments the plots amended with maize stover combined with bacillus subtilis had the largest yield and cwpet 2 9 and 2 6 kg m 3 in 2020 and 2021 respectively in comparison with the organic amendment types the plots amended with maize stover combined with bacillus subtilis had slightly higher cwpet than those with same amount of compost 6 t ha 1 the variation in cwpirrig and pfpn were consistent with that of grain yield since irrigation and fertilization regimes were the same for all treatments thus the plots obtained the highest yield had the highest cwpirrig and pfpn 4 discussion 4 1 effects of organic amendment incorporation on soil physical and chemical properties soil physical and chemical properties play an important role in determining suitability for agricultural use bulk density is an important parameter of soil physical properties which is affected by texture structure organic matter content and the degree of compaction etc in the two year field study the incorporation of compost and maize stover significantly reduced soil bulk density table 3 however the reduction in bulk density non monotonically varied with the application rate of compost the reduction in bulk density was simply attributed to the lower density of compost and maize stover the decrease in bulk density is essential for agricultural soil and water management as seed germination penetration of roots movement retention and availability of water and nutrients to plants and flow of heat and air are directly associated with the bulk density in particular for the study area root zone soil had relatively high bulk density 1 53 g cm 3 before the experiments in some areas even higher than 1 65 g cm 3 due of soil paedogenesis surface irrigation and tillage practices thus seed germination and crop yield were negatively affected in order to promote the emergence rate local farmers sometimes covered the seeds with sand after sowing which was labor consuming the experimental results demonstrated that emergence rate of maize significantly increased after two year consecutive incorporation of either compost or maize stover fig 5 som is important to improve soil fertility ameliorate soil structure and maintain crop production dong et al 2021 lal 2004 som evidently increased after incorporation of compost and maize stover since they had higher organic carbon content table 1 organic matter content of the tested compost was around 391 7 g kg 1 and of maize stover was around 614 5 g kg 1 which was 25 and 40 folds of that in the soil 15 2 g kg 1 residual som after two consecutive growing seasons increased linearly with the application rate of compost som in compost amended plots was slightly higher than that in maize stover amended plots at the same application rate this may be attributed to high carbon availability of maize stover and alkaline nature of experimental soil resulting in faster carbon mineralization and decreased organic carbon khalil et al 2005 siedt et al 2021 organic amendment incorporation may stabilize soil carbon by soil microbial communities wang et al 2015 and the stabilized nutrient may become available to plants in the subsequent microbial turnover zhang et al 2015 the addition of organic amendment is a key factor that influences soil aggregation and aggregation in turn plays a crucial role in protecting soil organic matter from decomposition the mean weight diameter is the most widely used index in relating aggregate size to stability the addition of organic amendment resulted in an evident increase in the mean weight diameter and the proportion of macroaggregate diameter 0 25 mm compared with the control fig 2 these results are consistent with previous studies by bandyopadhyay et al 2010 hernandez et al 2017 xu et al 2015 higher mwd indicates the dominance of less erodible larger aggregates in the soil and therefore greater aggregate stability rabot et al 2018 organic amendment affected soil aggregation directly by acting as a binding agent among soil particles or indirectly by increasing soil organic carbon content which subsequently influences soil aggregation the increased som content resulted in improved cohesion of organic matter and soil clay minerals which promote the formation of aggregate mainuri and owino 2013 the different organic binding agents have different effects on soil aggregation organic binding agents can be classified into three different types i e transient temporary and persistent depending on the age and degree of som degradation tisdall and oades 1982 the addition of well decomposed material leads to a slow and more steady increase in aggregation sarker et al 2022 proposed to use maximum relative effect the value in the organic amendment treatment divided by that in the unamended control to evaluate the effects of organic amendment on aggregate stability the maximum relative effect below or equal to 1 00 was consider no effect between 1 00 and 1 30 was weak between 1 31 and 2 00 was strong and above 2 00 was very strong effects the maximum relative effect was around 1 27 2 07 for compost and 1 10 for maize stover sarker et al 2022 it indicated that the effect varied from weak to very strong for the compost because of the quality of compost varied widely and was week for maize stover the larger mwd of compost amended soil than the same amount of maize stover amended soil was consistent with maximum relative effect evaluation the mwd and pad varied non monotonically with the application rate of compost implied that deficit or over application of compost would not obtain the optimal aggregate structure the incorporation of organic amendments improved soil aggregation and altered soil structure thus changed soil hydraulic properties saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil amended with compost and maize stover increased obviously due to decrease in bulk density and increase in aggregate stability table 3 in general soils with smaller bulk density exhibited larger macro porosity spaans et al 1989 the application of compost and maize stover has the potential to increase the number size and connectivity of the pores dong et al 2021 in addition saturated hydraulic conductivity was also affected by soil aggregates size soil amended with organic amendments had larger soil aggregate size thus improved saturated hydraulic conductivity these results are consistent with previous studies mahmoodabadi and sajjadi 2016 mangalassery et al 2013 the increased hydraulic conductivity may improve the flow and transport of water fertilizer and gases through the soil profile which is important for plant growth ferreras et al 2006 marinari et al 2000 yazdanpanah et al 2011 in particular in arid area leaching salt out of root zone is also essential for crop production 4 2 plant growth responses to organic amendment incorporation incorporation of organic amendment alters soil aggregation thus influencing soil water and nutrient statuses and plant growth macroaggregates provide protection to organic matter and contain the majority of available nutrient content tian et al 2022 soil aggregate stability is associated with soil water and nutrient condition soil with better aggregate stability can accumulate sufficient available water and nutrient generally in the macroaggregates resulting in the promoted crop productivity garland et al 2018 plante et al 2002 six et al 2000 tian et al 2022 zhang et al 2016 the addition of compost decreased soil bulk density and increased field capacity reflecting the improved soil pore characters thus improving water holding capacity yang et al 2011 the relatively lower soil wetness in plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost might be that maize uptake more soil water because of better crop growth bandyopadhyay et al 2010 as soil moisture in root zone was the balance among irrigation evaporation root uptake and percolation into deeper layers the addition of organic amendments is an effective way to improve soil available nitrogen content soil microbes decompose organic nitrogen from compost and maize stover for their growth and activities and convert organic nitrogen to inorganic nitrogen through mineralization omar et al 2020 thus the quantity of organic matter and nitrogen from organic amendments plays an important role in soil available nitrogen compost and maize stover had abundant organic matter and nitrogen which provided enough substrate for nitrogen mineralization thus improved available nitrogen table 1 manure compost was found have an important effect on soil processes such as protein and amino acid processing rate and resulted in the steady and slow mineralization of nitrogen habteselassie et al 2006 he et al 1999 ma et al 2020 thus the application of compost promoted organic nitrogen mineralization improved soil nitrogen nh4 and no3 production and assimilation and resulted in a sustained nitrogen supply to crops ma et al 2020 omar et al 2020 in addition the relatively lower c n of compost 11 1 may also contribute to higher available content since compost with c n ranging from 10 to 15 results in mineralization tejada et al 2009 although trinsoutrot et al 2000 reported that only crop residues with c n lower than 24 resulted in a higher mineral nitrogen and the tested maize stover has higher c n ratio 48 6 larger available nitrogen content was still found in plots added maize stover with the decomposing agent fig 4 it may be attributed to high nitrogen availability of maize stover and relatively lower c n 25 7 of soil characterized by slower nitrogen immobilization and surplus of available nitrogen siedt et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 similarly soil nitrogen availability was also found increase in soil amended with high c n 63 of rice straw organic amendment by zhou et al 2020 the addition of decomposing agent favored maize stover decomposition and mineralization thus soil amended with maize stover combined with decomposing agent has higher available nitrogen soil available nitrogen may also be indirectly influenced by soil physical properties the addition of compost and maize stover resulted in decreased bulk density which reflected a decreased mechanical impedance and increased oxygen availability bingham and bengough 2003 czyz 2004 decreased mechanical impedance and increased oxygen availability reduced nitrogen loss by reducing denitrification proper application of organic amendments together with inorganic fertilizer increased soil nitrogen availability resulted in better plant growth increase in maize biomass cumulation and directly improved maize yield omar et al 2020 zakirullah and khalil 2010 improvment of soil physical chemical properties may also promote nutrient aviliabllity and crop nutrient uptake therefore combined use of organic amendments and fertilizer resulted in a build up of nitrogen and obviously improved pfpn in the plots amended with 4 and 6 t ha 1 compost and maize stover with decomposing agent treatments since irrigation and fertilization regimes were the same for all the treatments plots with higher yield and pfpn also had higher cwpirrig incorporation of 4 and 6 t ha 1 compost and maize stover with decomposing agents obviously improved cwpet in two experimental years similar results were also reported by hati et al 2006 and bandyopadhyay et al 2010 the addition of organic amendment decreased bulk density and increased soil porosity aggregate stability and hydraulic conductivity resulting in larger soil water retention capacity better soil structure and better plant root growth gaiotti et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 crop roots uptake water and nutrient efficiently in organic material amended soils which improved cwpet lima et al 2009 seghatoleslami et al 2014 4 3 proper application strategy of different organic amendments crop water productivity is an indicator for quantifying the impact of irrigation scheduling decisions with regard to water management compost application has a synthetic effect on grain yield crop water productivity and partial factor productivity for nitrogen optimal compost application strategies are usually proposed that consider integrating these elements grain yield water productivity and partial factor productivity for nitrogen versus the application rate of compost showed a quadratic relationship fig 8 the vertexes of fitting curves illustrated that optimal application rate of the compost ranged from 5 08 to 5 78 t ha 1 in 2020 and ranged from 4 75 to 5 61 t ha 1 in 2021 for different maize stover treatments the highest yield and water nitrogen productivity were detected in the plots amended with the decomposing agent in 2020 and 2021 table 5 therefore a proper organic amendment application strategy can be proposed i e amended with 5 6 t ha 1 sheep manure compost or 6 t ha 1 maize stover combined with bacillus subtilis for loamy soil under arid conditions however these findings are based on field implementation of organic amendments for two growing seasons the long term effects of different organic amendments under arid condition and application pattern consecutive or intermittent incorporation are still ongoing research 5 conclusion two year field experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of sheep manure compost and maize stover on maize zea mays l growth yield and water fertilizer productivity under arid conditions the application of organic amendments improved soil aggregation and physical chemical properties in two year experiments soil physical properties varied non monotonically with the application rate of compost and soil organic matter content increased linearly with the compost application rate the addition of decomposing agents bacillus subtilis and trichoderma harzianum did not evidently influence soil physical and chemical properties the addition of compost and maize stover improved plant growth starting from the jointing stage compared with the control the incorporation of compost did not always improve the grain yield deficient and over application of the compost did not alter grain yield significantly the addition of bacillus subtilis and trichoderma harzianum did not impact maize stem diameter but promoted plant height lai and aboveground biomass in maize stover incorporations the variation in water and fertilizer are consistent with that of grain yield since irrigation and fertilization regimes were the same for all the treatments the appropriate application rate of sheep manure compost is 5 6 t ha 1 for the loam soil under arid conditions with consideration of the effects on soil properties maize yield and water fertilizer productivity the application of 6 t ha 1 maize stover in combination with bacillus subtilis has also good effect on the maize production the long term effects of these organic amendments under either consecutive or intermittent incorporation is still desirable declaration of

9452,land degradation is one of the world s most pressing environmental problems and a constraint to agricultural production application of diverse organic amendments provides a management strategy to compensate for soil organic carbon depletion and reduce land degradation the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of different organic amendments on soil properties crop growth and water fertilizer productivity under arid conditions soil in a maize field located in the upper reaches of yellow river was amended with sheep manure compost and maize stover respectively five different application rates 2 4 6 8 and 10 t ha 1 were carried out for the compost and maize stover 6 t ha 1 combined with two different decomposing agents were implemented main component of the decomposing agent was bacillus subtilis and trichoderma harzianum respectively soil aggregation and physical chemical properties were generally improved with the incorporation of compost and maize stover the addition of compost and maize stover reduced the bulk density and increased the field capacity soil organic matter aggregate stability and the saturated hydraulic conductivity the emergence rate and maize growth properties improved in the organic materials amended plots however soil properties and crop growth non monotonically varied with application rate of compost the addition of different decomposing agents in maize stover amended plots did not show significant impact on most soil properties but improved soil nutrient status crop growth and yield with different levels compared with maize stover alone comprehensive analysis of yield crop water productivity and partial factor productivity for nitrogen incorporation of compost at a rate of 5 6 t ha 1 or 6 t ha 1 maize stover combined with bacillus subtilis was recommended as a proper strategy in loamy soil under arid conditions keywords sheep manure compost maize zea mays l stover water productivity partial factor productivity of nitrogen border irrigation 1 introduction arid and semi arid lands comprise more than forty percent of the earth s land surface reynolds et al 2007 these drought prone regions have become important cereals fruits and cash crops production areas where a large number of people inhabit to engage in agriculture to meet their basic needs however agricultural development in these regions is constrained by water shortage soil salinization and low soil fertility hassani et al 2020 myers et al 2017 sahab et al 2021 in order to obtain high crop production excess mineral fertilizer is applied and a series of environmental problems occur such as nonpoint source pollution land degradation and desertification ju et al 2004 turner et al 2016 the degradation and desertification of land induced decline in soil productivity in order to achieve the sustainable development of agriculture diverse organic amendments are proposed to improve soil quality and productivity diacono and montemurro 2010 kranz et al 2020 leogrande and vitti 2019 ullah et al 2021 the application of organic amendments provides a management strategy to compensate for soil organic carbon depletion and reduce land degradation the incorporation of diverse organic amendments is also regarded as a means to improve soil structure and fertility microbial activity crop yield and sequester carbon for climate change mitigation aparna et al 2014 bastida et al 2012 carlson et al 2015 larney and angers 2012 leogrande and vitti 2019 parr et al 1989 therefore understanding the performance of variable organic amendments under different conditions is essential for their proper application a variety of organic amendments with varying levels of processing and characteristic is available in different regions and can be applied to amend soils larney and angers 2012 vida et al 2019 the feedstocks of organic amendment may be either agricultural or industrial byproducts the performance of organic amendment differs as a consequence of several factors such as original feedstocks and producing conditions climate soil and crop types gravuer et al 2019 several factors including the availability quality applicability sustainability and cost and beneficial effects for the soil system need to consider when different organic amendments are applied siedt et al 2021 compost is one of the most widely employed organic amendments as it is easily available and applicable kranz et al 2020 siedt et al 2021 compost prepared from different organic wastes differs in their quality and stability which further depends upon the composition of raw materials azim et al 2018 the quality of compost is determined by the sum of its different features and properties parameters used to evaluate compost quality include the c n organic matter content salinity total nitrogen total phosphorous stability phytotoxicity ph maturity boron chloride sodium particle sizes heavy metal concentration and pathogen concentrations etc azim et al 2018 plant straw is another widely used organic amendment which has stable quality soon and lupwayi 2012 the elemental composition and chemical parameters such as carbon nitrogen or phosphorous content c n molar ratios of hydrogen or oxygen to carbon atoms varied in different types of straw siedt et al 2021 compost and straw are made from waste products without energy intensive production processes and therefore have relatively high sustainability siedt et al 2021 the addition of organic amendment aims at improving soil structure and physicochemical properties larney and angers 2012 and kranz et al 2020 reviewed a large number of studies regarding compost incorporation and the associated impact on soil properties and functions in general soil physicochemical properties are improved after application of compost such as increase in pore volume water infiltration and aggregate stability and decrease in bulk density and soil erosion kranz et al 2020 lucas et al 2014 numerous studies have reported that the application of compost improved soil aggregation and macropore volume sarker et al 2022 however there were also many results showed no significant changes kranz et al 2020 and references therein ferreras et al 2006 reported a significant correlation between soil aggregate stability and organic matter concentration after short term six months application of compost 10 and 20 t ha 1 yazdanpanah et al 2016 reported that compost amended soil had higher water stable aggregates 0 25 mm and more macropore fractions as well as greater hydraulic conductivity than the non amended soil the macropore fraction was more sensitive to the application of compost than the micropore fraction in contrast guidi et al 1988 reported that compost application at rates of 0 1 0 3 t ha 1 in sandy clay loam had negligible effect on the stability and pore size distribution of soil aggregates during the growing season of maize under natural field conditions straw has multiple beneficial effects on soil physical conditions over a wide range of climate soil and cropping systems siedt et al 2021 incorporation of straw was found to increase in soil water holding capacity and retention ability blanco canqui and lal 2009 reported that maize stover removal decreased soil structural stability and short term removal influences were terrain dependent i e the influence of maize stover removal was greater in sloping soils than in flat and glaciated soils tormena et al 2016 observed that moderate and high rates of maize stover harvest 50 and 90 respectively significantly increased structural quality compared with no harvest with no tillage following seven years of continuous experiments zhao et al 2018 reported that straw return increased mass proportion of macroaggregates but had negligible influence on proportion of microaggregates in the summer maize winter wheat rotation field in contrast soon and lupwayi 2012 reported that soil aggregation was not affected by straw management in a cold semiarid region zhang et al 2017 reported that wheat straw incorporation at a rate of 8 t ha 1 after three years had no significant effect on loess soil aggregation garnier et al 2004 found the presence of straw in soil decreased hydraulic conductivity due to the increase in tortuosity therefore as the ingredients and chemical composition of organic amendments vary among different sources their performances varied widely under different conditions soil organic amendments are added to increase organic content and fertility so that the availability of nutrients for crop was improved oo et al 2013 schmid et al 2016 yazdanpanah et al 2016 dwinta et al 2017 reported that the application of straw compost neem compost and cow manure significantly improved soil available nitrogen content and increased crop nitrogen uptake zhao et al 2018 reported that straw return significantly increased soil organic carbon content in different soil aggregate size classes relative to no straw return after seven years wang et al 2015 found that incorporation of maize stover significantly increased soil organic matter content huang et al 2021 reported that straw mulching and straw burying increased soil available nitrogen content oldfield et al 2018 demonstrated that higher concentrations of organic matter whether native or amended were associated with higher soil water holding capacity and nutrients the application of organic amendments on agricultural soils may increase in crop yield and productivity due to improvement of soil physio chemical properties and microbe mediated soil functions on the basis of meta analysis luo et al 2018 showed that incorporation of organic amendments increased crop yields on average of 27 than mineral only fertilization on a global scale however the effects largely depend on the type and application frequency of organic amendments cesarano et al 2017 ullah et al 2021 appraised the effects of organic amendment as a single or combined treatment to enhance crop productivity under drought stress and confirmed their efficiency in improving the growth and yield of crops under drought stress oldfield et al 2018 attempted to separate the influence of native organic matter and amended organic matter compost on crop productivity and found that native and amended organic matter had similar effects on soil properties and crop productivity in contrast soon and lupwayi 2012 detected grain yields were unaffected by straw management or crop residue input in a cold semiarid region in addition the performance of organic amendments on crop productivity also depends on their application patterns chen et al 2007 the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different organic amendments on soil properties and crop production under arid conditions the specific purposes are 1 to investigate the incorporation of different organic amendments on soil physical and chemical properties 2 to understand the effects of different organic amendments on maize growth yield and water fertilizer productivity 3 to propose a proper application strategy for different organic amendments under arid conditions sheep manure compost and maize zea mays l stover were chosen as the amendments to reclaim soils with consideration of easy availability applicability sustainability and cost the compost was incorporated at five different rates and maize stover was retained in identical amounts but combined with different decomposing agents 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description field experiments were conducted at the hetao experimental station located in the upper reaches of yellow river in 2020 and 2021 latitude 40 44 n longitude 107 17 e altitude 1031 m fig 1 climate in the study area is temperate continental climate characterized by low rainfall and high evaporation annual rainfall was around 160 mm with marked seasonality and annual potential evaporation was 2300 mm irrigation is essential for crop production in the hetao irrigation district because of the large discrepancy between annual precipitation and potential evaporation the large irrigation depth 400 500 mm in maize growing season and 220 260 mm for post harvest irrigation results in shallow groundwater 0 5 3 0 m and soil salinization mean annual temperature is 6 8 c and annual total sunshine duration is around 3230 h monthly meteorological data during the growing season of maize are presented in table 2 the daily reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated through the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 soil in the experimental site is classified as the anthropogenic alluvial soil according to chinese soil classification and terminology soil pedogenesis irrigation and tillage history resulted in relatively high bulk density of root zone soil soil at a depth of 0 100 cm was sampled and analyzed by the mastersizer 2000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer soil texture was classified according to the us texture classification triangle soil was loam sandy loam silt loam at a depth of 0 20 20 40 and 40 100 cm respectively table 1 shows root zone soil properties in the experimental site 2 2 incorporation of organic amendments two different types of organic amendments sheep manure compost and maize stover were incorporated into a maize field respectively the application rate of compost was 2 4 6 8 and 10 t ha 1 c2 c4 c6 c8 and c10 respectively the incorporation of maize stover contained three treatments i e 6 t ha 1 maize stover alone s6 and 6 t ha 1 maize stover combined with two different decomposing agents 75 kg ha 1 the principal components of decomposing agents were bacillus subtilis s6s and trichoderma harzianum s6h respectively bacillus subtilis is a bacterial strain and trichoderma harzianum is a fungal strain with high cellulase activity at low temperature the decomposing agent was a mixture of streptomyce and bacillus subtilis or trichoderma harzianum organic amendment was uniformly spread on soil surface and rotary tilled before seeding the tillage depth was 20 cm the plots without any organic amendment incorporation were considered the control ck the experimental design was a randomized block with three replications to minimize the influence of spatial heterogeneity each plot had an area of 96 m2 20 4 8 m2 2 3 crop planting irrigation and fertilization the test maize zea mays l was the cultivar zhenghong 558 in 2020 and kehe 669 in 2021 respectively maize was sowed on apr 28 and may 11 and harvested on sept 23 and 24 in 2020 and 2021 respectively the planting pattern was alternate wide and narrow rows which had the spacing of 70 and 50 cm respectively the wide row was mulched with polypropylene film with a breadth of 80 cm the maize seedlings were sowed close to the border of wide row with plant spacing of 30 cm the planting density was 60 000 plants per hectare irrigation fertilizer and field management practices were the same for all treatments border irrigation at a depth of 105 mm each time was conducted in the seedling jointing tasselling and milking stages respectively irrigation water source was groundwater with ec 0 83 ds m 1 and ph 7 35 the initial fertilizer consisted of 48 kg ha 1 of urea 295 kg ha 1 of diammonium phosphate n 18 p 46 and 120 kg ha 1 of potassium sulphate k 50 the supplementary urea fertilizer was applied at a rate of 163 109 and 109 kg ha 1 in the seedling tasselling and milking stages for each treatment respectively the supplementary fertilizer urea was spread uniformly between the polypropylene films prior to irrigation fertilizer and irrigation regimes were consistent with local farming practices 2 4 measurement of soil and plant growth properties soil physical and chemical properties were measured either in situ or through sampling soil samples used to measure wetness and available nitrogen were collected with an auger every 10 cm from 0 to 20 cm and every 20 cm from 20 to 100 cm respectively soil water content was measured by the gravimetric method the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil at a depth of 0 20 cm was measured in situ using the guelph permeameter soil organic carbon was determined by oxidizing organic matter in soil samples with k2cr2o7 in concentrate sulphuric acid for 30 min followed by titration of the excess of k2cr2o7 with ferrous ammonium sulphate soil electrical conductivity ec1 5 and ph were determined by abstracting the 1 5 soil water suspensions soil solution was extracted from the mixture of soil and 2 mol l 1 kcl solution at a ratio of 1 5 then the ammonium and nitrate nitrogen were measured using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer p4 uv visible spectrophotometer mapada china soil aggregate size distribution was measured using dry and wet sieving dong et al 2021 the nominal opening sizes of dry sieving were 10 7 5 3 2 1 0 5 and 0 25 mm respectively seven aggregate size classes were obtained by wet sieving with a series of sizes of 5 3 2 1 0 5 and 0 25 mm respectively the aggregate size distribution after dry and wet sieving was expressed as the mean weight diameter mwd the mean weight diameter of soil aggregates was calculated by the formula 1 mwd i 1 n w i x i i 1 n w i where x i is the average diameter of two consecutive sieves and w i represents the weight ratio of aggregate remaining on the i th sieve the percentage of aggregate destruction pad was calculated as 2 pad w d w w w d 100 where w d is the weight ratio of dry aggregate size and w w is the weight ratio of wet aggregate size over 0 25 mm the leaf area index lai of maize was measured by the ceptometer accupar l80 decagon devices pullman wa the height and stem diameter of maize were measured in different growth stages for ten fixed plants in each plot six plants were sampled for each plot to measure the aboveground biomass and allocation in organs in different growth stages maize plants were dried at 105 for 1 h to inactivate enzyme and then dried at 75 until constant weight the yield and yield components of maize were measured in the late of maturity stage ten plants were consecutively sampled in each plot i e 30 plants for each treatment the grains with water content of 14 were considered the standard yield of maize 2 5 calculation and data analysis the actual evapotranspiration eta of maize was estimated through soil water balance equation 3 et a p e i s μ h e h s r where p e is the precipitation in maize growing season mm i is the irrigation depth in maize growing season mm δs is the variation in soil water storage at a depth of 0 100 cm mm r is surface runoff mm μ is the specific yield h e and h s are the groundwater depth at the end and start of maize growing season respectively no runoff was detected during maize growing season so r is zero μ is 0 033 according to ren et al 2016 crop water productivity cwp is a term to describe the relationship between crop yield and the amount of water related to crop production the amount of water related to crop production can be expressed by actual evapotranspiration and irrigation depth crop water productivity was calculated by 4 cwp et yield of maize et a 5 cwp irrig yield of maize irrigation depth partial factor productivity is a term to describe the fertilizer using efficiency in crop growing season partial factor productivity of nitrogen was calculated by 6 pfp n yield of maize nitrogen fertilizer application rate the performances of organic amendments were analyzed by one way analysis of variance anova the least significant difference lsd test was employed to assess the differences among the treatments at a significant level of p 0 05 statistical analysis was carried out using spss 20 0 spss inc chicago usa 3 results 3 1 variation in soil physical and chemical properties across the amendments soil physical and chemical properties after two year application of organic amendments are presented in table 3 soil bulk density generally reduced with the addition of compost and maize stover compared with the control 1 58 g cm 3 the bulk density nonmonotonically varied with the application rate of compost soil amended with 4 and 6 t ha 1 compost had the smallest bulk density 1 44 g cm 3 and that amended with 2 t ha 1 compost had the largest bulk density 1 52 g cm 3 in the plots of maize stover treatments the addition of decomposing agents did not significantly alter the bulk density of soil corresponding variation in the field capacity was consistent with that of the bulk density the field capacity in plots with lower bulk density was relatively larger than that with higher soil bulk density soil organic matter som content significantly increased with the application of compost and maize stover compared with the control som in plots without any organic amendment was 15 7 g kg 1 the residual som after two growing seasons increased linearly with the application rate of compost som 0 5 rate 18 6 r 2 0 97 som in compost amended plots was slightly higher than that in maize stover amended plots the addition of decomposing agents did not significantly influence on som in maize stover amended plots soil aggregate size and stability varied with the incorporation of compost and maize stover fig 2 and table 3 the addition of organic amendment increased the mwd of dry and wet sieved aggregates compared with the control the mwd of dry sieved aggregates in compost amended soil non monotonically varied with the application rate and ranged from 3 27 mm to 3 96 mm the largest mwd of dry sieved aggregates was obtained in the plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost over application of compost 8 and 10 t ha 1 did not evidently increase the mwd of dry sieved aggregates in different maize stover treatments the mwd of dry sieved aggregates did not show significant difference it implied that the addition of decomposing agents did not alter dry sieved aggregate fractions in the two year experiments the mwds of wet sieved aggregates after slaking varied consistently with those by dry sieving the percentage of aggregate destruction pad reduced by addition of compost and maize stover compared with the control 88 the smallest pad 70 6 was found in plots amended with 8 t ha 1 compost the pad in maize stover treatments ranged from 63 9 to 65 9 significantly smaller than that in the control the addition of decomposing agents did not evidently impact the pad in addition the pad of soils amended with maize stover was smaller than that amended with same amount of compost the incorporation of organic amendments improved soil hydraulic conductivity in most cases saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil in the control was 4 5 10 6 m s 1 the hydraulic conductivity non monotonically varied with the application rate of compost the highest hydraulic conductivity 9 8 10 6 m s 1 was obtained in the plots amended with 4 and 6 t ha 1 compost however over application of compost 10 t ha 1 reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity 4 0 10 6 m s 1 the hydraulic conductivity varied with the presence absence of decomposing agents in maize stover amended soil the incorporation of maize stover alone did not significantly improve the hydraulic conductivity 4 8 10 6 m s 1 compared with the control however the addition of decomposing agents clearly increased hydraulic conductivity with different levels in addition the hydraulic conductivity in plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost was clearly higher than that in plots amended with 6 t ha 1 maize stover regardless of decomposing agents 3 2 soil water and nutrient dynamics soil wetness profiles at different growth stages of maize are presented in fig 3 panels a d and e h illustrate soil wetness distribution at the same day in the seedling jointing tasseling and milking stages in compost and maize stover amended plots respectively soil wetness in root zone was the balance among irrigation evaporation root uptake and percolation into deeper layers soil wetness mainly varied in the root zone of 0 50 cm in different organic materials amended plots soil wetness beneath 50 cm was almost around 0 4 cm3 cm 3 in different growth stages under different treatments in general the highest and lowest soil wetness in root zone in different growth stages obtained in the plots amended with 8 and 6 t ha 1 compost respectively soil wetness had no distinct difference among the other compost amended plots and the control soil wetness in maize stover treatments did not show distinct difference and had similar variation to the control seasonal variation in available soil nitrogen for different organic amendment treatments is shown in fig 4 temporal variation in soil available nitrogen at a depth of 0 20 and 20 40 cm was consistent but soil available nitrogen at a depth of 0 20 cm was generally higher than that at 20 40 cm depth soil had higher available nitrogen in the seedling and jointing stages and relatively lower available nitrogen in the tasseling and milking stages it noted that the sampling time in the tasseling and milking stages was prior to the irrigation and fertilization event soil at a depth of 0 20 cm in plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost had the highest available nitrogen in most growth stages soil available nitrogen at 20 40 cm depth showed no clear variation among different compost treatments but compost amended plots had relatively higher available nitrogen than the control in most growth stages maize stover treatments had higher available nitrogen at a depth of 0 20 cm in most growth stages and had higher available nitrogen at a depth of 20 40 cm only in seedling stage and maturity stage in addition soil amended with maize stover and bacillus subtilis had the highest available nitrogen in most growth stages among different maize stover treatments 3 3 plant growth and biomass response to organic amendment incorporation the emergence rate of maize under different organic amendment treatments is shown in fig 5 the emergence rate was not significantly influenced by the incorporation of compost and maize stover in the first experimental year however the emergence rate in the second experimental year increased in the plots amended with compost and maize stover the plots amended with 4 and 6 t ha 1 compost had the highest emergence rate 88 the emergence rate in the maize stover amended plots did not vary in the presence absence of decomposing agent maize growth properties after two year consecutive incorporation of organic amendments are presented in fig 6 panels a c and d f illustrate plant height stem diameter and lai for different compost and maize stover treatments respectively maize plants grew rapidly in the jointing stage and maintained the height in the tasseling milking and maturity stages plant growth had no distinct difference in the seedling stage 50 d after sowing for different organic amendment treatments the addition of compost and maize stover improved plant growth starting from the jointing stage compared with the control in comparison of different compost treatments the plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost obtained the best plants growth properties with the largest plant height stem diameter and lai in maize stover amended plots the addition of decomposing agents did not impact the stem diameter but improved the plant height and lai fig 7 illustrates dry aboveground biomass and its components in the organs for different treatments obtained in late maturity stage generally compost and maize stover incorporation improved aboveground biomass in most cases but dry aboveground biomass non monotonically varied with the application rate of compost the treatment of 4 and 6 t ha 1 compost obtained the highest aboveground biomass per plant in both experimental years over or deficit incorporation of compost had no significant difference in aboveground biomass compared with the control among maize stover treatments the addition of decomposing agents slightly increased aboveground biomass the plots amended with maize stover and bacillus subtilis obtained the highest aboveground biomass for all compost and maize stover treatments biomass proportions in different organs were not evidently influenced compared with the control 3 4 impact of organic amendments on maize yield and productivity grain yield and yield components of maize under different organic amendment treatments are presented in table 4 the incorporation of compost did not always improve grain yield the highest grain yield 16 1 and 12 1 t ha 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively was obtained in the plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost in both experimental years deficient and over application 2 and 10 t ha 1 of compost in the first experimental year even slightly reduced grain yield compared with the control but the reduction did not have a statistical significance however grain yield increased in the second experimental for all compost treatments even though the increase in the plots amended with 2 and 10 t ha 1 compost was not significant as well the yield components including ear length and diameter kernel per ear and 100 kernel weight improved in the plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost compared with the control in both experimental years the incorporation of maize stover alone did not improve grain yield in the first experimental year but promoted grain yield significantly in the second experimental year the addition of decomposing agent in maize stover treatments significantly improved grain yield in both experimental years grain yield in the plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost was clearly higher than that with 6 t ha 1 maize stover alone however grain yield in the plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost had no significant difference to that with 6 t ha 1 maize stover in combination with decomposing agent it noted that grain yield had an evident difference between two experimental years the large difference was attributed to several factors i the change of maize cultivar ii decrease in rainfall in the growing season table 2 iii spider mite damage and iv soil compaction by the machinery due to the engineering construction in 2021 table 5 shows actual evapotranspiration of maize crop water productivity in terms of evapotranspiration cwpet and irrigation depth cwpirrig and partial factor productivity of nitrogen pfpn for different compost and maize stover treatments actual evapotranspiration of maize in the control was around 590 and 480 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively the incorporation of compost slightly increased actual evapotranspiration in most cases but the increase did not show statistically significant the incorporation of maize stover had no significant impact on actual evapotranspiration regardless of decomposing agent thus crop water productivity in terms of evapotranspiration was mainly determined by the yield the plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost had the highest yield thus having the highest cwpet 2 7 and 2 5 kg m 3 in 2020 and 2021 respectively in the maize stover treatments the plots amended with maize stover combined with bacillus subtilis had the largest yield and cwpet 2 9 and 2 6 kg m 3 in 2020 and 2021 respectively in comparison with the organic amendment types the plots amended with maize stover combined with bacillus subtilis had slightly higher cwpet than those with same amount of compost 6 t ha 1 the variation in cwpirrig and pfpn were consistent with that of grain yield since irrigation and fertilization regimes were the same for all treatments thus the plots obtained the highest yield had the highest cwpirrig and pfpn 4 discussion 4 1 effects of organic amendment incorporation on soil physical and chemical properties soil physical and chemical properties play an important role in determining suitability for agricultural use bulk density is an important parameter of soil physical properties which is affected by texture structure organic matter content and the degree of compaction etc in the two year field study the incorporation of compost and maize stover significantly reduced soil bulk density table 3 however the reduction in bulk density non monotonically varied with the application rate of compost the reduction in bulk density was simply attributed to the lower density of compost and maize stover the decrease in bulk density is essential for agricultural soil and water management as seed germination penetration of roots movement retention and availability of water and nutrients to plants and flow of heat and air are directly associated with the bulk density in particular for the study area root zone soil had relatively high bulk density 1 53 g cm 3 before the experiments in some areas even higher than 1 65 g cm 3 due of soil paedogenesis surface irrigation and tillage practices thus seed germination and crop yield were negatively affected in order to promote the emergence rate local farmers sometimes covered the seeds with sand after sowing which was labor consuming the experimental results demonstrated that emergence rate of maize significantly increased after two year consecutive incorporation of either compost or maize stover fig 5 som is important to improve soil fertility ameliorate soil structure and maintain crop production dong et al 2021 lal 2004 som evidently increased after incorporation of compost and maize stover since they had higher organic carbon content table 1 organic matter content of the tested compost was around 391 7 g kg 1 and of maize stover was around 614 5 g kg 1 which was 25 and 40 folds of that in the soil 15 2 g kg 1 residual som after two consecutive growing seasons increased linearly with the application rate of compost som in compost amended plots was slightly higher than that in maize stover amended plots at the same application rate this may be attributed to high carbon availability of maize stover and alkaline nature of experimental soil resulting in faster carbon mineralization and decreased organic carbon khalil et al 2005 siedt et al 2021 organic amendment incorporation may stabilize soil carbon by soil microbial communities wang et al 2015 and the stabilized nutrient may become available to plants in the subsequent microbial turnover zhang et al 2015 the addition of organic amendment is a key factor that influences soil aggregation and aggregation in turn plays a crucial role in protecting soil organic matter from decomposition the mean weight diameter is the most widely used index in relating aggregate size to stability the addition of organic amendment resulted in an evident increase in the mean weight diameter and the proportion of macroaggregate diameter 0 25 mm compared with the control fig 2 these results are consistent with previous studies by bandyopadhyay et al 2010 hernandez et al 2017 xu et al 2015 higher mwd indicates the dominance of less erodible larger aggregates in the soil and therefore greater aggregate stability rabot et al 2018 organic amendment affected soil aggregation directly by acting as a binding agent among soil particles or indirectly by increasing soil organic carbon content which subsequently influences soil aggregation the increased som content resulted in improved cohesion of organic matter and soil clay minerals which promote the formation of aggregate mainuri and owino 2013 the different organic binding agents have different effects on soil aggregation organic binding agents can be classified into three different types i e transient temporary and persistent depending on the age and degree of som degradation tisdall and oades 1982 the addition of well decomposed material leads to a slow and more steady increase in aggregation sarker et al 2022 proposed to use maximum relative effect the value in the organic amendment treatment divided by that in the unamended control to evaluate the effects of organic amendment on aggregate stability the maximum relative effect below or equal to 1 00 was consider no effect between 1 00 and 1 30 was weak between 1 31 and 2 00 was strong and above 2 00 was very strong effects the maximum relative effect was around 1 27 2 07 for compost and 1 10 for maize stover sarker et al 2022 it indicated that the effect varied from weak to very strong for the compost because of the quality of compost varied widely and was week for maize stover the larger mwd of compost amended soil than the same amount of maize stover amended soil was consistent with maximum relative effect evaluation the mwd and pad varied non monotonically with the application rate of compost implied that deficit or over application of compost would not obtain the optimal aggregate structure the incorporation of organic amendments improved soil aggregation and altered soil structure thus changed soil hydraulic properties saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil amended with compost and maize stover increased obviously due to decrease in bulk density and increase in aggregate stability table 3 in general soils with smaller bulk density exhibited larger macro porosity spaans et al 1989 the application of compost and maize stover has the potential to increase the number size and connectivity of the pores dong et al 2021 in addition saturated hydraulic conductivity was also affected by soil aggregates size soil amended with organic amendments had larger soil aggregate size thus improved saturated hydraulic conductivity these results are consistent with previous studies mahmoodabadi and sajjadi 2016 mangalassery et al 2013 the increased hydraulic conductivity may improve the flow and transport of water fertilizer and gases through the soil profile which is important for plant growth ferreras et al 2006 marinari et al 2000 yazdanpanah et al 2011 in particular in arid area leaching salt out of root zone is also essential for crop production 4 2 plant growth responses to organic amendment incorporation incorporation of organic amendment alters soil aggregation thus influencing soil water and nutrient statuses and plant growth macroaggregates provide protection to organic matter and contain the majority of available nutrient content tian et al 2022 soil aggregate stability is associated with soil water and nutrient condition soil with better aggregate stability can accumulate sufficient available water and nutrient generally in the macroaggregates resulting in the promoted crop productivity garland et al 2018 plante et al 2002 six et al 2000 tian et al 2022 zhang et al 2016 the addition of compost decreased soil bulk density and increased field capacity reflecting the improved soil pore characters thus improving water holding capacity yang et al 2011 the relatively lower soil wetness in plots amended with 6 t ha 1 compost might be that maize uptake more soil water because of better crop growth bandyopadhyay et al 2010 as soil moisture in root zone was the balance among irrigation evaporation root uptake and percolation into deeper layers the addition of organic amendments is an effective way to improve soil available nitrogen content soil microbes decompose organic nitrogen from compost and maize stover for their growth and activities and convert organic nitrogen to inorganic nitrogen through mineralization omar et al 2020 thus the quantity of organic matter and nitrogen from organic amendments plays an important role in soil available nitrogen compost and maize stover had abundant organic matter and nitrogen which provided enough substrate for nitrogen mineralization thus improved available nitrogen table 1 manure compost was found have an important effect on soil processes such as protein and amino acid processing rate and resulted in the steady and slow mineralization of nitrogen habteselassie et al 2006 he et al 1999 ma et al 2020 thus the application of compost promoted organic nitrogen mineralization improved soil nitrogen nh4 and no3 production and assimilation and resulted in a sustained nitrogen supply to crops ma et al 2020 omar et al 2020 in addition the relatively lower c n of compost 11 1 may also contribute to higher available content since compost with c n ranging from 10 to 15 results in mineralization tejada et al 2009 although trinsoutrot et al 2000 reported that only crop residues with c n lower than 24 resulted in a higher mineral nitrogen and the tested maize stover has higher c n ratio 48 6 larger available nitrogen content was still found in plots added maize stover with the decomposing agent fig 4 it may be attributed to high nitrogen availability of maize stover and relatively lower c n 25 7 of soil characterized by slower nitrogen immobilization and surplus of available nitrogen siedt et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 similarly soil nitrogen availability was also found increase in soil amended with high c n 63 of rice straw organic amendment by zhou et al 2020 the addition of decomposing agent favored maize stover decomposition and mineralization thus soil amended with maize stover combined with decomposing agent has higher available nitrogen soil available nitrogen may also be indirectly influenced by soil physical properties the addition of compost and maize stover resulted in decreased bulk density which reflected a decreased mechanical impedance and increased oxygen availability bingham and bengough 2003 czyz 2004 decreased mechanical impedance and increased oxygen availability reduced nitrogen loss by reducing denitrification proper application of organic amendments together with inorganic fertilizer increased soil nitrogen availability resulted in better plant growth increase in maize biomass cumulation and directly improved maize yield omar et al 2020 zakirullah and khalil 2010 improvment of soil physical chemical properties may also promote nutrient aviliabllity and crop nutrient uptake therefore combined use of organic amendments and fertilizer resulted in a build up of nitrogen and obviously improved pfpn in the plots amended with 4 and 6 t ha 1 compost and maize stover with decomposing agent treatments since irrigation and fertilization regimes were the same for all the treatments plots with higher yield and pfpn also had higher cwpirrig incorporation of 4 and 6 t ha 1 compost and maize stover with decomposing agents obviously improved cwpet in two experimental years similar results were also reported by hati et al 2006 and bandyopadhyay et al 2010 the addition of organic amendment decreased bulk density and increased soil porosity aggregate stability and hydraulic conductivity resulting in larger soil water retention capacity better soil structure and better plant root growth gaiotti et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 crop roots uptake water and nutrient efficiently in organic material amended soils which improved cwpet lima et al 2009 seghatoleslami et al 2014 4 3 proper application strategy of different organic amendments crop water productivity is an indicator for quantifying the impact of irrigation scheduling decisions with regard to water management compost application has a synthetic effect on grain yield crop water productivity and partial factor productivity for nitrogen optimal compost application strategies are usually proposed that consider integrating these elements grain yield water productivity and partial factor productivity for nitrogen versus the application rate of compost showed a quadratic relationship fig 8 the vertexes of fitting curves illustrated that optimal application rate of the compost ranged from 5 08 to 5 78 t ha 1 in 2020 and ranged from 4 75 to 5 61 t ha 1 in 2021 for different maize stover treatments the highest yield and water nitrogen productivity were detected in the plots amended with the decomposing agent in 2020 and 2021 table 5 therefore a proper organic amendment application strategy can be proposed i e amended with 5 6 t ha 1 sheep manure compost or 6 t ha 1 maize stover combined with bacillus subtilis for loamy soil under arid conditions however these findings are based on field implementation of organic amendments for two growing seasons the long term effects of different organic amendments under arid condition and application pattern consecutive or intermittent incorporation are still ongoing research 5 conclusion two year field experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of sheep manure compost and maize stover on maize zea mays l growth yield and water fertilizer productivity under arid conditions the application of organic amendments improved soil aggregation and physical chemical properties in two year experiments soil physical properties varied non monotonically with the application rate of compost and soil organic matter content increased linearly with the compost application rate the addition of decomposing agents bacillus subtilis and trichoderma harzianum did not evidently influence soil physical and chemical properties the addition of compost and maize stover improved plant growth starting from the jointing stage compared with the control the incorporation of compost did not always improve the grain yield deficient and over application of the compost did not alter grain yield significantly the addition of bacillus subtilis and trichoderma harzianum did not impact maize stem diameter but promoted plant height lai and aboveground biomass in maize stover incorporations the variation in water and fertilizer are consistent with that of grain yield since irrigation and fertilization regimes were the same for all the treatments the appropriate application rate of sheep manure compost is 5 6 t ha 1 for the loam soil under arid conditions with consideration of the effects on soil properties maize yield and water fertilizer productivity the application of 6 t ha 1 maize stover in combination with bacillus subtilis has also good effect on the maize production the long term effects of these organic amendments under either consecutive or intermittent incorporation is still desirable declaration of

irrigation 1 introduction there is an expectation that climate change will bring increased frequency of extreme weather events around the globe with unusually high rainfall events leading to floods and low precipitation higher temperatures and higher potential et resulting in longer harder and more frequent droughts and larger magnitude water scarcity evidence of the impact of climate change on drought is found worldwide for instance the usa has experienced an increase in moderate to severe levels of drought particularly in the southwest with a megadrought in southwestern north america extending from 2000 to 2021 and comprising the driest 22 year period in 12 centuries williams et al 2022 the most notable recent drought in the usa from a public awareness perspective due to its impact on agricultural productivity was the california drought of 2011 2016 this caused drastic reductions in irrigation water allocations to farmers in the agriculturally productive san joaquin valley and heightened water conservation measures in urban areas which resulted in continuing the progressive shift from flood and sprinkler irrigated low cash crops to micro irrigated high cash crops including nuts and fruits e g tindula et al 2013 taylor and zilberman 2017 this shift was encouraged and supported by provision of federal and state financial incentives to growers such as the environmental quality incentives program eqip and state water efficiency enhancement program sweep other recent worldwide droughts include a one in a thousand year drought in australia e g lower portion of the murray darling river basin which began in 1995 continuing until 2009 spain s drought in catalonia northern india s drought in the first decade of the new millennium and droughts in northern china syria and southeastern brazil even though there is no short term extreme weather event that can be conclusively attributed to climate change there is a statistical record of these events showing that they clearly occur with increased frequency and or intensity dai 2011 it can be expected that as droughts increase in intensity and frequency in highly productive arid and semi arid agricultural areas there will be a shift to micro irrigation systems as a means of coping with water scarcity e g food and agriculture organization fao 2012 2017 as has been the case in california s san joaquin valley in addition climate change is globally impacting soil salinity accumulation with some of the greatest potential detrimental impacts occurring in water scarce agricultural areas such as california s san joaquin valley corwin 2021 the accumulation of soil salinity can result in reduced plant growth reduced yields and in severe cases crop failure by reducing the osmotic potential making it more difficult for the plant to extract water salinity may also cause specific ion toxicity e g na ion toxicity or upset the nutritional balance of plants furthermore the salt composition of soil water influences the composition of cations on the exchange complex of soil particles which influences soil permeability and tilth an inflation adjusted cost of salt induced land degradation was estimated at 441 usd ha 1 resulting in an estimated global economic loss of 27 3 billion usd for 2013 qadir et al 2014 welle and mauter 2017 estimated an income loss due to salinity within california alone at 3 7 billion usd for 2014 the ability to spatially assess soil salinity will become an even greater concern in the future than it already is today micro irrigation systems such as drip irrigation produce complex local scale i e 3 m2 and field scale 3 km2 soil salinity patterns research by burt and isbell 2005 hanson and may 2011 and jadoon et al 2015 2017 shows the complex patterns of local scale soil salinity leaching under drip irrigation soil salinity patterns emanate from each dripper and follow the water flow and water content patterns illustrated in fig 1 at each drip emitter a gradation of soil salinity radiates outward fig 1b and downward through the soil profile fig 1d resulting in a complex 3 dimensional distribution of salinity across a field under drip irrigation mapping these complex salinity patterns at field scale is a formidable challenge currently the most common method of mapping salinity at field i e 3 km2 and landscape i e 3 10 km2 scales is geospatial measurements of apparent soil electrical conductivity eca apparent soil electrical conductivity is a measure of the electrical conductivity of the bulk soil it measures anything conductive in the soil geospatial eca measurements are particularly well suited for establishing within field spatial variability of not only soil salinity but a range of soil properties e g water content texture organic matter and bulk density because they are quick and dependable measurements that integrate the influence of several soil properties contributing to the electrical conductance of the bulk soil corwin and leach 2005a at present no other measurement provides a greater level of spatial soil information than that of geospatial measurements of eca when used to direct soil sampling corwin and leach 2005a the characterization of spatial variability using geospatial eca measurements is based on the hypothesis that spatial eca information can be used to develop a directed soil sampling plan that identifies sites that adequately reflect the range and variability of soil salinity and or other soil properties correlated with eca at the study site corwin and lesch 2003 2005b maps of eca variability provide the spatial information to direct the selection of soil sample sites to characterize the spatial variability of those soil properties correlated either for direct or indirect reasons to eca in essence eca serves as a surrogate to map those properties that correlate with eca at that particular field site this is referred to as ec a directed soil sampling this hypothesis has repeatedly held true for a variety of agricultural applications lesch et al 1992 2005 johnson et al 2001 corwin and lesch 2003 2005b 2005c corwin et al 2003a 2003b corwin 2005 current field scale eca directed soil sampling protocols and guidelines which were developed by corwin and lesch 2005b 2013 and have been reviewed and summarized by corwin and scudiero 2020 were devised for natural precipitation and flood and sprinkler irrigation systems where local scale variation in soil salinity is less complex since water infiltrating across the soil surface is relatively uniform in comparison to micro irrigation systems these eca directed soil sampling protocols and guidelines may be inadequate for mapping the complex local scale 3 dimensional nature of salinity resulting from micro irrigation systems i e drip buried drip micro sprinklers etc when following the current eca directed soil sampling protocols of corwin and lesch 2013 to map field scale soil salinity for a field under drip irrigation a single soil core is taken at the location of a drip emitter for selected locations within the field determined from model e g response surface sample design or design based e g stratified random sampling sample designs based on the spatial variability of eca measurements the soil sample is in the sweet spot i e location where the salinity is leached the most and is the lowest which is not representative of the 1 2 m3 volume of measurement of the electromagnetic conductivity meter i e geonics em38 used to measure eca fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the induced electromagnetic field encompasses the full salinity gradient created by the drip emitter resulting in eca measurements i e measurement of eca in the horizontal coil configuration emh and in the vertical coil configuration emv that are not representative of the salinity in the soil core taken directly below the drip emitter subsequently the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract ece obtained from the soil core sample which is the customary quantitative measure of soil salinity is not representative resulting in an erroneous eca to ece calibration to map soil salinity accurately for fields under drip irrigation a modified set of protocols is likely needed that considers the complex local scale variability in salinity accurate eca ece calibrations are essential since hard data from soil cores is not sufficient to map salinity on drip irrigated fields with sufficient spatial accuracy to be meaningful due to the high level of local scale variability in salinity the interpolation of salinity from only soil core samples is insufficient even if 100 or more soil cores are taken rather soft data consisting of thousands of geospatial eca measurements that are converted to ece through a calibration are needed to characterize the complex local and field scale salinity patterns maps with this level of complexity will reveal the local and field scale salinity patterns that are needed for site specific irrigation management to control soil salinity site specific irrigation management of drip irrigation systems provides the level of water management that will be essential in water scarce agricultural areas that are expected to suffer longer and harsher periods of drought due to climate change it is hypothesized that the abrupt local scale changes in soil salinity that occur under drip irrigation will detrimentally impact the ability to calibrate eca to ece for a field scale eca survey the objective of this paper is to evaluate the impact of local scale changes in soil salinity under drip irrigation upon the calibration of eca to ece when using the current eca directed soil sampling protocols summarized by corwin and scudiero 2020 to map field scale soil salinity if current protocols are inadequate then modifications to the current eca directed soil sampling protocols are proposed based on an analysis of the local scale variation in soil salinity the modified eca directed soil sampling protocols will provide improved eca to ece calibrations for micro irrigation systems that will better map local scale soil salinity at and near drip lines providing detailed micro irrigation management information for salinity control within the root zone 2 materials and methods a two phased approach was used at the flores farm pistachio orchard near lemoore ca 1 to determine the influence of local scale changes in soil salinity under drip irrigation upon the eca ece calibration and 2 to establish the modifications in the eca directed soil sampling protocols needed to improve the calibration the approach for evaluating the impact of local scale variation in soil salinity under a drip irrigation system upon the eca ece calibration involved taking a variety of soil cores to establish the best soil core or combination of cores that results in the most robust eca ece calibration from this information modifications were made to the current protocols and guidelines developed by corwin and lesch 2013 to specifically address eca surveys of fields under micro irrigation 2 1 site description a pistachio orchard on flores farm located near lemoore ca 36 3008º n 119 7829º w elevation of 72 m above sea level in kings county was selected as the study site fig 3 flores pistachio orchard resides in the southern region of california s san joaquin valley which has a mediterranean climate with rainfall occurring primarily during winter months november through february the orchard consists of pistachio trees of kerman cultivar grafted onto pioneer gold 1 pg1 rootstock and is drip irrigated with dual drip lines site selection was based on obtaining an orchard that contained mature trees with well developed root systems under drip irrigation for a decade or more which would result in a spatial distribution of soil salinity within the root zone resembling that of fig 1 the flores farm pistachio orchard a 57 ha block has mature trees planted during the late 1980s at a 5 m x 5 m spacing on a lethent clay loam soil the micro irrigation system consists of dual drip lines with eight netafim triton x pressure compensating drippers per tree with nominal flowrate of 1 9 l h 1 the actual system application rate is 0 43 mm h 1 with average emitters flowrate of 1 4 l h 1 the irrigation water applied by the grower was measured and recorded using magnetic flowmeters sensus ipearl raleigh nc usa irrigation water was applied every 2 3 days on average and about 250 400 mm was applied for the growing season part of this water was applied before leaf out to refill the soil profile and part was applied from leaf out to meet the et and leaching requirements during that period soil moisture was monitored by means of granular matrix moisture tension sensors watermark irrometer company inc riverside ca usa installed at the depths of 0 40 m 0 90 m and 1 20 m the farm manager scheduled irrigation based on a combination of et and soil moisture and maintained the moisture tension in the root zone consistently above 50 kpa two subsections within the flores pistachio orchard designated d01 and d05 were selected to provide a range of soil salinities and sodic conditions subsection d01 was 230 m x 200 m and d05 was 200 m x 200 m preliminary data collected from an eca directed soil sampling of the flores orchard indicated that subsection d01 ranged in salinity i e ece from 2 to 13 3 ds m 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar from 7 to 43 and phe from 7 4 to 7 8 subsection d05 ranged in salinity i e ece from 2 to 13 ds m 1 sar from 3 to 40 and phe from 7 4 to 7 8 the ranges and standard deviations of ece and sar for d01 and d05 indicate that there was variation in salinity and sodium levels for both subsections 2 2 eca directed soil sampling survey the field scale distribution of soil salinity was assessed following the eca directed soil sampling protocols and guidelines of corwin and lesch 2003 2005b 2013 and summarized by corwin and scudiero 2020 all measurements of eca were taken using a geonics 1 1 all references to commercial equipment and instrumentation are provided solely for the benefit of the reader and do not imply the endorsement of the usda ars dual dipole em38 electromagnetic conductivity meter geonics limited mississauga ontario canada eca surveys were conducted using a mobile cart pulled by hand with the electromagnetic induction emi and coupled gps equipment secured to the cart ten equally spaced traverses 20 m apart were taken with the electromagnetic conductivity meter within each of the flores d01 and d05 sites along each traverse eca measurements were taken every 3 5 m measurements of eca were taken in the horizontal emh and vertical emv dipole modes to provide shallow 0 0 75 m and deep 0 1 5 m measurements of eca respectively the eca measurement locations were georeferenced with sub meter accuracy using a trimble1 pro xrs gps system trimble sunnyvale ca usa flores d01 and d05 were surveyed in march 2018 the eca surveys of emv and emh for flores d01 and d05 are provided in fig 4 2 3 soil sampling design using the eca survey data and esap software lesch et al 2000 12 initial soil core sampling locations were selected at each site i e flores d01 and flores d05 to represent the frequency distribution of the bivariate emi survey data for each site and to be allocated across each site to avoid spatial clustering fig 4a b soil cores were taken in the days following the eca surveys the initial 12 soil core locations 24 soil core locations total taken within each of the flores sites d01 and d05 were used to characterize the field scale variation in soil properties and to determine the robustness of the eca directed soil sampling protocols in developing a reliable eca ece calibration at each site soil samples at the 12 locations in d01 and 12 locations in d05 were taken at 0 3 m depth increments i e 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 0 6 0 9 0 9 1 2 and 1 2 1 5 m to a depth of 1 5 m resulting in 60 core samples at each site 120 total samples the soil cores were taken at the drip line near the tree trunk additional soil cores were taken at 6 of the 12 locations within both d01 and d05 see circled locations in fig 4 which were used to characterize local scale variation and to determine the best soil core location or combination of soil core locations to produce the most reliable eca ece calibration the additional soil cores consisted of cores taken at 0 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 5 m perpendicular to the drip line at 0 3 m depth increments down to 1 5 m these 6 soil core positions at and perpendicular to the drip line are designated as l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 corresponding to the distances of 0 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 5 m perpendicular to the drip line respectively fig 5 all soil cores were kept in refrigerated storage prior to air drying and sieving 2 mm sieve which occurred within a few days after their collection soil samples were analyzed for ece sp sar gravimetric water content at field capacity θg and phe following the chemical analysis procedures presented in methods of soil analysis sparks 1996 the decision to sample out to 1 5 m perpendicular to the drip line from the tree is based on an accepted rule of thumb that the radius of the root system for a tree crop is approximately equal to the radius of the canopy the average radius of the pistachio canopy in d01 and d05 was approximately 1 5 m the decision to sample to a depth of 1 5 m is based on the depth of measurement of the em38 which is approximately 1 5 m the soil core sample design resulted in 180 soil core samples for d01 and 180 for d05 i e 6 locations x 6 positions perpendicular to the drip line x 5 depth increments 180 this intensive soil sampling also provided a means of estimating the volume of measurement of both the emh and emv coil configurations by determining the collection of soil samples whose combined ece best correlated with emh eca and emv eca 3 results and discussion maps of sp and ece for the top 0 1 5 m of soil for d01 and d05 are shown in fig 6a and 6b respectively these maps show the field scale variation in these soil properties at the drip lines since the soil samples were taken only in the drip line at all 12 locations within each subsection i e d01 and d05 the soil profiles below the drip lines reflect the lowest salinity levels and highest water contents which subsequently provide a biased optimistic view of the salinity affecting the pistachio yield the maps of fig 6 provide only general spatial trends in soil properties at field scale that are extremely biased and are most likely of extremely limited value from a salinity management perspective 3 1 analysis of soil profile salinity data to evaluate the influence of local scale salinity gradients resulting from drip irrigation on eca measurements with the em38 it was important to determine whether local scale salinity gradients like those depicted in fig 1 existed at the two selected sites i e d01 and d05 figs 7 and 8 show graphs of the salinity profiles for l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 for the flores d01 and flores d05 sites respectively where the ece is the average for a depth increment of the 6 intensively sampled locations for a given core figs 7 and 8 indicate that a local scale gradient of salinity exists within the root zone across both d01 and d05 due to a decade or more of drip irrigation at both sites the general trend is for soil salinity to increase as the distance increases from the drip line and for salinity to increase with depth these figures provide a realistic view of the local scale root zone salinity affecting pistachio yield at d01 and d05 calculation of the average absolute difference aad between the average salinity profile and each of the salinity profiles for positions l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 provides a means of determining which of the soil cores comes closest to the average salinity profile of the 6 soil cores i e l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 the average absolute difference is shown in eq 1 1 aad l p 1 n i 1 n ec e n ec e l p n where p is 0 1 2 3 4 or 5 and corresponds to the positions where soil cores were taken at l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 respectively n is the depth increment i e n 1 is 0 0 3 m n 2 is 0 3 0 6 m n 3 is 0 6 0 9 m n 4 is 0 9 1 2 m and n 5 is 1 2 1 5 m ec e n is the average ece of l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 at depth n and ec e l n is the ece at depth n for position l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 or l5 the average soil profile salinity for d01 lies closest to l4 which is the soil core taken at 1 2 m from the drip line and for d05 lies closest to l2 taken at 0 6 m from the drip line ostensibly this suggests that taking a soil core between 0 6 and 1 2 m between l2 and l4 from the drip line provides a better representation of the average soil salinity than from below the drip line at l0 in both d01 and d05 the average soil profile salinity fell between l2 0 6 m and l4 1 2 m however the lowest aad occurs when l2 and l4 are averaged suggesting that the average salinity profile within the root zone of a pistachio tree in d01 and d05 might be estimated by averaging soil cores taken at positions l2 and l4 which are 0 6 m and 1 2 m respectively from the drip line under the tree canopy l2 and l4 correspond to approximately 40 and 80 of the radius of the canopy in d01 and d05 characterizing the average root zone salinity under drip irrigation may be useful in the calibration of eca to ece since eca measurements with the em38 encompass a sphere of measurement of approximately 1 2 m3 which comprises a substantial portion of the root system where salinity varies considerably both horizontally and vertically establishing the best location to take a soil core or combination of cores to characterize the corresponding volume of measurement of the em38 when drip irrigation has created significant gradients in salinity is a knowledge gap in current eca directed soil sampling protocols that needs to be filled however using eq 1 to determine where to take a soil core sample may be problematic because it assumes that the best reflection of the volume of measurement by the em38 is the average salinity profile which may or may not be true to better understand how the eca ece calibration benefits from a well positioned soil core sample or combination of coil samples simple correlations between eca both emh and emv and ece were calculated where ece was determined over various composite depths and composites of soil cores including l0 alone which is the soil core location recommended by the current protocols of corwin and lesch 2013 the highest correlation coefficient would reflect the soil core best to represent the volume of measurement of the em38 3 1 1 flores d01 site table 1 is a compilation of the correlation coefficients between emh eca and ece and between emv eca and ece for various composites of soil cores i e l0 l0 l1 l0 l1 l2 l0 l1 l2 l3 l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 the lowest correlation for d01 for both emh and emv predominantly occurred when ece was measured solely from soil core l0 at all composite depth increments the highest correlation for d01 for both emh and emv occurred when ece was measured for a composite of all 6 soil core positions i e l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 and averaged with correlation coefficients r of 0 72 for emh and 0 65 for emv the highest correlations occur for the composite depth of 0 1 2 m for emh and 0 1 5 m for emv which reflects the depth of penetration of emh and emv this suggests that a better measure of ece is obtained for the volume of measurement of eca by the em38 when all soil cores were combined providing a better average measurement of the salinity gradient across the instrument s volume of measurement theoretically the em38 has a depth of measurement for emh eca of 0 5 0 75 m and for the emv eca of 1 2 1 5 m which is the skin depth i e depth at which the em38 signal is attenuated by 1 e however as pointed out above one means of estimating the actual depth of measurement in the field is to determine the composite depth increment that results in the highest correlation coefficient corwin and lesch 2013 the actual depth of measurement may be different from the theoretical skin depth corwin and lesch 2013 there was also a correlation between eca and sp at d01 table 2 a correlation between eca and more than one edaphic property is common since eca is influenced by salinity water content bulk density and texture corwin and lesch 2003 2005b saturation percentage is a reflection of the soil texture high correlations were found between eca and sp for both emh eca and emv eca at all soil core composites i e l0 l0 l1 l0 l1 l2 l0 l1 l2 l3 l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 the high correlations for all soil core composites is expected since texture does not have high local scale variability as was the case in table 1 table 2 shows the highest correlation for the composite depth of 0 1 2 m for emh and 0 1 5 m for emv table 3 establishes the single core that best approximates the salinity gradients measured within the volume of measurement of the em38 the correlation coefficients for l3 and l4 soil cores corresponding to 0 9 and 1 2 m from the drip line are the highest and are similar in value at a composite depth of 0 0 9 m for emh eca r 0 79 and r 0 79 respectively and a composite depth of 0 1 5 m for emv eca r 0 78 and r 0 79 respectively table 4 shows the best combination of two soil cores that approximates the salinity gradients measured within the volume of measurement of the em38 the combination of soil cores l0 l5 have the highest correlation coefficients for both emh and emv r 0 77 and r 0 71 respectively not shown in table 4 is the high correlation coefficient of the combination of soil cores l3 l4 which had high correlation coefficients but not quite as high as l0 l5 the composite depth with the highest correlation coefficient was 0 0 9 m for emh and 0 1 5 m for emv for tables 1 4 the highest correlations between emh eca and ece were for composite soil cores of either 0 0 9 m or 0 1 2 depth suggesting the actual depth may be around 1 m which is somewhat surprising since the theoretical skin depth is 0 5 0 75 m however the actual depth of measurement of emh eca and emv eca may not always equal the theoretical skin depth as found by corwin and lesch 2013 3 1 2 flores d05 site table 5 indicates the highest correlation coefficient for d05 for both emh and emv occurred when ece was a composite of the 0 0 9 m soil core depth for emh and composite depth of 0 1 5 m for emv and all 6 soil core positions were combined i e l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 and averaged with correlation coefficients r of 0 79 for emh and 0 75 for emv table 5 similar to d01 strong correlations between eca and sp were found for all combinations of soil cores i e l0 l0 l1 l0 l1 l2 l0 l1 l2 l3 l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 for both emh and emv indicating the low local scale variability of soil texture table 6 the correlation of eca to ece using a single soil core worked best with the l4 core position 1 2 m from the drip line for d05 with r of 0 78 for emh and 0 79 for emv table 7 table 8 shows the best combination of two soil cores that approximates the salinity gradients measured within the volume of measurement of the em38 the combination of soil cores l0 l5 have the highest correlation coefficients for both emh and emv r 0 78 and r 0 74 respectively not shown in table 8 is the high correlation coefficient of the combination of soil cores l2 l4 which had comparable correlation coefficients of r 0 76 and r 0 77 respectively for emh and emv from tables 4 8 the depth of measurement was either 0 0 90 m or 0 1 2 m for emh and was consistently 0 1 5 m for emv 3 2 modified eca directed soil sampling survey protocols for drip irrigation the original eca directed soil sampling protocols for fields under drip irrigation by corwin and lesch 2013 were developed from a drip irrigated vineyard in northern california s napa valley simply stated the protocols recommended that two separate eca surveys should be conducted with one survey consisting of eca measurements taken every 3 5 m along the drip lines and the second survey taken between the drip lines i e the crop inter row using a model based sampling design i e esap by lesch et al 2000 based on the eca measurements 6 12 or more depending on the spatial variability of the eca measurements soil cores locations were selected for each of the two surveys in the case of the eca survey taken along the drip lines the soil cores were taken directly below the drip line which corresponds to l0 in tables 1 8 however in every instance for the salt affected pistachio orchard at flores farm l0 provided the lowest correlation with eca for d01 and d05 tables 1 and 5 respectively the failure of the corwin and lesch 2013 drip irrigation protocols for the flores pistachio orchard sites d01 and d05 is because the napa valley vineyard site did not have dramatic salinity gradients near the drip lines like those depicted in figs 7 and 8 for the flores pistachio orchard the napa valley vineyard was situated on a hillside with an impermeable clay layer located approximately 1 m below the soil surface the topography and impermeable layer resulted in an upslope recharge and a downslope discharge during the rainy months of the winter sufficient rainfall was received during the rainy season to leach most of the salts in the root zone downslope to catchment basins the salinity gradient that existed near the drip line was not as dramatic a gradient as found in well established drip irrigated fields of the san joaquin valley such as the flores pistachio orchard subsequently correlations between eca and ece at the napa valley site were high even though the soil cores associated with the drip line eca survey were taken directly below the drip line in the l0 position it is obvious from the data presented in tables 1and 5 that soil cores taken in the l0 position to develop an eca ece calibration for the drip line eca survey are problematic in cases where drip irrigation has occurred for more than a decade resulting in substantial lateral salinity gradients in these instances the data suggests that a single soil core should be taken at a location perpendicular to the drip line that is 60 80 of the canopy radius in summary the following modified eca directed soil sampling protocols for drip irrigation fields are recommended 1 conduct two separate eca surveys with one along the drip line and the other between the drip lines i e the crop inter row 2 using a model based sampling design select 6 12 soil core locations for each of the two eca data sets 3 for the drip line eca data set take the soil core samples at a location perpendicular to the drip line from the base of the plant trunk that is a distance of 0 6 0 8 times the radius of the tree canopy 4 if sufficient resources are available to take soil cores at two locations instead of one location then take the soil cores below the drip line and at the edge of the tree canopy note that two soil cores were not shown to provide an improvement in the eca ece calibration 5 take the soil core samples at 0 3 m increments to a depth of at least 1 2 m or preferably 1 5 m 6 if possible take soil bulk density samples at each depth increment for at least one of the 6 12 soil core sites 7 analyze soil cores for ece sp and water content 8 using the dppc module of esap lesch et al 2000 conduct a qa qc of the data to check the data s reliability and to remove spurious data and 9 develop an eca ece calibration following the guidelines of corwin and lesch 2003 2005b 2013 from model simulations with hydrus 2d bughici et al 2020 recommend an alternative to step 1 which is to take the geospatial eca measurements with the em38 and associated soil core samples at a distance from the drip line of 1 0 m rather than taking the measurements along the drip line this alternative would make the eca survey easier to take but it is not recommended at this time until sufficient field data can be collected to establish that it is as reliable and accurate as the proposed step 1 an eca ece calibration for d01 and d05 was developed using the general calibration equation form shown in eq 2 2 ec e em h ec a em v ec a x y ε where ec e is the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract ds m 1 em h ec a is the apparent soil electrical conductivity measured in the horizontal coil configuration with the em38 ds m 1 em v ec a is the apparent soil electrical conductivity measured in the vertical coil configuration with the em38 ds m 1 x is the x coordinate m y is the y coordinate m and ε is the error term the x and y coordinates in eq 2 account for field scale trends due to position in the field the calibration equations using the modified protocols i e core sample taken at the l4 position showed a marked improvement over the corwin and lesch 2013 protocols i e core sample taken at the l0 position calibration of eca to ece improved from r2 0 25 to r2 0 73 for site flores d01 and from r2 0 17 to r2 0 72 for site flores d05 4 summary and conclusions the local scale variability in soil salinity found near drip lines in fields that have been under drip irrigation for a decade or longer presents a challenge to mapping salinity with eca directed soil sampling because of the significant salinity gradients that occur both laterally and vertically from the drip line the challenge of mapping local scale variability under micro irrigation with eca directed soil sampling is confirmed by the results presented in tables 1 8 and points to the need for additional guidelines results indicate that the local scale 3 dimensional complexity of soil salinity patterns near drip lines adds another level of difficulty to the identification of soil core locations for calibrating eca to ece since the soil core or cores must be located at a position that reflects the overall salinity in the volume of measurement of the em38 instrument or electrical resistivity device the initial eca directed soil sampling protocols for drip irrigation by corwin and lesch 2013 were not developed for the dramatic local scale salinity gradients that occur near drip lines for fields that have been under drip irrigation for long time periods and do not receive sufficient precipitation to leach out salts that accumulate in patterns reflected in fig 1 this is confirmed by the data presented as shown by the l0 data of tables 1 and 5 the original protocols failed for this situation the empirical results of d01 and d05 indicate that the use of eq 1 to aid in locating the best position to take a soil core sample or combination of core samples is helpful but may not be sufficient eq 1 shows the core location to be between 0 6 and 1 2 m the empirical data shows that a single soil core taken at l3 or l4 which corresponds to 60 80 of the canopy radius i e 0 9 1 2 m is best for the crop mature pistachio orchard and soil conditions at flores farm if two soil cores are taken and composited then cores l0 l5 are best but do not necessarily provide better results than a single core composites of l3 l4 are also reasonably good it is dubious that the modified eca directed soil sampling protocols can be applied to other crops and soil conditions conducting this type of study for each drip irrigated crop and different soil conditions is impractical the use of 2 d solute transport models such as hydrus 2d provides a means of determining soil salinity distributions under drip irrigation to identify where soil cores are best taken the paper by bughici et al 2020 shows how this is accomplished the conclusion of bughici et al 2020 falls in line with the empirical findings of our paper bughici et al 2020 concluded that for a crop soil conditions and irrigation water quality like what occurred at flores pistachio orchard the distance from the drip line for em38 eca measurements and associated soil samples should be taken 1 0 m perpendicular to the drip line beneath the tree which matches closely with the 0 6 0 8 times the canopy radius or 0 9 1 2 m found herein however further research needs to be conducted to determine if geospatial measurements of eca taken parallel to the drip line at a distance of 0 6 0 8 times the canopy radius 0 9 1 2 m from the drip line or as bughici et al 2020 recommend at a distance 1 0 m from the drip line are viable alternatives to taking the geospatial measurements along the drip line in addition research needs to be conducted to validate the modeling approach for a variety of other drip irrigated crops soil conditions and irrigation water qualities maps of soil salinity are among the most valuable tools for irrigation management and salt leaching practices in water scarce agricultural areas such as california s san joaquin valley imperial valley and coachella valley the increased use of micro irrigation systems in water scarce agricultural areas to cope with climate change impacts causing more extreme drought conditions is a significant challenge to map soil salinity for managing these more water efficient irrigation systems the potential ramifications of creating soil salinity maps of drip irrigated fields that delineate accurate and reliable local and field scale soil salinity distributions within the root zone are greater crop productivity using

irrigation 1 introduction there is an expectation that climate change will bring increased frequency of extreme weather events around the globe with unusually high rainfall events leading to floods and low precipitation higher temperatures and higher potential et resulting in longer harder and more frequent droughts and larger magnitude water scarcity evidence of the impact of climate change on drought is found worldwide for instance the usa has experienced an increase in moderate to severe levels of drought particularly in the southwest with a megadrought in southwestern north america extending from 2000 to 2021 and comprising the driest 22 year period in 12 centuries williams et al 2022 the most notable recent drought in the usa from a public awareness perspective due to its impact on agricultural productivity was the california drought of 2011 2016 this caused drastic reductions in irrigation water allocations to farmers in the agriculturally productive san joaquin valley and heightened water conservation measures in urban areas which resulted in continuing the progressive shift from flood and sprinkler irrigated low cash crops to micro irrigated high cash crops including nuts and fruits e g tindula et al 2013 taylor and zilberman 2017 this shift was encouraged and supported by provision of federal and state financial incentives to growers such as the environmental quality incentives program eqip and state water efficiency enhancement program sweep other recent worldwide droughts include a one in a thousand year drought in australia e g lower portion of the murray darling river basin which began in 1995 continuing until 2009 spain s drought in catalonia northern india s drought in the first decade of the new millennium and droughts in northern china syria and southeastern brazil even though there is no short term extreme weather event that can be conclusively attributed to climate change there is a statistical record of these events showing that they clearly occur with increased frequency and or intensity dai 2011 it can be expected that as droughts increase in intensity and frequency in highly productive arid and semi arid agricultural areas there will be a shift to micro irrigation systems as a means of coping with water scarcity e g food and agriculture organization fao 2012 2017 as has been the case in california s san joaquin valley in addition climate change is globally impacting soil salinity accumulation with some of the greatest potential detrimental impacts occurring in water scarce agricultural areas such as california s san joaquin valley corwin 2021 the accumulation of soil salinity can result in reduced plant growth reduced yields and in severe cases crop failure by reducing the osmotic potential making it more difficult for the plant to extract water salinity may also cause specific ion toxicity e g na ion toxicity or upset the nutritional balance of plants furthermore the salt composition of soil water influences the composition of cations on the exchange complex of soil particles which influences soil permeability and tilth an inflation adjusted cost of salt induced land degradation was estimated at 441 usd ha 1 resulting in an estimated global economic loss of 27 3 billion usd for 2013 qadir et al 2014 welle and mauter 2017 estimated an income loss due to salinity within california alone at 3 7 billion usd for 2014 the ability to spatially assess soil salinity will become an even greater concern in the future than it already is today micro irrigation systems such as drip irrigation produce complex local scale i e 3 m2 and field scale 3 km2 soil salinity patterns research by burt and isbell 2005 hanson and may 2011 and jadoon et al 2015 2017 shows the complex patterns of local scale soil salinity leaching under drip irrigation soil salinity patterns emanate from each dripper and follow the water flow and water content patterns illustrated in fig 1 at each drip emitter a gradation of soil salinity radiates outward fig 1b and downward through the soil profile fig 1d resulting in a complex 3 dimensional distribution of salinity across a field under drip irrigation mapping these complex salinity patterns at field scale is a formidable challenge currently the most common method of mapping salinity at field i e 3 km2 and landscape i e 3 10 km2 scales is geospatial measurements of apparent soil electrical conductivity eca apparent soil electrical conductivity is a measure of the electrical conductivity of the bulk soil it measures anything conductive in the soil geospatial eca measurements are particularly well suited for establishing within field spatial variability of not only soil salinity but a range of soil properties e g water content texture organic matter and bulk density because they are quick and dependable measurements that integrate the influence of several soil properties contributing to the electrical conductance of the bulk soil corwin and leach 2005a at present no other measurement provides a greater level of spatial soil information than that of geospatial measurements of eca when used to direct soil sampling corwin and leach 2005a the characterization of spatial variability using geospatial eca measurements is based on the hypothesis that spatial eca information can be used to develop a directed soil sampling plan that identifies sites that adequately reflect the range and variability of soil salinity and or other soil properties correlated with eca at the study site corwin and lesch 2003 2005b maps of eca variability provide the spatial information to direct the selection of soil sample sites to characterize the spatial variability of those soil properties correlated either for direct or indirect reasons to eca in essence eca serves as a surrogate to map those properties that correlate with eca at that particular field site this is referred to as ec a directed soil sampling this hypothesis has repeatedly held true for a variety of agricultural applications lesch et al 1992 2005 johnson et al 2001 corwin and lesch 2003 2005b 2005c corwin et al 2003a 2003b corwin 2005 current field scale eca directed soil sampling protocols and guidelines which were developed by corwin and lesch 2005b 2013 and have been reviewed and summarized by corwin and scudiero 2020 were devised for natural precipitation and flood and sprinkler irrigation systems where local scale variation in soil salinity is less complex since water infiltrating across the soil surface is relatively uniform in comparison to micro irrigation systems these eca directed soil sampling protocols and guidelines may be inadequate for mapping the complex local scale 3 dimensional nature of salinity resulting from micro irrigation systems i e drip buried drip micro sprinklers etc when following the current eca directed soil sampling protocols of corwin and lesch 2013 to map field scale soil salinity for a field under drip irrigation a single soil core is taken at the location of a drip emitter for selected locations within the field determined from model e g response surface sample design or design based e g stratified random sampling sample designs based on the spatial variability of eca measurements the soil sample is in the sweet spot i e location where the salinity is leached the most and is the lowest which is not representative of the 1 2 m3 volume of measurement of the electromagnetic conductivity meter i e geonics em38 used to measure eca fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the induced electromagnetic field encompasses the full salinity gradient created by the drip emitter resulting in eca measurements i e measurement of eca in the horizontal coil configuration emh and in the vertical coil configuration emv that are not representative of the salinity in the soil core taken directly below the drip emitter subsequently the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract ece obtained from the soil core sample which is the customary quantitative measure of soil salinity is not representative resulting in an erroneous eca to ece calibration to map soil salinity accurately for fields under drip irrigation a modified set of protocols is likely needed that considers the complex local scale variability in salinity accurate eca ece calibrations are essential since hard data from soil cores is not sufficient to map salinity on drip irrigated fields with sufficient spatial accuracy to be meaningful due to the high level of local scale variability in salinity the interpolation of salinity from only soil core samples is insufficient even if 100 or more soil cores are taken rather soft data consisting of thousands of geospatial eca measurements that are converted to ece through a calibration are needed to characterize the complex local and field scale salinity patterns maps with this level of complexity will reveal the local and field scale salinity patterns that are needed for site specific irrigation management to control soil salinity site specific irrigation management of drip irrigation systems provides the level of water management that will be essential in water scarce agricultural areas that are expected to suffer longer and harsher periods of drought due to climate change it is hypothesized that the abrupt local scale changes in soil salinity that occur under drip irrigation will detrimentally impact the ability to calibrate eca to ece for a field scale eca survey the objective of this paper is to evaluate the impact of local scale changes in soil salinity under drip irrigation upon the calibration of eca to ece when using the current eca directed soil sampling protocols summarized by corwin and scudiero 2020 to map field scale soil salinity if current protocols are inadequate then modifications to the current eca directed soil sampling protocols are proposed based on an analysis of the local scale variation in soil salinity the modified eca directed soil sampling protocols will provide improved eca to ece calibrations for micro irrigation systems that will better map local scale soil salinity at and near drip lines providing detailed micro irrigation management information for salinity control within the root zone 2 materials and methods a two phased approach was used at the flores farm pistachio orchard near lemoore ca 1 to determine the influence of local scale changes in soil salinity under drip irrigation upon the eca ece calibration and 2 to establish the modifications in the eca directed soil sampling protocols needed to improve the calibration the approach for evaluating the impact of local scale variation in soil salinity under a drip irrigation system upon the eca ece calibration involved taking a variety of soil cores to establish the best soil core or combination of cores that results in the most robust eca ece calibration from this information modifications were made to the current protocols and guidelines developed by corwin and lesch 2013 to specifically address eca surveys of fields under micro irrigation 2 1 site description a pistachio orchard on flores farm located near lemoore ca 36 3008º n 119 7829º w elevation of 72 m above sea level in kings county was selected as the study site fig 3 flores pistachio orchard resides in the southern region of california s san joaquin valley which has a mediterranean climate with rainfall occurring primarily during winter months november through february the orchard consists of pistachio trees of kerman cultivar grafted onto pioneer gold 1 pg1 rootstock and is drip irrigated with dual drip lines site selection was based on obtaining an orchard that contained mature trees with well developed root systems under drip irrigation for a decade or more which would result in a spatial distribution of soil salinity within the root zone resembling that of fig 1 the flores farm pistachio orchard a 57 ha block has mature trees planted during the late 1980s at a 5 m x 5 m spacing on a lethent clay loam soil the micro irrigation system consists of dual drip lines with eight netafim triton x pressure compensating drippers per tree with nominal flowrate of 1 9 l h 1 the actual system application rate is 0 43 mm h 1 with average emitters flowrate of 1 4 l h 1 the irrigation water applied by the grower was measured and recorded using magnetic flowmeters sensus ipearl raleigh nc usa irrigation water was applied every 2 3 days on average and about 250 400 mm was applied for the growing season part of this water was applied before leaf out to refill the soil profile and part was applied from leaf out to meet the et and leaching requirements during that period soil moisture was monitored by means of granular matrix moisture tension sensors watermark irrometer company inc riverside ca usa installed at the depths of 0 40 m 0 90 m and 1 20 m the farm manager scheduled irrigation based on a combination of et and soil moisture and maintained the moisture tension in the root zone consistently above 50 kpa two subsections within the flores pistachio orchard designated d01 and d05 were selected to provide a range of soil salinities and sodic conditions subsection d01 was 230 m x 200 m and d05 was 200 m x 200 m preliminary data collected from an eca directed soil sampling of the flores orchard indicated that subsection d01 ranged in salinity i e ece from 2 to 13 3 ds m 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar from 7 to 43 and phe from 7 4 to 7 8 subsection d05 ranged in salinity i e ece from 2 to 13 ds m 1 sar from 3 to 40 and phe from 7 4 to 7 8 the ranges and standard deviations of ece and sar for d01 and d05 indicate that there was variation in salinity and sodium levels for both subsections 2 2 eca directed soil sampling survey the field scale distribution of soil salinity was assessed following the eca directed soil sampling protocols and guidelines of corwin and lesch 2003 2005b 2013 and summarized by corwin and scudiero 2020 all measurements of eca were taken using a geonics 1 1 all references to commercial equipment and instrumentation are provided solely for the benefit of the reader and do not imply the endorsement of the usda ars dual dipole em38 electromagnetic conductivity meter geonics limited mississauga ontario canada eca surveys were conducted using a mobile cart pulled by hand with the electromagnetic induction emi and coupled gps equipment secured to the cart ten equally spaced traverses 20 m apart were taken with the electromagnetic conductivity meter within each of the flores d01 and d05 sites along each traverse eca measurements were taken every 3 5 m measurements of eca were taken in the horizontal emh and vertical emv dipole modes to provide shallow 0 0 75 m and deep 0 1 5 m measurements of eca respectively the eca measurement locations were georeferenced with sub meter accuracy using a trimble1 pro xrs gps system trimble sunnyvale ca usa flores d01 and d05 were surveyed in march 2018 the eca surveys of emv and emh for flores d01 and d05 are provided in fig 4 2 3 soil sampling design using the eca survey data and esap software lesch et al 2000 12 initial soil core sampling locations were selected at each site i e flores d01 and flores d05 to represent the frequency distribution of the bivariate emi survey data for each site and to be allocated across each site to avoid spatial clustering fig 4a b soil cores were taken in the days following the eca surveys the initial 12 soil core locations 24 soil core locations total taken within each of the flores sites d01 and d05 were used to characterize the field scale variation in soil properties and to determine the robustness of the eca directed soil sampling protocols in developing a reliable eca ece calibration at each site soil samples at the 12 locations in d01 and 12 locations in d05 were taken at 0 3 m depth increments i e 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 0 6 0 9 0 9 1 2 and 1 2 1 5 m to a depth of 1 5 m resulting in 60 core samples at each site 120 total samples the soil cores were taken at the drip line near the tree trunk additional soil cores were taken at 6 of the 12 locations within both d01 and d05 see circled locations in fig 4 which were used to characterize local scale variation and to determine the best soil core location or combination of soil core locations to produce the most reliable eca ece calibration the additional soil cores consisted of cores taken at 0 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 5 m perpendicular to the drip line at 0 3 m depth increments down to 1 5 m these 6 soil core positions at and perpendicular to the drip line are designated as l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 corresponding to the distances of 0 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 5 m perpendicular to the drip line respectively fig 5 all soil cores were kept in refrigerated storage prior to air drying and sieving 2 mm sieve which occurred within a few days after their collection soil samples were analyzed for ece sp sar gravimetric water content at field capacity θg and phe following the chemical analysis procedures presented in methods of soil analysis sparks 1996 the decision to sample out to 1 5 m perpendicular to the drip line from the tree is based on an accepted rule of thumb that the radius of the root system for a tree crop is approximately equal to the radius of the canopy the average radius of the pistachio canopy in d01 and d05 was approximately 1 5 m the decision to sample to a depth of 1 5 m is based on the depth of measurement of the em38 which is approximately 1 5 m the soil core sample design resulted in 180 soil core samples for d01 and 180 for d05 i e 6 locations x 6 positions perpendicular to the drip line x 5 depth increments 180 this intensive soil sampling also provided a means of estimating the volume of measurement of both the emh and emv coil configurations by determining the collection of soil samples whose combined ece best correlated with emh eca and emv eca 3 results and discussion maps of sp and ece for the top 0 1 5 m of soil for d01 and d05 are shown in fig 6a and 6b respectively these maps show the field scale variation in these soil properties at the drip lines since the soil samples were taken only in the drip line at all 12 locations within each subsection i e d01 and d05 the soil profiles below the drip lines reflect the lowest salinity levels and highest water contents which subsequently provide a biased optimistic view of the salinity affecting the pistachio yield the maps of fig 6 provide only general spatial trends in soil properties at field scale that are extremely biased and are most likely of extremely limited value from a salinity management perspective 3 1 analysis of soil profile salinity data to evaluate the influence of local scale salinity gradients resulting from drip irrigation on eca measurements with the em38 it was important to determine whether local scale salinity gradients like those depicted in fig 1 existed at the two selected sites i e d01 and d05 figs 7 and 8 show graphs of the salinity profiles for l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 for the flores d01 and flores d05 sites respectively where the ece is the average for a depth increment of the 6 intensively sampled locations for a given core figs 7 and 8 indicate that a local scale gradient of salinity exists within the root zone across both d01 and d05 due to a decade or more of drip irrigation at both sites the general trend is for soil salinity to increase as the distance increases from the drip line and for salinity to increase with depth these figures provide a realistic view of the local scale root zone salinity affecting pistachio yield at d01 and d05 calculation of the average absolute difference aad between the average salinity profile and each of the salinity profiles for positions l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 provides a means of determining which of the soil cores comes closest to the average salinity profile of the 6 soil cores i e l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 the average absolute difference is shown in eq 1 1 aad l p 1 n i 1 n ec e n ec e l p n where p is 0 1 2 3 4 or 5 and corresponds to the positions where soil cores were taken at l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 respectively n is the depth increment i e n 1 is 0 0 3 m n 2 is 0 3 0 6 m n 3 is 0 6 0 9 m n 4 is 0 9 1 2 m and n 5 is 1 2 1 5 m ec e n is the average ece of l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 at depth n and ec e l n is the ece at depth n for position l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 or l5 the average soil profile salinity for d01 lies closest to l4 which is the soil core taken at 1 2 m from the drip line and for d05 lies closest to l2 taken at 0 6 m from the drip line ostensibly this suggests that taking a soil core between 0 6 and 1 2 m between l2 and l4 from the drip line provides a better representation of the average soil salinity than from below the drip line at l0 in both d01 and d05 the average soil profile salinity fell between l2 0 6 m and l4 1 2 m however the lowest aad occurs when l2 and l4 are averaged suggesting that the average salinity profile within the root zone of a pistachio tree in d01 and d05 might be estimated by averaging soil cores taken at positions l2 and l4 which are 0 6 m and 1 2 m respectively from the drip line under the tree canopy l2 and l4 correspond to approximately 40 and 80 of the radius of the canopy in d01 and d05 characterizing the average root zone salinity under drip irrigation may be useful in the calibration of eca to ece since eca measurements with the em38 encompass a sphere of measurement of approximately 1 2 m3 which comprises a substantial portion of the root system where salinity varies considerably both horizontally and vertically establishing the best location to take a soil core or combination of cores to characterize the corresponding volume of measurement of the em38 when drip irrigation has created significant gradients in salinity is a knowledge gap in current eca directed soil sampling protocols that needs to be filled however using eq 1 to determine where to take a soil core sample may be problematic because it assumes that the best reflection of the volume of measurement by the em38 is the average salinity profile which may or may not be true to better understand how the eca ece calibration benefits from a well positioned soil core sample or combination of coil samples simple correlations between eca both emh and emv and ece were calculated where ece was determined over various composite depths and composites of soil cores including l0 alone which is the soil core location recommended by the current protocols of corwin and lesch 2013 the highest correlation coefficient would reflect the soil core best to represent the volume of measurement of the em38 3 1 1 flores d01 site table 1 is a compilation of the correlation coefficients between emh eca and ece and between emv eca and ece for various composites of soil cores i e l0 l0 l1 l0 l1 l2 l0 l1 l2 l3 l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 the lowest correlation for d01 for both emh and emv predominantly occurred when ece was measured solely from soil core l0 at all composite depth increments the highest correlation for d01 for both emh and emv occurred when ece was measured for a composite of all 6 soil core positions i e l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 and averaged with correlation coefficients r of 0 72 for emh and 0 65 for emv the highest correlations occur for the composite depth of 0 1 2 m for emh and 0 1 5 m for emv which reflects the depth of penetration of emh and emv this suggests that a better measure of ece is obtained for the volume of measurement of eca by the em38 when all soil cores were combined providing a better average measurement of the salinity gradient across the instrument s volume of measurement theoretically the em38 has a depth of measurement for emh eca of 0 5 0 75 m and for the emv eca of 1 2 1 5 m which is the skin depth i e depth at which the em38 signal is attenuated by 1 e however as pointed out above one means of estimating the actual depth of measurement in the field is to determine the composite depth increment that results in the highest correlation coefficient corwin and lesch 2013 the actual depth of measurement may be different from the theoretical skin depth corwin and lesch 2013 there was also a correlation between eca and sp at d01 table 2 a correlation between eca and more than one edaphic property is common since eca is influenced by salinity water content bulk density and texture corwin and lesch 2003 2005b saturation percentage is a reflection of the soil texture high correlations were found between eca and sp for both emh eca and emv eca at all soil core composites i e l0 l0 l1 l0 l1 l2 l0 l1 l2 l3 l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 the high correlations for all soil core composites is expected since texture does not have high local scale variability as was the case in table 1 table 2 shows the highest correlation for the composite depth of 0 1 2 m for emh and 0 1 5 m for emv table 3 establishes the single core that best approximates the salinity gradients measured within the volume of measurement of the em38 the correlation coefficients for l3 and l4 soil cores corresponding to 0 9 and 1 2 m from the drip line are the highest and are similar in value at a composite depth of 0 0 9 m for emh eca r 0 79 and r 0 79 respectively and a composite depth of 0 1 5 m for emv eca r 0 78 and r 0 79 respectively table 4 shows the best combination of two soil cores that approximates the salinity gradients measured within the volume of measurement of the em38 the combination of soil cores l0 l5 have the highest correlation coefficients for both emh and emv r 0 77 and r 0 71 respectively not shown in table 4 is the high correlation coefficient of the combination of soil cores l3 l4 which had high correlation coefficients but not quite as high as l0 l5 the composite depth with the highest correlation coefficient was 0 0 9 m for emh and 0 1 5 m for emv for tables 1 4 the highest correlations between emh eca and ece were for composite soil cores of either 0 0 9 m or 0 1 2 depth suggesting the actual depth may be around 1 m which is somewhat surprising since the theoretical skin depth is 0 5 0 75 m however the actual depth of measurement of emh eca and emv eca may not always equal the theoretical skin depth as found by corwin and lesch 2013 3 1 2 flores d05 site table 5 indicates the highest correlation coefficient for d05 for both emh and emv occurred when ece was a composite of the 0 0 9 m soil core depth for emh and composite depth of 0 1 5 m for emv and all 6 soil core positions were combined i e l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 and averaged with correlation coefficients r of 0 79 for emh and 0 75 for emv table 5 similar to d01 strong correlations between eca and sp were found for all combinations of soil cores i e l0 l0 l1 l0 l1 l2 l0 l1 l2 l3 l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 and l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 for both emh and emv indicating the low local scale variability of soil texture table 6 the correlation of eca to ece using a single soil core worked best with the l4 core position 1 2 m from the drip line for d05 with r of 0 78 for emh and 0 79 for emv table 7 table 8 shows the best combination of two soil cores that approximates the salinity gradients measured within the volume of measurement of the em38 the combination of soil cores l0 l5 have the highest correlation coefficients for both emh and emv r 0 78 and r 0 74 respectively not shown in table 8 is the high correlation coefficient of the combination of soil cores l2 l4 which had comparable correlation coefficients of r 0 76 and r 0 77 respectively for emh and emv from tables 4 8 the depth of measurement was either 0 0 90 m or 0 1 2 m for emh and was consistently 0 1 5 m for emv 3 2 modified eca directed soil sampling survey protocols for drip irrigation the original eca directed soil sampling protocols for fields under drip irrigation by corwin and lesch 2013 were developed from a drip irrigated vineyard in northern california s napa valley simply stated the protocols recommended that two separate eca surveys should be conducted with one survey consisting of eca measurements taken every 3 5 m along the drip lines and the second survey taken between the drip lines i e the crop inter row using a model based sampling design i e esap by lesch et al 2000 based on the eca measurements 6 12 or more depending on the spatial variability of the eca measurements soil cores locations were selected for each of the two surveys in the case of the eca survey taken along the drip lines the soil cores were taken directly below the drip line which corresponds to l0 in tables 1 8 however in every instance for the salt affected pistachio orchard at flores farm l0 provided the lowest correlation with eca for d01 and d05 tables 1 and 5 respectively the failure of the corwin and lesch 2013 drip irrigation protocols for the flores pistachio orchard sites d01 and d05 is because the napa valley vineyard site did not have dramatic salinity gradients near the drip lines like those depicted in figs 7 and 8 for the flores pistachio orchard the napa valley vineyard was situated on a hillside with an impermeable clay layer located approximately 1 m below the soil surface the topography and impermeable layer resulted in an upslope recharge and a downslope discharge during the rainy months of the winter sufficient rainfall was received during the rainy season to leach most of the salts in the root zone downslope to catchment basins the salinity gradient that existed near the drip line was not as dramatic a gradient as found in well established drip irrigated fields of the san joaquin valley such as the flores pistachio orchard subsequently correlations between eca and ece at the napa valley site were high even though the soil cores associated with the drip line eca survey were taken directly below the drip line in the l0 position it is obvious from the data presented in tables 1and 5 that soil cores taken in the l0 position to develop an eca ece calibration for the drip line eca survey are problematic in cases where drip irrigation has occurred for more than a decade resulting in substantial lateral salinity gradients in these instances the data suggests that a single soil core should be taken at a location perpendicular to the drip line that is 60 80 of the canopy radius in summary the following modified eca directed soil sampling protocols for drip irrigation fields are recommended 1 conduct two separate eca surveys with one along the drip line and the other between the drip lines i e the crop inter row 2 using a model based sampling design select 6 12 soil core locations for each of the two eca data sets 3 for the drip line eca data set take the soil core samples at a location perpendicular to the drip line from the base of the plant trunk that is a distance of 0 6 0 8 times the radius of the tree canopy 4 if sufficient resources are available to take soil cores at two locations instead of one location then take the soil cores below the drip line and at the edge of the tree canopy note that two soil cores were not shown to provide an improvement in the eca ece calibration 5 take the soil core samples at 0 3 m increments to a depth of at least 1 2 m or preferably 1 5 m 6 if possible take soil bulk density samples at each depth increment for at least one of the 6 12 soil core sites 7 analyze soil cores for ece sp and water content 8 using the dppc module of esap lesch et al 2000 conduct a qa qc of the data to check the data s reliability and to remove spurious data and 9 develop an eca ece calibration following the guidelines of corwin and lesch 2003 2005b 2013 from model simulations with hydrus 2d bughici et al 2020 recommend an alternative to step 1 which is to take the geospatial eca measurements with the em38 and associated soil core samples at a distance from the drip line of 1 0 m rather than taking the measurements along the drip line this alternative would make the eca survey easier to take but it is not recommended at this time until sufficient field data can be collected to establish that it is as reliable and accurate as the proposed step 1 an eca ece calibration for d01 and d05 was developed using the general calibration equation form shown in eq 2 2 ec e em h ec a em v ec a x y ε where ec e is the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract ds m 1 em h ec a is the apparent soil electrical conductivity measured in the horizontal coil configuration with the em38 ds m 1 em v ec a is the apparent soil electrical conductivity measured in the vertical coil configuration with the em38 ds m 1 x is the x coordinate m y is the y coordinate m and ε is the error term the x and y coordinates in eq 2 account for field scale trends due to position in the field the calibration equations using the modified protocols i e core sample taken at the l4 position showed a marked improvement over the corwin and lesch 2013 protocols i e core sample taken at the l0 position calibration of eca to ece improved from r2 0 25 to r2 0 73 for site flores d01 and from r2 0 17 to r2 0 72 for site flores d05 4 summary and conclusions the local scale variability in soil salinity found near drip lines in fields that have been under drip irrigation for a decade or longer presents a challenge to mapping salinity with eca directed soil sampling because of the significant salinity gradients that occur both laterally and vertically from the drip line the challenge of mapping local scale variability under micro irrigation with eca directed soil sampling is confirmed by the results presented in tables 1 8 and points to the need for additional guidelines results indicate that the local scale 3 dimensional complexity of soil salinity patterns near drip lines adds another level of difficulty to the identification of soil core locations for calibrating eca to ece since the soil core or cores must be located at a position that reflects the overall salinity in the volume of measurement of the em38 instrument or electrical resistivity device the initial eca directed soil sampling protocols for drip irrigation by corwin and lesch 2013 were not developed for the dramatic local scale salinity gradients that occur near drip lines for fields that have been under drip irrigation for long time periods and do not receive sufficient precipitation to leach out salts that accumulate in patterns reflected in fig 1 this is confirmed by the data presented as shown by the l0 data of tables 1 and 5 the original protocols failed for this situation the empirical results of d01 and d05 indicate that the use of eq 1 to aid in locating the best position to take a soil core sample or combination of core samples is helpful but may not be sufficient eq 1 shows the core location to be between 0 6 and 1 2 m the empirical data shows that a single soil core taken at l3 or l4 which corresponds to 60 80 of the canopy radius i e 0 9 1 2 m is best for the crop mature pistachio orchard and soil conditions at flores farm if two soil cores are taken and composited then cores l0 l5 are best but do not necessarily provide better results than a single core composites of l3 l4 are also reasonably good it is dubious that the modified eca directed soil sampling protocols can be applied to other crops and soil conditions conducting this type of study for each drip irrigated crop and different soil conditions is impractical the use of 2 d solute transport models such as hydrus 2d provides a means of determining soil salinity distributions under drip irrigation to identify where soil cores are best taken the paper by bughici et al 2020 shows how this is accomplished the conclusion of bughici et al 2020 falls in line with the empirical findings of our paper bughici et al 2020 concluded that for a crop soil conditions and irrigation water quality like what occurred at flores pistachio orchard the distance from the drip line for em38 eca measurements and associated soil samples should be taken 1 0 m perpendicular to the drip line beneath the tree which matches closely with the 0 6 0 8 times the canopy radius or 0 9 1 2 m found herein however further research needs to be conducted to determine if geospatial measurements of eca taken parallel to the drip line at a distance of 0 6 0 8 times the canopy radius 0 9 1 2 m from the drip line or as bughici et al 2020 recommend at a distance 1 0 m from the drip line are viable alternatives to taking the geospatial measurements along the drip line in addition research needs to be conducted to validate the modeling approach for a variety of other drip irrigated crops soil conditions and irrigation water qualities maps of soil salinity are among the most valuable tools for irrigation management and salt leaching practices in water scarce agricultural areas such as california s san joaquin valley imperial valley and coachella valley the increased use of micro irrigation systems in water scarce agricultural areas to cope with climate change impacts causing more extreme drought conditions is a significant challenge to map soil salinity for managing these more water efficient irrigation systems the potential ramifications of creating soil salinity maps of drip irrigated fields that delineate accurate and reliable local and field scale soil salinity distributions within the root zone are greater crop productivity using

9454,the gnangara groundwater system is western australia s most important groundwater resource but it is being depleted although australia has been at the forefront of establishing water markets western australia has been slow to adopt legislation that would support trade in groundwater this study explores the impact of introducing groundwater trading within the horticulture sector for farms that extract water from the gnangara system we use a simulation optimization framework to evaluate market performance the model is based on detailed water allocation data obtained from the relevant water agency a farm optimization model was used to generate supply and demand functions for water at the individual farm level and the market clearing price for water was established via a uniform price double sided auction the level of water available for extraction was also varied the model considers unrestricted trading and trading within relatively small groundwater zones that limit the potential for local over extraction externalities the results show 1 substantial economic gains from allowing trading are possible 2 most of the gains from establishing a groundwater market can be realized from within zone trading only 3 industry consolidation follows the introduction of trading and 4 without zonal trading restrictions local over extraction externalities are present also with groundwater trading we find that reallocating water to the most efficient producers could reduce horticulture sector water extraction by 14 while maintaining the existing value of agricultural production in the area keywords australia cap and trade groundwater horticulture water market 1 introduction groundwater resources support complex ecosystems agricultural production and have been integrated into the potable water supply for cities due to low extraction costs and relatively high water quality many communities depend on groundwater birkenholtz 2015 for example groundwater accounts for about 50 of drinking water and 43 of irrigation water worldwide wheeler et al 2016 in australia 5000gl of groundwater is used per year providing almost one third of total drinking water and 70 of agricultural water harrington and cook 2014 groundwater contributes around aud38 32 billion 2020 adjusted per annum to the australian economy chong and sunding 2006 the contribution would be higher if non market values for ecosystem services were included gunawardena et al 2020 however in australia and many other countries groundwater is being extracted beyond sustainable levels harrington and cook 2014 for example groundwater storage in the murray darling basin covering roughly 14 of australia declined by around 100 000gl between 2000 and 2007 ranjan 2014 the groundwater level of western australia s most important groundwater system the gnangara groundwater system has also fallen by about 2 m in the last 35 years iftekhar and fogarty 2017 in australia groundwater has traditionally not been metered has been supplied free or at low cost and extraction has been managed by plans that fail to consider the connectivity between surface and groundwater the continuing consumption of groundwater at current levels is a risk to already stressed aquifers goa 2017 the establishment of groundwater markets has been suggested as an economic instrument for reducing the impact of over extraction wheeler et al 2016 both cap and cap and trade systems have been used to manage groundwater resources with varying degrees of success with a cap an extraction limit is set for each water user if no trading opportunity exists all users must work within their cap but in response to the cap users can invest in more efficient technology allocate water to higher value uses or reduce production chong and sunding 2006 formal markets for water extraction rights exist in many countries including australia the usa south africa china and chile informal water markets also exist in developing countries including bangladesh india pakistan and throughout africa gonzales and ajami 2019 molinos senante et al 2016 these markets have generated substantial economic social and environmental benefits for example water trading in a drought year 2008 09 in the southern murray darling basin of australia increased national gdp by an estimated 273 million 2020 adjusted productivity commission 2017 however only a very small portion of the total trade in water is related to groundwater for example in 2014 15 australian groundwater trades represented just 3 of total national trades in water allocations 5800gl and 15 of the national trade in water entitlements 1800gl abares 2016 the extent of australian groundwater trading in subsequent years has changed little establishing effective cap and trade systems for groundwater systems is challenging mulligan et al 2014 a key issue for any trading system is internalizing the spatial and temporal externalities of water extraction externality issues associated with excessive extraction in a specific location include land subsidence saltwater intrusion and the impact on local groundwater dependent ecosystems zeff et al 2019 allowing a concentration of extraction rights in a specific location can aggravate externality issues in a market based scheme skurray and pannell 2012 two main instruments are used to address externality issues a water transfer tax and zonal restrictions on trading in theory a tax can incorporate the social cost of extraction into the market price in practice it is difficult for water authorities to set an efficient tax and there can be political resistance to such a tax as such regulatory measures such as imposing trading restrictions to prevent trading in sensitive zones are more common however the effect of regulatory constraints has not been examined in detail especially where irrigators also face cuts to their existing water allocation in this paper we contribute to this knowledge gap by developing a simulation optimization model to study the impact of trading restrictions on the overall performance of a potential groundwater market for the gnangara groundwater system in western australia western australia remains an outlier jurisdiction for economically efficient approaches to water management for example prior to the 2000 amendments to the rights in water and irrigation act 1914 wa the act there was no separation between land and water titles and so it was necessary to acquire the relevant land to acquire the water license however even after the amendments in 2000 clauses in the act materially restricted water trading for example the submission of the relevant water agency to a 2008 parliamentary inquiry noted that in western australia a licence provides for the water and land to be held together in essence eisc 2008 p 88 water reform legislation has progressed very slowly in western australia and the state has yet to enact legislation to create water access entitlements consistent with the requirements of the national water initiative productivity commission 2021 the lack of water reform in western australia is explained partly by a political system that places considerable weight on rural electorates that have not favored reform and partly by concerns of localized over extraction externalities if groundwater trading is allowed in late 2021 electoral changes were introduced in western australia that reduced the weight on rural electorates but there remains a lack of urgency to implement water reforms 1 1 prior to the electoral changes the upper house of parliament in western australia had six districts that each elected six members there were three rural districts and three metropolitan districts and the number of voters per elected member in metropolitan districts was around four times higher than in rural districts against this backdrop of resistance to change research to understand the value and implications of water trading in western australia is valuable the gnangara groundwater system extends over 2200 sq km around perth the capital of western australia population 2 million and contributes to over 40 of perth s public water supply the system also supports native flora and fauna unique groundwater dependent ecosystems and an extensive irrigated agriculture industry however reducing water extraction is an active policy topic because the system is under pressure due to over extraction dwer 2017 some studies have investigated the potential of water markets in western australia for example gao et al 2013 found that a cap and trade system could achieve the same water reduction as a cap only system in perth with 18 21 lower cost in terms of lost agricultural production gross margin in the study market design rules were not considered and the automatic transfer of water rights was assumed iftekhar and fogarty 2017 studied the impact of water allocation caps on farm income but they did not examine the benefit of a cap and trade scheme the main focus of this paper recently lan et al 2021a examined the impact of a uniform allocation reduction on horticulturists in gnangara and recommended applying a market based tool to reduce the pressure on irrigators following this suggestion lan et al 2021b compared budget constrained and target constrained designs for a groundwater buyback auction for the gnangara system the modeling found that a budget constrained auction is generally more effective but the analysis did not consider a double auction format where irrigators could trade with each other more generally while the existing literature suggests that establishing a groundwater market would provide the expected positive net benefits the extent of benefits under different water availability scenarios and different institutional arrangements for trading have not been quantified in this research we extend the literature by exploring the implications of allowing inter zonal trading only and unrestricted trading under different water availability scenarios in the remainder of this paper we address four main research questions i what are the potential benefits of establishing a groundwater market in gnangara ii to what extent can a market based approach minimize the impact of water extraction restrictions water allocation cuts iii do trading and extraction restrictions uniformly affect different sized farms irrigators and iv what happens to benefits and externality costs when trading is limited to inter zonal areas only 2 study site the gnangara groundwater system is a suitable site for this study because it provides a major water source for human consumption many unique ecosystems depend on it and the system is under severe stress for administrative purposes the gnangara groundwater management plan area is divided into multiple sub areas based on cadastral boundaries except for a few specific locations each sub area has a specific water extraction limit further the government is considering reductions of around 10 25 of the current water extraction rights to reduce stress on the system government of western australia 2019 groundwater trading as defined in the existing water economics literature does not exist in western australia with any form of trade across different sub areas prohibited for this study nine sub areas in the wanneroo region were selected as potential areas where groundwater trading could be actively promoted fig 1 these areas were confirmed as appropriate study areas with the department of water and environmental regulation and licenses in the relevant sub areas cover approximately 13 of the gnangara groundwater allocation dow 2009 data on individual licenses including annual water allocation proposed farming area and farming purpose were collected in the selected sub areas to keep the model tractable only licenses that identified horticulture as the main use of the groundwater were considered there were 260 licenses active in 2017 with an average annual extraction limit of 49 23 ml standard deviation sd 56 ml and average area specified for horticultural production of 6 16 ha sd 7 09 ha both the farm area distribution and the allocated water distribution are highly skewed and around 30 of the farms account for around 70 of both total farm area and total water allocation 3 simulation framework an individual based simulation modeling approach was used to answer the research questions the model has three main parts i estimating the value of groundwater use ii constructing the supply and demand functions of individual bidders in the market and iii the trading model 3 1 estimating the value of groundwater use for individual farms in the model individual license holders are treated as separate farms and it is assumed that each farm makes independent decisions in terms of their water use and behavior in the market to construct bids in a water market farms need to know the value of their groundwater use the value functions for individual farms were constructed using the optimization model of iftekhar and fogarty 2017 which maximizes profit by growing different crops within the specified farm level area and groundwater availability constraints five vegetables were considered for the cropping mix cauliflower broccoli lettuce beans and tomatoes cauliflower and broccoli are winter crops beans and tomatoes are summer crops and lettuce can be grown in both seasons approximately 40 of the total horticultural yield from the region comprises these five vegetables the model also has the flexibility to select different irrigation technologies a brief description of the farm model is provided below using the notation and structure of iftekhar and fogarty 2017 the model maximizes the profit from growing the mix of vegetables some crops use more water than others and the model can allocate more area and water to more profitable crops as part of the optimal decision six different irrigation technologies that vary in terms of efficiency and costs are considered the model can select a more efficient but expensive irrigation technology if it increases net profit the objective function of the model is 1 max π k l p k c k y k a k c k l a k x l where a k l w k l k the production constraints are water constraint k l w k l g w area constraint k k w a k a w k k s a k a s technology constraint x l 0 1 a n d l x l 1 there are two main parts to the objective function the first part calculates the profit from cultivating crop k as the difference between the price of the crop p k and the cost of growing the crop c k multiplied by the yield per hectare y k and the area allocated to the crop a k the second part of the equation subtracts the total cost of using irrigation technology l which is the product of the unit cost of using the technology to irrigate the crop c k l and the area allocated to growing the crop finally both parts of the expression are multiplied by the irrigation technology selection variable x l which indicates whether the technology has been selected x l 1 or not x l 0 the optimal water application rate for a crop k is fixed the area a k allocated to growing crop k is calculated as the ratio between the water allocated to each crop w k l and the optimal water application rate there are three main constraints in the model i the water constraint which ensures that the total water used cannot exceed the total water allocation specified in the license ii the area constraint that limits the cropping area to that available for cultivating winter cauliflower broccoli and lettuce and summer beans tomato and lettuce crops and iii the technology constraint that prevents the selection of more than one irrigation technology the parameter values used in the farm model are detailed in tables 1 and 2 which are from iftekhar and fogarty 2017 adjusted to 2020 values to validate the model we ran the farm optimization sub model equation 1 100 times with parameter values for individual farms drawn randomly based on the distributions in tables 1 and 2 and recorded details on gross revenue per ml of water used these values were then compared to published values for individual vegetables the simulated gross revenue per ml range was 1309 7145 ml and the inflation adjusted range of gross revenue estimates for individual vegetables reported in hoffmann et al 2005 was 2511 7040 ml this gave us confidence in the simulation model outputs as the results were largely in agreement 3 2 construction of supply and demand functions for a farm to achieve optimal profit under different water availability constraints we integrated the optimization model into a simulation optimization process fig 2 first each farm i was assigned initial conditions for farm area and their water allocation then the farm condition loop k started for each iteration the main determinants of the farm profit function i e price cost and yield parameters were randomly drawn based on the distributions in tables 1 and 2 the water loop j then started with the water allocation systematically increased from 10 of the initial water allocation to 200 of the initial allocation in each step the farm optimization model equation 1 was implemented in each water loop step with model results collected at the end of each step this process continued until the water loop finished i e j 20 then the farm variables were randomly drawn for the next iteration of the farm condition loop k k 1 this process continued until a pre defined number 100 iterations of farm condition loops were completed i e k 100 this process was repeated until the process was completed for all farms i 260 after obtaining the simulation optimization model results different statistical models linear quadratic and cubic models without intercepts were tested to understand the overall relationship between water availability and net farming benefit based on the adjusted r squared and akaike information criterion values a quadratic function was selected as the best description of the relevant relationship the parameters were estimated separately for individual farms and the function took the following form nb ijk a i w ijk b i w ijk 2 ε ijk where nb ijk and w ijk are net farming benefit and available water respectively for farm i in farm water condition loop j and water availability loop k the a i and b i parameters are estimated this function can be used to calculate the optimal water requirement to maximize the net benefit of a farm by setting the first derivative of the function with respect to w i equal to zero i e w i nb i 0 the optimal water requirement formula is w i a ˆ l 2 b ˆ l where a ˆ l and b ˆ l are the estimated parameter values for farm i whether a farm is willing to buy water rights from the market or not depends on the farm s optimal water requirement a farm will seek to buy water from the market if the optimal water requirement w i is higher than the current water allocation w i and the maximum water volume a farm is willing to buy is w i w i in contrast a farmer is willing to sell any amount of water up to w i if the total price is higher than or equal to the net benefit of using that volume of water to clarify the concept consider the example in fig 3 the estimated net benefit function of the farm is 2 306 w i 7 80 w i 2 the farm s optimal water requirement is 148 ml point b and the farm s profit is 170 437 however the farm s current water allocation is 61 ml point a and the farm s profit is 111 642 therefore the farm may seek to buy up to 87 ml from the market if this water costs less than 170 437 111 642 58 795 or 676 ml however given the market s competitive nature explained below submitting a single bid may not be the most beneficial strategy therefore a bid schedule is prepared by calculating the farm profit and unit value at different volumes of water between the current allocation and the optimal water requirement i e between points a and b the farmer also has the flexibility to sell any volume of water to the market up to the current allocation i e up to point a if a farmer is willing to sell his her current allocation 61 ml the farm needs to receive a minimum total price of 111 642 or 1830 ml similar to a bid schedule an ask schedule is prepared for individual farms by calculating farm profit and unit cost at different volumes of water up to the current allocation the simulation optimization model also collects information on the total irrigated area and cropping mix under different water availability conditions for individual farms the relationship between water availability and irrigated area is then estimated using a series of quadratic regression models based on the regression models the total irrigated area and the area under a tomato crop the most profitable but most water intensive crop are estimated for different levels of water availability estimated areas are capped to ensure that the predicted areas for winter and summer crops do not exceed their respective area availability constraints for individual farms to illustrate in fig 4 predicted areas have been plotted for the same farm illustrated in fig 3 the plot shows that at the current water allocation level 61 ml 4 24 ha is irrigated and 100 of the irrigated area is devoted to tomato production as more water becomes available the total irrigated area increases 2 2 note the maximum area available for cropping is 85 of the total area of each farm as land is rotated through a fallow period however the area allocated to tomato production ultimately hits the summer area constraint so water is then allocated to other crops at the optimal water application level 148 ml the total irrigated area is 11 17 ha and 57 of the irrigated area is under tomato production 3 3 trading model similar to du et al 2017 we implemented an annual allocation market double auction model which assumes that willing farmers submit bid and ask schedules at the same time the auctioneer then runs the selection model and bids and asks are selected a uniform pricing rule is implemented where successful buyers pay the same price per unit of water ml and the successful sellers receive the same price given that it is a uniform price auction the model assumes that bidders do not engage in any strategizing behavior and submit a truthful bid schedule similar to palazzo and brozović 2014 it is assumed that trading is frictionless and transaction costs are zero the trading model implemented in this paper is a double sided multi unit single shot uniform price auction in such auctions individual bidders can submit a schedule of bids price and quantity the bids for buying water are denoted v ird q ird where v ird and q ird are the unit value and volume of water respectively that a bidder i in sub area r is willing to buy at volume d the bids for selling water are denoted c irs q irs where c irs and q irs are the unit cost and volume of water respectively that a bidder i in sub area r is willing to sell at volume s the same bidder can submit bids to buy and asks to sell water and both buyers and sellers participate in the same market the formal model followed by an explanation of the objective function and constraints is as follows max π v d c s where v d i r d v ird q ird x ird c s i r s c irs q irs y irs x ird 0 1 y irs 0 1 subject to individual trading restriction constraint i d x ird i s y irs 1 global trading restriction constraint i r s q irs y irs i r d q ird x ird 0 sub area trading restriction constraint i s q irs y irs i d q ird x ird 0 the objective of the model is to maximize the surplus from trading i e the difference between the aggregate value of buying water v d and the aggregate cost of selling water c s from the trade the aggregate value of buying water v d is calculated as the sum of the product of the unit value ml v ird volume ml q ird and a selection variable x ird the selection variable indicates whether the bid level submitted by bidder i in sub area r has been selected or not similarly the aggregate cost of selling water c s is calculated as the sum of the product of the unit cost ml c irs volume ml q irs and a selection variable y irs where y irs indicates whether the ask level submitted by seller i in sub area r has been selected or not no partial selection of bids and asks is allowed there are three main trading constraints the individual trading constraint prevents the selection of more than one bid or ask from a bidder the second and third constraints are related to water availability the global trading constraint ensures that the total supply from the whole market meets the demand for groundwater the sub area trading constraint ensures that the total supply from sellers in that sub area meets the demand for groundwater of the buyers in that sub area these two constraints are substituted in the relevant scenario 4 simulation scenarios two main dimensions of a groundwater management program were considered to answer the main research questions market structure and water availability the level of the water allocation cut three potential market conditions no market restricted market and unrestricted market were considered as follows in the no market scenario we ran a global optimization model to calculate the maximum total profit achievable subject to the individual farm level groundwater availability constraints that is max i nb i i f w i s t w i gw i in the restricted market scenario farmers could only trade water allocations with other farmers in their sub area this scenario involved solving the trading model with the sub area trading constraint imposed in the unrestricted market scenario farmers could freely trade their water allocation with anyone in the system this scenario involved solving the trading model with the global trading constraint imposed the level of water allocation cut was implemented by reducing the current groundwater allocation by a certain proportion which could be the same or different for each farm here we considered four levels of uniform cut across all farms 0 10 20 and 30 these are values relevant to the current groundwater management policy environment in western australia the optimization models were run for all possible 3 4 12 combinations of market structure and level of allocation cut to test the scenarios comprehensively individual scenarios were simulated 1000 times with random draws of parameters a i and b i for individual farms based on a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation values derived from regression analyses 4 1 performance measures three different performance measures were used to compare the scenarios aggregate impact market behavior and farm level impact five separate indicators were considered to understand the aggregate impact of water markets aggregate income from farming and trading ha total irrigated area ha average size of irrigated area per farm ha farm irrigated area under tomato crop ha and irrigated area under other crops ha changes in aggregate income track the overall economic impact of different policy scenarios the measures related to the irrigated area highlight potential structural changes in farming under different scenarios for example the number of active farms and total irrigated area indicate the possibility of people moving out of farming and an increase in the average size of the irrigated area indicates the transfer and consolidation of water rights changes to the area under different crops indicate potential sources of efficiency improvement in groundwater use as water shifts to higher value uses we also report details for the total profit or surplus per ml of water traded in the market a reduction in environmental externalities is often used to justify restricting trading between different zones to establish whether these concerns are likely to justify within zone trading restrictions we can examine the aggregate income under restricted and unrestricted trading regimes where externality costs are considered here the externality cost adjustment to aggregate income from an unrestricted trading scheme is the aggregate income minus the economic externality costs due to excessive groundwater extraction this is a conservative externality cost estimate as we ignore the potential positive ecological benefit from reducing groundwater extraction in other sub areas excess groundwater extraction in a sub area is calculated as the difference between total demand and total supply if total demand exceeds total supply i e ed r i d q ird x ird i s q irs y irs if i d q ird x ird i s q irs y irs the sub area specific excess demand is then aggregated to calculate the total excess extraction i e r ed r there is limited information on the economic externality cost of groundwater extraction in the region but one estimate of cost is between 302 and 416 2020 adjusted per ml economic regulation authority 2009 in this application we multiply the mid point of this estimate i e 359 ml by the total excess extraction r ed r volume to calculate the externality cost of excess groundwater extraction this value is then subtracted from aggregate income to calculate the externality adjusted aggregate income from farming and trading in an unrestricted market a quantile median regression model framework was used to understand the impact of water allocation cuts and market structure where target performance indicators were regressed against allocation cut level market structure and their interaction the estimation involves minimizing min β y i x i β θ y i x i β θ y i x i β 1 θ y i x i β θ where y i is the value of a performance indicator in iteration i θ is the quantile under consideration θ 0 5 x i is a k 1 vector of explanatory variables and β θ is the vector of coefficients to be estimated the cut variable is in percentage terms so the estimated coefficient describes the expected change in the outcome variable in response to a one percentage point change in the water allocation level the no market scenario is taken as the base level for the market structure variable and the coefficient indicates the difference from the base level the interaction variables indicate whether or not the effect of a reduction in water allocation cut is dependent on the market structure type given that the dependent variables have been expressed in natural logarithm form the percentage impact of the explanatory variables can be calculated as exp β ˆ 1 100 the two farm level indicators examined to understand the effect of market structure and water availability on farms of different sizes were the 1 probability of buying and selling water from the market and 2 aggregate income the probability of buying and selling water from the market was modeled using a logit model which included farm size market structure level of water availability and their interactions the dependent variable is a binary variable indicating whether a farm is a buyer seller the general form for the buying selling model is p pr y 1 x e α β x 1 e α β x where p is the probability of buying selling water which depends on the regressor vector x the parameter vector β and an intercept term α finally to determine whether markets were beneficial for all types of farms total aggregate income from farming and market trading was regressed against farm size and farm size squared using a quantile regression specification given that our focus is the impact of farm size we ran the models separately for different market structures and allocation levels and reported the median results 5 results the results section is divided into three parts aggregate performance impact of trading restrictions and farm level behavior and impacts 5 1 aggregate performance table 3 model 1 shows the income regression results the key findings were i aggregate income from farming and trading was 13 65 higher following the introduction of restricted within zone only trading and 18 37 higher with unrestricted trading compared to the no trading market structure ii as water availability was restricted via cuts to allocations the fall in income was approximately proportional to the cut for example a 1 reduction in water allocation decreased aggregated income by 1 04 without trading 1 00 with restricted trading and 0 98 with unrestricted trading and iii the interaction effects were statistically significant but not important from a practical perspective table 3 model 2 shows the results for the total area planted with total water allocations unchanged the total irrigated area increased by 5 39 with restricted trading and 5 57 with unrestricted trading this result is consistent with a situation where larger more water efficient farms are water constrained at their current water allocation level relative to the land available for irrigation the fact that income increases more than area planted reflects the higher production efficiency of those purchasing water compared to those selling water with reduced water availability the area planted falls at a similar rate under all market scenarios specifically following a 1 cut in water availability the area planted falls by 1 17 with no trading and 1 20 with restricted and unrestricted trading table 3 model 3 shows the results for an average farm size the key finding was that the average farm size increased by 101 with restricted trading and 166 with unrestricted trading indicating the concentration of water extraction rights to fewer farms following the introduction of trading this finding implies that many farms in the region are currently operating at a sub optimal level with ample scope for improving system level economic efficiency by introducing groundwater trading while the movement of water rights to high value more water efficient farms was expected this result provides information on the scale of the potential changes for the study area table 4 shows the impact on the production mix following changes in market structure and water availability model 1 shows the impact on the area under tomato production the most water intensive and profitable crop and model 2 shows the combined impact across all other vegetables with the introduction of restricted trading the area under tomato production increased by less than 1 and the area planted to other crops increased by 17 86 with the introduction of unrestricted trading the area under tomato production increased by 3 57 and 10 33 for other crops these differences in the change in the production mix between restricted and unrestricted trading largely explain the differences observed in the income achieved between the two trading scenarios as water availability decreased the area under tomato production fell more slowly than other vegetables and the effects were approximately the same for all market scenarios specifically a 1 reduction in water availability decreased the area under tomato production and other vegetables by 1 06 and 1 49 respectively with no trading by 1 06 and 1 54 respectively with restricted trading and by 1 12 and 1 39 respectively for unrestricted trading this result illustrates that despite high absolute water use the value per ml of water used is still higher for tomato production than other crops this specific example also illustrates the more general result that water is reallocated to more productive uses following the introduction of a water market before considering externality effects it is valuable to compare the overall results of the restricted and unrestricted trading scenarios that is unrestricted trading had 4 72 higher aggregate income 0 18 higher total irrigated area 64 70 more irrigated area per farm 2 94 more area under tomato and 7 53 less area under other crops compared to restricted trading 5 2 impact of trading restrictions this sub section measures the impact of trading restrictions in terms of surplus per ml of water traded in the market and externality adjusted income the regression model structure is the same as the previous section except that there were only two levels of the categorical market structure variable with the base level being the restricted market trading condition table 5 model 1 shows that unrestricted trading has 55 36 higher total surplus per ml of water traded than restricted trading and the total surplus falls more slowly with limited water availability specifically following a 1 reduction in water allocations the total surplus falls by 0 13 with unrestricted trading and 0 35 with restricted trading table 5 model 2 shows the difference in the externality cost adjusted income between the restricted and unrestricted trading scenarios specifically when a conservative measure of externality costs is included the difference in income between the two trading scenarios is only 1 35 so once externality costs are included the gap in performance between the two market structures closes substantially the decline in adjusted income for every percentage point increase in allocation cut is the same for both structures 5 3 farm level behavior and impacts this sub section examines the impact of farm size on the probability of buying and selling water from the market table 6 model 1 shows that large farms are more likely to be water buyers than sellers and this tendency increases with unrestricted trading the cut level has a marginal impact on the probability of buying water in table 6 most of the interaction variables are statistically significant but small to assist with interpreting the results fig 5 plots the probability of buying and selling water against farm size for restricted and unrestricted trading with no change in water availability and a 30 reduction in water allocations the probability of buying water is positively correlated with farm size while selling water is negatively correlated with farm size if we then consider the 50 probability point as the threshold for predicting buying or selling the buying plots show a smaller average farm size for those predicted to purchase water i with restricted trading than unrestricted trading and ii when water availability decreases for both market conditions with no change in water availability those predicted to be water sellers have the same farm size for both market conditions when water availability decreases by 30 the size of farms predicted to be sellers of water increases but the threshold size of farms is approximately the same for both market structures table 7 reports the regression model results that explore the relationship between farm size and aggregate income over the range of farm sizes considered total farm income increases with farm size fig 6 shows the results for two different levels of water availability i across all market structures small farms have similar incomes for a given level of water availability but larger farms enjoy greater gains from trading as farm size increases and ii for a given market condition and farm size income is always lower with reduced water availability 6 discussion in 2004 the various australian governments signed the national water initiative nwi clause 23 of the nwi committed these governments to work toward 10 water reform objectives full implementation of this national water agreement will result in a nationally compatible market regulatory and planning based system of managing surface and groundwater resources for rural and urban use that optimizes economic social and environmental outcomes by achieving the following i clear and nationally compatible characteristics for secure water access entitlements ii transparent statutory based water planning iii statutory provision for environmental and other public benefit outcomes and improved environmental management practices iv complete the return of all currently overallocated or overused systems to environmentally sustainable levels of extraction v progressive removal of barriers to trade in water and meeting other requirements to facilitate the broadening and deepening of the water market with an open trading market to be in place vi clarity around the assignment of risk arising from future changes in the availability of water for the consumptive pool vii water accounting which is able to meet the information needs of different water systems in respect to planning monitoring trading environmental management and on farm management viii policy settings which facilitate water use efficiency and innovation in urban and rural areas ix addressing future adjustment issues that may impact on water users and communities and x recognition of the connectivity between surface and groundwater resources and connected systems managed as a single resource 3 3 intergovernmental agreement on a national water initiative between the commonwealth of australia and the governments of new south wales victoria queensland south australia the australian capital territory and the northern territory objectives i iv v vi and vii are directly related to facilitating water trading the most important of these objectives is to create a secure water access entitlement system objective i but the western australian government has failed to do this productivity commission 2021 trade in groundwater extraction rights is technically possible in western australia however there is no tenure security as the terms for the right to extract groundwater are granted on a relatively short fixed term basis and there is no guarantee of license renewal or renewal for the previously licensed amount this substantially limits the possibility of trade in groundwater the fact that land tenure and groundwater rights are legally separate but in practical terms joint further limits the extent to which any substantial trade in groundwater rights can occur in western australia one reason for the slow progress in creating the legislative framework to support groundwater trading is the concern that trading will lead to localized over extraction externalities this study calibrated to real world data found that local extraction externalities are present with unrestricted trading when a narrow definition was used for the extraction externality the economic gain from unrestricted trading largely disappeared relative to restricted within zone only trading this result relied on the mid point estimate from the economic regulation authority s relatively uncertain and narrowly defined estimate of the economic externality range 302 416 ml we deem this sufficient evidence to conclude that the gain from unrestricted trade across the gnangara groundwater system is insufficient to justify a move to unrestricted trading relative to restricted trading the potential for localized over extraction externality effects is a generally relevant finding and a design characteristic that should be considered in all groundwater markets material gains will still occur from within zone only trading if there are enough license holders within the existing zones with sufficiently different businesses farm income increased by 13 7 for the restricted trading scenario with the current extraction limits however the gnangara groundwater system is over allocated under restricted trading we calculated that horticultural water extraction could be reduced by 14 while maintaining existing production levels a reduction of this magnitude is in the middle of the range of water allocation reductions discussed that would result in a sustainable water balance in the system in contrast in a scenario with no water trading a 14 reduction in water allocations is associated with a 14 6 reduction in farm income water trading can therefore be seen as a mechanism to restore environmental balance without any material losses in agricultural production this result is relevant to the case study location and all locations where groundwater supports agricultural production as system level water availability declined the auction market clearing prices generally increased restricted trading with no reduction in water availability resulted in a median market clearing water price of 1758 ml with 90 of the market clearing prices between 1705 ml and 1806 ml when overall water availability decreased by 30 the median market clearing water price was 1940 ml with 90 of the market clearing prices between 1899 ml and 1975 ml as noted in the introduction groundwater is a globally important source of drinking water for the greater perth region the long run marginal cost lrmc of water supply is determined by the cost of desalinated water current estimates of lrmc are already substantially higher than the market clearing price for groundwater found in this study and lrmc is forecast to increase substantially with time economic regulation authority 2017 perth s main water utility has existing extraction bores in most gnangara sub regions and depending on the assumptions made the water utility s mean estimate of lrmc in 2020 dollars is between 3000 ml and 3970 ml economic regulation authority 2017 the nwi objectives suggest that the water utility and any other interested parties should be allowed to participate in groundwater markets given the difference in the value of water to the utility and the value of agricultural production gross margin allowing the water utility to purchase water from irrigators would likely result in a permanent large reduction in horticultural production in the area but also generate a large net benefit an area for additional policy development is therefore the approved possible land uses in areas currently zoned for agricultural production in a free market the fact that water might be allocated away from agriculture is a result relevant outside the specific case study example context and highlights the issue of market rule design national and sub national governments may have a range of objectives relating to agricultural production in any given region the highest value user of water may not be the agriculture sector but could be industry or a water utility when groundwater trading is introduced the implications of transferring water from agricultural production to other use types should be considered finally we note some future possible study extensions and limitations the optimization simulation framework used in this paper could be expanded by 1 including other major groundwater users such as local government industry and the local water utility in the trading market 2 exploring the market performance of other pricing mechanisms such as discriminatory vickrey and second price auctions in terms of limitations we assume participation in the market is motivated by profit maximization farmers and other potential participants in the market could be motivated by factors other than profit maximization surveying these participants about their motivations would shed light on the validity of this assumption declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment the authors are grateful to the department of

9454,the gnangara groundwater system is western australia s most important groundwater resource but it is being depleted although australia has been at the forefront of establishing water markets western australia has been slow to adopt legislation that would support trade in groundwater this study explores the impact of introducing groundwater trading within the horticulture sector for farms that extract water from the gnangara system we use a simulation optimization framework to evaluate market performance the model is based on detailed water allocation data obtained from the relevant water agency a farm optimization model was used to generate supply and demand functions for water at the individual farm level and the market clearing price for water was established via a uniform price double sided auction the level of water available for extraction was also varied the model considers unrestricted trading and trading within relatively small groundwater zones that limit the potential for local over extraction externalities the results show 1 substantial economic gains from allowing trading are possible 2 most of the gains from establishing a groundwater market can be realized from within zone trading only 3 industry consolidation follows the introduction of trading and 4 without zonal trading restrictions local over extraction externalities are present also with groundwater trading we find that reallocating water to the most efficient producers could reduce horticulture sector water extraction by 14 while maintaining the existing value of agricultural production in the area keywords australia cap and trade groundwater horticulture water market 1 introduction groundwater resources support complex ecosystems agricultural production and have been integrated into the potable water supply for cities due to low extraction costs and relatively high water quality many communities depend on groundwater birkenholtz 2015 for example groundwater accounts for about 50 of drinking water and 43 of irrigation water worldwide wheeler et al 2016 in australia 5000gl of groundwater is used per year providing almost one third of total drinking water and 70 of agricultural water harrington and cook 2014 groundwater contributes around aud38 32 billion 2020 adjusted per annum to the australian economy chong and sunding 2006 the contribution would be higher if non market values for ecosystem services were included gunawardena et al 2020 however in australia and many other countries groundwater is being extracted beyond sustainable levels harrington and cook 2014 for example groundwater storage in the murray darling basin covering roughly 14 of australia declined by around 100 000gl between 2000 and 2007 ranjan 2014 the groundwater level of western australia s most important groundwater system the gnangara groundwater system has also fallen by about 2 m in the last 35 years iftekhar and fogarty 2017 in australia groundwater has traditionally not been metered has been supplied free or at low cost and extraction has been managed by plans that fail to consider the connectivity between surface and groundwater the continuing consumption of groundwater at current levels is a risk to already stressed aquifers goa 2017 the establishment of groundwater markets has been suggested as an economic instrument for reducing the impact of over extraction wheeler et al 2016 both cap and cap and trade systems have been used to manage groundwater resources with varying degrees of success with a cap an extraction limit is set for each water user if no trading opportunity exists all users must work within their cap but in response to the cap users can invest in more efficient technology allocate water to higher value uses or reduce production chong and sunding 2006 formal markets for water extraction rights exist in many countries including australia the usa south africa china and chile informal water markets also exist in developing countries including bangladesh india pakistan and throughout africa gonzales and ajami 2019 molinos senante et al 2016 these markets have generated substantial economic social and environmental benefits for example water trading in a drought year 2008 09 in the southern murray darling basin of australia increased national gdp by an estimated 273 million 2020 adjusted productivity commission 2017 however only a very small portion of the total trade in water is related to groundwater for example in 2014 15 australian groundwater trades represented just 3 of total national trades in water allocations 5800gl and 15 of the national trade in water entitlements 1800gl abares 2016 the extent of australian groundwater trading in subsequent years has changed little establishing effective cap and trade systems for groundwater systems is challenging mulligan et al 2014 a key issue for any trading system is internalizing the spatial and temporal externalities of water extraction externality issues associated with excessive extraction in a specific location include land subsidence saltwater intrusion and the impact on local groundwater dependent ecosystems zeff et al 2019 allowing a concentration of extraction rights in a specific location can aggravate externality issues in a market based scheme skurray and pannell 2012 two main instruments are used to address externality issues a water transfer tax and zonal restrictions on trading in theory a tax can incorporate the social cost of extraction into the market price in practice it is difficult for water authorities to set an efficient tax and there can be political resistance to such a tax as such regulatory measures such as imposing trading restrictions to prevent trading in sensitive zones are more common however the effect of regulatory constraints has not been examined in detail especially where irrigators also face cuts to their existing water allocation in this paper we contribute to this knowledge gap by developing a simulation optimization model to study the impact of trading restrictions on the overall performance of a potential groundwater market for the gnangara groundwater system in western australia western australia remains an outlier jurisdiction for economically efficient approaches to water management for example prior to the 2000 amendments to the rights in water and irrigation act 1914 wa the act there was no separation between land and water titles and so it was necessary to acquire the relevant land to acquire the water license however even after the amendments in 2000 clauses in the act materially restricted water trading for example the submission of the relevant water agency to a 2008 parliamentary inquiry noted that in western australia a licence provides for the water and land to be held together in essence eisc 2008 p 88 water reform legislation has progressed very slowly in western australia and the state has yet to enact legislation to create water access entitlements consistent with the requirements of the national water initiative productivity commission 2021 the lack of water reform in western australia is explained partly by a political system that places considerable weight on rural electorates that have not favored reform and partly by concerns of localized over extraction externalities if groundwater trading is allowed in late 2021 electoral changes were introduced in western australia that reduced the weight on rural electorates but there remains a lack of urgency to implement water reforms 1 1 prior to the electoral changes the upper house of parliament in western australia had six districts that each elected six members there were three rural districts and three metropolitan districts and the number of voters per elected member in metropolitan districts was around four times higher than in rural districts against this backdrop of resistance to change research to understand the value and implications of water trading in western australia is valuable the gnangara groundwater system extends over 2200 sq km around perth the capital of western australia population 2 million and contributes to over 40 of perth s public water supply the system also supports native flora and fauna unique groundwater dependent ecosystems and an extensive irrigated agriculture industry however reducing water extraction is an active policy topic because the system is under pressure due to over extraction dwer 2017 some studies have investigated the potential of water markets in western australia for example gao et al 2013 found that a cap and trade system could achieve the same water reduction as a cap only system in perth with 18 21 lower cost in terms of lost agricultural production gross margin in the study market design rules were not considered and the automatic transfer of water rights was assumed iftekhar and fogarty 2017 studied the impact of water allocation caps on farm income but they did not examine the benefit of a cap and trade scheme the main focus of this paper recently lan et al 2021a examined the impact of a uniform allocation reduction on horticulturists in gnangara and recommended applying a market based tool to reduce the pressure on irrigators following this suggestion lan et al 2021b compared budget constrained and target constrained designs for a groundwater buyback auction for the gnangara system the modeling found that a budget constrained auction is generally more effective but the analysis did not consider a double auction format where irrigators could trade with each other more generally while the existing literature suggests that establishing a groundwater market would provide the expected positive net benefits the extent of benefits under different water availability scenarios and different institutional arrangements for trading have not been quantified in this research we extend the literature by exploring the implications of allowing inter zonal trading only and unrestricted trading under different water availability scenarios in the remainder of this paper we address four main research questions i what are the potential benefits of establishing a groundwater market in gnangara ii to what extent can a market based approach minimize the impact of water extraction restrictions water allocation cuts iii do trading and extraction restrictions uniformly affect different sized farms irrigators and iv what happens to benefits and externality costs when trading is limited to inter zonal areas only 2 study site the gnangara groundwater system is a suitable site for this study because it provides a major water source for human consumption many unique ecosystems depend on it and the system is under severe stress for administrative purposes the gnangara groundwater management plan area is divided into multiple sub areas based on cadastral boundaries except for a few specific locations each sub area has a specific water extraction limit further the government is considering reductions of around 10 25 of the current water extraction rights to reduce stress on the system government of western australia 2019 groundwater trading as defined in the existing water economics literature does not exist in western australia with any form of trade across different sub areas prohibited for this study nine sub areas in the wanneroo region were selected as potential areas where groundwater trading could be actively promoted fig 1 these areas were confirmed as appropriate study areas with the department of water and environmental regulation and licenses in the relevant sub areas cover approximately 13 of the gnangara groundwater allocation dow 2009 data on individual licenses including annual water allocation proposed farming area and farming purpose were collected in the selected sub areas to keep the model tractable only licenses that identified horticulture as the main use of the groundwater were considered there were 260 licenses active in 2017 with an average annual extraction limit of 49 23 ml standard deviation sd 56 ml and average area specified for horticultural production of 6 16 ha sd 7 09 ha both the farm area distribution and the allocated water distribution are highly skewed and around 30 of the farms account for around 70 of both total farm area and total water allocation 3 simulation framework an individual based simulation modeling approach was used to answer the research questions the model has three main parts i estimating the value of groundwater use ii constructing the supply and demand functions of individual bidders in the market and iii the trading model 3 1 estimating the value of groundwater use for individual farms in the model individual license holders are treated as separate farms and it is assumed that each farm makes independent decisions in terms of their water use and behavior in the market to construct bids in a water market farms need to know the value of their groundwater use the value functions for individual farms were constructed using the optimization model of iftekhar and fogarty 2017 which maximizes profit by growing different crops within the specified farm level area and groundwater availability constraints five vegetables were considered for the cropping mix cauliflower broccoli lettuce beans and tomatoes cauliflower and broccoli are winter crops beans and tomatoes are summer crops and lettuce can be grown in both seasons approximately 40 of the total horticultural yield from the region comprises these five vegetables the model also has the flexibility to select different irrigation technologies a brief description of the farm model is provided below using the notation and structure of iftekhar and fogarty 2017 the model maximizes the profit from growing the mix of vegetables some crops use more water than others and the model can allocate more area and water to more profitable crops as part of the optimal decision six different irrigation technologies that vary in terms of efficiency and costs are considered the model can select a more efficient but expensive irrigation technology if it increases net profit the objective function of the model is 1 max π k l p k c k y k a k c k l a k x l where a k l w k l k the production constraints are water constraint k l w k l g w area constraint k k w a k a w k k s a k a s technology constraint x l 0 1 a n d l x l 1 there are two main parts to the objective function the first part calculates the profit from cultivating crop k as the difference between the price of the crop p k and the cost of growing the crop c k multiplied by the yield per hectare y k and the area allocated to the crop a k the second part of the equation subtracts the total cost of using irrigation technology l which is the product of the unit cost of using the technology to irrigate the crop c k l and the area allocated to growing the crop finally both parts of the expression are multiplied by the irrigation technology selection variable x l which indicates whether the technology has been selected x l 1 or not x l 0 the optimal water application rate for a crop k is fixed the area a k allocated to growing crop k is calculated as the ratio between the water allocated to each crop w k l and the optimal water application rate there are three main constraints in the model i the water constraint which ensures that the total water used cannot exceed the total water allocation specified in the license ii the area constraint that limits the cropping area to that available for cultivating winter cauliflower broccoli and lettuce and summer beans tomato and lettuce crops and iii the technology constraint that prevents the selection of more than one irrigation technology the parameter values used in the farm model are detailed in tables 1 and 2 which are from iftekhar and fogarty 2017 adjusted to 2020 values to validate the model we ran the farm optimization sub model equation 1 100 times with parameter values for individual farms drawn randomly based on the distributions in tables 1 and 2 and recorded details on gross revenue per ml of water used these values were then compared to published values for individual vegetables the simulated gross revenue per ml range was 1309 7145 ml and the inflation adjusted range of gross revenue estimates for individual vegetables reported in hoffmann et al 2005 was 2511 7040 ml this gave us confidence in the simulation model outputs as the results were largely in agreement 3 2 construction of supply and demand functions for a farm to achieve optimal profit under different water availability constraints we integrated the optimization model into a simulation optimization process fig 2 first each farm i was assigned initial conditions for farm area and their water allocation then the farm condition loop k started for each iteration the main determinants of the farm profit function i e price cost and yield parameters were randomly drawn based on the distributions in tables 1 and 2 the water loop j then started with the water allocation systematically increased from 10 of the initial water allocation to 200 of the initial allocation in each step the farm optimization model equation 1 was implemented in each water loop step with model results collected at the end of each step this process continued until the water loop finished i e j 20 then the farm variables were randomly drawn for the next iteration of the farm condition loop k k 1 this process continued until a pre defined number 100 iterations of farm condition loops were completed i e k 100 this process was repeated until the process was completed for all farms i 260 after obtaining the simulation optimization model results different statistical models linear quadratic and cubic models without intercepts were tested to understand the overall relationship between water availability and net farming benefit based on the adjusted r squared and akaike information criterion values a quadratic function was selected as the best description of the relevant relationship the parameters were estimated separately for individual farms and the function took the following form nb ijk a i w ijk b i w ijk 2 ε ijk where nb ijk and w ijk are net farming benefit and available water respectively for farm i in farm water condition loop j and water availability loop k the a i and b i parameters are estimated this function can be used to calculate the optimal water requirement to maximize the net benefit of a farm by setting the first derivative of the function with respect to w i equal to zero i e w i nb i 0 the optimal water requirement formula is w i a ˆ l 2 b ˆ l where a ˆ l and b ˆ l are the estimated parameter values for farm i whether a farm is willing to buy water rights from the market or not depends on the farm s optimal water requirement a farm will seek to buy water from the market if the optimal water requirement w i is higher than the current water allocation w i and the maximum water volume a farm is willing to buy is w i w i in contrast a farmer is willing to sell any amount of water up to w i if the total price is higher than or equal to the net benefit of using that volume of water to clarify the concept consider the example in fig 3 the estimated net benefit function of the farm is 2 306 w i 7 80 w i 2 the farm s optimal water requirement is 148 ml point b and the farm s profit is 170 437 however the farm s current water allocation is 61 ml point a and the farm s profit is 111 642 therefore the farm may seek to buy up to 87 ml from the market if this water costs less than 170 437 111 642 58 795 or 676 ml however given the market s competitive nature explained below submitting a single bid may not be the most beneficial strategy therefore a bid schedule is prepared by calculating the farm profit and unit value at different volumes of water between the current allocation and the optimal water requirement i e between points a and b the farmer also has the flexibility to sell any volume of water to the market up to the current allocation i e up to point a if a farmer is willing to sell his her current allocation 61 ml the farm needs to receive a minimum total price of 111 642 or 1830 ml similar to a bid schedule an ask schedule is prepared for individual farms by calculating farm profit and unit cost at different volumes of water up to the current allocation the simulation optimization model also collects information on the total irrigated area and cropping mix under different water availability conditions for individual farms the relationship between water availability and irrigated area is then estimated using a series of quadratic regression models based on the regression models the total irrigated area and the area under a tomato crop the most profitable but most water intensive crop are estimated for different levels of water availability estimated areas are capped to ensure that the predicted areas for winter and summer crops do not exceed their respective area availability constraints for individual farms to illustrate in fig 4 predicted areas have been plotted for the same farm illustrated in fig 3 the plot shows that at the current water allocation level 61 ml 4 24 ha is irrigated and 100 of the irrigated area is devoted to tomato production as more water becomes available the total irrigated area increases 2 2 note the maximum area available for cropping is 85 of the total area of each farm as land is rotated through a fallow period however the area allocated to tomato production ultimately hits the summer area constraint so water is then allocated to other crops at the optimal water application level 148 ml the total irrigated area is 11 17 ha and 57 of the irrigated area is under tomato production 3 3 trading model similar to du et al 2017 we implemented an annual allocation market double auction model which assumes that willing farmers submit bid and ask schedules at the same time the auctioneer then runs the selection model and bids and asks are selected a uniform pricing rule is implemented where successful buyers pay the same price per unit of water ml and the successful sellers receive the same price given that it is a uniform price auction the model assumes that bidders do not engage in any strategizing behavior and submit a truthful bid schedule similar to palazzo and brozović 2014 it is assumed that trading is frictionless and transaction costs are zero the trading model implemented in this paper is a double sided multi unit single shot uniform price auction in such auctions individual bidders can submit a schedule of bids price and quantity the bids for buying water are denoted v ird q ird where v ird and q ird are the unit value and volume of water respectively that a bidder i in sub area r is willing to buy at volume d the bids for selling water are denoted c irs q irs where c irs and q irs are the unit cost and volume of water respectively that a bidder i in sub area r is willing to sell at volume s the same bidder can submit bids to buy and asks to sell water and both buyers and sellers participate in the same market the formal model followed by an explanation of the objective function and constraints is as follows max π v d c s where v d i r d v ird q ird x ird c s i r s c irs q irs y irs x ird 0 1 y irs 0 1 subject to individual trading restriction constraint i d x ird i s y irs 1 global trading restriction constraint i r s q irs y irs i r d q ird x ird 0 sub area trading restriction constraint i s q irs y irs i d q ird x ird 0 the objective of the model is to maximize the surplus from trading i e the difference between the aggregate value of buying water v d and the aggregate cost of selling water c s from the trade the aggregate value of buying water v d is calculated as the sum of the product of the unit value ml v ird volume ml q ird and a selection variable x ird the selection variable indicates whether the bid level submitted by bidder i in sub area r has been selected or not similarly the aggregate cost of selling water c s is calculated as the sum of the product of the unit cost ml c irs volume ml q irs and a selection variable y irs where y irs indicates whether the ask level submitted by seller i in sub area r has been selected or not no partial selection of bids and asks is allowed there are three main trading constraints the individual trading constraint prevents the selection of more than one bid or ask from a bidder the second and third constraints are related to water availability the global trading constraint ensures that the total supply from the whole market meets the demand for groundwater the sub area trading constraint ensures that the total supply from sellers in that sub area meets the demand for groundwater of the buyers in that sub area these two constraints are substituted in the relevant scenario 4 simulation scenarios two main dimensions of a groundwater management program were considered to answer the main research questions market structure and water availability the level of the water allocation cut three potential market conditions no market restricted market and unrestricted market were considered as follows in the no market scenario we ran a global optimization model to calculate the maximum total profit achievable subject to the individual farm level groundwater availability constraints that is max i nb i i f w i s t w i gw i in the restricted market scenario farmers could only trade water allocations with other farmers in their sub area this scenario involved solving the trading model with the sub area trading constraint imposed in the unrestricted market scenario farmers could freely trade their water allocation with anyone in the system this scenario involved solving the trading model with the global trading constraint imposed the level of water allocation cut was implemented by reducing the current groundwater allocation by a certain proportion which could be the same or different for each farm here we considered four levels of uniform cut across all farms 0 10 20 and 30 these are values relevant to the current groundwater management policy environment in western australia the optimization models were run for all possible 3 4 12 combinations of market structure and level of allocation cut to test the scenarios comprehensively individual scenarios were simulated 1000 times with random draws of parameters a i and b i for individual farms based on a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation values derived from regression analyses 4 1 performance measures three different performance measures were used to compare the scenarios aggregate impact market behavior and farm level impact five separate indicators were considered to understand the aggregate impact of water markets aggregate income from farming and trading ha total irrigated area ha average size of irrigated area per farm ha farm irrigated area under tomato crop ha and irrigated area under other crops ha changes in aggregate income track the overall economic impact of different policy scenarios the measures related to the irrigated area highlight potential structural changes in farming under different scenarios for example the number of active farms and total irrigated area indicate the possibility of people moving out of farming and an increase in the average size of the irrigated area indicates the transfer and consolidation of water rights changes to the area under different crops indicate potential sources of efficiency improvement in groundwater use as water shifts to higher value uses we also report details for the total profit or surplus per ml of water traded in the market a reduction in environmental externalities is often used to justify restricting trading between different zones to establish whether these concerns are likely to justify within zone trading restrictions we can examine the aggregate income under restricted and unrestricted trading regimes where externality costs are considered here the externality cost adjustment to aggregate income from an unrestricted trading scheme is the aggregate income minus the economic externality costs due to excessive groundwater extraction this is a conservative externality cost estimate as we ignore the potential positive ecological benefit from reducing groundwater extraction in other sub areas excess groundwater extraction in a sub area is calculated as the difference between total demand and total supply if total demand exceeds total supply i e ed r i d q ird x ird i s q irs y irs if i d q ird x ird i s q irs y irs the sub area specific excess demand is then aggregated to calculate the total excess extraction i e r ed r there is limited information on the economic externality cost of groundwater extraction in the region but one estimate of cost is between 302 and 416 2020 adjusted per ml economic regulation authority 2009 in this application we multiply the mid point of this estimate i e 359 ml by the total excess extraction r ed r volume to calculate the externality cost of excess groundwater extraction this value is then subtracted from aggregate income to calculate the externality adjusted aggregate income from farming and trading in an unrestricted market a quantile median regression model framework was used to understand the impact of water allocation cuts and market structure where target performance indicators were regressed against allocation cut level market structure and their interaction the estimation involves minimizing min β y i x i β θ y i x i β θ y i x i β 1 θ y i x i β θ where y i is the value of a performance indicator in iteration i θ is the quantile under consideration θ 0 5 x i is a k 1 vector of explanatory variables and β θ is the vector of coefficients to be estimated the cut variable is in percentage terms so the estimated coefficient describes the expected change in the outcome variable in response to a one percentage point change in the water allocation level the no market scenario is taken as the base level for the market structure variable and the coefficient indicates the difference from the base level the interaction variables indicate whether or not the effect of a reduction in water allocation cut is dependent on the market structure type given that the dependent variables have been expressed in natural logarithm form the percentage impact of the explanatory variables can be calculated as exp β ˆ 1 100 the two farm level indicators examined to understand the effect of market structure and water availability on farms of different sizes were the 1 probability of buying and selling water from the market and 2 aggregate income the probability of buying and selling water from the market was modeled using a logit model which included farm size market structure level of water availability and their interactions the dependent variable is a binary variable indicating whether a farm is a buyer seller the general form for the buying selling model is p pr y 1 x e α β x 1 e α β x where p is the probability of buying selling water which depends on the regressor vector x the parameter vector β and an intercept term α finally to determine whether markets were beneficial for all types of farms total aggregate income from farming and market trading was regressed against farm size and farm size squared using a quantile regression specification given that our focus is the impact of farm size we ran the models separately for different market structures and allocation levels and reported the median results 5 results the results section is divided into three parts aggregate performance impact of trading restrictions and farm level behavior and impacts 5 1 aggregate performance table 3 model 1 shows the income regression results the key findings were i aggregate income from farming and trading was 13 65 higher following the introduction of restricted within zone only trading and 18 37 higher with unrestricted trading compared to the no trading market structure ii as water availability was restricted via cuts to allocations the fall in income was approximately proportional to the cut for example a 1 reduction in water allocation decreased aggregated income by 1 04 without trading 1 00 with restricted trading and 0 98 with unrestricted trading and iii the interaction effects were statistically significant but not important from a practical perspective table 3 model 2 shows the results for the total area planted with total water allocations unchanged the total irrigated area increased by 5 39 with restricted trading and 5 57 with unrestricted trading this result is consistent with a situation where larger more water efficient farms are water constrained at their current water allocation level relative to the land available for irrigation the fact that income increases more than area planted reflects the higher production efficiency of those purchasing water compared to those selling water with reduced water availability the area planted falls at a similar rate under all market scenarios specifically following a 1 cut in water availability the area planted falls by 1 17 with no trading and 1 20 with restricted and unrestricted trading table 3 model 3 shows the results for an average farm size the key finding was that the average farm size increased by 101 with restricted trading and 166 with unrestricted trading indicating the concentration of water extraction rights to fewer farms following the introduction of trading this finding implies that many farms in the region are currently operating at a sub optimal level with ample scope for improving system level economic efficiency by introducing groundwater trading while the movement of water rights to high value more water efficient farms was expected this result provides information on the scale of the potential changes for the study area table 4 shows the impact on the production mix following changes in market structure and water availability model 1 shows the impact on the area under tomato production the most water intensive and profitable crop and model 2 shows the combined impact across all other vegetables with the introduction of restricted trading the area under tomato production increased by less than 1 and the area planted to other crops increased by 17 86 with the introduction of unrestricted trading the area under tomato production increased by 3 57 and 10 33 for other crops these differences in the change in the production mix between restricted and unrestricted trading largely explain the differences observed in the income achieved between the two trading scenarios as water availability decreased the area under tomato production fell more slowly than other vegetables and the effects were approximately the same for all market scenarios specifically a 1 reduction in water availability decreased the area under tomato production and other vegetables by 1 06 and 1 49 respectively with no trading by 1 06 and 1 54 respectively with restricted trading and by 1 12 and 1 39 respectively for unrestricted trading this result illustrates that despite high absolute water use the value per ml of water used is still higher for tomato production than other crops this specific example also illustrates the more general result that water is reallocated to more productive uses following the introduction of a water market before considering externality effects it is valuable to compare the overall results of the restricted and unrestricted trading scenarios that is unrestricted trading had 4 72 higher aggregate income 0 18 higher total irrigated area 64 70 more irrigated area per farm 2 94 more area under tomato and 7 53 less area under other crops compared to restricted trading 5 2 impact of trading restrictions this sub section measures the impact of trading restrictions in terms of surplus per ml of water traded in the market and externality adjusted income the regression model structure is the same as the previous section except that there were only two levels of the categorical market structure variable with the base level being the restricted market trading condition table 5 model 1 shows that unrestricted trading has 55 36 higher total surplus per ml of water traded than restricted trading and the total surplus falls more slowly with limited water availability specifically following a 1 reduction in water allocations the total surplus falls by 0 13 with unrestricted trading and 0 35 with restricted trading table 5 model 2 shows the difference in the externality cost adjusted income between the restricted and unrestricted trading scenarios specifically when a conservative measure of externality costs is included the difference in income between the two trading scenarios is only 1 35 so once externality costs are included the gap in performance between the two market structures closes substantially the decline in adjusted income for every percentage point increase in allocation cut is the same for both structures 5 3 farm level behavior and impacts this sub section examines the impact of farm size on the probability of buying and selling water from the market table 6 model 1 shows that large farms are more likely to be water buyers than sellers and this tendency increases with unrestricted trading the cut level has a marginal impact on the probability of buying water in table 6 most of the interaction variables are statistically significant but small to assist with interpreting the results fig 5 plots the probability of buying and selling water against farm size for restricted and unrestricted trading with no change in water availability and a 30 reduction in water allocations the probability of buying water is positively correlated with farm size while selling water is negatively correlated with farm size if we then consider the 50 probability point as the threshold for predicting buying or selling the buying plots show a smaller average farm size for those predicted to purchase water i with restricted trading than unrestricted trading and ii when water availability decreases for both market conditions with no change in water availability those predicted to be water sellers have the same farm size for both market conditions when water availability decreases by 30 the size of farms predicted to be sellers of water increases but the threshold size of farms is approximately the same for both market structures table 7 reports the regression model results that explore the relationship between farm size and aggregate income over the range of farm sizes considered total farm income increases with farm size fig 6 shows the results for two different levels of water availability i across all market structures small farms have similar incomes for a given level of water availability but larger farms enjoy greater gains from trading as farm size increases and ii for a given market condition and farm size income is always lower with reduced water availability 6 discussion in 2004 the various australian governments signed the national water initiative nwi clause 23 of the nwi committed these governments to work toward 10 water reform objectives full implementation of this national water agreement will result in a nationally compatible market regulatory and planning based system of managing surface and groundwater resources for rural and urban use that optimizes economic social and environmental outcomes by achieving the following i clear and nationally compatible characteristics for secure water access entitlements ii transparent statutory based water planning iii statutory provision for environmental and other public benefit outcomes and improved environmental management practices iv complete the return of all currently overallocated or overused systems to environmentally sustainable levels of extraction v progressive removal of barriers to trade in water and meeting other requirements to facilitate the broadening and deepening of the water market with an open trading market to be in place vi clarity around the assignment of risk arising from future changes in the availability of water for the consumptive pool vii water accounting which is able to meet the information needs of different water systems in respect to planning monitoring trading environmental management and on farm management viii policy settings which facilitate water use efficiency and innovation in urban and rural areas ix addressing future adjustment issues that may impact on water users and communities and x recognition of the connectivity between surface and groundwater resources and connected systems managed as a single resource 3 3 intergovernmental agreement on a national water initiative between the commonwealth of australia and the governments of new south wales victoria queensland south australia the australian capital territory and the northern territory objectives i iv v vi and vii are directly related to facilitating water trading the most important of these objectives is to create a secure water access entitlement system objective i but the western australian government has failed to do this productivity commission 2021 trade in groundwater extraction rights is technically possible in western australia however there is no tenure security as the terms for the right to extract groundwater are granted on a relatively short fixed term basis and there is no guarantee of license renewal or renewal for the previously licensed amount this substantially limits the possibility of trade in groundwater the fact that land tenure and groundwater rights are legally separate but in practical terms joint further limits the extent to which any substantial trade in groundwater rights can occur in western australia one reason for the slow progress in creating the legislative framework to support groundwater trading is the concern that trading will lead to localized over extraction externalities this study calibrated to real world data found that local extraction externalities are present with unrestricted trading when a narrow definition was used for the extraction externality the economic gain from unrestricted trading largely disappeared relative to restricted within zone only trading this result relied on the mid point estimate from the economic regulation authority s relatively uncertain and narrowly defined estimate of the economic externality range 302 416 ml we deem this sufficient evidence to conclude that the gain from unrestricted trade across the gnangara groundwater system is insufficient to justify a move to unrestricted trading relative to restricted trading the potential for localized over extraction externality effects is a generally relevant finding and a design characteristic that should be considered in all groundwater markets material gains will still occur from within zone only trading if there are enough license holders within the existing zones with sufficiently different businesses farm income increased by 13 7 for the restricted trading scenario with the current extraction limits however the gnangara groundwater system is over allocated under restricted trading we calculated that horticultural water extraction could be reduced by 14 while maintaining existing production levels a reduction of this magnitude is in the middle of the range of water allocation reductions discussed that would result in a sustainable water balance in the system in contrast in a scenario with no water trading a 14 reduction in water allocations is associated with a 14 6 reduction in farm income water trading can therefore be seen as a mechanism to restore environmental balance without any material losses in agricultural production this result is relevant to the case study location and all locations where groundwater supports agricultural production as system level water availability declined the auction market clearing prices generally increased restricted trading with no reduction in water availability resulted in a median market clearing water price of 1758 ml with 90 of the market clearing prices between 1705 ml and 1806 ml when overall water availability decreased by 30 the median market clearing water price was 1940 ml with 90 of the market clearing prices between 1899 ml and 1975 ml as noted in the introduction groundwater is a globally important source of drinking water for the greater perth region the long run marginal cost lrmc of water supply is determined by the cost of desalinated water current estimates of lrmc are already substantially higher than the market clearing price for groundwater found in this study and lrmc is forecast to increase substantially with time economic regulation authority 2017 perth s main water utility has existing extraction bores in most gnangara sub regions and depending on the assumptions made the water utility s mean estimate of lrmc in 2020 dollars is between 3000 ml and 3970 ml economic regulation authority 2017 the nwi objectives suggest that the water utility and any other interested parties should be allowed to participate in groundwater markets given the difference in the value of water to the utility and the value of agricultural production gross margin allowing the water utility to purchase water from irrigators would likely result in a permanent large reduction in horticultural production in the area but also generate a large net benefit an area for additional policy development is therefore the approved possible land uses in areas currently zoned for agricultural production in a free market the fact that water might be allocated away from agriculture is a result relevant outside the specific case study example context and highlights the issue of market rule design national and sub national governments may have a range of objectives relating to agricultural production in any given region the highest value user of water may not be the agriculture sector but could be industry or a water utility when groundwater trading is introduced the implications of transferring water from agricultural production to other use types should be considered finally we note some future possible study extensions and limitations the optimization simulation framework used in this paper could be expanded by 1 including other major groundwater users such as local government industry and the local water utility in the trading market 2 exploring the market performance of other pricing mechanisms such as discriminatory vickrey and second price auctions in terms of limitations we assume participation in the market is motivated by profit maximization farmers and other potential participants in the market could be motivated by factors other than profit maximization surveying these participants about their motivations would shed light on the validity of this assumption declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have
