11135,photosynthesis is a complex process that is intrinsically determined by two main components the co2 diffusion from the atmosphere to the chloroplast and the biochemistry among co2 diffusion mesophyll conductance within the leaf g m has been receiving attention in the recent years as a key player determining photosynthesis both across species and in response to the environment furthermore g m estimation allows for disentangling the complete set of photosynthesis underlying mechanisms in a water limited scenario where crop productivity and efficiency need to be increased the analysis of available data from photosynthesis among vascular plants and its response to water stress results helpful for a better understanding of crop management and improvement here photosynthesis data are compiled to elucidate if crop and wild species from different growth forms present different photosynthesis limitations under optimum and water stress conditions from the available data a double process of apparent photosynthesis selection is revealed higher values from ferns to woody and herbaceous species and among angiosperms a tendency towards greater photosynthesis in crop species although constrained by growth form the causes of such photosynthesis variation are discussed moreover crop and herbaceous species present a shift in photosynthesis limitations towards lower mesophyll diffusion constraints under both well watered and water stress conditions these particular photosynthesis characteristics in crops present several implications for the possible improvement of co2 assimilation and water use efficiency providing new guidelines for future engineering and management in agriculture keywords photosynthesis limitations mesophyll conductance crops water stress improvement 1 introduction increasing water scarcity will be a major challenge along the 21st century with agriculture being one of the most affected areas as currently 70 of the available fresh water is used for crop production morison et al 2008 moreover due to the expected population rise in the next decades and the desertification in some areas e g the mediterranean basis there will be an increasing demand for food production per land tilman et al 2002 schultz 2016 achieving both increased yields and more crop per drop i e higher water productivity is one of the main challenges of plant physiology evans 1997 as photosynthesis is the key process associated with plant growth and productivity the study of its underlying mechanisms and its complex response to water depletion is key for understanding how plants perform under stress and to elucidate if there is any room for improving yield and water productivity loreto and centritto 2008 within the photosynthetic or carbon assimilation process a new player has recently received attention as a suitable candidate for achieving these goals mesophyll conductance to co2 g m flexas et al 2012 2016 in this paper we will use the currently available data in different species and water stress conditions to analyse how g m and or other factors limiting photosynthesis such as stomatal conductance g s and photosynthetic biochemistry reflected by maximum carboxylation rate by the enzyme rubisco v cmax and the electron transport rate etr vary across growth forms and determine photosynthesis under drought in turn this knowledge could help us to disentangle to which extent net assimilation a n and water use efficiency at the leaf level can be improved 1 1 photosynthesis importance of mesophyll conductance photosynthesis in c3 plants can be described as a combined diffusional and biochemical process flexas et al 2004 von caemmerer et al 2009 the diffusional component comprehends the path of co2 from the atmosphere c a to the substomatal cavity c i and finally the chloroplast c c including the stomatal pore and the mesophyll tissue the biochemical component includes the co2 fixation in the calvin cycle and the synthesis of atp and nadph in the electron transport chain capture of light energy or photochemistry stomatal conductance regulates the diffusion of both h2o g sw and co2 g sc as they share a common path through the stomatal pore they can be related as g sw 1 6 g sc in early studies it was thought that photosynthesis was determined only by g s and biochemistry being g m neglected as it was considered to be very large farquhar et al 1980 however an increasing amount of evidence has now revealed the importance of co2 diffusion through the mesophyll as a key player in the regulation of photosynthesis rates flexas et al 2008 warren 2008 mesophyll conductance comprehends the co2 path from the substomatal cavity to the sites of carboxylation by the enzyme ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco therefore g m includes several steps that can be considered as separated resistances within the leaf see evans et al 2009 for a detailed depiction of the co2 path inside leaves carbon dioxide has to diffuse from the intercellular air spaces of the leaf mesophyll enter the liquid phase overcoming the resistances imposed by the cell wall and lipid membranes and finally reach the chloroplast stroma among these steps cell wall protein catalysed processes and chloroplast distribution have been identified as key traits determining g m flexas et al 2012 pérez martín et al 2014 onoda et al 2017 however mesophyll conductance is not only determined by the series of physical barriers inside leaves but also by the interplay of mitochondrial co2 release and net photosynthesis tholen et al 2012b which adds difficulty in determining g m short term responses xiao and zhu 2017 photosynthesis decrease under water depletion was firstly thought to be mainly due to stomatal and biochemical limitations chaves et al 2009 although it was not clear which of the two components was the main driver of declining photosynthesis lawlor 2002 flexas et al 2004 however in the 1990s some studies pointed out that a decrease of mesophyll conductance would also constrain co2 diffusion during water stress roupsard et al 1996 tourneux and peltier 1995 renou et al 1990 this potential role of g m was later confirmed in the early 2000s in different species flexas et al 2002 2004 warren et al 2004 the measurements performed by grassi and magnani 2005 in oak quercus robur and ash fraxynus oxyphylla showed that mesophyll conductance played a significant role in photosynthesis decrease in the field under drought conditions g m imposed a significant limitation to photosynthesis revealing that the biochemical constraint was lower than suspected flexas et al 2002 grassi and magnani 2005 galmés et al 2007 moreover its inclusion in carbon fixation models showed an improved accuracy between measured and predicted assimilation under stress niinemets et al 2009 keenan et al 2010 cano et al 2013 therefore mesophyll conductance has to be considered in photosynthesis studies aiming to determine causes of photosynthesis variability and its limitations under stress grassi and magnani 2005 warren 2008 and in order to accurately determine biochemistry parameters ethier and livingston 2004 von caemmerer et al 2009 1 2 domestication syndrome in photosynthesis the domestication syndrome is the set of traits that have undergone human driven selection in crops classical traits considered to be part of the domestication syndrome are the elimination or reduction in seed dispersal the trend towards increased fruit seed size and the loss of germination inhibition etc fuller 2007 which are not usually embraced under natural selection allaby 2010 vaughan et al 2007 according to milla et al 2015 the domestication syndrome definition can be more restricted only those traits differing between progenitors and the very earliest domesticates descending from a given center of origin are true signatures of domestication however recent revisions of the domestication syndrome in food crops suggest that there are no clear traits selected in all domestication events instead the package of selected traits is depending on crop subsets based on taxonomy geography and agricultural purposes abbo et al 2014 meyer et al 2012 photosynthesis is one of the main processes that determines plant growth and performance poorter and remkes 1990 and may shape plant life strategies even in the same environment feng et al 2008 it is unlikely that higher photosynthetic capacity was actively selected during plant domestication events however photosynthesis may have undergone some process of natural selection under cultivation as a part of the hypothesized shift towards favored resource acquisition traits in agricultural systems denison 2009 milla et al 2015 however early studies found that for several crop plants e g barley bean the highest assimilation values were found among their wild relatives chapin et al 1989 evans 1993 gonzález et al 1995 among others for others rice no clear tendency has been observed giulani et al 2013 xiong et al 2017 only in some cases cultivated species showed higher assimilation rates compared to their wild relatives study case for cassava pujol et al 2008 on the other hand few studies have compared in broad terms crop and wild species gago et al 2014 showed that crops displayed some tendency towards increased a n gs g m and v cmax whereas rotundo and cipriotti 2017 contrasted photosynthetic n use efficiency in crops and wild species both studies highlighted the importance of considering growth form when comparing crops with other species putting crop photosynthesis and its performance under both optimal and water limited conditions into a wider botanical context is key to unveil if there is still room for improving crop yield and water productivity flood et al 2011 long et al 2006 1 3 objectives the analysis of the available empirical data reporting photosynthesis parameters and specifically photosynthesis limitations may be a good approach to identify the key components shaping co2 assimilation among vascular plants moreover it is of critical importance to consider specifically crop species as they would be the targets of any attempt to improve yield and water use growth form effect should also be included as it may impose an important constraint in crop species gago et al 2014 finally as water availability is and will be a critical limitation to crop productivity the photosynthesis response to water stress has also to be considered bearing this in mind the main objectives of the present analysis are to 1 describe the photosynthesis parameters a n g s g m and biochemical capacity variation across vascular plants under optimal conditions and discuss its possible structural and biochemical sources 2 determine if crop species within each growth form present a higher photosynthetic capacity together with changes in the parameters determining net assimilation and to analyse if crops present any modification of photosynthesis limiting factors compared to wild species 3 determine if the photosynthesis response to water stress differs among growth forms and or shows any specific crop effect 4 model whether improvements in any single or combined photosynthetic parameter could be an effective way to increase assimilation and water use efficiency in crop species of different growth forms the present work differs from previous meta analysis of photosynthesis data flexas et al 2013a gago et al 2014 onoda et al 2017 where limitations to photosynthesis were not the main focus the approach followed here considering photosynthesis in terms of its limiting factors would help disentangling the main constraints to assimilation rate and hopefully provide useful tools for future photosynthesis enhancement by identifying specific targets among its components 2 material and methods 2 1 photosynthesis parameters across species literature search values of net assimilation rate a n stomatal g sc and mesophyll g m conductances to co2 covering a wide range of species were obtained from the database provided in flexas et al 2013b and complemented with more recent studies see photos param ww dataset in supp mat values for each species refer to the mean from various leaves individuals of unstressed plants however growth conditions may differ between studies indoors or outdoors field or pot sown light regime etc the complete set of gas exchange parameters per species and study was included if g m was estimated by any of the currently accepted methods described in pons et al 2009 and when measurements were performed after sufficient steady state time at ambient co2 concentration saturating light and leaf temperature around 25 c the resulting database comprehends 275 entries covering 240 different taxa and 23 new studies added to the flexas et al 2013b database values for the same species from different studies were considered separately the different species were arranged by growth form grasses herbs woody deciduous and evergreens gymnosperms and ferns crop and wild species within each growth form were also distinguished for angiosperms as in previous compilation studies gago et al 2014 rotundo and cipriotti 2017 species were considered as crops following the criteria for food crops defined in meyer et al 2012 although gymnosperms and ferns are not proper growth forms which refers to structural aspects they are considered as separate groups due to their unique combination of leaf traits tosens et al 2016 verheijen et al 2016 as one of the aims of this analysis is to determine whether crop photosynthesis is different from wild species in its assimilation rates and or limitations only artificially selected historical plant species genotypes were considered as crops meyer et al 2012 in order to increase the available data and for the limitation analysis see below co2 concentrations at the atmosphere c a substomatal cavity c i and site of carboxylation c c were also compiled if any of the mentioned parameters was not provided it was estimated whenever possible using the fick s first law of diffusion equations flexas et al 2013a 1 a n g sc c a c i 2 a n g m c c c i 2 2 limitation approach in the present analysis photosynthesis limitations are estimated using the method described by jones 1985 and modified by grassi and magnani 2005 in this approach the total photosynthetic limitation is divided into the relative limitations of stomata l s mesophyll l m and biochemistry l b the limitations approach is useful because enables to disclosure the underlying mechanisms of the assimilation rate knowing the relative contribution of each parameter g s g m and biochemistry usually v cmax may allow to identify the limiting factor s under stress or even to predict the most suitable target for photosynthesis improvement in the present study the ratio a n c c at c a of 360 400 ppm was used as a proxy of a c c in order to take into account the biochemistry limitations because v cmax was often unavailable in the published studies showing data for g s and g m 2 3 photosynthesis limitations under water stress for determining the general pattern of photosynthesis decrease under water stress by growth form another database covering water stress studies in different species was compiled see photos lim ws dataset in supp mat in this case due to the limitation approach taken in the present analysis we consider only studies where photosynthesis limitations were estimated as described in grassi and magnani 2005 and where g s during stress was also depicted in this case the stomatal sl mesophyll ml and biochemical capacity or maximum carboxylation rate bl absolute limitations are the contributions to the relative change in assimilation rate when a non stressed a n value is taken as a reference grassi and magnani 2005 as an example the sum of sl ml and bl total limitation tl is zero when photosynthesis is un stressed and is 50 when a n is reduced to half the contribution of each component may vary it is worth mentioning that most of the studies considered in the present work did not account for cuticular conductance g c which may result in a slight overestimation of c i and consequently ml tominaga et al 2018 2 4 simulations assimilation a n and intrinsic water use efficiency wue i improvement by modifying a different combination of g s g m and v cmax was simulated using the fvcb model equations for assimilation rate including co2 diffusion through the mesophyll von caemmerer et al 2009 and equations 1 and 2 an iterative approach using microsoft excel solver tool was used for calculating the resulting a n and wue i modification when increasing a certain percentage either g s g m or v cmax or any combination of them as seen in flexas 2016 this approach was used in the initial gas exchange data unstressed plants from different crop species each representative of a different growth form nicotiana tabacum herb triticum aestivum gen gk forrás grass vitis vinifera cv malvasia woody deciduous and olea europaea var manzanilla woody evergreen from galmés et al 2006 olsovska et al 2016 el aou ouad et al 2016 and pérez martín et al 2009 respectively the photosynthesis parameters of these species are depicted in table 2 2 5 statistical analysis differences among growth forms and crop and wild species were addressed using either one or two way anova considering only growth form effect or both crop and growth form effects differences among plant groups were later analyzed using hsd tukey test responses to drought limitations against relative g s were modelled using quadratic polynomial fittings all analyses were performed using r statistical software r core team 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 photosynthesis parameters across plant groups 3 1 1 variability in assimilation rates a total amount of 275 taxonomic entries were considered for the gas exchange data across crops in growth forms under optimal conditions photos param ww dataset in supp mat fig 1 a shows the assimilation values included in this analysis arranged by growth form and within the angiosperms by being crop or wild species the net assimilation values a n ranged from 40 2 in the grass crop triticum aestivum von caemmerer and evans 1991 to 1 4 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 in the evergreen citrus reticulata lloyd et al 1992 there is a strong growth form effect p value 0 0001 one way anova pooling together crop and wild species mean a n increased from ferns 5 9 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 and gymnosperms 8 9 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 to woody angiosperms 10 2 and 12 1 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 in deciduous and evergreens respectively and finally to herbs 16 1 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 and grasses 22 4 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 mean values of these groups match with those reported in larger scale meta analysis onoda et al 2017 wright et al 2005 as co2 diffusion is a strong determinant of assimilation flexas et al 2013a in order to determine the underlying traits shaping photosynthesis across and within growth form it is important to consider the variability of stomatal g s and mesophyll g m conductances 3 1 2 stomatal conductance and water use efficiency as assimilation stomatal conductance g sc increases across growth forms from lowest in ferns to highest in grasses and herbaceous species fig 1 b p value 0 0001 one way anova ferns presented the lowest mean values 0 07 mol co2 m 2 s 1 followed by gymnosperms 0 12 mol co2 m 2 s 1 and woody angiosperms 0 15 mol co2 m 2 s 1 herbs 0 20 mol co2 m 2 s 1 and grasses 0 29 mol co2 m 2 s 1 presented the highest values these g sc ranges observed across growth forms especially the differences observed between ferns gymnosperms and angiosperms may be explained by the leaf venation development among land plants and the link between leaf hydraulics and g s brodribb et al 2007 leaf hydraulic conductance k leaf and g s are mechanistically related as both take into account the transpiration rate of the leaf in their respective estimation flexas et al 2013b gago et al 2014 being stomatal conductance one of the main drivers of net assimilation flexas et al 2013a k leaf and a n are closely related across plant groups brodribb et al 2007 sack et al 2013 and even within genus xiong et al 2014 scoffoni et al 2016 water use efficiency wue may be referred to many levels from whole plant to the leaf level morison et al 2008 flexas et al 2010 when considering the leaf level the ratio a n g sw is defined as the intrinsic water use efficiency wue i the use of a n g sw instead of the co2 assimilated per h2o transpired a n e allows for considering water use efficiency at a common evaporative demand osmond et al 1980 due to the similar increase in both a n and g sw across all groups r 2 0 61 p value 0 0001 quadratic polynomial fit no differences in wue i were detected p value 0 055 one way anova however wue i did show a high degree of variability within each group supp mat fig s1 greater among woody angiosperms and ferns 14 and 7 fold range respectively compared to herbs and grasses 6 and 3 fold range respectively highest values corresponded to woody angiosperm species maximum value of 143 μmol co2 mol 1 h2o reported in the gymnosperm macrozamia spiralis tosens et al 2012 whereas maximum values for herbs and grasses only reached 99 μmol co2 mol 1 h2o in the herbaceous allium ursinum hommel et al 2014 and 82 μmol co2 mol 1 h2o in the grass stipa grandis xu and zhou 2011 minimum values varied little among groups being the lowest 11 μmol co2 mol 1 h2o in the evergreen eucalyptus sieberi douthe et al 2011 in previous reports wue i did not vary between herbs and woody species gago et al 2014 in contrast to a n and g s it seems that wue i has not experienced a positive selection towards higher values from ferns to fast growing herbs and grasses however it has been suggested that short term stomatal response may have evolved to prevent excessive water loss under non optimal conditions for carbon fixation brodribb et al 2009 thus favoring a dynamic wue i in response to the environmental factors over high wue i under well watered optimal conditions nonetheless the existing range across species indicates that species operate differently over the a n g s relationship which may be dependent not on growth form but on environmental conditions for example mediterranean sclerophylls show higher wue i than their temperate counterparts flexas et al 2014 the naturally occurring variability on wue i may offer some opportunities for selection towards higher water efficiency in crops 3 1 3 mesophyll conductance role of leaf anatomy the strong differentiation by growth form in g sc can also be found for mesophyll conductance fig 1 c p value 0 0001 one way anova indeed a n also escalates positively with g m r 2 0 68 p value 0 0001 quadratic polynomial fit and both conductances are also correlated with each other r 2 0 52 p value 0 0001 linear fit the general pattern of g m values across growth forms follows the same trend as g sc mean g m is lowest in ferns 0 06 mol co2 m 2 s 1 gymnosperms and woody angiosperms present higher values 0 09 and 0 15 mol co2 m 2 s 1 respectively and finally herbs 0 25 mol co2 m 2 s 1 and grasses 0 43 mol co2 m 2 s 1 present the highest values as for a n and g sc there are no differences between deciduous and evergreen woody angiosperms however it is possible that within a narrower scale deciduous species show greater g m values than their evergreen relatives e g in quercus species peguero pina et al 2017a the g m differences across plant groups from lowest in ferns and woody species to highest in herbs and grasses may be strongly related to cell wall thickness t cw indeed ferns gymnosperms and woody evergreen species present the highest values of t cw among vascular plants tomàs et al 2013 carriquí et al 2016 tosens et al 2016 veromann jürgenson et al 2017 whereas herbaceous species present thinner cell walls tomàs et al 2013 onoda et al 2017 in fact leaf anatomy parameters such as cell wall thickness and chloroplast size and distribution may have been key drivers in leaf assimilation and productivity evolution peguero pina et al 2017b veromann jürgenson et al 2017 stomatal and mesophyll conductances may be correlated as they reflect to segments of the co2 pathway in the leaf as stated earlier leaf hydraulic conductance strongly determines stomatal conductance in turn it has been reported a significant correlation between k leaf and g m for different species flexas et al 2013b xiong et al 2017 water and carbon dioxide molecules may share a common path inside the leaf the mesophyll cell walls a recent theoretical approach by buckley 2015 suggests that apoplastic water transport i e through the cell wall represents the most important path of water movement outside the xylem therefore the shared path of both co2 and h2o across the cell wall may constitute the mechanistic basis of the coordination between k leaf and g m the fact that g m is strongly related to hydraulic conductance outside the xylem k ox reinforces this possible link xiong et al 2017 3 1 4 biochemistry importance of rubisco assimilation rate at a given co2 concentration at the carboxylation sites c c depends on biochemistry mechanisms calvin cycle enzymes and photochemistry structure farquhar et al 1980 therefore the ratio a n c c at 400 ppm can be used as a proxy for the photosynthetic biochemical capacity grassi and magnani 2005 indeed a n c c tightly correlates with maximum velocity of carboxylation v cmax and maximum electron transport rate j max in a survey of different species from ferns to angiosperms nadal unpublished data in addition as v cmax and j max are tightly coordinated at 25 c across species medlyn et al 2002 singsaas et al 2003 a n c c is a good proxy for both carbon fixation and photochemical processes when comparing a n c c across growth forms similar differences as seen for the other gas exchange parameters arise between groups fig 1 d p value 0 0001 one way anova for growth form effect grasses and herbs present the highest values means of 0 11 and 0 08 mol m 2 s 1 respectively woody angiosperms present intermediate values 0 07 for both deciduous and evergreens and finally gymnosperms 0 06 and ferns 0 04 present the lowest a n c c when considering v cmax and etr electron transport rate the differences found in a n c c are maintained for example carriquí et al 2016 reported higher etr and v cmax in angiosperms when compared to ferns grown under the same conditions as for the other parameters there is a high range of variation within each group higher biochemical capacity is mostly related to rubisco content and activity von caemmerer et al 2009 and electron transport components such as photosystem ii dwyer et al 2012 and chlorophyll content sage et al 1987 singsaas et al 2003 the biochemistry component of photosynthesis is determined by the protein complexes that constitute the calvin cycle and the electron transport chain as a result nitrogen availability and also phosphorus is a strong determinant of both v cmax and etr evans and poorter 2001 and consequently photosynthesis wright et al 2004 onoda et al 2017 recent studies across plant groups show a possible tendency for increased rubisco contents per total soluble proteins in angiosperms compared to ferns and gymnosperms galmés et al 2014b although more data are needed in order to provide evolutionary trends regarding rubisco content and activation among rubisco kinetics parameters specificity factor s c o tends to be higher in ferns and woody evergreens compared to deciduous and herbaceous species galmés et al 2005 gago et al 2013 implying a higher affinity in the former but possibly also a lower carboxylation capacity galmés et al 2014a which could be reflected in the lower biochemistry capacity observed for these groups fig 1d overall the present data compilation shows a clear variation in assimilation rate due to simultaneous variations in all of its underlying parameters stomatal and mesophyll conductances and biochemistry all gas exchange parameters follow the same pattern across groups from lowest in ferns and gymnosperms intermediate in woody angiosperms to highest in herbs and grasses among the main causes of this raise in photosynthetic capacity leaf anatomy may explain the raise from ferns to angiosperms leaf venation and cell wall characteristics brodribb et al 2007 tosens et al 2016 veromann jürgenson et al 2017 and mesophyll characteristics and n use are likely to be the main responsible for the higher values in herbaceous compared to woody species onoda et al 2017 3 2 crop effect among photosynthetic parameters from the results described above it can be seen that the variation range of each photosynthetic component is partly determined by growth form therefore in order to unveil a possible selective pressure towards higher assimilation rates in crops gago et al 2014 it is important to consider this process within each growth form and to identify the potential anatomical and biochemical traits responsible of this differentiation main leaf traits determining gas exchange parameters are described above the factor crop imposes a significant effect for all photosynthetic parameters within each growth form fig 1 p value 0 05 two way anova considering both factors crop and growth form mean assimilation values in crop species are higher than in wild species for all growth forms fig 1 a p value 0 0001 the interaction term crop x gf is non significant in all cases i e there is a similar increase for all growth forms with the exception of g m fig 1 c p value 0 0008 for the interaction term where there is only a slight increase in woody species compared to herbaceous and grass species the concomitant increase of a n and g sw in crops results in a similar wue i in crop and wild species p value 0 86 supp mat fig s1 other studies have compared the photosynthetic differentiation between crops and wild species within each growth form see gago et al 2014 where herbs shrubs and trees are considered here this differentiation is slightly different considering grasses and evergreen vs deciduous in woody species but the main trend for a n g sc and g m is similar to the reported by gago et al 2014 the factor crop is highly significant in determining a n mean 35 65 higher in crops pooling all growth forms although herbaceous species do not present an increase as clear as in the other groups the general pattern of higher assimilation in crop compared to wild species within each growth form does not necessarily imply that cultivated plants have undergone a process of natural selection under cultivation milla et al 2015 studies within closely related species did not show a clear tendency towards enhanced photosynthesis in cultivated species compared to their wild relatives e g chapin et al 1989 evans 1993 gonzález et al 1995 xiong et al 2017 as the species considered here represent a high diversity for both crop and wild species across all growth forms it may be possible that the wild ancestors already presented higher assimilation as found for other functional traits in fertile crescent crops cuniff et al 2014 but not for all of the domestication syndrome traits preece et al 2015 3 3 differences in photosynthesis limitations the relative limitation approach performed here modified from grassi and magnani 2005 allows to observe interesting trends derived from growth form and crop selection fig 2 growth form effect was observed in mesophyll l m and biochemical l b limitations where grasses and herbs present a l m lower and a higher l b than other growth forms fig 2 a p value 0 05 two way anova considering both factors crop and growth form the crop effect poses a significant difference among diffusive limitations l m shows a significant crop effect fig 2a p value 0 0045 two way anova indicating a lower constrain of co2 through the mesophyll in crop species this pattern is clearer in herbs and grasses where g m is strongly differentiated between crop and wild species fig 1d high g m could potentially account for the increased photosynthetic n use efficiency observed in certain grass crops rotundo and cipriotti 2017 in contrast l s does not present any significant effect fig 2b p value 0 64 for factor crop two way anova this different crop effect in the conductances results in a different l m l s ratio between crop and wild species reproduced in each growth form although wild grasses also present a low l m l s fig 2 c p value 0 0078 two way anova wild species present the whole range of l m l s values however crop species seem to be selected towards lower l m l s more related to a greater increase of g m rather than a decrease in g sc fig 1 b and c this pattern in diffusive limitations is also observed in the ratio g m g sc being slightly higher in crops p value 0 006 for crop effect two way anova however this does not translate into higher wue i despite the suggestion that g m g sc would be an adequate parameter for wue i selection galmés et al 2011a the lower diffusive limitations in crops by lowering l m results in a re balance in limitations compared to wild species however no clear crop effect is detected in l b fig 2 d p value 0 1467 two way anova nonetheless crops present a limited range of diffusive limitations l d l m l s per biochemical limitations l d l b close to 1 in woody species and lower 0 5 in grasses and herbaceous supp mat fig s2 in all growth forms wild species present higher maximum l m l s and l d l b this could imply a selection towards low diffusive constraints mainly due to a greater enhancement of g m relative to g sc this may indicate a lower investment in leaf structure in crop species enhancing a fast strategy promoting rapid growth and high productivity rather than leaf resistance feng et al 2008 in this regard tribouillois et al 2015 found lower values for bulk structural parameters lma and leaf dry matter content in cover crops than in wild species although other studies did not find such trend xiong et al 2015 the reduction in diffusive resistances is accentuated in herb and grass crops compared to woody crops nonetheless the latter also present this pattern indicating a common differentiation in all growth forms interestingly wild species present a somewhat more balanced photosynthesis limitation pattern whereas crops are biased towards lower structural high g m derived constraints future work is needed in order to determine the causes of such high g m reflected in low l m in crops low cell wall thickness could be an important player as crop species are situated in the low end of the t cw reported for seed plants onoda et al 2017 veromann jürgenson et al 2017 however a novel study highlights the importance of cell wall composition in also determining g m ellsworth et al 2018 this first direct evidence provided by ellsworth and col could open the path for further research disentangling the detailed mechanics of co2 diffusion in crop species overall the reduction in l m compared to l s and l b in crop and herbaceous species will have important implications for its behaviour under water stress conditions and the improvement approach 3 4 photosynthesis limitations in response to water stress studies monitoring sl bl ml and g s under water stress conditions were used in the present analysis relative stomatal conductance percentage of a maximum value for each species within study was taken as an indicator of water stress following flexas et al 2004 the different literature entries describing photosynthesis limitations upon water stress 11 in total are depicted in table 1 although there is an acceptable coverage among angiosperms of herbaceous n 5 woody deciduous n 9 and woody evergreen n 11 species to the best of our knowledge there are no studies neither for grasses gymnosperms or ferns moreover few crops within each growth form have been studied being the most common grapevine and olive for woody deciduous and evergreen respectively 3 4 1 general pattern of photosynthesis under stress the pattern of stomatal mesophyll and biochemical limitations described in grassi and magnani 2005 is very similar in the resulting analysis of data from later studies including different species fig 3 using stomatal conductance as the indicator of water stress allows to unveil the dynamics of each component contribution to photosynthesis decrease stomatal conductance is usually considered to be the first gas exchange parameter affected by water stress flexas et al 2004 using the polynomial fittings determined across species depicted in fig 3 an almost linear relationship appears r 2 0 98 between the percentage of g s decrease normalized g s and the total limitations accounting for relative assimilation reduction see supp mat fig s3 overall this approach shows that a 50 reduction in g s accounts for an approximately 35 assimilation decrease these results confirm a well known counterbalance of mild drought although there is an increase of wue i it is concomitant with a reduction in assimilation galmés et al 2011a cano et al 2014 flexas et al 2016 flexas 2016 mesophyll conductance imposes an increasing limitation as water stress progresses ml being approximately half of sl along the g s range fig 3 therefore under moderate water stress conditions the reduction in both g s and g m accounts for most of the photosynthesis decrease grassi and magnani 2005 galmés et al 2007 cano et al 2013 only under severe stress conditions the decrease in biochemical capacity v cmax and j max begins to affect photosynthesis i e the metabolic impairment flexas et al 2004 chaves et al 2009 indeed bl only accounts for approximately 15 of total assimilation reduction when g s is reduced to 10 of its non stressed value estimated from polynomial fit from data depicted in fig 3 however biochemical and diffusive limitations interact as drought progresses the decrease in g s and g m reduces the co2 availability in the sites of carboxylation lower c c which in turn may lead to rubisco deactivation reducing v cmax galmés et al 2011b flexas et al 2006a this general pattern of photosynthesis limitations during water stress importance of diffusive limitations contribution of g m and biochemistry effect on later stages seems to be more related to drought duration than severity cano et al 2014 flexas et al 2009 3 4 2 causes of photosynthetic parameters decrease stomatal closure upon water stress was reported since early drought studies and constitutes the main driver of g s decrease chaves et al 2003 flexas et al 2004 it is thought to result from a combination of abscisic acid aba signaling and leaf turgor sensitivity rodríguez domínguez et al 2016 chaves et al 2003 moreover a loss in k leaf through both vessel embolism nardini et al 2003 and outside xylem path collapse scoffoni et al 2017 upon dehydration is also responsible of stomatal conductance decrease rodríguez domínguez et al 2016 hernandez santana et al 2016 probably accentuated under severe drought hochberg et al 2017 these processes may also affect g m wang et al 2018 théroux rancourt et al 2014 due to its possible mechanistic relationship with k ox xiong et al 2017 and its coordinated response with g s to aba increases upon stress mizokami et al 2015 sorrentino et al 2016 however the coordination of mesophyll and stomatal conductances during stress may be species specific flexas et al 2013a moreover g m decline under water stress could also be mediated by changes in mesophyll anatomy and or protein driven diffusion reviewed in nadal and flexas 2018 overall the interplay between all water and co2 diffusion components in decreasing photosynthesis is still under debate flexas et al 2018 biochemical capacity also experiences a decrease under water stress although its effects on photosynthesis are detected only under severe stress fig 3 both etr and v cmax decrease under water stress although the latter has been reported to follow a more threshold like relationship with g s galmés et al 2011a reduced rubisco content and activation has been attributed to v cmax decrease galmés et al 2011a perdomo et al 2017 whereas decreased efficiency in light energy conversion into electron transport may contribute to the decrease in etr flexas and medrano 2002 3 4 3 differences among growth forms the general response of photosynthesis limitations to decreasing g s differs among growth forms figs 4 and 5 although the order described earlier is maintained sl ml bl the relative contribution of each diffusive limitation changes among growth forms in fact the ratio sl ml bl is maintained in all growth forms along all g s range fig 5 derived from quadratic polynomial fittings stomatal limitations impose the highest limitation in herbaceous species especially under low g s on the other hand in evergreen species although sl still accounts for most of the diffusive limitations along all the g s range there is a shift towards an increased ml sl under severe stress conditions normalized g s 0 25 deciduous species behave following an intermediate pattern between herbaceous and evergreen species fig 5 thus the interplay between stomatal and mesophyll limitations depends on growth form under moderate and especially severe stress assimilation in herbs is mostly limited by g s whereas in woody evergreen species g m and g s impose a similar limitation although the data proceeds from different experimental conditions this survey allows to discern growth form effects that otherwise may be confounded in studies with fewer species galle et al 2011 galmés et al 2007 the analysis presented here shows that not only the different photosynthetic parameters need to be taken into account in modelling photosynthesis response to drought at the ecosystem level growth form predominance should also be considered keenan et al 2010 niinemets and keenan 2014 3 4 4 crop cases grapevine data available to accurately compare crop and wild species response to water stress are only sufficient within woody deciduous species and even in this case grapevine is the only crop where the photosynthesis limitation analysis has been performed when deciduous data is divided in the three vitis cultivars available and wild species the resulting responses resemble to the herbs versus evergreen differences stated earlier fig 4 the differences in diffusive limitations follow the same pattern sl in grapevine accounts for most of the assimilation reduction when g s is below half of the non stressed values whereas ml impose a significant reduction in wild species although there is little evidence and data is only available for vitis cultivars it seems that the pattern of sl being higher in fast growing high a n under non stressed conditions species is maintained both across and within growth forms this crop differentiation may reflect the non stressed photosynthesis limitations which later could determine the limitation pattern upon water stress as l m l s is clearly differentiated when comparing crop and wild species within woody deciduous plants fig 2c in this case the presumably anatomical characteristics in crops and herbaceous species leading to higher g m may preserve g m from exercising an excessive constraint both under optimal and water stress conditions future depiction of photosynthesis limitations upon drought in crop species would be necessary to confirm this pattern under stress most crop and wild woody species included in the analysis operate mostly in a g sw around 0 3 mol h2o m 2 s 1 under optimal conditions however it can be appreciated that total limitations in grapevine are low until g sw has dropped to 50 that is around 0 15 mol h2o m 2 s 1 which has been described as a first indicator of mild stress at which only co2 diffusion limitations to photosynthesis operate flexas et al 2004 2009 below this threshold total limitations increase and at 25 g s there is a 50 75 reduction in assimilation contrarily limitations increase more gradually in wild species fig 4 this may indicate that crops are able to sustain assimilation rates under mild stress possibly due to their higher g m and biochemical capacity despite the reduction in g s whereas wild species are promptly affected by g s decreases on the other hand it is also possible that the relationship of g m response with decreasing g s varies across species flexas et al 2013a resulting in the different limitation pattern moreover according to the data presented here slight g s decreases may result in improved wue i with minimum a n decrease the physiological diversity wue i response to decreasing stem water potential found in grapevine cultivars indicate that there is room for genotype selection towards greater efficiency under mild stress bota et al 2016 more studies unveiling photosynthesis limitations under water stress are needed to extend these preliminary results to other crops and to confirm the possible different behaviour in response to water stress between cultivated and wild species 3 5 photosynthesis improvement 3 5 1 improvement in a water limited scenario not only higher yields are necessary but also an increased water productivity despite the controversies regarding the improvement of wue i as a suitable target for greater water productivity blum 2005 higher wue i is still envisaged as a good mean for saving water in agriculture gago et al 2014 and has proven to be an accurate target in genotype selection flexas et al 2010 bunce 2016 li et al 2017 and engineering yang et al 2016 the modification of parameters that regulate or limit photosynthesis has been proposed as one of the means to increase both a n and wue i flexas et al 2013a gago et al 2014 flexas et al 2016 improving stomatal conductance has been disregarded because although it would increase a n it involves a concomitant decrease in wue i flexas et al 2010 on the other hand it is possible to achieve an increase in wue i through a reduction in g s but this would suppose a reduction in a n and in turn yield morison et al 2008 flexas et al 2013a therefore the holy grail for photosynthesis improvement is to achieve higher a n at a given value of g s mesophyll conductance and maximum carboxylation capacity of rubisco v cmax have been proposed as the best targets for increasing simultaneously both a n and wue i flexas et al 2016 there is an increasing amount of literature identifying the mechanistic traits determining both g m and v cmax evans et al 2009 flexas et al 2012 galmés et al 2014b pérez martín et al 2014 xiong et al 2015 flexas et al 2016 therefore providing specific targets for improving a n however translating this theoretical approach to actual experimental cases has proven to be an elusive matter with little success so far flexas 2016 aquaporin expression has been envisaged as one of the best targets for increasing g m indeed several studies have reported larger g m and a n as a result of enhanced ntaqp1 expression in tobacco flexas et al 2006b and tomato sade et al 2010 however this also resulted in larger g s and thus either unaffected or lower wue i this has been attributed to the transport of both co2 and h2o by aquaporins across lipid membranes sade et al 10 flexas et al 2012 studies in other traits yielded similar results for a complete depiction see flexas et al 2016 evidencing that enhancement of any single photosynthetic parameter usually implicates pleiotropic effects on the others resulting in little wue i improvement flexas 2016 moreover the data presented here suggests that crop species already present higher assimilation mostly through high g m thus lower l m than their wild counterparts the next section addresses if even higher assimilation could be achieved by modification of any of its underlying parameters 3 5 1 1 improvement simulation importance of growth form a simulation analysis was performed in four representative crops in order to determine if the modification of a n and wue i resulting from an increase in any parameter g s g m and v cmax is dependent of growth form figs 6 and 7 despite their different parameter values see table 2 the simultaneous increase of all parameters results in the same response an increase of 50 in g s g m and v cmax results in an assimilation value 50 higher and no wue i modification due to the a n and g s simultaneous increase however when considering each parameter separately a different response of a n and wue i is observed stomatal conductance improvement positively affects a n in all cases greatest in o europaea however this results in a concomitant decrease of wue i this reduction in wue i shows that the values taken for these species respond to non stressed conditions where a n and g s show an allometric relationship see flexas et al 2010 for an example in vitis data therefore under optimal conditions an increase in g s results in a decrease in wue i in all cases when considering increasing mesophyll conductance the simulation shows a clear difference between triticum aestivum grass and nicotiana tabacum herb on one hand and vitis vinifera woody deciduous and olea europaea woody evergreen on the other hand the latter species show higher a n and wue i at a common g m increase this higher response of woody species to g m modification may reflect their overall higher l m and l m l s ratio stomatal and mesophyll resistances work in series flexas et al 2013a so it can be expected that the lower conductance drives the total leaf conductance g tot as mesophyll conductance imposes a greater limitation in woody than herbaceous species it may be expected a greater sensitivity in woody species to any g m improvement as predicted for evergreen species regarding higher co2 availability niinemets et al 2011 however it is worth noting the overall little effect that a g m modification imposes to both a n and wue i a 50 increase in g m only results in an approximately 10 enhancement of a n and wue i in the best case woody species moreover there is no experimental evidence for such g m increase by modification of any of its underlying mechanistic components see compilation in flexas et al 2016 the little impact exercised by g m increase in the selected crop species may reflect the already reduced mesophyll limitations in crop species especially in herbs and grasses see section 3 2 in all cases the best results in terms of simultaneous increase of both a n and wue i emerge from the increase of both v cmax and g m if g s remains unaltered this results in approximately 30 and 25 higher a n and wue i respectively when v cmax and g m are increased by 50 olea europaea does not experience such an increase due to the higher g s limitation as evidenced by its higher sensitivity to g s increase however this improvement may be rather elusive due to the usually found g s g m coordination within species flexas et al 2013a decoupling stomatal and mesophyll conductance remains one of the most challenging aims of photosynthesis engineering aquaporin modification has yielded contrasting results see compilation in flexas et al 2016 but in some cases increases in assimilation have been reported tomato lines overexpressing ntaqp1 showed higher a n by 41 and even enhanced whole plant wue sade et al 2010 although no g m was reported and tobacco lines overexpressing aquaporin mcmipb from the cam plant mesembryanthemum crystallinum showed enhanced a n and g m by 45 and 53 although with no wue i modification kawase et al 2013 improving biochemistry and maintaining g s is the other way to achieve higher yields and water production the simulation with increasing v cmax offers more promising results than g m in all crop species a n and wue i around 20 higher at 50 v cmax moreover n tabacum and t aestivum show a greater increase 25 reflecting again the larger biochemical limitations present in grasses and herbs compared to woody species presented earlier in addition it is possible to decouple v cmax modification through rubisco carbamylation state from g s changes although this modification resulted in lower assimilation rates galmés et al 2013 nonetheless high v cmax increases without diffusion enhancement would inevitably lead to decreased c c which limits v cmax modification and highlights the need for parallel increase of both v cmax and g m flexas et al 2016 to date a n and wue i improvement by modifying rubisco related traits has proven an extremely elusive matter in the seven studies where modification of rubisco biochemistry was attempted reviewed in flexas et al 2016 only in just one case some a n and wue i improvement was achieved 18 and 8 respectively kontunen soppela et al 2010 3 5 1 2 improvement simulation performance under stress photosynthesis improvement approaches have also to be considered in a water limited scenario loreto and centritto 2008 it could be expected that in crop species where the stomatal limitations are low at the beginning of the water stress the combination of mild stress slight g s decrease and the improvement of g m and v cmax would result in a significant enhancement of wue i while compensating the decrease of a n due to lower g s flexas et al 2013a following the approach showed in figs 6 and 7 the same simulation approach was conducted for the species depicted in table 2 considering two scenarios mild drought where g s is at 75 of non stressed value and moderate drought where g s is at 50 and g m is also reduced at 75 whereas v cmax remains unaltered a realistic assumption under these stress conditions galmés et al 2007 2011a the results are showed in supp mat fig s4 for a n and supp mat fig s5 for wue i in any case only under mild stress conditions g s at 75 it is possible to compensate the decrease in a n or even in the case of v cmax and of the simultaneous increase of both g m and v cmax increase a n over the non stressed values by 20 in the best case scenario indeed wue i is greater in all cases due to the lower g s but may also be significantly improved up to 50 when g m and v cmax are enhanced by 50 however the initial parameters impose a significant limitation to any improvement attempt any increase of a n in o europaea is very limited due to the low non stressed g s of this species in addition the hypothetical improvement may not only be conditioned by the photosynthesis characteristics of the targeted species but also by the difficulty of overcoming the coordinated response of g s and g m under stress mizokami et al 2015 sorrentino et al 2016 3 5 2 future targets and guidelines the improvement simulation performed in different crop species under non stressed conditions shows that a significant improvement in v cmax and or g m is needed in order to achieve higher a n and wue i in all cases a 20 30 improvement in the desired traits requires v cmax and g m to be 50 higher than their maximum values under non stressed conditions to the best of our knowledge only aquaporin modification has been found to affect g m in such degree kawase et al 2013 and no such improvement has been reported for v cmax yet table 3 shows several insights for future research derived from the current work here it has been shown that crop and wild species are differentiated in their photosynthetic characteristics however the question regarding if crop photosynthesis did truly experience a domestication process remains unsolved in this regard the study of the wild relatives is a key point for future research both for determining the effects of domestication in photosynthesis and to provide a possible gene pool for crop breeding on the other hand specific targets for photosynthesis improvement are also provided in table 3 anatomical features have been regarded as the holy grail for g m improvement tholen et al 2012a however mesophyll limitations have proven to be already minimized in crops and g m simulation showed the lowest a n and wue i modification figs 6 and 7 nonetheless cell wall components may be an unexplored way to enhance g m in a recent study ellsworth et al 2018 showed in rice mutants that disruptions in cell wall mixed linkage glucan mlg production affects cell wall composition and properties translated into lower g m this study constitutes a novel finding supporting a key role of cell wall composition influencing g m which could provide a powerful tool for photosynthesis engineering however from the results of the simulation analysis and the data compilation it seems clear that v cmax and maybe other biochemical parameters are the key targets for higher productivity in crops at the leaf level to date no clear improvement has been achieved in gas exchange at the leaf level by modification of any of the photosynthesis underlying components flexas 2016 as already stated modification of g s along the a n g s relationship may result in a more effective way to improve water use efficiency work on aba receptors could provide useful tools for wue improvement yang et al 2016 on the other hand improvement based on increasing daily carbon gain per water loss rather than maximizing instantaneous assimilation i e improvement of light saturated a n indeed a recent compilation of soybean genotypes shows that carbon gain has been improved in recently released cultivars through maintaining high a n during midday and afternoon periods rather than enhanced maximum a n v cmax or g m koester et al 2016 these approaches could prove to be a good alternative for water productivity and yield enhancement in a fluctuating environment lawson et al 2012 4 concluding remarks photosynthesis is a complex multi trait process strongly influenced by anatomical biochemical and environmental parameters nonetheless as it is closely related to plant growth and therefore life cycle it has been shaped by natural selection this is reflected in the different rates reported for fern gymnosperm and angiosperm species moreover from the data presented here crop species and cultivars tend to present higher assimilation rates diffusive and biochemistry capacities than other wild species within each considered growth form the photosynthesis limitations approach across species under non stressed conditions unveiled a clear differentiation of crops there is a tendency in reducing mesophyll limitations a selection towards lower l m l s ratios this tendency is also present when comparing wild grasses to other growth forms this also reveals slightly increased biochemical limitations in crops the change in photosynthesis limitations in cultivated species poses several implications for their water stress response and yield improvement under non stressed conditions increased mesophyll conductance alone may have little effect in the resulting a n and wue i whereas the enhancement of v cmax significantly improves both a n and wue i however under water stress biochemical limitations are low and a potential v cmax modification would only be truly effective under well watered conditions although v cmax enhancement may compensate a n decrease in some cases overall the analysis presented here unveils the importance of considering empirical data in order to determine the importance of co2 diffusion and biochemical processes that determine the photosynthesis limitations of both wild and domesticated species and specially to provide a pattern for photosynthesis under water stress and the most promising targets for yield and water productivity improvement mesophyll conductance to co2 and especially for grasses and herbs the biochemical components of photosynthesis flexas et al 2016 still to advance in this important area of research the current state of the art

11135,photosynthesis is a complex process that is intrinsically determined by two main components the co2 diffusion from the atmosphere to the chloroplast and the biochemistry among co2 diffusion mesophyll conductance within the leaf g m has been receiving attention in the recent years as a key player determining photosynthesis both across species and in response to the environment furthermore g m estimation allows for disentangling the complete set of photosynthesis underlying mechanisms in a water limited scenario where crop productivity and efficiency need to be increased the analysis of available data from photosynthesis among vascular plants and its response to water stress results helpful for a better understanding of crop management and improvement here photosynthesis data are compiled to elucidate if crop and wild species from different growth forms present different photosynthesis limitations under optimum and water stress conditions from the available data a double process of apparent photosynthesis selection is revealed higher values from ferns to woody and herbaceous species and among angiosperms a tendency towards greater photosynthesis in crop species although constrained by growth form the causes of such photosynthesis variation are discussed moreover crop and herbaceous species present a shift in photosynthesis limitations towards lower mesophyll diffusion constraints under both well watered and water stress conditions these particular photosynthesis characteristics in crops present several implications for the possible improvement of co2 assimilation and water use efficiency providing new guidelines for future engineering and management in agriculture keywords photosynthesis limitations mesophyll conductance crops water stress improvement 1 introduction increasing water scarcity will be a major challenge along the 21st century with agriculture being one of the most affected areas as currently 70 of the available fresh water is used for crop production morison et al 2008 moreover due to the expected population rise in the next decades and the desertification in some areas e g the mediterranean basis there will be an increasing demand for food production per land tilman et al 2002 schultz 2016 achieving both increased yields and more crop per drop i e higher water productivity is one of the main challenges of plant physiology evans 1997 as photosynthesis is the key process associated with plant growth and productivity the study of its underlying mechanisms and its complex response to water depletion is key for understanding how plants perform under stress and to elucidate if there is any room for improving yield and water productivity loreto and centritto 2008 within the photosynthetic or carbon assimilation process a new player has recently received attention as a suitable candidate for achieving these goals mesophyll conductance to co2 g m flexas et al 2012 2016 in this paper we will use the currently available data in different species and water stress conditions to analyse how g m and or other factors limiting photosynthesis such as stomatal conductance g s and photosynthetic biochemistry reflected by maximum carboxylation rate by the enzyme rubisco v cmax and the electron transport rate etr vary across growth forms and determine photosynthesis under drought in turn this knowledge could help us to disentangle to which extent net assimilation a n and water use efficiency at the leaf level can be improved 1 1 photosynthesis importance of mesophyll conductance photosynthesis in c3 plants can be described as a combined diffusional and biochemical process flexas et al 2004 von caemmerer et al 2009 the diffusional component comprehends the path of co2 from the atmosphere c a to the substomatal cavity c i and finally the chloroplast c c including the stomatal pore and the mesophyll tissue the biochemical component includes the co2 fixation in the calvin cycle and the synthesis of atp and nadph in the electron transport chain capture of light energy or photochemistry stomatal conductance regulates the diffusion of both h2o g sw and co2 g sc as they share a common path through the stomatal pore they can be related as g sw 1 6 g sc in early studies it was thought that photosynthesis was determined only by g s and biochemistry being g m neglected as it was considered to be very large farquhar et al 1980 however an increasing amount of evidence has now revealed the importance of co2 diffusion through the mesophyll as a key player in the regulation of photosynthesis rates flexas et al 2008 warren 2008 mesophyll conductance comprehends the co2 path from the substomatal cavity to the sites of carboxylation by the enzyme ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco therefore g m includes several steps that can be considered as separated resistances within the leaf see evans et al 2009 for a detailed depiction of the co2 path inside leaves carbon dioxide has to diffuse from the intercellular air spaces of the leaf mesophyll enter the liquid phase overcoming the resistances imposed by the cell wall and lipid membranes and finally reach the chloroplast stroma among these steps cell wall protein catalysed processes and chloroplast distribution have been identified as key traits determining g m flexas et al 2012 pérez martín et al 2014 onoda et al 2017 however mesophyll conductance is not only determined by the series of physical barriers inside leaves but also by the interplay of mitochondrial co2 release and net photosynthesis tholen et al 2012b which adds difficulty in determining g m short term responses xiao and zhu 2017 photosynthesis decrease under water depletion was firstly thought to be mainly due to stomatal and biochemical limitations chaves et al 2009 although it was not clear which of the two components was the main driver of declining photosynthesis lawlor 2002 flexas et al 2004 however in the 1990s some studies pointed out that a decrease of mesophyll conductance would also constrain co2 diffusion during water stress roupsard et al 1996 tourneux and peltier 1995 renou et al 1990 this potential role of g m was later confirmed in the early 2000s in different species flexas et al 2002 2004 warren et al 2004 the measurements performed by grassi and magnani 2005 in oak quercus robur and ash fraxynus oxyphylla showed that mesophyll conductance played a significant role in photosynthesis decrease in the field under drought conditions g m imposed a significant limitation to photosynthesis revealing that the biochemical constraint was lower than suspected flexas et al 2002 grassi and magnani 2005 galmés et al 2007 moreover its inclusion in carbon fixation models showed an improved accuracy between measured and predicted assimilation under stress niinemets et al 2009 keenan et al 2010 cano et al 2013 therefore mesophyll conductance has to be considered in photosynthesis studies aiming to determine causes of photosynthesis variability and its limitations under stress grassi and magnani 2005 warren 2008 and in order to accurately determine biochemistry parameters ethier and livingston 2004 von caemmerer et al 2009 1 2 domestication syndrome in photosynthesis the domestication syndrome is the set of traits that have undergone human driven selection in crops classical traits considered to be part of the domestication syndrome are the elimination or reduction in seed dispersal the trend towards increased fruit seed size and the loss of germination inhibition etc fuller 2007 which are not usually embraced under natural selection allaby 2010 vaughan et al 2007 according to milla et al 2015 the domestication syndrome definition can be more restricted only those traits differing between progenitors and the very earliest domesticates descending from a given center of origin are true signatures of domestication however recent revisions of the domestication syndrome in food crops suggest that there are no clear traits selected in all domestication events instead the package of selected traits is depending on crop subsets based on taxonomy geography and agricultural purposes abbo et al 2014 meyer et al 2012 photosynthesis is one of the main processes that determines plant growth and performance poorter and remkes 1990 and may shape plant life strategies even in the same environment feng et al 2008 it is unlikely that higher photosynthetic capacity was actively selected during plant domestication events however photosynthesis may have undergone some process of natural selection under cultivation as a part of the hypothesized shift towards favored resource acquisition traits in agricultural systems denison 2009 milla et al 2015 however early studies found that for several crop plants e g barley bean the highest assimilation values were found among their wild relatives chapin et al 1989 evans 1993 gonzález et al 1995 among others for others rice no clear tendency has been observed giulani et al 2013 xiong et al 2017 only in some cases cultivated species showed higher assimilation rates compared to their wild relatives study case for cassava pujol et al 2008 on the other hand few studies have compared in broad terms crop and wild species gago et al 2014 showed that crops displayed some tendency towards increased a n gs g m and v cmax whereas rotundo and cipriotti 2017 contrasted photosynthetic n use efficiency in crops and wild species both studies highlighted the importance of considering growth form when comparing crops with other species putting crop photosynthesis and its performance under both optimal and water limited conditions into a wider botanical context is key to unveil if there is still room for improving crop yield and water productivity flood et al 2011 long et al 2006 1 3 objectives the analysis of the available empirical data reporting photosynthesis parameters and specifically photosynthesis limitations may be a good approach to identify the key components shaping co2 assimilation among vascular plants moreover it is of critical importance to consider specifically crop species as they would be the targets of any attempt to improve yield and water use growth form effect should also be included as it may impose an important constraint in crop species gago et al 2014 finally as water availability is and will be a critical limitation to crop productivity the photosynthesis response to water stress has also to be considered bearing this in mind the main objectives of the present analysis are to 1 describe the photosynthesis parameters a n g s g m and biochemical capacity variation across vascular plants under optimal conditions and discuss its possible structural and biochemical sources 2 determine if crop species within each growth form present a higher photosynthetic capacity together with changes in the parameters determining net assimilation and to analyse if crops present any modification of photosynthesis limiting factors compared to wild species 3 determine if the photosynthesis response to water stress differs among growth forms and or shows any specific crop effect 4 model whether improvements in any single or combined photosynthetic parameter could be an effective way to increase assimilation and water use efficiency in crop species of different growth forms the present work differs from previous meta analysis of photosynthesis data flexas et al 2013a gago et al 2014 onoda et al 2017 where limitations to photosynthesis were not the main focus the approach followed here considering photosynthesis in terms of its limiting factors would help disentangling the main constraints to assimilation rate and hopefully provide useful tools for future photosynthesis enhancement by identifying specific targets among its components 2 material and methods 2 1 photosynthesis parameters across species literature search values of net assimilation rate a n stomatal g sc and mesophyll g m conductances to co2 covering a wide range of species were obtained from the database provided in flexas et al 2013b and complemented with more recent studies see photos param ww dataset in supp mat values for each species refer to the mean from various leaves individuals of unstressed plants however growth conditions may differ between studies indoors or outdoors field or pot sown light regime etc the complete set of gas exchange parameters per species and study was included if g m was estimated by any of the currently accepted methods described in pons et al 2009 and when measurements were performed after sufficient steady state time at ambient co2 concentration saturating light and leaf temperature around 25 c the resulting database comprehends 275 entries covering 240 different taxa and 23 new studies added to the flexas et al 2013b database values for the same species from different studies were considered separately the different species were arranged by growth form grasses herbs woody deciduous and evergreens gymnosperms and ferns crop and wild species within each growth form were also distinguished for angiosperms as in previous compilation studies gago et al 2014 rotundo and cipriotti 2017 species were considered as crops following the criteria for food crops defined in meyer et al 2012 although gymnosperms and ferns are not proper growth forms which refers to structural aspects they are considered as separate groups due to their unique combination of leaf traits tosens et al 2016 verheijen et al 2016 as one of the aims of this analysis is to determine whether crop photosynthesis is different from wild species in its assimilation rates and or limitations only artificially selected historical plant species genotypes were considered as crops meyer et al 2012 in order to increase the available data and for the limitation analysis see below co2 concentrations at the atmosphere c a substomatal cavity c i and site of carboxylation c c were also compiled if any of the mentioned parameters was not provided it was estimated whenever possible using the fick s first law of diffusion equations flexas et al 2013a 1 a n g sc c a c i 2 a n g m c c c i 2 2 limitation approach in the present analysis photosynthesis limitations are estimated using the method described by jones 1985 and modified by grassi and magnani 2005 in this approach the total photosynthetic limitation is divided into the relative limitations of stomata l s mesophyll l m and biochemistry l b the limitations approach is useful because enables to disclosure the underlying mechanisms of the assimilation rate knowing the relative contribution of each parameter g s g m and biochemistry usually v cmax may allow to identify the limiting factor s under stress or even to predict the most suitable target for photosynthesis improvement in the present study the ratio a n c c at c a of 360 400 ppm was used as a proxy of a c c in order to take into account the biochemistry limitations because v cmax was often unavailable in the published studies showing data for g s and g m 2 3 photosynthesis limitations under water stress for determining the general pattern of photosynthesis decrease under water stress by growth form another database covering water stress studies in different species was compiled see photos lim ws dataset in supp mat in this case due to the limitation approach taken in the present analysis we consider only studies where photosynthesis limitations were estimated as described in grassi and magnani 2005 and where g s during stress was also depicted in this case the stomatal sl mesophyll ml and biochemical capacity or maximum carboxylation rate bl absolute limitations are the contributions to the relative change in assimilation rate when a non stressed a n value is taken as a reference grassi and magnani 2005 as an example the sum of sl ml and bl total limitation tl is zero when photosynthesis is un stressed and is 50 when a n is reduced to half the contribution of each component may vary it is worth mentioning that most of the studies considered in the present work did not account for cuticular conductance g c which may result in a slight overestimation of c i and consequently ml tominaga et al 2018 2 4 simulations assimilation a n and intrinsic water use efficiency wue i improvement by modifying a different combination of g s g m and v cmax was simulated using the fvcb model equations for assimilation rate including co2 diffusion through the mesophyll von caemmerer et al 2009 and equations 1 and 2 an iterative approach using microsoft excel solver tool was used for calculating the resulting a n and wue i modification when increasing a certain percentage either g s g m or v cmax or any combination of them as seen in flexas 2016 this approach was used in the initial gas exchange data unstressed plants from different crop species each representative of a different growth form nicotiana tabacum herb triticum aestivum gen gk forrás grass vitis vinifera cv malvasia woody deciduous and olea europaea var manzanilla woody evergreen from galmés et al 2006 olsovska et al 2016 el aou ouad et al 2016 and pérez martín et al 2009 respectively the photosynthesis parameters of these species are depicted in table 2 2 5 statistical analysis differences among growth forms and crop and wild species were addressed using either one or two way anova considering only growth form effect or both crop and growth form effects differences among plant groups were later analyzed using hsd tukey test responses to drought limitations against relative g s were modelled using quadratic polynomial fittings all analyses were performed using r statistical software r core team 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 photosynthesis parameters across plant groups 3 1 1 variability in assimilation rates a total amount of 275 taxonomic entries were considered for the gas exchange data across crops in growth forms under optimal conditions photos param ww dataset in supp mat fig 1 a shows the assimilation values included in this analysis arranged by growth form and within the angiosperms by being crop or wild species the net assimilation values a n ranged from 40 2 in the grass crop triticum aestivum von caemmerer and evans 1991 to 1 4 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 in the evergreen citrus reticulata lloyd et al 1992 there is a strong growth form effect p value 0 0001 one way anova pooling together crop and wild species mean a n increased from ferns 5 9 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 and gymnosperms 8 9 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 to woody angiosperms 10 2 and 12 1 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 in deciduous and evergreens respectively and finally to herbs 16 1 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 and grasses 22 4 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 mean values of these groups match with those reported in larger scale meta analysis onoda et al 2017 wright et al 2005 as co2 diffusion is a strong determinant of assimilation flexas et al 2013a in order to determine the underlying traits shaping photosynthesis across and within growth form it is important to consider the variability of stomatal g s and mesophyll g m conductances 3 1 2 stomatal conductance and water use efficiency as assimilation stomatal conductance g sc increases across growth forms from lowest in ferns to highest in grasses and herbaceous species fig 1 b p value 0 0001 one way anova ferns presented the lowest mean values 0 07 mol co2 m 2 s 1 followed by gymnosperms 0 12 mol co2 m 2 s 1 and woody angiosperms 0 15 mol co2 m 2 s 1 herbs 0 20 mol co2 m 2 s 1 and grasses 0 29 mol co2 m 2 s 1 presented the highest values these g sc ranges observed across growth forms especially the differences observed between ferns gymnosperms and angiosperms may be explained by the leaf venation development among land plants and the link between leaf hydraulics and g s brodribb et al 2007 leaf hydraulic conductance k leaf and g s are mechanistically related as both take into account the transpiration rate of the leaf in their respective estimation flexas et al 2013b gago et al 2014 being stomatal conductance one of the main drivers of net assimilation flexas et al 2013a k leaf and a n are closely related across plant groups brodribb et al 2007 sack et al 2013 and even within genus xiong et al 2014 scoffoni et al 2016 water use efficiency wue may be referred to many levels from whole plant to the leaf level morison et al 2008 flexas et al 2010 when considering the leaf level the ratio a n g sw is defined as the intrinsic water use efficiency wue i the use of a n g sw instead of the co2 assimilated per h2o transpired a n e allows for considering water use efficiency at a common evaporative demand osmond et al 1980 due to the similar increase in both a n and g sw across all groups r 2 0 61 p value 0 0001 quadratic polynomial fit no differences in wue i were detected p value 0 055 one way anova however wue i did show a high degree of variability within each group supp mat fig s1 greater among woody angiosperms and ferns 14 and 7 fold range respectively compared to herbs and grasses 6 and 3 fold range respectively highest values corresponded to woody angiosperm species maximum value of 143 μmol co2 mol 1 h2o reported in the gymnosperm macrozamia spiralis tosens et al 2012 whereas maximum values for herbs and grasses only reached 99 μmol co2 mol 1 h2o in the herbaceous allium ursinum hommel et al 2014 and 82 μmol co2 mol 1 h2o in the grass stipa grandis xu and zhou 2011 minimum values varied little among groups being the lowest 11 μmol co2 mol 1 h2o in the evergreen eucalyptus sieberi douthe et al 2011 in previous reports wue i did not vary between herbs and woody species gago et al 2014 in contrast to a n and g s it seems that wue i has not experienced a positive selection towards higher values from ferns to fast growing herbs and grasses however it has been suggested that short term stomatal response may have evolved to prevent excessive water loss under non optimal conditions for carbon fixation brodribb et al 2009 thus favoring a dynamic wue i in response to the environmental factors over high wue i under well watered optimal conditions nonetheless the existing range across species indicates that species operate differently over the a n g s relationship which may be dependent not on growth form but on environmental conditions for example mediterranean sclerophylls show higher wue i than their temperate counterparts flexas et al 2014 the naturally occurring variability on wue i may offer some opportunities for selection towards higher water efficiency in crops 3 1 3 mesophyll conductance role of leaf anatomy the strong differentiation by growth form in g sc can also be found for mesophyll conductance fig 1 c p value 0 0001 one way anova indeed a n also escalates positively with g m r 2 0 68 p value 0 0001 quadratic polynomial fit and both conductances are also correlated with each other r 2 0 52 p value 0 0001 linear fit the general pattern of g m values across growth forms follows the same trend as g sc mean g m is lowest in ferns 0 06 mol co2 m 2 s 1 gymnosperms and woody angiosperms present higher values 0 09 and 0 15 mol co2 m 2 s 1 respectively and finally herbs 0 25 mol co2 m 2 s 1 and grasses 0 43 mol co2 m 2 s 1 present the highest values as for a n and g sc there are no differences between deciduous and evergreen woody angiosperms however it is possible that within a narrower scale deciduous species show greater g m values than their evergreen relatives e g in quercus species peguero pina et al 2017a the g m differences across plant groups from lowest in ferns and woody species to highest in herbs and grasses may be strongly related to cell wall thickness t cw indeed ferns gymnosperms and woody evergreen species present the highest values of t cw among vascular plants tomàs et al 2013 carriquí et al 2016 tosens et al 2016 veromann jürgenson et al 2017 whereas herbaceous species present thinner cell walls tomàs et al 2013 onoda et al 2017 in fact leaf anatomy parameters such as cell wall thickness and chloroplast size and distribution may have been key drivers in leaf assimilation and productivity evolution peguero pina et al 2017b veromann jürgenson et al 2017 stomatal and mesophyll conductances may be correlated as they reflect to segments of the co2 pathway in the leaf as stated earlier leaf hydraulic conductance strongly determines stomatal conductance in turn it has been reported a significant correlation between k leaf and g m for different species flexas et al 2013b xiong et al 2017 water and carbon dioxide molecules may share a common path inside the leaf the mesophyll cell walls a recent theoretical approach by buckley 2015 suggests that apoplastic water transport i e through the cell wall represents the most important path of water movement outside the xylem therefore the shared path of both co2 and h2o across the cell wall may constitute the mechanistic basis of the coordination between k leaf and g m the fact that g m is strongly related to hydraulic conductance outside the xylem k ox reinforces this possible link xiong et al 2017 3 1 4 biochemistry importance of rubisco assimilation rate at a given co2 concentration at the carboxylation sites c c depends on biochemistry mechanisms calvin cycle enzymes and photochemistry structure farquhar et al 1980 therefore the ratio a n c c at 400 ppm can be used as a proxy for the photosynthetic biochemical capacity grassi and magnani 2005 indeed a n c c tightly correlates with maximum velocity of carboxylation v cmax and maximum electron transport rate j max in a survey of different species from ferns to angiosperms nadal unpublished data in addition as v cmax and j max are tightly coordinated at 25 c across species medlyn et al 2002 singsaas et al 2003 a n c c is a good proxy for both carbon fixation and photochemical processes when comparing a n c c across growth forms similar differences as seen for the other gas exchange parameters arise between groups fig 1 d p value 0 0001 one way anova for growth form effect grasses and herbs present the highest values means of 0 11 and 0 08 mol m 2 s 1 respectively woody angiosperms present intermediate values 0 07 for both deciduous and evergreens and finally gymnosperms 0 06 and ferns 0 04 present the lowest a n c c when considering v cmax and etr electron transport rate the differences found in a n c c are maintained for example carriquí et al 2016 reported higher etr and v cmax in angiosperms when compared to ferns grown under the same conditions as for the other parameters there is a high range of variation within each group higher biochemical capacity is mostly related to rubisco content and activity von caemmerer et al 2009 and electron transport components such as photosystem ii dwyer et al 2012 and chlorophyll content sage et al 1987 singsaas et al 2003 the biochemistry component of photosynthesis is determined by the protein complexes that constitute the calvin cycle and the electron transport chain as a result nitrogen availability and also phosphorus is a strong determinant of both v cmax and etr evans and poorter 2001 and consequently photosynthesis wright et al 2004 onoda et al 2017 recent studies across plant groups show a possible tendency for increased rubisco contents per total soluble proteins in angiosperms compared to ferns and gymnosperms galmés et al 2014b although more data are needed in order to provide evolutionary trends regarding rubisco content and activation among rubisco kinetics parameters specificity factor s c o tends to be higher in ferns and woody evergreens compared to deciduous and herbaceous species galmés et al 2005 gago et al 2013 implying a higher affinity in the former but possibly also a lower carboxylation capacity galmés et al 2014a which could be reflected in the lower biochemistry capacity observed for these groups fig 1d overall the present data compilation shows a clear variation in assimilation rate due to simultaneous variations in all of its underlying parameters stomatal and mesophyll conductances and biochemistry all gas exchange parameters follow the same pattern across groups from lowest in ferns and gymnosperms intermediate in woody angiosperms to highest in herbs and grasses among the main causes of this raise in photosynthetic capacity leaf anatomy may explain the raise from ferns to angiosperms leaf venation and cell wall characteristics brodribb et al 2007 tosens et al 2016 veromann jürgenson et al 2017 and mesophyll characteristics and n use are likely to be the main responsible for the higher values in herbaceous compared to woody species onoda et al 2017 3 2 crop effect among photosynthetic parameters from the results described above it can be seen that the variation range of each photosynthetic component is partly determined by growth form therefore in order to unveil a possible selective pressure towards higher assimilation rates in crops gago et al 2014 it is important to consider this process within each growth form and to identify the potential anatomical and biochemical traits responsible of this differentiation main leaf traits determining gas exchange parameters are described above the factor crop imposes a significant effect for all photosynthetic parameters within each growth form fig 1 p value 0 05 two way anova considering both factors crop and growth form mean assimilation values in crop species are higher than in wild species for all growth forms fig 1 a p value 0 0001 the interaction term crop x gf is non significant in all cases i e there is a similar increase for all growth forms with the exception of g m fig 1 c p value 0 0008 for the interaction term where there is only a slight increase in woody species compared to herbaceous and grass species the concomitant increase of a n and g sw in crops results in a similar wue i in crop and wild species p value 0 86 supp mat fig s1 other studies have compared the photosynthetic differentiation between crops and wild species within each growth form see gago et al 2014 where herbs shrubs and trees are considered here this differentiation is slightly different considering grasses and evergreen vs deciduous in woody species but the main trend for a n g sc and g m is similar to the reported by gago et al 2014 the factor crop is highly significant in determining a n mean 35 65 higher in crops pooling all growth forms although herbaceous species do not present an increase as clear as in the other groups the general pattern of higher assimilation in crop compared to wild species within each growth form does not necessarily imply that cultivated plants have undergone a process of natural selection under cultivation milla et al 2015 studies within closely related species did not show a clear tendency towards enhanced photosynthesis in cultivated species compared to their wild relatives e g chapin et al 1989 evans 1993 gonzález et al 1995 xiong et al 2017 as the species considered here represent a high diversity for both crop and wild species across all growth forms it may be possible that the wild ancestors already presented higher assimilation as found for other functional traits in fertile crescent crops cuniff et al 2014 but not for all of the domestication syndrome traits preece et al 2015 3 3 differences in photosynthesis limitations the relative limitation approach performed here modified from grassi and magnani 2005 allows to observe interesting trends derived from growth form and crop selection fig 2 growth form effect was observed in mesophyll l m and biochemical l b limitations where grasses and herbs present a l m lower and a higher l b than other growth forms fig 2 a p value 0 05 two way anova considering both factors crop and growth form the crop effect poses a significant difference among diffusive limitations l m shows a significant crop effect fig 2a p value 0 0045 two way anova indicating a lower constrain of co2 through the mesophyll in crop species this pattern is clearer in herbs and grasses where g m is strongly differentiated between crop and wild species fig 1d high g m could potentially account for the increased photosynthetic n use efficiency observed in certain grass crops rotundo and cipriotti 2017 in contrast l s does not present any significant effect fig 2b p value 0 64 for factor crop two way anova this different crop effect in the conductances results in a different l m l s ratio between crop and wild species reproduced in each growth form although wild grasses also present a low l m l s fig 2 c p value 0 0078 two way anova wild species present the whole range of l m l s values however crop species seem to be selected towards lower l m l s more related to a greater increase of g m rather than a decrease in g sc fig 1 b and c this pattern in diffusive limitations is also observed in the ratio g m g sc being slightly higher in crops p value 0 006 for crop effect two way anova however this does not translate into higher wue i despite the suggestion that g m g sc would be an adequate parameter for wue i selection galmés et al 2011a the lower diffusive limitations in crops by lowering l m results in a re balance in limitations compared to wild species however no clear crop effect is detected in l b fig 2 d p value 0 1467 two way anova nonetheless crops present a limited range of diffusive limitations l d l m l s per biochemical limitations l d l b close to 1 in woody species and lower 0 5 in grasses and herbaceous supp mat fig s2 in all growth forms wild species present higher maximum l m l s and l d l b this could imply a selection towards low diffusive constraints mainly due to a greater enhancement of g m relative to g sc this may indicate a lower investment in leaf structure in crop species enhancing a fast strategy promoting rapid growth and high productivity rather than leaf resistance feng et al 2008 in this regard tribouillois et al 2015 found lower values for bulk structural parameters lma and leaf dry matter content in cover crops than in wild species although other studies did not find such trend xiong et al 2015 the reduction in diffusive resistances is accentuated in herb and grass crops compared to woody crops nonetheless the latter also present this pattern indicating a common differentiation in all growth forms interestingly wild species present a somewhat more balanced photosynthesis limitation pattern whereas crops are biased towards lower structural high g m derived constraints future work is needed in order to determine the causes of such high g m reflected in low l m in crops low cell wall thickness could be an important player as crop species are situated in the low end of the t cw reported for seed plants onoda et al 2017 veromann jürgenson et al 2017 however a novel study highlights the importance of cell wall composition in also determining g m ellsworth et al 2018 this first direct evidence provided by ellsworth and col could open the path for further research disentangling the detailed mechanics of co2 diffusion in crop species overall the reduction in l m compared to l s and l b in crop and herbaceous species will have important implications for its behaviour under water stress conditions and the improvement approach 3 4 photosynthesis limitations in response to water stress studies monitoring sl bl ml and g s under water stress conditions were used in the present analysis relative stomatal conductance percentage of a maximum value for each species within study was taken as an indicator of water stress following flexas et al 2004 the different literature entries describing photosynthesis limitations upon water stress 11 in total are depicted in table 1 although there is an acceptable coverage among angiosperms of herbaceous n 5 woody deciduous n 9 and woody evergreen n 11 species to the best of our knowledge there are no studies neither for grasses gymnosperms or ferns moreover few crops within each growth form have been studied being the most common grapevine and olive for woody deciduous and evergreen respectively 3 4 1 general pattern of photosynthesis under stress the pattern of stomatal mesophyll and biochemical limitations described in grassi and magnani 2005 is very similar in the resulting analysis of data from later studies including different species fig 3 using stomatal conductance as the indicator of water stress allows to unveil the dynamics of each component contribution to photosynthesis decrease stomatal conductance is usually considered to be the first gas exchange parameter affected by water stress flexas et al 2004 using the polynomial fittings determined across species depicted in fig 3 an almost linear relationship appears r 2 0 98 between the percentage of g s decrease normalized g s and the total limitations accounting for relative assimilation reduction see supp mat fig s3 overall this approach shows that a 50 reduction in g s accounts for an approximately 35 assimilation decrease these results confirm a well known counterbalance of mild drought although there is an increase of wue i it is concomitant with a reduction in assimilation galmés et al 2011a cano et al 2014 flexas et al 2016 flexas 2016 mesophyll conductance imposes an increasing limitation as water stress progresses ml being approximately half of sl along the g s range fig 3 therefore under moderate water stress conditions the reduction in both g s and g m accounts for most of the photosynthesis decrease grassi and magnani 2005 galmés et al 2007 cano et al 2013 only under severe stress conditions the decrease in biochemical capacity v cmax and j max begins to affect photosynthesis i e the metabolic impairment flexas et al 2004 chaves et al 2009 indeed bl only accounts for approximately 15 of total assimilation reduction when g s is reduced to 10 of its non stressed value estimated from polynomial fit from data depicted in fig 3 however biochemical and diffusive limitations interact as drought progresses the decrease in g s and g m reduces the co2 availability in the sites of carboxylation lower c c which in turn may lead to rubisco deactivation reducing v cmax galmés et al 2011b flexas et al 2006a this general pattern of photosynthesis limitations during water stress importance of diffusive limitations contribution of g m and biochemistry effect on later stages seems to be more related to drought duration than severity cano et al 2014 flexas et al 2009 3 4 2 causes of photosynthetic parameters decrease stomatal closure upon water stress was reported since early drought studies and constitutes the main driver of g s decrease chaves et al 2003 flexas et al 2004 it is thought to result from a combination of abscisic acid aba signaling and leaf turgor sensitivity rodríguez domínguez et al 2016 chaves et al 2003 moreover a loss in k leaf through both vessel embolism nardini et al 2003 and outside xylem path collapse scoffoni et al 2017 upon dehydration is also responsible of stomatal conductance decrease rodríguez domínguez et al 2016 hernandez santana et al 2016 probably accentuated under severe drought hochberg et al 2017 these processes may also affect g m wang et al 2018 théroux rancourt et al 2014 due to its possible mechanistic relationship with k ox xiong et al 2017 and its coordinated response with g s to aba increases upon stress mizokami et al 2015 sorrentino et al 2016 however the coordination of mesophyll and stomatal conductances during stress may be species specific flexas et al 2013a moreover g m decline under water stress could also be mediated by changes in mesophyll anatomy and or protein driven diffusion reviewed in nadal and flexas 2018 overall the interplay between all water and co2 diffusion components in decreasing photosynthesis is still under debate flexas et al 2018 biochemical capacity also experiences a decrease under water stress although its effects on photosynthesis are detected only under severe stress fig 3 both etr and v cmax decrease under water stress although the latter has been reported to follow a more threshold like relationship with g s galmés et al 2011a reduced rubisco content and activation has been attributed to v cmax decrease galmés et al 2011a perdomo et al 2017 whereas decreased efficiency in light energy conversion into electron transport may contribute to the decrease in etr flexas and medrano 2002 3 4 3 differences among growth forms the general response of photosynthesis limitations to decreasing g s differs among growth forms figs 4 and 5 although the order described earlier is maintained sl ml bl the relative contribution of each diffusive limitation changes among growth forms in fact the ratio sl ml bl is maintained in all growth forms along all g s range fig 5 derived from quadratic polynomial fittings stomatal limitations impose the highest limitation in herbaceous species especially under low g s on the other hand in evergreen species although sl still accounts for most of the diffusive limitations along all the g s range there is a shift towards an increased ml sl under severe stress conditions normalized g s 0 25 deciduous species behave following an intermediate pattern between herbaceous and evergreen species fig 5 thus the interplay between stomatal and mesophyll limitations depends on growth form under moderate and especially severe stress assimilation in herbs is mostly limited by g s whereas in woody evergreen species g m and g s impose a similar limitation although the data proceeds from different experimental conditions this survey allows to discern growth form effects that otherwise may be confounded in studies with fewer species galle et al 2011 galmés et al 2007 the analysis presented here shows that not only the different photosynthetic parameters need to be taken into account in modelling photosynthesis response to drought at the ecosystem level growth form predominance should also be considered keenan et al 2010 niinemets and keenan 2014 3 4 4 crop cases grapevine data available to accurately compare crop and wild species response to water stress are only sufficient within woody deciduous species and even in this case grapevine is the only crop where the photosynthesis limitation analysis has been performed when deciduous data is divided in the three vitis cultivars available and wild species the resulting responses resemble to the herbs versus evergreen differences stated earlier fig 4 the differences in diffusive limitations follow the same pattern sl in grapevine accounts for most of the assimilation reduction when g s is below half of the non stressed values whereas ml impose a significant reduction in wild species although there is little evidence and data is only available for vitis cultivars it seems that the pattern of sl being higher in fast growing high a n under non stressed conditions species is maintained both across and within growth forms this crop differentiation may reflect the non stressed photosynthesis limitations which later could determine the limitation pattern upon water stress as l m l s is clearly differentiated when comparing crop and wild species within woody deciduous plants fig 2c in this case the presumably anatomical characteristics in crops and herbaceous species leading to higher g m may preserve g m from exercising an excessive constraint both under optimal and water stress conditions future depiction of photosynthesis limitations upon drought in crop species would be necessary to confirm this pattern under stress most crop and wild woody species included in the analysis operate mostly in a g sw around 0 3 mol h2o m 2 s 1 under optimal conditions however it can be appreciated that total limitations in grapevine are low until g sw has dropped to 50 that is around 0 15 mol h2o m 2 s 1 which has been described as a first indicator of mild stress at which only co2 diffusion limitations to photosynthesis operate flexas et al 2004 2009 below this threshold total limitations increase and at 25 g s there is a 50 75 reduction in assimilation contrarily limitations increase more gradually in wild species fig 4 this may indicate that crops are able to sustain assimilation rates under mild stress possibly due to their higher g m and biochemical capacity despite the reduction in g s whereas wild species are promptly affected by g s decreases on the other hand it is also possible that the relationship of g m response with decreasing g s varies across species flexas et al 2013a resulting in the different limitation pattern moreover according to the data presented here slight g s decreases may result in improved wue i with minimum a n decrease the physiological diversity wue i response to decreasing stem water potential found in grapevine cultivars indicate that there is room for genotype selection towards greater efficiency under mild stress bota et al 2016 more studies unveiling photosynthesis limitations under water stress are needed to extend these preliminary results to other crops and to confirm the possible different behaviour in response to water stress between cultivated and wild species 3 5 photosynthesis improvement 3 5 1 improvement in a water limited scenario not only higher yields are necessary but also an increased water productivity despite the controversies regarding the improvement of wue i as a suitable target for greater water productivity blum 2005 higher wue i is still envisaged as a good mean for saving water in agriculture gago et al 2014 and has proven to be an accurate target in genotype selection flexas et al 2010 bunce 2016 li et al 2017 and engineering yang et al 2016 the modification of parameters that regulate or limit photosynthesis has been proposed as one of the means to increase both a n and wue i flexas et al 2013a gago et al 2014 flexas et al 2016 improving stomatal conductance has been disregarded because although it would increase a n it involves a concomitant decrease in wue i flexas et al 2010 on the other hand it is possible to achieve an increase in wue i through a reduction in g s but this would suppose a reduction in a n and in turn yield morison et al 2008 flexas et al 2013a therefore the holy grail for photosynthesis improvement is to achieve higher a n at a given value of g s mesophyll conductance and maximum carboxylation capacity of rubisco v cmax have been proposed as the best targets for increasing simultaneously both a n and wue i flexas et al 2016 there is an increasing amount of literature identifying the mechanistic traits determining both g m and v cmax evans et al 2009 flexas et al 2012 galmés et al 2014b pérez martín et al 2014 xiong et al 2015 flexas et al 2016 therefore providing specific targets for improving a n however translating this theoretical approach to actual experimental cases has proven to be an elusive matter with little success so far flexas 2016 aquaporin expression has been envisaged as one of the best targets for increasing g m indeed several studies have reported larger g m and a n as a result of enhanced ntaqp1 expression in tobacco flexas et al 2006b and tomato sade et al 2010 however this also resulted in larger g s and thus either unaffected or lower wue i this has been attributed to the transport of both co2 and h2o by aquaporins across lipid membranes sade et al 10 flexas et al 2012 studies in other traits yielded similar results for a complete depiction see flexas et al 2016 evidencing that enhancement of any single photosynthetic parameter usually implicates pleiotropic effects on the others resulting in little wue i improvement flexas 2016 moreover the data presented here suggests that crop species already present higher assimilation mostly through high g m thus lower l m than their wild counterparts the next section addresses if even higher assimilation could be achieved by modification of any of its underlying parameters 3 5 1 1 improvement simulation importance of growth form a simulation analysis was performed in four representative crops in order to determine if the modification of a n and wue i resulting from an increase in any parameter g s g m and v cmax is dependent of growth form figs 6 and 7 despite their different parameter values see table 2 the simultaneous increase of all parameters results in the same response an increase of 50 in g s g m and v cmax results in an assimilation value 50 higher and no wue i modification due to the a n and g s simultaneous increase however when considering each parameter separately a different response of a n and wue i is observed stomatal conductance improvement positively affects a n in all cases greatest in o europaea however this results in a concomitant decrease of wue i this reduction in wue i shows that the values taken for these species respond to non stressed conditions where a n and g s show an allometric relationship see flexas et al 2010 for an example in vitis data therefore under optimal conditions an increase in g s results in a decrease in wue i in all cases when considering increasing mesophyll conductance the simulation shows a clear difference between triticum aestivum grass and nicotiana tabacum herb on one hand and vitis vinifera woody deciduous and olea europaea woody evergreen on the other hand the latter species show higher a n and wue i at a common g m increase this higher response of woody species to g m modification may reflect their overall higher l m and l m l s ratio stomatal and mesophyll resistances work in series flexas et al 2013a so it can be expected that the lower conductance drives the total leaf conductance g tot as mesophyll conductance imposes a greater limitation in woody than herbaceous species it may be expected a greater sensitivity in woody species to any g m improvement as predicted for evergreen species regarding higher co2 availability niinemets et al 2011 however it is worth noting the overall little effect that a g m modification imposes to both a n and wue i a 50 increase in g m only results in an approximately 10 enhancement of a n and wue i in the best case woody species moreover there is no experimental evidence for such g m increase by modification of any of its underlying mechanistic components see compilation in flexas et al 2016 the little impact exercised by g m increase in the selected crop species may reflect the already reduced mesophyll limitations in crop species especially in herbs and grasses see section 3 2 in all cases the best results in terms of simultaneous increase of both a n and wue i emerge from the increase of both v cmax and g m if g s remains unaltered this results in approximately 30 and 25 higher a n and wue i respectively when v cmax and g m are increased by 50 olea europaea does not experience such an increase due to the higher g s limitation as evidenced by its higher sensitivity to g s increase however this improvement may be rather elusive due to the usually found g s g m coordination within species flexas et al 2013a decoupling stomatal and mesophyll conductance remains one of the most challenging aims of photosynthesis engineering aquaporin modification has yielded contrasting results see compilation in flexas et al 2016 but in some cases increases in assimilation have been reported tomato lines overexpressing ntaqp1 showed higher a n by 41 and even enhanced whole plant wue sade et al 2010 although no g m was reported and tobacco lines overexpressing aquaporin mcmipb from the cam plant mesembryanthemum crystallinum showed enhanced a n and g m by 45 and 53 although with no wue i modification kawase et al 2013 improving biochemistry and maintaining g s is the other way to achieve higher yields and water production the simulation with increasing v cmax offers more promising results than g m in all crop species a n and wue i around 20 higher at 50 v cmax moreover n tabacum and t aestivum show a greater increase 25 reflecting again the larger biochemical limitations present in grasses and herbs compared to woody species presented earlier in addition it is possible to decouple v cmax modification through rubisco carbamylation state from g s changes although this modification resulted in lower assimilation rates galmés et al 2013 nonetheless high v cmax increases without diffusion enhancement would inevitably lead to decreased c c which limits v cmax modification and highlights the need for parallel increase of both v cmax and g m flexas et al 2016 to date a n and wue i improvement by modifying rubisco related traits has proven an extremely elusive matter in the seven studies where modification of rubisco biochemistry was attempted reviewed in flexas et al 2016 only in just one case some a n and wue i improvement was achieved 18 and 8 respectively kontunen soppela et al 2010 3 5 1 2 improvement simulation performance under stress photosynthesis improvement approaches have also to be considered in a water limited scenario loreto and centritto 2008 it could be expected that in crop species where the stomatal limitations are low at the beginning of the water stress the combination of mild stress slight g s decrease and the improvement of g m and v cmax would result in a significant enhancement of wue i while compensating the decrease of a n due to lower g s flexas et al 2013a following the approach showed in figs 6 and 7 the same simulation approach was conducted for the species depicted in table 2 considering two scenarios mild drought where g s is at 75 of non stressed value and moderate drought where g s is at 50 and g m is also reduced at 75 whereas v cmax remains unaltered a realistic assumption under these stress conditions galmés et al 2007 2011a the results are showed in supp mat fig s4 for a n and supp mat fig s5 for wue i in any case only under mild stress conditions g s at 75 it is possible to compensate the decrease in a n or even in the case of v cmax and of the simultaneous increase of both g m and v cmax increase a n over the non stressed values by 20 in the best case scenario indeed wue i is greater in all cases due to the lower g s but may also be significantly improved up to 50 when g m and v cmax are enhanced by 50 however the initial parameters impose a significant limitation to any improvement attempt any increase of a n in o europaea is very limited due to the low non stressed g s of this species in addition the hypothetical improvement may not only be conditioned by the photosynthesis characteristics of the targeted species but also by the difficulty of overcoming the coordinated response of g s and g m under stress mizokami et al 2015 sorrentino et al 2016 3 5 2 future targets and guidelines the improvement simulation performed in different crop species under non stressed conditions shows that a significant improvement in v cmax and or g m is needed in order to achieve higher a n and wue i in all cases a 20 30 improvement in the desired traits requires v cmax and g m to be 50 higher than their maximum values under non stressed conditions to the best of our knowledge only aquaporin modification has been found to affect g m in such degree kawase et al 2013 and no such improvement has been reported for v cmax yet table 3 shows several insights for future research derived from the current work here it has been shown that crop and wild species are differentiated in their photosynthetic characteristics however the question regarding if crop photosynthesis did truly experience a domestication process remains unsolved in this regard the study of the wild relatives is a key point for future research both for determining the effects of domestication in photosynthesis and to provide a possible gene pool for crop breeding on the other hand specific targets for photosynthesis improvement are also provided in table 3 anatomical features have been regarded as the holy grail for g m improvement tholen et al 2012a however mesophyll limitations have proven to be already minimized in crops and g m simulation showed the lowest a n and wue i modification figs 6 and 7 nonetheless cell wall components may be an unexplored way to enhance g m in a recent study ellsworth et al 2018 showed in rice mutants that disruptions in cell wall mixed linkage glucan mlg production affects cell wall composition and properties translated into lower g m this study constitutes a novel finding supporting a key role of cell wall composition influencing g m which could provide a powerful tool for photosynthesis engineering however from the results of the simulation analysis and the data compilation it seems clear that v cmax and maybe other biochemical parameters are the key targets for higher productivity in crops at the leaf level to date no clear improvement has been achieved in gas exchange at the leaf level by modification of any of the photosynthesis underlying components flexas 2016 as already stated modification of g s along the a n g s relationship may result in a more effective way to improve water use efficiency work on aba receptors could provide useful tools for wue improvement yang et al 2016 on the other hand improvement based on increasing daily carbon gain per water loss rather than maximizing instantaneous assimilation i e improvement of light saturated a n indeed a recent compilation of soybean genotypes shows that carbon gain has been improved in recently released cultivars through maintaining high a n during midday and afternoon periods rather than enhanced maximum a n v cmax or g m koester et al 2016 these approaches could prove to be a good alternative for water productivity and yield enhancement in a fluctuating environment lawson et al 2012 4 concluding remarks photosynthesis is a complex multi trait process strongly influenced by anatomical biochemical and environmental parameters nonetheless as it is closely related to plant growth and therefore life cycle it has been shaped by natural selection this is reflected in the different rates reported for fern gymnosperm and angiosperm species moreover from the data presented here crop species and cultivars tend to present higher assimilation rates diffusive and biochemistry capacities than other wild species within each considered growth form the photosynthesis limitations approach across species under non stressed conditions unveiled a clear differentiation of crops there is a tendency in reducing mesophyll limitations a selection towards lower l m l s ratios this tendency is also present when comparing wild grasses to other growth forms this also reveals slightly increased biochemical limitations in crops the change in photosynthesis limitations in cultivated species poses several implications for their water stress response and yield improvement under non stressed conditions increased mesophyll conductance alone may have little effect in the resulting a n and wue i whereas the enhancement of v cmax significantly improves both a n and wue i however under water stress biochemical limitations are low and a potential v cmax modification would only be truly effective under well watered conditions although v cmax enhancement may compensate a n decrease in some cases overall the analysis presented here unveils the importance of considering empirical data in order to determine the importance of co2 diffusion and biochemical processes that determine the photosynthesis limitations of both wild and domesticated species and specially to provide a pattern for photosynthesis under water stress and the most promising targets for yield and water productivity improvement mesophyll conductance to co2 and especially for grasses and herbs the biochemical components of photosynthesis flexas et al 2016 still to advance in this important area of research the current state of the art

11136,row crops such as grapevine are particularly vulnerable to heat stress under hot and dry conditions due to the combined effect of soil heat fluxes and of limited capacity for leaf canopy evaporative cooling via transpiration therefore a better understanding of grapevine responses to variations in air and soil temperature and of related heat fluxes are required in mediterranean type viticulture in order to optimize canopy and soil management practices while saving irrigation water ground based thermography was used to monitor canopy tc and soil ts temperature patterns in a vineyard trained in a vertical shoot positioning trellis system measurements of heat exchanges in the vineyard were done along the day and throughout the season to predict vine s water status and heat stress risks field trials were carried out in 2014 and 2015 in alentejo winegrowing region south portugal using two v vinifera red varieties aragonez syn tempranillo and touriga nacional subjected to two deficit irrigation strategies tc and ts measurements were complemented by punctual leaf and berry temperature measurements with thermocouples soil water content leaf water potential and leaf gas exchange were also measured tc was above the optimal temperature for leaf photosynthesis during a large part of the day 11 00 17 00 h particularly under stressful atmospheric conditions high vpd and irradiance combined with lower soil water availability the highest tc was measured at mid late afternoon 17 00 h indicating a delay relative to the highest tair conditions the basal part of the canopy cluster zone presented a temperature 1 2 c higher than the upper part whereas ts was on average 10 15 c higher than tc variation in ts was coupled to sun radiation and tc correlated negatively with leaf water potential and stomatal conductance to water vapour our results suggest that tc can be used as a simple indicator of grapevine performance and as a parameter to feed grapevine growth models to estimate heat and water fluxes in irrigated vineyards ts emerges as a thermal variable with potential use to manage heat and drought stress in vineyards keywords mediterranean viticulture water and crop management thermal imaging heat and water fluxes canopy temperature soil temperature 1 introduction climate change scenarios for south mediterranean europe predict longer and more severe soil water deficits and higher air and soil temperatures in the near future hannan et al 2013 meehl et al 2007 rogiers and clarke 2013 shultz 2016 teskey et al 2014 van leeuwen and darriet 2016 in addition heat waves tend to strike the mediterranean region more frequently and for longer periods meehl et al 2007 teskey et al 2014 estimation of soil evaporation and plant transpiration is critical to assess crop s water use efficiency and to optimize irrigation management this applies to row crops such as grapevines widely grown in arid regions e g mediterranean climate costa et al 2016 most of wine grape vineyards nowadays have a small canopy soil cover fractions in order to optimize cluster micro climate pieri 2010a b furthermore the large majority of vineyards for wine production worldwide is trained in vertical shoot positioning trellis to enable easier mechanization and management bem et al 2015 carbonneau 2009 clingeleffer 2009 kliewer et al 1989 although more practical vertical shoot positioning may be inconvenient under hot climates due to higher soil exposure to direct sun light contrary to horizontal trellis e g pergola with horizontal shoot positioning gladstone and dokoozlian 2003 grapevines temperature can increase via both convective and radiative heating convective heating occurs when air temperature tair exceeds plant temperature and heat is transferred to plant tissues this convective process can also cool down plants if tair is lower than plant s temperature in turn radiative heating takes place when sun thermal energy is intercepted and absorbed by leaves and or by berries hayman et al 2012 shading reduces radiative heating by decreasing incident direct radiation by increasing plant s reflection of thermal energy or by decreasing indirect radiation e g thermal energy reflected by soil campillo et al 2012 villalobos et al 2016 the impact of soil temperature ts on grapevine canopy and cluster metabolism must be better accounted for in sparse planted crops row crops such as vineyards soil surface largely contributes for energy balance processes within the soil canopy atmosphere continuum heilman et al 1994 hicks 1973 nobel 2005 also berry temperature tberry is influenced by soil heat via micro advection pieri 2010a b pogue 2008 literature reports significant increases in ts at least at a rate similar to tair over the past decades in postdam germany for example the upper one meter soil proﬁle increased by about two to three degrees celsius during spring and summer april to august in the last 100 years böhme and böttcher 2011 therefore if we assume that i row crops are more vulnerable to heat waves ii heat stress can partly derive from soil heat fluxes and iii row configuration of crops amplifies the impact of ts on both canopy and fruits a better understanding and monitoring of this soil canopy atmosphere continuum is required despite the significant contribution of soil to system fluxes partitioning of energy balance components between soil and canopy is not easy to predict kool et al 2016 ortega farías et al 2016 2010 pieri 2010a b pogue 2008 sene 1994 spano et al 2000 moreover there are still knowledge gaps regarding the combined effect of ts and high tair on grapevine canopy and berry metabolism in particular at the cluster zone this issue gains more attention if we consider climate change scenarios and the potential negative impacts of extreme high tc on vines performance and berry composition holzapfel et al 2016 shultz 2016 it is also recognized that the response of grapevine to climate change namely heat and drought stress varies with the genotype bota et al 2001 chaves et al 2016 costa et al 2012 therefore improved grapevine genotype characterization combined with appropriate soil and irrigation management is required costa et al 2016 in this context the aims of our work were to identify the spatial and temporal variation in tc tberry and ts patterns based on punctual and imaging measurements of temperature as means to improve water and heat stress management in mediterranean vineyards subjected to deficit irrigation furthermore this study also aimed at assessing if thermal imaging can discriminate differences between genotypes on the basis of their tc patterns 2 material and methods 2 1 location and plant material the experiment was located in a commercial vineyard at reguengos de monsaraz alentejo south portugal 38 23 55 0 n 7 32 46 00 w elevation 200 m the climate is typically mediterranean with mild temperatures in winter rarely below five degrees celsius and dry and warm summers with especially high tair temperature e g in july and august when average values reach 25 c with punctual maximum values above 40 c we used 11 years old grapevines of the red varieties touriga nacional tou and aragonez syn tempranillo ara which are two of the most important varieties cultivated in portugal ivv 2017 vines of the two genotypes were grafted onto 1103 paulsen rootstock and were planted side by side in two adjacent plots planting density was 2200 vines ha 1 5 m x 3 0 m per vine with n s oriented rows vines were subjected to

irrigation amounts and shows important differences between 2014 and 2015 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 climate data soil and plant water status tair relative humidity rh wind speed and solar radiation were hourly collected using an automatic weather station imetos 1 pessl instruments gmbh werksweg austria located in the vineyard close to the experimental plot fig 1 grapevine water status was assessed along the vegetative period from flowering to harvest by measuring leaf water potential at pre dawn ψpd and along the day ψleaf at three hour intervals with a scholander pressure chamber soil moisture equipment corp sta barbara ca usa a total of four leaves per irrigation treatment eight leaves per genotype were used in each data point mature leaves were taken from the middle part of the canopy

to remotely assess canopy and soil surface temperatures we assumed an identical emissivity for soil which is within the range proposed by jones and vaughan 2010 for non sandy soils individual leaf temperature tleaf and berry temperature tberry were also continuously measured at 30 min interval from berry pea size to full maturation using a two junction fine wire copper constantan thermocouples and registered in a dual channel temperature data logger egipto et al 2016 tberry was measured on two berries from a sample of three clusters per grapevine located at three different canopy positions sunlit exposed and non exposed berries from clusters at the interior of the canopy east and west exposed face of the canopy in two blocks a total of six tberry measurements per variety and irrigation treatment were done in parallel punctual tleaf measurements were done in three mature fully developed leaves located at different canopy positions facing east facing west and interior canopy thermal images were taken along the day and season in 2014 24 july and 19 august and in 2015 12 13 may 3 june 8 9 july and 13 14 august diurnal cycle measurements were done at 8 00 9 00 h 11 00 h 14 00 h 17 00 h and 19 20 00 h thermal imaging was followed by visible rgb imaging in 2015 a 24 to 36 h observation period was punctually implemented along the growing cycle on 12 13 may 8 9 july and 13 14 august e g on 8 9 july plants were observed at 24 00 h 5 00 h 9 00 h 11 00 h 14 30 h 17 00 h 20 00 h 24 00 h 6 00 h 9 30 h 11 00 h data not shown for the last three measurements of the day the thermal camera was positioned at the center of the inter row and images were taken at about 15 m distance from the nearest smart point equipped with thermocouples fig 2 images were taken with a n s orientation and the field of view included two parallel rows background reference temperature was determined by measuring temperature of a crumpled sheet of aluminum foil placed near the leaves canopy of interest and using ε 1 jones et al 2002 thermal images were corrected for background temperature and analyzed with the thermacam researcher pro 2 10 software flir systems usa six regions of interest rois were manually selected in each thermogram by using the function add polygon of the thermacam research software four rois corresponded to the canopy upper canopy and cluster zone in both sides facing east and west two additional rois were selected for soil surface east and west sides by using the thermacam researcher pro 2 10 software the radiometric images were converted into csv files and exported to excel to obtain a temperature data matrix in which each cell pixel corresponded to a temperature value the number of pixels of each roi was always above 1500 pixels pixels were counted at a 0 2 c temperature range e g 20 00 to 20 19 c and registered in an absolute frequency table the maximum standard deviation of temperature values measured within the selected rois was 2 29 c at the canopy level and 7 04 c at soil level thermal data was normalized dividing the number of pixels within each temperature class interval by the total number of pixels of the roi resulting into a relative pixel frequency per roi 2 3 3 individual leaf gas exchange stomatal conductance to water vapor gs and net co2 assimilation an were assessed with a portable infrared gas exchange system li 6400 licor inc lincoln nebraska usa equipped with a 6 cm2 transparent leaf chamber with an air flow rate set at 500 mol s 1 measurements were done in two mature and sunlit leaves per plant using a total of four plants per irrigation treatment and variety leaf gas exchange was assessed immediately after thermography measurements 2 3 4 canopy traits and yield grapevine leaf area was measured according to lopes and pinto 2005 in two average length shoots from three vines per elemental plot at flowering veraison mid ripening and harvest the total leaf area tla and lateral leaf area lla per vine were assessed as indicative traits of plant vigour the lla is presented as percentage of tla the exposed leaf area ela m2 ha was calculated for each irrigation treatment and variety by measuring canopy height and width in ten plants two replications per vine per treatment block and variety yield was assessed in the two genotypes by recording the number of clusters and their total weight from 15 selected vines per elemental plot 60 vines per treatment 2 4 experimental design and statistical analysis the experimental set up was a randomized complete block design with two deficit irrigation treatments and four replications per treatment the elemental plot comprised three contiguous rows with two buffer rows and a central one for data harvesting thermal data were retrieved from two of the four experimental blocks of the trial the relationships between tc and ψleaf and between tc and gs were assessed by pearson correlation using pooled data from the two genotypes statistical analysis was done using the statistix 9 0 analytical software the differences in tla lla and ela due to irrigation treatments within each variety were compared by a two way anova a factorial anova split plot design using the variety as main factor the irrigation treatment as a sub factor and blocks as replications was performed to evaluate the effects of variety at each date a 95 confidence interval ci was computed for the mean of thermal data and used to compare the different roi patterns correlation analysis was used to study the relationships between ts and tc at cluster zone of sunlit canopy between 14 00 and 20 00 h 3 results 3 1 weather conditions and irrigation weather data show differences between the two seasons years although solar radiation was similar in both years 2015 was warmer and drier than 2014 table 2 consequently the longest irrigation period and the largest volume of irrigation water were applied in 2015 table 2 in addition the smaller vpd and tair observed in 2014 resulted in lower cumulative reference evapotranspiration et0 values as compared to 2015 table 2 climate data solar radiation tair rh relative to the data collecting days in 2014 and 2015 is presented in fig 1 in 2014 vpd values varied between 0 07 and 3 46 kpa during observations 2 40 3 46 kpa from 14 00 to 17 00 h whereas in 2015 vpd values oscillated between 0 08 and 5 91 kpa 4 56 to 5 91 from 14 00 to 17 00 h 3 2 soil and plant water status the average values of ψpd varied between 0 1 and 0 2 mpa no stress at the flowering period of 2014 and 2015 seasons respectively ψpd decreased along the season attaining a minimum of about 0 6 to 0 75 mpa in the di2 treatment at mid end august 2014 which indicates a mild to severe water stress condition at harvest fig 3 di2 plants showed slightly more negative ψpd in aragonez 0 75 mpa for di2 and 0 78 mpa for di1 fig 3 regarding the diurnal variation of leaf water potential in both seasons vines decreased their water potential along the day but showed a marked recovery by 20 00 h mainly in 2014 in turn the recovery observed by 19 00 20 00 h in 2015 was less evident than in 2014 mainly in august indicating more severe drought stress fig 4 3 3 variation of leaf canopy soil and berry temperature along the day in 2014 in mid july and mid august diurnal assessments show that tc was two to three degrees celsius above the optimal tleaf for photosynthesis 25 30 c mullins et al 1992 fig 5 a and b under clean sky conditions and that the maximum tc was measured at around 17 00 h more extreme tair and vpd conditions in 2015 resulted in several days with tc values clearly above the optimum tleaf for photosynthesis an extreme example occurred on 8 9 july 2015 where a tleaf of three to eight degrees celsius above the optimum tleaf for photosynthesis was measured fig 5 the effect of irrigation treatments and cultivar on tc and tleaf was not always clear but di2 vines showed punctually a tendency for higher tc than di1 vines under more stressful atmospheric conditions high tair and vpd e g 8 9 july 2015 fig 5c a more detailed analysis of tc was performed in 2015 by assessing the vertical variation profile of tc by measuring the temperature of the upper and lower cluster zone parts of the canopy see figs 6a and 6b and table 4 tc patterns were similar at the upper canopy and the cluster zone of the canopy during the night period till early morning see figs 6a and 6b and table 4 however between 9 00 h and 17 00 h when ts markedly increases tc at the cluster zone achieves its highest temperatures mainly during the afternoon hours figs 6a and 6b and table 4 we monitored as well the diurnal variation of ts in 2015 fig 5c shows the variation of tair tc and ts along a 24 00 h period for both genotypes and irrigation treatments we can distinguish a diurnal variation pattern for ts as compared to tc see figs 5c and 6 indeed the variation pattern of ts was closely linked to variation in sun radiation fig 5c whereas tc was more related to tair although with a certain delay fig 5c while in the morning 8 00 9 00 h soil temperature was on average ca 5 c higher than tc in the afternoon the difference increased to a maximum of 10 15 c fig 5c and table 4 during the night as solar radiation is not available to warm up soil s surface ts values reach an equilibrium with tair and tc figs 6a and 6b and table 4 measurements of tberry with thermocouples showed that tberry was closely coupled to tair during the morning period but not in the afternoon fig 7 indeed in the afternoon the decrease in tberry was delayed in both varieties and irrigation treatments relatively to the decrease observed in tair fig 7 3 4 canopy temperature vs leaf water potential and gas exchange the analysis of data from water potential thermography and individual leaf gas exchange along the trial indicates that irrespective of the varying climate conditions in 2014 and 2015 the parameter tc was negatively correlated with leaf water potential stomatal conductance to water vapor and to net photosynthesis fig 8 moreover a negative relationship was found between the tc 14 17h and leaf water potential measured at the most stressful time of the day 14 00 17 00 h correlations between tc and leaf water potential were stronger in 2015 which was the driest and warmest season fig 8 furthermore punctual measurements of tleaf made with thermocouples were closely related to thermal imaging measurements of tc r 0 87 p 0 001 demonstrating the robustness of the imaging approach 3 5 canopy traits and yield the exposed leaf area of ara was larger than that of tou table 3 which could result in larger water loss in ara vines due to transpiration in turn higher percentage of laterals was found in tou indicating a higher proportion of young leaves that could potentially influence canopy microclimate e g higher rh in 2015 which was the most stressful season of the trial total leaf area of tou and ara was reduced by about 53 and 43 respectively as compared to 2014 regarding yield results in 2014 the average yield of ara was 4 7 kg vine while that of tou was 4 1 kg under the more stressful conditions of 2015 vines of ara produced in average 4 5 kg vine as compared to 3 9 kg vine obtained for tou the effect of irrigation strategy was not significant except in 2015 for tou where di2 showed a significantly lower yield than di1 3 4 vs 4 3 kg vine respectively 4 discussion and conclusions heat and drought stress limit wine production in mediterranean climates this is particularly the case when heat waves strike vineyards or and when irrigation is not possible and or mismanaged therefore a better understanding of grapevine responses to water and heat stress combined with improved crop monitoring based on thermal patterns will contribute to optimize irrigation and soil management in mediterranean viticulture deficit irrigation helps to save irrigation water in viticulture in this trial we found that di2 strategy reduced the amount of water used 45 460 m3 ha 1 year 1 as compared to the conventional di1 strategy with minimal negative effects on yield nevertheless further studies are needed to better evaluate the long term impact of di strategies on yield and vines longevity for different genotypes we observed differences between genotypes for vine s water status as evaluated by ψpd ara vines presented more negative ψpd as compared to tou especially under the most stressful treatment di2 this behavior of ara can be related to canopy size and architecture as ara has a larger total leaf area leading to higher total transpiration water loss as compared to tou table 3 in previous field experiments carried out in alentejo vines of the variety tou kept higher stomatal conductance and lower tc than ara for identical water potential costa et al 2012 suggesting that tou can maintain better thermal regulation than ara under mild water stress conditions however in the present experiment and in spite of the lower ψpd tc and leaf gas exchange patterns observed for ara vines were not different from the ones of tou a relevant finding was that the highest tc values were measured at mid late afternoon 17 00 h figs 5 and 6a 6b and not at the warmest time of the day which can be related with the thermal inertia associated to leaf tissues water content schymanski et al 2013 and to the potential effect of re radiation of soil energy at that time of the day when tair is lower than the afternoon warmest hours the observed tc profile shows that soil heat fluxes may influence tc at the cluster zone which is the part of the canopy closest to soil s surface in a vertical shoot positioning trellis we found a clear trend of higher temperatures in the cluster zone of the canopy as compared to its upper part figs 6a 6b tables 4 and 5 these results are in accordance to previous findings in grapevine pieri 2010a b pogue 2008 van leeuwen et al 2004 the positive correlation between ts and tc at the cluster zone in particular when exposed to direct sunlight with ts values reaching 10 15 c higher than tc supports the idea that soil heat fluxes may be influencing canopy microclimate in particular at the cluster zone see table 5 in addition these findings suggest that cluster zone could be highly vulnerable to the effect of ascendant heat fluxes originated by soil stored heat mainly under sunlit conditions the release of soil heat to the atmosphere whenever tair decreases along the mid and end afternoon contributes to higher tc of the cluster zone table 4 the minimum tc range was observed during the night period until pre dawn figs 6a 6b and table 4 as soon as there is no solar energy income soil vine atmosphere system tends to an equilibrium once sun rises tc variability increases either due to different canopy surface exposition east west and to leaf position orientation on the canopy which ultimately affects the amount of absorbed emitted and reflected energy other contributions for the measured tc variability within each irrigation treatment x variety can be related to the variation in solar azimuth and elevation which modifies the amount of energy absorbed emitted and reflected by exposed leaves along the day season the same applies to ts figs 6a 6b once solar azimuth and elevation changes along the day the proportion of sun exposed and shaded soil changes with the diurnal dynamic of sunlight exposition promoting differential soil temperature patterns along the day as the impact of evaporative cooling throughout the day is smaller for soil than for a transpiring canopy ts showed a more marked variation than tc regarding the potential role of canopy density on grapevine thermal regulation it is possible that denser canopies could generate less favorable microclimate to evaporative cooling due to higher rh and reduced air renovation within the canopy which generates lower evaporative demand table 3 in parallel higher canopy density can restrict convective cooling by reducing air movement within the canopy regarding tberry variation along the day it is possible that the thermal inertia related to berry s water content 75 85 gerós et al 2012 might explain the delay observed in the cooling down observed in the afternoon fig 7 similarly to what occurs with leaf tissues schymanski et al 2013 in very hot days during the afternoon hours the effect of extreme soil temperatures and related heat fluxes particularly in the sunlit side of the canopy e g 40 55 c should influence canopy s temperature at the cluster zone indeed we found that tberry was above 33 35 c for several hours of the day fig 7 which can be particularly harmful for red berries composition as their pigments absorb much light and convert it into heat gladstones 2015 promoting degradation of anthocyanins and or repressing their synthesis tarara et al 2008 zarrouk et al 2016 our findings show the relevance of thermal remote sensing to monitor plant and soil temperature patterns in vineyards and to identify spots and or times of the day with high risk of extreme temperatures and related sunburn of leaves and berries the use of thermal indexes such as cwsi or ig helps to minimize the influence of variable climate conditions on thermographic measurements bellvert et al 2016 jones 2004 jones et al 2002 costa et al 2010 maes and steppe 2012 nevertheless our results show that tc correlates with major eco physiological traits such as ψleaf gs and an along the two seasons fig 8 this points out that tc can be used as a simple thermal indicator of water status leaf gas exchange in grapevine garcía tejero et al 2016 moreover the fact that ψleaf measured in the afternoon 14 00 17 00 h was correlated with tc 14 17h is in line with previous literature for grapevine and other crops bellvert et al 2016 dejonge et al 2015 grant et al 2007 pou et al 2014 and it has practical benefits for field monitoring by avoiding the inconvenience of pre dawn measurements similarly the close relationship between thermocouple measurements of tleaf and thermal imaging values of tc supports the practical use of tc previous literature emphasized the usefulness of tc as a biophysical variable to monitor water stress in grapevine baluja et al 2012 espinoza et al 2017 garcía tejero et al 2016 nevertheless we must consider that the variation in air vpd may affect canopy evaporative cooling and thus tc bellvert et al 2016 this may explain the differences observed for the regression slopes when correlating tc 14 17h with leaf water potential and leaf gas exchange in 2014 and 2015 fig 8 as opposed to thermal imaging measurements done perpendicularly to the row costa et al 2012 garcía tejero et al 2016 jones et al 2002 pou et al 2014 the use of thermography for vineyard monitoring along rows simplifies ground based measurements and will save time while allowing visualization of a larger portion of the canopy attending to the impact of ts on heat exchanges in vineyards reported in this paper further testing of novel soil management and training strategies that reduce the impact of soil heat on canopy and berry is required in particular the effects of soil and crop residue management on vineyards soil heat fluxes should be studied in combination with canopy architecture size orientation and trunk height our results on the impact of ts on tc and tberry are likely to be also relevant when considering training systems with short trunck height in warm climates e g south europe this kind of studies will further help to better predict evapotranspiration losses assess unproductive irrigation water use save water and support development of evapotranspiration models carrasco benavides et al 2014 kool et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 aiming at the improvement of vineyard sustainability finally monitoring of ts and tc in vineyards along the season can provide valuable information for efficient irrigation management and to map hot spots islands within the vineyard as well as to feed models to support decision making and to reduce the risks of leaf and berry sunburn

11136,row crops such as grapevine are particularly vulnerable to heat stress under hot and dry conditions due to the combined effect of soil heat fluxes and of limited capacity for leaf canopy evaporative cooling via transpiration therefore a better understanding of grapevine responses to variations in air and soil temperature and of related heat fluxes are required in mediterranean type viticulture in order to optimize canopy and soil management practices while saving irrigation water ground based thermography was used to monitor canopy tc and soil ts temperature patterns in a vineyard trained in a vertical shoot positioning trellis system measurements of heat exchanges in the vineyard were done along the day and throughout the season to predict vine s water status and heat stress risks field trials were carried out in 2014 and 2015 in alentejo winegrowing region south portugal using two v vinifera red varieties aragonez syn tempranillo and touriga nacional subjected to two deficit irrigation strategies tc and ts measurements were complemented by punctual leaf and berry temperature measurements with thermocouples soil water content leaf water potential and leaf gas exchange were also measured tc was above the optimal temperature for leaf photosynthesis during a large part of the day 11 00 17 00 h particularly under stressful atmospheric conditions high vpd and irradiance combined with lower soil water availability the highest tc was measured at mid late afternoon 17 00 h indicating a delay relative to the highest tair conditions the basal part of the canopy cluster zone presented a temperature 1 2 c higher than the upper part whereas ts was on average 10 15 c higher than tc variation in ts was coupled to sun radiation and tc correlated negatively with leaf water potential and stomatal conductance to water vapour our results suggest that tc can be used as a simple indicator of grapevine performance and as a parameter to feed grapevine growth models to estimate heat and water fluxes in irrigated vineyards ts emerges as a thermal variable with potential use to manage heat and drought stress in vineyards keywords mediterranean viticulture water and crop management thermal imaging heat and water fluxes canopy temperature soil temperature 1 introduction climate change scenarios for south mediterranean europe predict longer and more severe soil water deficits and higher air and soil temperatures in the near future hannan et al 2013 meehl et al 2007 rogiers and clarke 2013 shultz 2016 teskey et al 2014 van leeuwen and darriet 2016 in addition heat waves tend to strike the mediterranean region more frequently and for longer periods meehl et al 2007 teskey et al 2014 estimation of soil evaporation and plant transpiration is critical to assess crop s water use efficiency and to optimize irrigation management this applies to row crops such as grapevines widely grown in arid regions e g mediterranean climate costa et al 2016 most of wine grape vineyards nowadays have a small canopy soil cover fractions in order to optimize cluster micro climate pieri 2010a b furthermore the large majority of vineyards for wine production worldwide is trained in vertical shoot positioning trellis to enable easier mechanization and management bem et al 2015 carbonneau 2009 clingeleffer 2009 kliewer et al 1989 although more practical vertical shoot positioning may be inconvenient under hot climates due to higher soil exposure to direct sun light contrary to horizontal trellis e g pergola with horizontal shoot positioning gladstone and dokoozlian 2003 grapevines temperature can increase via both convective and radiative heating convective heating occurs when air temperature tair exceeds plant temperature and heat is transferred to plant tissues this convective process can also cool down plants if tair is lower than plant s temperature in turn radiative heating takes place when sun thermal energy is intercepted and absorbed by leaves and or by berries hayman et al 2012 shading reduces radiative heating by decreasing incident direct radiation by increasing plant s reflection of thermal energy or by decreasing indirect radiation e g thermal energy reflected by soil campillo et al 2012 villalobos et al 2016 the impact of soil temperature ts on grapevine canopy and cluster metabolism must be better accounted for in sparse planted crops row crops such as vineyards soil surface largely contributes for energy balance processes within the soil canopy atmosphere continuum heilman et al 1994 hicks 1973 nobel 2005 also berry temperature tberry is influenced by soil heat via micro advection pieri 2010a b pogue 2008 literature reports significant increases in ts at least at a rate similar to tair over the past decades in postdam germany for example the upper one meter soil proﬁle increased by about two to three degrees celsius during spring and summer april to august in the last 100 years böhme and böttcher 2011 therefore if we assume that i row crops are more vulnerable to heat waves ii heat stress can partly derive from soil heat fluxes and iii row configuration of crops amplifies the impact of ts on both canopy and fruits a better understanding and monitoring of this soil canopy atmosphere continuum is required despite the significant contribution of soil to system fluxes partitioning of energy balance components between soil and canopy is not easy to predict kool et al 2016 ortega farías et al 2016 2010 pieri 2010a b pogue 2008 sene 1994 spano et al 2000 moreover there are still knowledge gaps regarding the combined effect of ts and high tair on grapevine canopy and berry metabolism in particular at the cluster zone this issue gains more attention if we consider climate change scenarios and the potential negative impacts of extreme high tc on vines performance and berry composition holzapfel et al 2016 shultz 2016 it is also recognized that the response of grapevine to climate change namely heat and drought stress varies with the genotype bota et al 2001 chaves et al 2016 costa et al 2012 therefore improved grapevine genotype characterization combined with appropriate soil and irrigation management is required costa et al 2016 in this context the aims of our work were to identify the spatial and temporal variation in tc tberry and ts patterns based on punctual and imaging measurements of temperature as means to improve water and heat stress management in mediterranean vineyards subjected to deficit irrigation furthermore this study also aimed at assessing if thermal imaging can discriminate differences between genotypes on the basis of their tc patterns 2 material and methods 2 1 location and plant material the experiment was located in a commercial vineyard at reguengos de monsaraz alentejo south portugal 38 23 55 0 n 7 32 46 00 w elevation 200 m the climate is typically mediterranean with mild temperatures in winter rarely below five degrees celsius and dry and warm summers with especially high tair temperature e g in july and august when average values reach 25 c with punctual maximum values above 40 c we used 11 years old grapevines of the red varieties touriga nacional tou and aragonez syn tempranillo ara which are two of the most important varieties cultivated in portugal ivv 2017 vines of the two genotypes were grafted onto 1103 paulsen rootstock and were planted side by side in two adjacent plots planting density was 2200 vines ha 1 5 m x 3 0 m per vine with n s oriented rows vines were subjected to identical canopy management and cultivation standard practices vines were trained on a vertical shoot positioning with one pair of movable wires and spur pruned on a bilateral royat cordon system with

irrigation amounts and shows important differences between 2014 and 2015 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 climate data soil and plant water status tair relative humidity rh wind speed and solar radiation were hourly collected using an automatic weather station imetos 1 pessl instruments gmbh werksweg austria located in the vineyard close to the experimental plot fig 1 grapevine water status was assessed along the vegetative period from flowering to harvest by measuring leaf water potential at pre dawn ψpd and along the day ψleaf at three hour intervals with a scholander pressure chamber soil moisture equipment corp sta barbara ca usa a total of four leaves per irrigation treatment eight leaves per genotype were used in each data point mature leaves were taken from the middle part of the canopy from the sunlit side where leaf gas exchange was measured 2 3 2 canopy soil and berry temperature ground based thermal imaging flir b20 camera flir systems usa 7 13 μm 320 240 pixels ε 0 96 was used to remotely assess canopy and soil surface temperatures we assumed an identical emissivity for soil which is within the range proposed by jones and vaughan 2010 for non sandy soils individual leaf temperature tleaf and berry temperature tberry were also continuously measured at 30 min interval from berry pea size to full maturation using a two junction fine wire copper constantan thermocouples and registered in a dual channel temperature data logger egipto et al 2016 tberry was measured on two berries from a sample of three clusters per grapevine located at three different canopy positions sunlit exposed and non exposed berries from clusters at the interior of the canopy east and west exposed face of the canopy in two blocks a total of six tberry measurements per variety and irrigation treatment were done in parallel punctual tleaf measurements were done in three mature fully developed leaves located at different canopy positions facing east facing west and interior canopy thermal images were taken along the day and season in 2014 24 july and 19 august and in 2015 12 13 may 3 june 8 9 july and 13 14 august diurnal cycle measurements were done at 8 00 9 00 h 11 00 h 14 00 h 17 00 h and 19 20 00 h thermal imaging was followed by visible rgb imaging in 2015 a 24 to 36 h observation period was punctually implemented along the growing cycle on 12 13 may 8 9 july and 13 14 august e g on 8 9 july plants were observed at 24 00 h 5 00 h 9 00 h 11 00 h 14 30 h 17 00 h 20 00 h 24 00 h 6 00 h 9 30 h 11 00 h data not shown for the last three measurements of the day the thermal camera was positioned at the center of the inter row and images were taken at about 15 m distance from the nearest smart point equipped with thermocouples fig 2 images were taken with a n s orientation and the field of view included two parallel rows background reference temperature was determined by measuring temperature of a crumpled sheet of aluminum foil placed near the leaves canopy of interest and using ε 1 jones et al 2002 thermal images were corrected for background temperature and analyzed with the thermacam researcher pro 2 10 software flir systems usa six regions of interest rois were manually selected in each thermogram by using the function add polygon of the thermacam research software four rois corresponded to the canopy upper canopy and cluster zone in both sides facing east and west two additional rois were selected for soil surface east and west sides by using the thermacam researcher pro 2 10 software the radiometric images were converted into csv files and exported to excel to obtain a temperature data matrix in which each cell pixel corresponded to a temperature value the number of pixels of each roi was always above 1500 pixels pixels were counted at a 0 2 c temperature range e g 20 00 to 20 19 c and registered in an absolute frequency table the maximum standard deviation of temperature values measured within the selected rois was 2 29 c at the canopy level and 7 04 c at soil level thermal data was normalized dividing the number of pixels within each temperature class interval by the total number of pixels of the roi resulting into a relative pixel frequency per roi 2 3 3 individual leaf gas exchange stomatal conductance to water vapor gs and net co2 assimilation an were assessed with a portable infrared gas exchange system li 6400 licor inc lincoln nebraska usa equipped with a 6 cm2 transparent leaf chamber with an air flow rate set at 500 mol s 1 measurements were done in two mature and sunlit leaves per plant using a total of four plants per irrigation treatment and variety leaf gas exchange was assessed immediately after thermography measurements 2 3 4 canopy traits and yield grapevine leaf area was measured according to lopes and pinto 2005 in two average length shoots from three vines per elemental plot at flowering veraison mid ripening and harvest the total leaf area tla and lateral leaf area lla per vine were assessed as indicative traits of plant vigour the lla is presented as percentage of tla the exposed leaf area ela m2 ha was calculated for each irrigation treatment and variety by measuring canopy height and width in ten plants two replications per vine per treatment block and variety yield was assessed in the two genotypes by recording the number of clusters and their total weight from 15 selected vines per elemental plot 60 vines per treatment 2 4 experimental design and statistical analysis the experimental set up was a randomized complete block design with two deficit irrigation treatments and four replications per treatment the elemental plot comprised three contiguous rows with two buffer rows and a central one for data harvesting thermal data were retrieved from two of the four experimental blocks of the trial the relationships between tc and ψleaf and between tc and gs were assessed by pearson correlation using pooled data from the two genotypes statistical analysis was done using the statistix 9 0 analytical software the differences in tla lla and ela due to irrigation treatments within each variety were compared by a two way anova a factorial anova split plot design using the variety as main factor the irrigation treatment as a sub factor and blocks as replications was performed to evaluate the effects of variety at each date a 95 confidence interval ci was computed for the mean of thermal data and used to compare the different roi patterns correlation analysis was used to study the relationships between ts and tc at cluster zone of sunlit canopy between 14 00 and 20 00 h 3 results 3 1 weather conditions and irrigation weather data show differences between the two seasons years although solar radiation was similar in both years 2015 was warmer and drier than 2014 table 2 consequently the longest irrigation period and the largest volume of irrigation water were applied in 2015 table 2 in addition the smaller vpd and tair observed in 2014 resulted in lower cumulative reference evapotranspiration et0 values as compared to 2015 table 2 climate data solar radiation tair rh relative to the data collecting days in 2014 and 2015 is presented in fig 1 in 2014 vpd values varied between 0 07 and 3 46 kpa during observations 2 40 3 46 kpa from 14 00 to 17 00 h whereas in 2015 vpd values oscillated between 0 08 and 5 91 kpa 4 56 to 5 91 from 14 00 to 17 00 h 3 2 soil and plant water status the average values of ψpd varied between 0 1 and 0 2 mpa no stress at the flowering period of 2014 and 2015 seasons respectively ψpd decreased along the season attaining a minimum of about 0 6 to 0 75 mpa in the di2 treatment at mid end august 2014 which indicates a mild to severe water stress condition at harvest fig 3 di2 plants showed slightly more negative ψpd in aragonez 0 75 mpa for di2 and 0 78 mpa for di1 fig 3 regarding the diurnal variation of leaf water potential in both seasons vines decreased their water potential along the day but showed a marked recovery by 20 00 h mainly in 2014 in turn the recovery observed by 19 00 20 00 h in 2015 was less evident than in 2014 mainly in august indicating more severe drought stress fig 4 3 3 variation of leaf canopy soil and berry temperature along the day in 2014 in mid july and mid august diurnal assessments show that tc was two to three degrees celsius above the optimal tleaf for photosynthesis 25 30 c mullins et al 1992 fig 5 a and b under clean sky conditions and that the maximum tc was measured at around 17 00 h more extreme tair and vpd conditions in 2015 resulted in several days with tc values clearly above the optimum tleaf for photosynthesis an extreme example occurred on 8 9 july 2015 where a tleaf of three to eight degrees celsius above the optimum tleaf for photosynthesis was measured fig 5 the effect of irrigation treatments and cultivar on tc and tleaf was not always clear but di2 vines showed punctually a tendency for higher tc than di1 vines under more stressful atmospheric conditions high tair and vpd e g 8 9 july 2015 fig 5c a more detailed analysis of tc was performed in 2015 by assessing the vertical variation profile of tc by measuring the temperature of the upper and lower cluster zone parts of the canopy see figs 6a and 6b and table 4 tc patterns were similar at the upper canopy and the cluster zone of the canopy during the night period till early morning see figs 6a and 6b and table 4 however between 9 00 h and 17 00 h when ts markedly increases tc at the cluster zone achieves its highest temperatures mainly during the afternoon hours figs 6a and 6b and table 4 we monitored as well the diurnal variation of ts in 2015 fig 5c shows the variation of tair tc and ts along a 24 00 h period for both genotypes and irrigation treatments we can distinguish a diurnal variation pattern for ts as compared to tc see figs 5c and 6 indeed the variation pattern of ts was closely linked to variation in sun radiation fig 5c whereas tc was more related to tair although with a certain delay fig 5c while in the morning 8 00 9 00 h soil temperature was on average ca 5 c higher than tc in the afternoon the difference increased to a maximum of 10 15 c fig 5c and table 4 during the night as solar radiation is not available to warm up soil s surface ts values reach an equilibrium with tair and tc figs 6a and 6b and table 4 measurements of tberry with thermocouples showed that tberry was closely coupled to tair during the morning period but not in the afternoon fig 7 indeed in the afternoon the decrease in tberry was delayed in both varieties and irrigation treatments relatively to the decrease observed in tair fig 7 3 4 canopy temperature vs leaf water potential and gas exchange the analysis of data from water potential thermography and individual leaf gas exchange along the trial indicates that irrespective of the varying climate conditions in 2014 and 2015 the parameter tc was negatively correlated with leaf water potential stomatal conductance to water vapor and to net photosynthesis fig 8 moreover a negative relationship was found between the tc 14 17h and leaf water potential measured at the most stressful time of the day 14 00 17 00 h correlations between tc and leaf water potential were stronger in 2015 which was the driest and warmest season fig 8 furthermore punctual measurements of tleaf made with thermocouples were closely related to thermal imaging measurements of tc r 0 87 p 0 001 demonstrating the robustness of the imaging approach 3 5 canopy traits and yield the exposed leaf area of ara was larger than that of tou table 3 which could result in larger water loss in ara vines due to transpiration in turn higher percentage of laterals was found in tou indicating a higher proportion of young leaves that could potentially influence canopy microclimate e g higher rh in 2015 which was the most stressful season of the trial total leaf area of tou and ara was reduced by about 53 and 43 respectively as compared to 2014 regarding yield results in 2014 the average yield of ara was 4 7 kg vine while that of tou was 4 1 kg under the more stressful conditions of 2015 vines of ara produced in average 4 5 kg vine as compared to 3 9 kg vine obtained for tou the effect of irrigation strategy was not significant except in 2015 for tou where di2 showed a significantly lower yield than di1 3 4 vs 4 3 kg vine respectively 4 discussion and conclusions heat and drought stress limit wine production in mediterranean climates this is particularly the case when heat waves strike vineyards or and when irrigation is not possible and or mismanaged therefore a better understanding of grapevine responses to water and heat stress combined with improved crop monitoring based on thermal patterns will contribute to optimize irrigation and soil management in mediterranean viticulture deficit irrigation helps to save irrigation water in viticulture in this trial we found that di2 strategy reduced the amount of water used 45 460 m3 ha 1 year 1 as compared to the conventional di1 strategy with minimal negative effects on yield nevertheless further studies are needed to better evaluate the long term impact of di strategies on yield and vines longevity for different genotypes we observed differences between genotypes for vine s water status as evaluated by ψpd ara vines presented more negative ψpd as compared to tou especially under the most stressful treatment di2 this behavior of ara can be related to canopy size and architecture as ara has a larger total leaf area leading to higher total transpiration water loss as compared to tou table 3 in previous field experiments carried out in alentejo vines of the variety tou kept higher stomatal conductance and lower tc than ara for identical water potential costa et al 2012 suggesting that tou can maintain better thermal regulation than ara under mild water stress conditions however in the present experiment and in spite of the lower ψpd tc and leaf gas exchange patterns observed for ara vines were not different from the ones of tou a relevant finding was that the highest tc values were measured at mid late afternoon 17 00 h figs 5 and 6a 6b and not at the warmest time of the day which can be related with the thermal inertia associated to leaf tissues water content schymanski et al 2013 and to the potential effect of re radiation of soil energy at that time of the day when tair is lower than the afternoon warmest hours the observed tc profile shows that soil heat fluxes may influence tc at the cluster zone which is the part of the canopy closest to soil s surface in a vertical shoot positioning trellis we found a clear trend of higher temperatures in the cluster zone of the canopy as compared to its upper part figs 6a 6b tables 4 and 5 these results are in accordance to previous findings in grapevine pieri 2010a b pogue 2008 van leeuwen et al 2004 the positive correlation between ts and tc at the cluster zone in particular when exposed to direct sunlight with ts values reaching 10 15 c higher than tc supports the idea that soil heat fluxes may be influencing canopy microclimate in particular at the cluster zone see table 5 in addition these findings suggest that cluster zone could be highly vulnerable to the effect of ascendant heat fluxes originated by soil stored heat mainly under sunlit conditions the release of soil heat to the atmosphere whenever tair decreases along the mid and end afternoon contributes to higher tc of the cluster zone table 4 the minimum tc range was observed during the night period until pre dawn figs 6a 6b and table 4 as soon as there is no solar energy income soil vine atmosphere system tends to an equilibrium once sun rises tc variability increases either due to different canopy surface exposition east west and to leaf position orientation on the canopy which ultimately affects the amount of absorbed emitted and reflected energy other contributions for the measured tc variability within each irrigation treatment x variety can be related to the variation in solar azimuth and elevation which modifies the amount of energy absorbed emitted and reflected by exposed leaves along the day season the same applies to ts figs 6a 6b once solar azimuth and elevation changes along the day the proportion of sun exposed and shaded soil changes with the diurnal dynamic of sunlight exposition promoting differential soil temperature patterns along the day as the impact of evaporative cooling throughout the day is smaller for soil than for a transpiring canopy ts showed a more marked variation than tc regarding the potential role of canopy density on grapevine thermal regulation it is possible that denser canopies could generate less favorable microclimate to evaporative cooling due to higher rh and reduced air renovation within the canopy which generates lower evaporative demand table 3 in parallel higher canopy density can restrict convective cooling by reducing air movement within the canopy regarding tberry variation along the day it is possible that the thermal inertia related to berry s water content 75 85 gerós et al 2012 might explain the delay observed in the cooling down observed in the afternoon fig 7 similarly to what occurs with leaf tissues schymanski et al 2013 in very hot days during the afternoon hours the effect of extreme soil temperatures and related heat fluxes particularly in the sunlit side of the canopy e g 40 55 c should influence canopy s temperature at the cluster zone indeed we found that tberry was above 33 35 c for several hours of the day fig 7 which can be particularly harmful for red berries composition as their pigments absorb much light and convert it into heat gladstones 2015 promoting degradation of anthocyanins and or repressing their synthesis tarara et al 2008 zarrouk et al 2016 our findings show the relevance of thermal remote sensing to monitor plant and soil temperature patterns in vineyards and to identify spots and or times of the day with high risk of extreme temperatures and related sunburn of leaves and berries the use of thermal indexes such as cwsi or ig helps to minimize the influence of variable climate conditions on thermographic measurements bellvert et al 2016 jones 2004 jones et al 2002 costa et al 2010 maes and steppe 2012 nevertheless our results show that tc correlates with major eco physiological traits such as ψleaf gs and an along the two seasons fig 8 this points out that tc can be used as a simple thermal indicator of water status leaf gas exchange in grapevine garcía tejero et al 2016 moreover the fact that ψleaf measured in the afternoon 14 00 17 00 h was correlated with tc 14 17h is in line with previous literature for grapevine and other crops bellvert et al 2016 dejonge et al 2015 grant et al 2007 pou et al 2014 and it has practical benefits for field monitoring by avoiding the inconvenience of pre dawn measurements similarly the close relationship between thermocouple measurements of tleaf and thermal imaging values of tc supports the practical use of tc previous literature emphasized the usefulness of tc as a biophysical variable to monitor water stress in grapevine baluja et al 2012 espinoza et al 2017 garcía tejero et al 2016 nevertheless we must consider that the variation in air vpd may affect canopy evaporative cooling and thus tc bellvert et al 2016 this may explain the differences observed for the regression slopes when correlating tc 14 17h with leaf water potential and leaf gas exchange in 2014 and 2015 fig 8 as opposed to thermal imaging measurements done perpendicularly to the row costa et al 2012 garcía tejero et al 2016 jones et al 2002 pou et al 2014 the use of thermography for vineyard monitoring along rows simplifies ground based measurements and will save time while allowing visualization of a larger portion of the canopy attending to the impact of ts on heat exchanges in vineyards reported in this paper further testing of novel soil management and training strategies that reduce the impact of soil heat on canopy and berry is required in particular the effects of soil and crop residue management on vineyards soil heat fluxes should be studied in combination with canopy architecture size orientation and trunk height our results on the impact of ts on tc and tberry are likely to be also relevant when considering training systems with short trunck height in warm climates e g south europe this kind of studies will further help to better predict evapotranspiration losses assess unproductive irrigation water use save water and support development of evapotranspiration models carrasco benavides et al 2014 kool et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 aiming at the improvement of vineyard sustainability finally monitoring of ts and tc in vineyards along the season can provide valuable information for efficient irrigation management and to map hot spots islands within the vineyard as well as to feed models to support decision making and to reduce the risks of leaf and berry sunburn

rain events are than 13 mm the primary source of irrigation water in the thp is pumped from the ogallala aquifer oa which has a different isotopic δ 18o signature compared to rainfall captured water given this difference it is feasible to quantify changes in the δ 18o signature of the plant water as the plant uptakes the rain and irrigation water stored in the soil to this end cotton gossypium hirsutum l was grown and irrigated with subsurface drip and center pivot and under dryland conditions the irrigation water was pumped from the oa and rainfall was collected in a rain gauge with mineral oil to prevent evaporation additionally plant and soil samples were collected before and after each rain event thereafter water was extracted from the collected soil and plant samples using cryogenic vacuum distillation and analyzed for δ 18o using a liquid water isotope analyzer the difference in isotope concentrations in the extracts showed a change δ 18o of the cotton petiole water

southern high plains shp of texas is grown in the region known as the llano estacado which is part of the great plains of north america stout 2018 the east portion is delineated by the end of the caprock escarpment a transition of the level plains and the surrounding rolling terrain with the western portion extending into new mexico the llano estacado region lies within the shp and within the texas portion are seven counties that have the highest production of upland cotton in the state national cotton council of america 2018 the history of cotton production in the shp is closely linked to the implementation of large scale irrigation arneson 1921 bloodworth and gillett 1984 which started in the 1920 1930 s with the introduction of the internal combustion engine musick et al 1988 and in response to the drought of the dust bowl opie et al 2018 the source of nearly all the irrigation water is the ogallala aquifer colaizzi et al 2009 which covers eight states of the usa and trends of irrigation are given by musick et al 1990 colaizzi et al 2009 wagner 2012 mahan and lascano 2016 in the shp the ogallala aquifer is largely a closed system where withdrawals exceed recharge and over the years the water table has declined musick et al 1988 1990 colaizzi et al 2009 this decline led to the adoption of so called deficit irrigation fereres and soriano 2007 practices because in some areas of the shp irrigation wells yield less than the daily water requirement of crops further and in response to this decline and to make use of seasonal rain the sprinkler irrigation system known as low energy precision application lepa was introduced lyle and bordovsky 1981 1983 bordovsky et al 1992 these sprinkler systems are generally mounted on center pivots that typically range in length from 400 to 800 m and deliver water to the ground via drop pipes that end with orifice controlled emitters operating at low pressures i e 150 kpa another irrigation system that has gained popularity in recent years again in response to the decline of the water table is drip irrigation camp 1998 plaut et al 1988 in the shp and for crop production drip irrigation systems are buried in the ground close to 0 3 m depth with drip lines typically on every other row e g wanjura et al 2002 bordovsky and porter 2008 hereafter and for brevity the buried drip tape is referred to as sub surface drip ssd and the center pivot sprinkler with lepa is referred to as lepa drip irrigation and center pivot sprinkler systems such as lepa are perhaps the two most efficient and advanced technologies that can be used for large scale irrigation in crop production they are both efficient i e ratio of volume of water applied and used for evapotranspiration to the total volume of water applied burt et al 1997 but their adoption has contributed to accelerate the decline of the water table in the ogallala aquifer this effect has been labeled the irrigation paradox grafton et al 2018 regardless of irrigation system used to deliver water to a crop its implementation must consider the local rainfall distribution and amount lascano 2000 information on rain frequency and amount is important before during and after the growing season for example in the shp late fall and early spring rains can partially fill the soil profile and provide the subsequent cotton crop with water during the growing season this water is stored in deep portions of the soil profile and is available for uptake when the crop is well established with a deep rooted system however this is a simple premise that is complicated because annual rainfall is variable in both amount and frequency and in most years inadequate to supply the crop water needs for example in lubbock tx the long term annual average rainfall is 458 146 mm and during the normal cotton growing season from may to october the monthly coefficient of variation for rain is 70 and about 49 of rain events are 10 mm mauget and leiker 2010 in bushland tx 200 km north of lubbock about 82 of annual rain events are 12 mm as measured over a 20 year period jones et al 1985 given this scenario a question of interest was which irrigation system lepa or ssd and for the conditions of the shp makes better use of rainfall during the growing season in the shp irrigation with lepa is done in conjunction with basins i e furrow dikes lyle and dixon 1977 designed to pond rainfall and reduce runoff and typically only every other row is watered bordovsky et al 1992 in cotton the irrigation strategy is for frequent irrigations 3 to 6 day interval and volumes of application that depend on the well capacity of 2 5 to 7 5 mm d lascano 2000 in this type of irrigation and throughout the growing season the soil surface remains partially wet from either irrigation or rain and we can assume that the cotton plant has active roots in the upper 0 1 to 0 2 m depth that can uptake water as previously noted 50 to 80 of rain events in the shp are 12 mm and what portion of this water evaporates from the soil or used by the crop as transpiration is unknown further in the shp is common to have periods of time say 10 to 20 days or longer without any rain and under these conditions we hypothesized that cotton plants irrigated with a sprinkler lepa system will be able to use a larger portion of a rain event after a dry period compared to a cotton plant irrigated with an ssd irrigation buried at 0 3 m our objective was to test our hypothesis with a field experiment i e proof of concept using stable isotopes to investigate if it was possible to determine if water originating from a 12 mm rain event could be detected in cotton irrigated with a sprinkler lepa and ssd system stable isotopes have been used to study water movement through different environments for several decades allison 1982 dawson et al 2002 and are ideally suited for this type of field experiment goebel et al 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiments were conducted at

may 2014 day of year doy 132 in the ssd and dryland fields and on the 15 may 2014 doy 135 in the lepa field on raised beds 1 m apart the center pivot zimmatic omaha ne irrigation system was 110 m long

drip tapes with the tape buried 0 30 m below the soil surface the emitters on the drip tape were spaced 0 6 m apart and the cotton was irrigated daily with 3 mm of water 2 2 experimental overview to differentiate between changes in isotopic signature of the plant due to the transpiration of rainwater from simple diurnal variation in the isotopic conditions of the plant several factors must be considered one factor is the diurnal variation in the isotopic signature of different plant tissues another factor is the variability in isotopic signature due to spatial variability e g variation in soil water content therefore and to minimize diurnal variation in isotopic signatures in the plant tissues that represent points of isotopic fractionation plant leaves were avoided and petioles were chosen and used yakir et al 1990 goebel et al 2015 to maintain some systematic plant height conditions petioles were sampled from the fifth leaf which is considered the first leaf on a cotton plant that is a source i e the leaf that is providing net energy into the plant vs the upper leaves that are actively growing and are considered sinks goebel et al 2015 two plant samples were collected at every time period to provide redundancy the two samples were taken at random locations across the field and where possible both samples were extracted and analyzed the resulting two samples were considered independent and their measured isotopic signature value were not averaged and provided a measure of the spatial variability of the isotopic signature across each field at a particular time flanagan et al 2005 on doy 195 we carried out our initial plant and soil sampling scheme and we designated this as a control it was used to quantify the variation in isotopic composition of plant and soil water samples over a 12 h daylight period obtained from the dryland ssd and lepa fields overnight on doy 195 a 12 mm rain event occurred and sampling commenced after dawn the following day on doy 196 2 3 petiole sample collection extraction and analysis prior to any rain two petiole samples were taken from the fifth leaf of cotton plants randomly distributed in a 10 20 m area of each field as described in section 2 2 two petiole samples were taken every time the petioles were reduced in size to 5 mm and placed in glass vials and sealed the vials were then placed in a laboratory freezer until extraction of the plant water could be conducted on 15 july doy 196 after a rain event petiole samples were taken as described above every two hours during daylight hours for the next four days plant water extraction was achieved using cryogenic vacuum distillation the vials containing the frozen petiole samples harvested form the cotton plants were opened and both the vial and cap were placed in an ignition tube that was placed in liquid nitrogen for 20 min the ignition tube was then placed on the cryogenic distillation apparatus and the extraction was allowed to proceed for 90 min goebel and lascano 2012 the resulting extracted water sample was then sealed with parafilm placed in a water bath and allowed to thaw the liquid water was then transferred to a 2 ml vial for analysis the water samples were analyzed for isotopic concentration with a liquid water isotope analyzer liwa los gatos research lgr model dlt 100 mountain view ca and using the iaea protocol for isotopic analysis of liquid water newman et al 2009 the results from the instrument were then run through lgr sci software version 1 0 0 69 and thereafter modified using calibration plots generated for broadband and narrow band contaminants goebel and lascano 2013 2 4 soil sample collection extraction and analysis on the 14 july doy 195 soil samples were taken to measure the isotope ratio of the water present in the soil profile prior to the addition of rainwater for this purpose soil samples were then taken after the rain event starting at 12 00 h doy 195 and again every 8 h or twice a day for the next four days samples were taken using a manual soil core sampler with plastic inserts to a depth of 0 3 m the soil cores were taken in the furrow with the plant petiole samples taken from either side for an approximate 0 5 m distance the inserts were capped and brought into the laboratory and further cut into 20 mm subsamples that were placed into ignition tubes the ignition tubes were sealed with rubber stoppers and stored in the freezer until the extraction could be performed the extraction method used was cryogenic vacuum distillation goebel and lascano 2012 the samples were removed from the freezer and placed in liquid nitrogen for 20 min to assure they were completely frozen the ignition tube containing the soil sample was then placed on the cryogenic distillation apparatus and the extraction was allowed to progress for 60 min goebel and lascano 2012 the water collected from the distillation was then sealed with parafilm placed in a water bath and allowed to thaw the liquid water was then placed in a 2 ml vial and was analyzed using the liwa to determine the isotopic composition of the soil water as with the extracted plant water the soil samples were also analyzed using the iaea protocol for isotopic analysis of liquid water newman et al 2009 2 5 rainwater collection and analysis rainwater was collected with a plastic rain gauge model 260 2531 m nova lynx corp auburn ca where 5 ml of mineral oil was added prior to any rain the mineral oil acts as a barrier to evaporation of the rainwater and thereby maintains the isotopic concentration until the rainwater was collected in a vial and sealed for storage the rain gauge was located on the roof of the usda ars main building about 300 m from the field plots the rain samples were always collected the day after the rain 3 results and discussion the 2014 growing season was an average year for total rainfall with 15 days of recorded rainfall at our location totaling 181 mm for the time period from planting doy 132 to the start of the experiment on doy 195 fig 1 however of days with rain 7 days had rain accumulation of 10 mm and only 3 days had accumulations of 25 mm this rain pattern left 50 of the rain accumulating at 25 mm and the 3 days of rain 25 mm occurred over a 4 day period from doy 143 146 the annual 2014 rainfall was 479 mm which was within 20 mm of the long term average of 458 146 for lubbock tx lascano 2000 the month of july 34 mm and august 38 mm were about 30 less rain than the long term average and the month of september 170 mm was about twice more rain than the long term average fig 1 the use of stable isotopes of water to track rainwater uptake in cotton is difficult when rain events occur frequently as the rain disturbs the isotopic signature of the soil water in the profile for this reason a period of at least two weeks was needed to allow the soil profile to stabilize this break occurred starting on doy 183 and continued until doy 196 when a 12 mm rain event occurred containing rainwater with an average measured bulk isotopic signature of 1 4 δ18o another small rain event of 1 2 mm occurred on doy 196 resulting in an isotopic signature of 3 6 δ18o for each of the sampled fields measured soil and plant isotopic data are displayed in fig 2 for the ssd irrigation in fig 3 for the dryland and in fig 4 for the lepa irrigation the bottom half of each figure shows the measured δ18o of soil water as a function of soil depth sampled in 20 mm increments from the surface to 300 mm depth and for doy 195 to 198 this is a detailed 15 soil layers that are used to describe how the measured δ18o of soil water changed in the surface 0 3 m and over time box plots showing the average of measured δ18o cotton petiole water throughout the day for 5 days doy 195 200 is shown in the upper half of each figure also given are the isotopic signature for the two rain events 1 4 δ18o for the 12 mm rain on doy 195 and 3 6 δ18o for the 1 2 mm rain on doy 199 a shortcoming of using stable isotopes of water to trace water movement is that they are effective at qualifying the presence of the rainwater but it is difficult to use stable isotopes of water to quantify the amount of rainwater used by the plants nevertheless and as an attempt to provide an estimate of the rainwater used the measured δ18o of cotton petiole water is given as box plots in figs 2 to 5 with the mean and upper and lower quartile for a given day the mean value of the δ18o of cotton petioles for the day prior to the rain event can then be compared to the mean value of δ18o cotton petioles after the rain to calculate a shift in the isotopic signature of the petiole water toward that of the rainwater for example the difference calculated as pre rain mean δ18o mean doy 199 δ18o pre rain mean δ18o 100 is an estimate of the change in mean isotopic signature of the cotton petiole water 3 1 subsurface drip irrigation prior to the rain event of 12 mm that occurred on doy 195 the isotopic distribution of the soil water in the soil profile resembled what would be considered a stable profile under ssd irrigation goebel et al 2015 the isotopic signature at the surface was 1 08 δ18o gradually depleting to 5 8 δ18o at a soil depth of 80 mm fig 2 as expected from a depth of 80 to 300 mm the isotopic value remains constant where irrigation water was applied from drip emitters at 300 mm and moves upward in the soil profile before being subject to enrichment due to evaporation at the soil surface after the 12 mm rain event on doy 196 the isotopic signature of the soil water at the surface changed to 3 2 δ18o resulting from the infiltration and mixing of the rainwater the peak of enrichment in the soil water profile 2 6 δ18o occurred at 60 mm this is the point where rainwater infiltrated into the soil profile and through piston flow moved the more enriched water that was at the surface deeper into the profile this enrichment peak continued to move downward in the profile to 80 mm on doy 197 and thereafter did not change suggesting that the rainwater did not infiltrate beyond 80 mm and that any resulting rainwater uptake by the cotton plants would require roots in the upper 80 mm of the soil profile prior to the rain event on doy 196 the isotopic signature of the petiole water was consistent throughout the day with a mean value of 3 5 δ18o for all the randomly sampled petioles for the entire day after the 12 mm rain the isotopic signature from the petiole samples increased in variability over the course of the day with the mean value of 3 1 δ18o trending slightly toward the isotopic signature of the rainwater 1 4 δ18o over the next two days doy 197 and 198 the scatter of the measured isotopic signature of the petiole water increased but the mean drifted only slightly to 2 9 δ18o suggesting that the cotton was able to use some of the rainwater that had moved 80 mm into the soil profile after the 1 2 mm rain on doy 199 the scatter of the isotopic signature of the petioles increased further and the mean value shifted to 2 1 δ18o the petiole samples taken later in the day showed a consistent trend toward enrichment similar to the isotopic signature of the soil in the upper portion of the soil profile this trend of enrichment at the end of the day on doy 199 was also measured in the dryland fig 3 and lepa fields fig 4 3 2 dryland the measured isotopic signature of soil water in the profile showed that a stable soil water isotopic signature had developed on doy 195 in the dryland field fig 3 the soil profile showed a well defined fractionation peak at 40 mm that has been previously observed at this location goebel et al 2015 and is well described by others allison 1982 braud et al 2009 the peak of enrichment prior to the rain event on doy 196 was 5 5 δ18o at 40 mm with depletion occurring with depth to 160 mm and an isotopic signature of 4 0 δ18o the isotopic signature beyond this depth was relatively stable to a soil depth of 300 mm after the rain event the fractionation peak moved deeper into the soil profile reaching a maximum depth of 80 mm on doy 197 this result suggests that for the cotton plants to use this water they must have a root system in the top 80 mm of the soil profile the isotopic signature of the petiole water of cotton plants sampled at 2 hour interval had some scatter over the course of doy 195 and the mean isotopic signature was 3 4 δ18o this value was similar to the petioles sampled under ssd prior to the rain event fig 2 after the rain event on doy 196 the petiole water of all the samples collected during the day showed more scatter however the mean shifted to 2 6 δ18o the next day doy 197 the isotopic signature of the water from the cotton petioles maintained a similar amount of scatter but the mean shifted to 2 1 δ18o moving closer to the isotopic signature of the rainwater the next day doy 198 the scatter of the isotopic signature from the petiole samples was somewhat reduced however the mean also decreased slightly to 2 1 δ18o after the 1 2 mm rain on doy 199 the scatter in the isotopic signature of the cotton petiole water returned but the mean shifted slightly back to 2 1 δ18o fig 3 3 3 lepa results of measured δ18o in the soil water and cotton petioles as a function of time for cotton irrigated with lepa is shown in fig 4 prior to the rain event of 12 mm on doy 196 the isotopic composition of the soil water resembled a stable profile under ssd with a frequent application of 25 mm of irrigation water every three days a more linear isotopic signature from 0 to 100 mm was expected goebel et al 2015 after the rain event on doy 195 the measured δ18o values from the sampled soil cores showed the movement of the fractionation peak from at or near the surface down to 60 80 mm under all the ssd and lepa irrigation and dryland the movement of the fractionation peak is indicative of the movement of rainwater to this soil depth further these results suggest that if the cotton plants were able to uptake the rainwater plants must have roots at 60 80 mm or deeper in the soil profile the isotopic signature of the water extracted from random petiole samples taken throughout doy 195 fig 4 had little scatter with a mean value of 3 0 δ18o which was within 13 of the value measured under dryland fig 3 and within 17 of the value for ssd fig 2 after the 12 mm rain the scatter increased over the course of the next day but the mean isotopic signature for the petioles sampled became more enriched with a mean of 2 1 δ18o on doy 196 and by the third day doy 197 the mean isotopic signature was 1 8 δ18o and continued to be enriched to 0 85 δ18o on doy 199 fig 4 the ssd and lepa irrigation and dryland cotton showed a different response from the 12 mm rain event under ssd the cotton petiole water over the day prior to the rain was on average 3 5 δ18o and three days later doy 198 the average cotton petiole samples water 2 9 δ18o this result indicates that the cotton plants were able to use some of the rainwater as the isotope ratio shifted 0 6 δ18o toward a more enriched signature similar to that of the rainwater fig 2 the results under dryland where pre rain petiole water measurements averaged 3 4 d18o and three days following the rain event they averaged 2 3 δ18o a shift of 1 1 δ18o toward the isotopic composition of the rainwater fig 3 under lepa the petiole water pre rain measurements averaged 3 0 δ18o and three days after the rain averaged 1 1 δ18o a shift of 1 9 δ18o toward the isotopic composition of the rainwater these results are based on rain events of 12 and 1 2 mm however the results are a proof of concept on the use of stable isotopes to discriminate water transpired by the crop from either rain or from irrigation under field conditions we are encouraged by these results to further pursue the field investigation and compare two irrigation systems ssd and center pivot lepa the complexity of discriminating root water uptake from either rain and irrigation under field conditions has led us to continue this research using a portable rainfall simulator to apply different water of known isotopic signature further we plan to implement simulation models of the energy and water balance bufon et al 2012 lascano et al 1987 evett and lascano 1993 to determine the impact of root architecture i e root length density as a function of soil depth on crop transpiration and evaporation of water from the soil for ssd and lepa irrigation our plan is to use simulated values to delineate field experiments to expand our understanding on increasing the use of water from rainfall during the growing season for the shp 4 conclusions it is important to note that the results presented here show that is possible to detect the use of rainwater from a rain event of 12 mm in cotton under field conditions while the two irrigation management practices showed some use of the rainwater the lepa irrigation system responded faster and the isotopic signature of the cotton petiole water shifted closer to the rainwater than did the ssd and the dryland one of the drawbacks to using stable isotopes of water to trace water movement is that they are effective at qualifying the presence of the rainwater but it is difficult to use stable isotopes of water to quantify the amount of rainwater used for the period from planting to doy 195 there were two rain events with accumulations close to 13 mm these results suggest that cotton grown under dryland and lepa management strategies would have had access to an additional 20 to 30 mm of water during this period compared to the ssd irrigation this amount of water represents about 25 to 50 kg ha of additional cotton lint yield production wanjura et al 2002 in the semiarid texas high plains at 10 mm most of the water would have been lost to water evaporation from the soil however crop production in a semi arid environment using water from an aquifer that is being depleted could be improved with access to an additional 20 30 mm of rainfall while ssd conserves water that could otherwise be lost to soil water evaporation it appears that it also underuses rainwater that could account for a large portion of the water budget during the growing season in regions such as the texas high plains where 80 of rain

an ssd irrigation buried at 0 3 m our objective was to test our hypothesis with a field experiment i e proof of concept using stable isotopes to investigate if it was possible to determine if water originating from a 12 mm rain event could be detected in cotton irrigated with a sprinkler lepa and ssd system stable isotopes have been used to study water movement through different environments for several decades allison 1982 dawson et al 2002 and are ideally suited for this type of field experiment goebel et al 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiments were conducted at the united states department of agriculture usda agricultural research service ars cropping systems research laboratory in lubbock tx 33º 35 38 7 n 101º 53 51 9 w and 987 m above sea level soil and plant samples were taken from an irrigated field with lepa and from field plots irrigated with ssd and an adjacent dryland plot the soil of all sampled plots is classified as an amarillo soil series fine loamy mixed superactive thermic aridic paleustalfs with soil physical properties described by baumhardt et al 1995 the climate of the shp is semi arid with an erratic rainfall distribution during the growing season and is characterized by days with high wind speed low air humidity and high solar irradiance mauget and leiker 2010 cotton fibermax 2 2 mention of this or other proprietary products

may 2014 day of year doy 132 in the ssd and dryland fields and on the 15 may 2014 doy 135 in the lepa field on raised beds 1 m apart the center pivot zimmatic omaha ne irrigation system was 110 m long with two spans covering 4 ha and applied 25 mm of water every 3 days the ssd system consisted of a 22 mm flexible drip tubing eurodrip madera ca installed between alternate 1 0 m rows 2 0 m between drip tapes with the tape buried 0 30 m below the soil surface the emitters on the drip tape were spaced 0 6 m apart and the cotton was irrigated daily with 3 mm of water 2 2 experimental overview to differentiate between changes in isotopic signature of the plant due to the transpiration of rainwater from simple diurnal variation in the isotopic conditions of the plant several factors must be considered one factor is the diurnal variation in the isotopic signature of different plant tissues another factor is the variability in isotopic signature due to spatial variability e g variation in soil water content therefore and to minimize diurnal variation in isotopic signatures in the plant tissues that represent points of isotopic fractionation plant leaves were avoided and petioles were chosen and used yakir et al 1990 goebel et al 2015 to maintain some systematic plant height conditions petioles were sampled from the fifth leaf which is considered the first leaf on a cotton plant that is a source i e the leaf that is providing net energy into the plant vs the upper leaves that are actively growing and are considered sinks goebel et al 2015 two plant samples were collected at every time period to provide redundancy the two samples were taken at random locations across the field and where possible both samples were extracted and analyzed the resulting two samples were considered independent and their measured isotopic signature value were not averaged and provided a measure of the spatial variability of the isotopic signature across each field at a particular time flanagan et al 2005 on doy 195 we carried out our initial plant and soil sampling scheme and we designated this as a control it was used to quantify the variation in isotopic composition of plant and soil water samples over a 12 h daylight period obtained from the dryland ssd and lepa fields overnight on doy 195 a 12 mm rain event occurred and sampling commenced after dawn the following day on doy 196 2 3 petiole sample collection extraction and analysis prior to any rain two petiole samples were taken from the fifth leaf of cotton plants randomly distributed in a 10 20 m area of each field as described in section 2 2 two petiole samples were taken every time the petioles were reduced in size to 5 mm and placed in glass vials and sealed the vials were then placed in a laboratory freezer until extraction of the plant water could be conducted on 15 july doy 196 after a rain event petiole samples were taken as described above every two hours during daylight hours for the next four days plant water extraction was achieved using cryogenic vacuum distillation the vials containing the frozen petiole samples harvested form the cotton plants were opened and both the vial and cap were placed in an ignition tube that was placed in liquid nitrogen for 20 min the ignition tube was then placed on the cryogenic distillation apparatus and the extraction was allowed to proceed for 90 min goebel and lascano 2012 the resulting extracted water sample was then sealed with parafilm placed in a water bath and allowed to thaw the liquid water was then transferred to a 2 ml vial for analysis the water samples were analyzed for isotopic concentration with a liquid water isotope analyzer liwa los gatos research lgr model dlt 100 mountain view ca and using the iaea protocol for isotopic analysis of liquid water newman et al 2009 the results from the instrument were then run through lgr sci software version 1 0 0 69 and thereafter modified using calibration plots generated for broadband and narrow band contaminants goebel and lascano 2013 2 4 soil sample collection extraction and analysis on the 14 july doy 195 soil samples were taken to measure the isotope ratio of the water present in the soil profile prior to the addition of rainwater for this purpose soil samples were then taken after the rain event starting at 12 00 h doy 195 and again every 8 h or twice a day for the next four days samples were taken using a manual soil core sampler with plastic inserts to a depth of 0 3 m the soil cores were taken in the furrow with the plant petiole samples taken from either side for an approximate 0 5 m distance the inserts were capped and brought into the laboratory and further cut into 20 mm subsamples that were placed into ignition tubes the ignition tubes were sealed with rubber stoppers and stored in the freezer until the extraction could be performed the extraction method used was cryogenic vacuum distillation goebel and lascano 2012 the samples were removed from the freezer and placed in liquid nitrogen for 20 min to assure they were completely frozen the ignition tube containing the soil sample was then placed on the cryogenic distillation apparatus and the extraction was allowed to progress for 60 min goebel and lascano 2012 the water collected from the distillation was then sealed with parafilm placed in a water bath and allowed to thaw the liquid water was then placed in a 2 ml vial and was analyzed using the liwa to determine the isotopic composition of the soil water as with the extracted plant water the soil samples were also analyzed using the iaea protocol for isotopic analysis of liquid water newman et al 2009 2 5 rainwater collection and analysis rainwater was collected with a plastic rain gauge model 260 2531 m nova lynx corp auburn ca where 5 ml of mineral oil was added prior to any rain the mineral oil acts as a barrier to evaporation of the rainwater and thereby maintains the isotopic concentration until the rainwater was collected in a vial and sealed for storage the rain gauge was located on the roof of the usda ars main building about 300 m from the field plots the rain samples were always collected the day after the rain 3 results and discussion the 2014 growing season was an average year for total rainfall with 15 days of recorded rainfall at our location totaling 181 mm for the time period from planting doy 132 to the start of the experiment on doy 195 fig 1 however of days with rain 7 days had rain accumulation of 10 mm and only 3 days had accumulations of 25 mm this rain pattern left 50 of the rain accumulating at 25 mm and the 3 days of rain 25 mm occurred over a 4 day period from doy 143 146 the annual 2014 rainfall was 479 mm which was within 20 mm of the long term average of 458 146 for lubbock tx lascano 2000 the month of july 34 mm and august 38 mm were about 30 less rain than the long term average and the month of september 170 mm was about twice more rain than the long term average fig 1 the use of stable isotopes of water to track rainwater uptake in cotton is difficult when rain events occur frequently as the rain disturbs the isotopic signature of the soil water in the profile for this reason a period of at least two weeks was needed to allow the soil profile to stabilize this break occurred starting on doy 183 and continued until doy 196 when a 12 mm rain event occurred containing rainwater with an average measured bulk isotopic signature of 1 4 δ18o another small rain event of 1 2 mm occurred on doy 196 resulting in an isotopic signature of 3 6 δ18o for each of the sampled fields measured soil and plant isotopic data are displayed in fig 2 for the ssd irrigation in fig 3 for the dryland and in fig 4 for the lepa irrigation the bottom half of each figure shows the measured δ18o of soil water as a function of soil depth sampled in 20 mm increments from the surface to 300 mm depth and for doy 195 to 198 this is a detailed 15 soil layers that are used to describe how the measured δ18o of soil water changed in the surface 0 3 m and over time box plots showing the average of measured δ18o cotton petiole water throughout the day for 5 days doy 195 200 is shown in the upper half of each figure also given are the isotopic signature for the two rain events 1 4 δ18o for the 12 mm rain on doy 195 and 3 6 δ18o for the 1 2 mm rain on doy 199 a shortcoming of using stable isotopes of water to trace water movement is that they are effective at qualifying the presence of the rainwater but it is difficult to use stable isotopes of water to quantify the amount of rainwater used by the plants nevertheless and as an attempt to provide an estimate of the rainwater used the measured δ18o of cotton petiole water is given as box plots in figs 2 to 5 with the mean and upper and lower quartile for a given day the mean value of the δ18o of cotton petioles for the day prior to the rain event can then be compared to the mean value of δ18o cotton petioles after the rain to calculate a shift in the isotopic signature of the petiole water toward that of the rainwater for example the difference calculated as pre rain mean δ18o mean doy 199 δ18o pre rain mean δ18o 100 is an estimate of the change in mean isotopic signature of the cotton petiole water 3 1 subsurface drip irrigation prior to the rain event of 12 mm that occurred on doy 195 the isotopic distribution of the soil water in the soil profile resembled what would be considered a stable profile under ssd irrigation goebel et al 2015 the isotopic signature at the surface was 1 08 δ18o gradually depleting to 5 8 δ18o at a soil depth of 80 mm fig 2 as expected from a depth of 80 to 300 mm the isotopic value remains constant where irrigation water was applied from drip emitters at 300 mm and moves upward in the soil profile before being subject to enrichment due to evaporation at the soil surface after the 12 mm rain event on doy 196 the isotopic signature of the soil water at the surface changed to 3 2 δ18o resulting from the infiltration and mixing of the rainwater the peak of enrichment in the soil water profile 2 6 δ18o occurred at 60 mm this is the point where rainwater infiltrated into the soil profile and through piston flow moved the more enriched water that was at the surface deeper into the profile this enrichment peak continued to move downward in the profile to 80 mm on doy 197 and thereafter did not change suggesting that the rainwater did not infiltrate beyond 80 mm and that any resulting rainwater uptake by the cotton plants would require roots in the upper 80 mm of the soil profile prior to the rain event on doy 196 the isotopic signature of the petiole water was consistent throughout the day with a mean value of 3 5 δ18o for all the randomly sampled petioles for the entire day after the 12 mm rain the isotopic signature from the petiole samples increased in variability over the course of the day with the mean value of 3 1 δ18o trending slightly toward the isotopic signature of the rainwater 1 4 δ18o over the next two days doy 197 and 198 the scatter of the measured isotopic signature of the petiole water increased but the mean drifted only slightly to 2 9 δ18o suggesting that the cotton was able to use some of the rainwater that had moved 80 mm into the soil profile after the 1 2 mm rain on doy 199 the scatter of the isotopic signature of the petioles increased further and the mean value shifted to 2 1 δ18o the petiole samples taken later in the day showed a consistent trend toward enrichment similar to the isotopic signature of the soil in the upper portion of the soil profile this trend of enrichment at the end of the day on doy 199 was also measured in the dryland fig 3 and lepa fields fig 4 3 2 dryland the measured isotopic signature of soil water in the profile showed that a stable soil water isotopic signature had developed on doy 195 in the dryland field fig 3 the soil profile showed a well defined fractionation peak at 40 mm that has been previously observed at this location goebel et al 2015 and is well described by others allison 1982 braud et al 2009 the peak of enrichment prior to the rain event on doy 196 was 5 5 δ18o at 40 mm with depletion occurring with depth to 160 mm and an isotopic signature of 4 0 δ18o the isotopic signature beyond this depth was relatively stable to a soil depth of 300 mm after the rain event the fractionation peak moved deeper into the soil profile reaching a maximum depth of 80 mm on doy 197 this result suggests that for the cotton plants to use this water they must have a root system in the top 80 mm of the soil profile the isotopic signature of the petiole water of cotton plants sampled at 2 hour interval had some scatter over the course of doy 195 and the mean isotopic signature was 3 4 δ18o this value was similar to the petioles sampled under ssd prior to the rain event fig 2 after the rain event on doy 196 the petiole water of all the samples collected during the day showed more scatter however the mean shifted to 2 6 δ18o the next day doy 197 the isotopic signature of the water from the cotton petioles maintained a similar amount of scatter but the mean shifted to 2 1 δ18o moving closer to the isotopic signature of the rainwater the next day doy 198 the scatter of the isotopic signature from the petiole samples was somewhat reduced however the mean also decreased slightly to 2 1 δ18o after the 1 2 mm rain on doy 199 the scatter in the isotopic signature of the cotton petiole water returned but the mean shifted slightly back to 2 1 δ18o fig 3 3 3 lepa results of measured δ18o in the soil water and cotton petioles as a function of time for cotton irrigated with lepa is shown in fig 4 prior to the rain event of 12 mm on doy 196 the isotopic composition of the soil water resembled a stable profile under ssd with a frequent application of 25 mm of irrigation water every three days a more linear isotopic signature from 0 to 100 mm was expected goebel et al 2015 after the rain event on doy 195 the measured δ18o values from the sampled soil cores showed the movement of the fractionation peak from at or near the surface down to 60 80 mm under all the ssd and lepa irrigation and dryland the movement of the fractionation peak is indicative of the movement of rainwater to this soil depth further these results suggest that if the cotton plants were able to uptake the rainwater plants must have roots at 60 80 mm or deeper in the soil profile the isotopic signature of the water extracted from random petiole samples taken throughout doy 195 fig 4 had little scatter with a mean value of 3 0 δ18o which was within 13 of the value measured under dryland fig 3 and within 17 of the value for ssd fig 2 after the 12 mm rain the scatter increased over the course of the next day but the mean isotopic signature for the petioles sampled became more enriched with a mean of 2 1 δ18o on doy 196 and by the third day doy 197 the mean isotopic signature was 1 8 δ18o and continued to be enriched to 0 85 δ18o on doy 199 fig 4 the ssd and lepa irrigation and dryland cotton showed a different response from the 12 mm rain event under ssd the cotton petiole water over the day prior to the rain was on average 3 5 δ18o and three days later doy 198 the average cotton petiole samples water 2 9 δ18o this result indicates that the cotton plants were able to use some of the rainwater as the isotope ratio shifted 0 6 δ18o toward a more enriched signature similar to that of the rainwater fig 2 the results under dryland where pre rain petiole water measurements averaged 3 4 d18o and three days following the rain event they averaged 2 3 δ18o a shift of 1 1 δ18o toward the isotopic composition of the rainwater fig 3 under lepa the petiole water pre rain measurements averaged 3 0 δ18o and three days after the rain averaged 1 1 δ18o a shift of 1 9 δ18o toward the isotopic composition of the rainwater these results are based on rain events of 12 and 1 2 mm however the results are a proof of concept on the use of stable isotopes to discriminate water transpired by the crop from either rain or from irrigation under field conditions we are encouraged by these results to further pursue the field investigation and compare two irrigation systems ssd and center pivot lepa the complexity of discriminating root water uptake from either rain and irrigation under field conditions has led us to continue this research using a portable rainfall simulator to apply different water of known isotopic signature further we plan to implement simulation models of the energy and water balance bufon et al 2012 lascano et al 1987 evett and lascano 1993 to determine the impact of root architecture i e root length density as a function of soil depth on crop transpiration and evaporation of water from the soil for ssd and lepa irrigation our plan is to use simulated values to delineate field experiments to expand our understanding on increasing the use of water from rainfall during the growing season for the shp 4 conclusions it is important to note that the results presented here show that is possible to detect the use of rainwater from a rain event of 12 mm in cotton under field conditions while the two irrigation management practices showed some use of the rainwater the lepa irrigation system responded faster and the isotopic signature of the cotton petiole water shifted closer to the rainwater than did the ssd and the dryland one of the drawbacks to using stable isotopes of water to trace water movement is that they are effective at qualifying the presence of the rainwater but it is difficult to use stable isotopes of water to quantify the amount of rainwater used for the period from planting to doy 195 there were two rain events with accumulations close to 13 mm these results suggest that cotton grown under dryland and lepa management strategies would have had access to an additional 20 to 30 mm of water during this period compared to the ssd irrigation this amount of water represents about 25 to 50 kg ha of additional cotton lint yield production wanjura et al 2002 in the semiarid texas high plains at 10 mm most of the water would have been lost to water evaporation from the soil however crop production in a semi arid environment using water from an aquifer that is being depleted could be improved with access to an additional 20 30 mm of rainfall while ssd conserves water that could otherwise be lost to soil water evaporation it appears that it also underuses rainwater that could account for a large portion of the water budget during the growing season in regions such as the texas high plains where 80 of rain events are 12 mm support this research was supported in part by the ogallala aquifer program a consortium between usda agricultural research service kansas state university texas agrilife research

productivity direct seeded rice 1 introduction meeting the food demand of a continuously increasing world population has become a major challenge especially in water scarce regions where water management in agriculture is often inefficient yao et al 2012 it is more so in the most of resource poor communities in asia including india nevertheless the asian region which suffers the most from scarcity and uneven availability of water has been identified as an area of high climate risk under projected global climate change scenarios ipcc 2013 liu et al 2015 india cultivates rice in 4 34 mha the highest in the world with the second largest production of 15 72 million mg after china faostat 2014 the north western region of india comprising punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh has played an important role in food and livelihood security of the country by contributing a major share to national food basket the region produces 48 of the total rice production of the country rockström et al 2007 transplanted puddled rice tpr followed by conventional tilled wheat rw is the dominant cropping system of this part of the country the percolation and surface evaporation losses of water are very high from tpr fields farooq et al 2011 the evaporation loss is estimated to be 30 40 of total evapotranspiration tabbal et al 2002 depending upon texture of soil combine seepage and deep percolation losses vary between 25 85 of total water losses from the paddy field bouman et al 2005 tpr is also labour intensive and requires 2 3 times more water as compared to upland crops like maize bhushan et al 2007 leading to overexploitation of groundwater and thus has become uneconomical kumar and ladha 2011 under prevailing tpr wheat cropping system groundwater is depleting at a rate of about 0 33 m per year in north west part of india narjary et al 2014 creating shallow hard pan through puddling is beneficial in tpr tpr cropping system for reducing irrigation water demand by reducing deep percolation losses but it adversely affects productivity of upland cropping systems mcdonald et al 2006 the long term practice of tpr system has adverse effect on wheat yield due to sub soil compaction and restricted root growth in the lower layers naresh et al 2010 negative impacts of conventional rw system are further aggravated in rw cropping system with fine grain aromatic rice csr 30 because of its long duration causing delay in wheat sowing and reduction in grain yield water and labour scarcity and increasing cost of cultivation in tpr are forcing farmers to adopt input use efficient and cost effective direct seeded rice dsr technique dawe 2005 kakraliya et al 2018 establishment of crop by broadcasting line drilling seed directly in the non puddle soil having optimum moisture is referred as direct seeded rice liu et al 2015 dsr improves soil physical conditions adoption of zero tillage or minimum tillage operation in place of conventional agronomic practices improves water stable macro aggregates in surface soil choudhury et al 2014 the soil penetration resistance spr in direct seeded rice dsr is significantly lower at sub surface soil layer as compared to puddled rice in north west india jat et al 2018 research studies on dsr at various places revealed that though it saves substantial amount of irrigation water in addition to achieving higher water use efficiency and reducing greenhouse gases emission but with contradictory observations on yield gains and losses bhushan et al 2007 saharawat et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 it is an established fact that performance of crops is very sensitive to water stress rice being high water requiring crop is even more sensitive with dsr method of cultivation as compared to tpr though water stress tolerance level of crops varies with crop growth stages yadav et al 2011 but despite of some published guidelines systematic information on irrigation scheduling for dsr is lacking gopal et al 2010 so far very limited systematic studies that too with contradictory observations have been conducted for optimizing irrigation schedules for dsr yadav et al 2011 reported 20 kpa soil moisture potential smp as safe limit while mahajan et al 2011 recorded contradictory observations hence there is a great need to identify optimum irrigation schedules for getting the maximum benefit from dsr method of cultivation keeping above facts in view the present study was undertaken with a hypothesis that water stress during vegetative phase reduces irrigation demand without compromising crop yield and to develop suitable irrigation strategies for higher input factor productivity and production of tilled dsr method of cultivation 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experimental site present field study was carried out on the experimental farm of central soil salinity research institute karnal india 29 42ʹ 20 6ʺ n 76 57ʹ 19 80ʺ e 243 m amsl for two years during kharif seasons of 2014 and 2015 the climate of the area is semi arid to sub humid with an average annual rainfall of 655 mm about 486 and 386 mm rainfall was received during crop seasons of 2014 and 2015 respectively which was only 58 and 53 of the evaporation occurred during respective seasons total 21 and 14 numbers of rainy days were recorded during crop seasons of 2014 and 2015 respectively however 10 and 9 numbers of rainy days were observed during july august period of 2014 and 2015 respectively which coincides with vegetative phase of rice physio chemical properties of the soil of experimental site are listed in table 1 the soil was sodic alkali prior to start of extensive cultivation about 40 years back it was reclaimed using gypsum a chemical amendment but ph of the soil below 30 cm is still in alkali range 8 5 which limits moisture movement through soil profile and nutrient availability soil texture in 0 120 cm soil depth is loam to sandy clay loam 2 2 experimental design and treatments considering previous observations crop physiology and aim of reducing irrigation demand to maximize precipitation use soil moisture potential smp 15 30 and 45 kpa based irrigation scheduling

respective smps and their selected combinations table 2 imposed during establishment 10 30 das vegetative 31 90 das reproductive 91 120 das and ripening 121 135 das phases of crop growth respectively to test our hypothesis i e water stress during vegetative phase reduces irrigation demand without compromising crop yield and proper implementation of treatments in field a total of eight irrigation scheduling strategies were imposed in dsr these comprised of continuous minimum t1 mild t2 and high t3 stress and mild to high stress except at reproductive phase t4 t5 t6 t7 and t8 during first 10 days all dsr plots received uniform irrigations for proper germination and establishment thereafter to impose water stress irrigations were applied at different crop growth stages as per pre decided smps smp was monitored with irrometer gauge type soil tensiometer made by irrometer riverside ca installed at 15 cm depth in every plot while in tpr 3 4 cm water depth was maintained continuously for first 20 days after transplanting dat however during remaining crop period subsequent irrigations were applied at 2 days after water disappearance dwd from the surface of field irrigation was stopped 15 days prior to harvesting in each plot the details of soil matric potential for imposing irrigation treatments at different crop stages is given in table 2 2 3 agronomic practices the field was ploughed and leveled with laser guided land leveler before laying out the experiment in first year field was prepared by 2 harrowings followed by planking however in second year plots were prepared using power tiller pre sowing irrigation was applied in each year and seeds placed at 3 4 cm below soil surface in dsr when soil moisture reached at the field capacity while in tpr prior to transplanting of seedlings soil was puddled using power tiller in dsr seeds were sown on 15 and 14 june in 2014 and 2015 respectively keeping row to row spacing of 20 cm nursery for transplanted plots was sown on the same day during respective seasons and transplanting was done in puddle plots with 25 days old seedlings about 20 13 25 and 10 kg ha of n p2o5 k2o and znso4 respectively were applied as basal dose in both dsr and tpr remaining 40 kg n ha was applied in two equal splits at 21 23 and 42 45 days after sowing das transplanting for controlling weeds pre and post emergence herbicides were applied at 1 and 21 das respectively in dsr but in tpr only post emergence herbicides were applied at 15 dat 2 4 water balance the water balance of each plot was computed by using the following relationship eq 1 1 r c i r r o e t c θ s m c where rc is recharge component mm i r ro and etc are irrigation applied mm rainfall mm runoff mm and evapotranspiration mm respectively while θsmc is change in soil moisture storage in different depths mm in a given period the proportion of input water moved beyond 1 2 m soil depth was considered as ground water recharge component rc rc was determined at weekly interval and summed up for the whole season among the water balance components rainfall irrigation amount runoff and change in soil moisture were measured directly from the field and evapotranspiration was estimated using related weather parameters a 50 cm wide uncultivated strip having bunds on both edges consisting 60 cm wide vertical plastic film were used to minimize any possibility of lateral seepage in addition to it 2 m strip bordering inside of the plots was left and not considered for data collection including soil matric potential smp observation hence lateral seepage was considered zero for water balance study with the help of water meter fitted on main outlet and pipe network approximately 5 5 6 0 cm water was applied directly to each of the plots the volume of water applied was divided by plot size 10 m 10 m to convert irrigation i in mm for individual treatment plots daily weather parameters viz temperature relative humidity wind speed sunshine hours rainfall etc were collected from the weather station situated adjacent to the experimental area runoff was generated only when heavy rains took place it was estimated as difference between height of bund depth of ponded water before rainfall and amount of rainfall occurred yadav et al 2011 the crop evapotranspiration for different treatments were estimated as eq 2 2 e t c e t 0 x k c x k s where et0 is potential evapotranspiration estimated with penman montieth method according to fao 56 locally developed crop coefficient kc by choudhury et al 2013 was adopted for crop et0 calculation water stress coefficient ks was calculated on daily basis by using soil moisture content and following the procedure described in fao 56 estimated et was partitioned into evaporation e and transpiration t according to the relationship given by belmans et al 1983 as a function of crop growth the evaporation and transpiration were calculated using following relationships respectively eqs

each plot were selected randomly and tagged at 15 das dat for determining plant height and plot wise heights averaged for representing respective treatments in order to determine tillers in unit length of dsr one m r l was earmarked randomly at three places and used for counting tillers m r l for respective plots in tpr 0 9 m r l was used for counting tillers leaf area index lai was measured by using canopy analyzer sunscan delta t devices ltd uk lai was taken from 5 places in a plot and average value was used for comparing the treatments panicle numbers were recorded by harvesting randomly selected five rows of 0 9 and 1 0 m length from tpr and dsr respectively and averaged for representing panicles m r l in respective treatments to determine grains panicle 15 panicles were randomly picked from harvested samples grains separated manually and counted an area of 36 m2 was harvested from the middle of each plot and threshed manually for determining the grain yield representative grain samples from respective treatments were oven dried and total grain yield was expressed at 14 moisture content total grains produced in a hectare area were divided with volume of water applied for estimating irrigation water productivity iwp iwp was expressed as kilogram of grains produced for per m3 of irrigation applied the crop water productivity cwp kg m3 was estimated as crop yield per unit water consumed zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 the water consumed by the crop was taken equal to the crop evapotranspiration 2 6 statistical analysis eight dsr treatments and tpr as control were laid out in triplicate in randomized block design rbd and compared data on all crop biometric parameters were subjected to analysis of variance anova test to confirm significance of variability among treatments anova analysis was performed online with sas 9 2 version http stat iasri res in sscnarsportal treatment means of respective parameters were compared using least significant difference lsd at 5 p 0 05 level of probability 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil moisture content the irrigation scheduling thresholds varied according to pre decided soil matric potential of 15 30 and 45 kpa adopted during different crop growth phases however to get a distinct information about the soil moisture fluctuation soil moisture content of only three treatments providing irrigation continuously at 15 kpa t1 30 kpa t2 and 45 kpa t3 during all crop growth phases are included here and presented in fig 1 frequent peaks followed by declines were observed in soil moisture content in 15 kpa t1 treatment in this treatment soil moisture fluctuated between 32 39 and never dropped below the field capacity fc 31 at any crop growth phase in case of 30 kpa t2 treatment soil moisture content varied between 27 39 it decreased below fc for some time but rarely for more than one day contrary to these two treatments the soil moisture dropped far below i e 21 fc and remained so continuously for 2 3 days between two irrigations in 45 kpa t3 irrigation regime nevertheless though the soil moisture did not reach frequently to threshold of 45 kpa during vegetative period due to refilling of soil pores by rains 219 mm mean of two consecutive seasons received but it decreased to this level more frequently during reproductive stage due to lesser rains 3 2 crop growth the seed germination and crop stand in all plots were good during early period because irrigation treatments were imposed only at 10 das onwards however variation in crop growth was observed after introduction of treatments that became further conspicuous by the end of vegetative period 90 das the plant height number of tillers per m r l and leaf area index lai recorded at 90 das fig 2 a c served as growth indicators for comparing different irrigation strategies the data presented in fig 2 shows that t1 dsr with irrigation threshold 15 kpa at all stages produced the maximum plant height 118 8 cm number of tillers per m r l 150 3 and lai 4 9 significantly lower values for plant growth indicators in t2 and t3 as compared to t1 revealed that further increase in smp to 30 kpa and 45 kpa for scheduling irrigation had detrimental effect on plant growth the best crop performance with irrigation regime of 15 kpa at all stages was probably due to the maintenance of more conducive soil moisture as it always remained above the field capacity which might have facilitated better nutrient uptake as also observed earlier yadav et al 2011 jat et al 2018 and luxurious crop growth however performance in t4 was comparable with t1 in terms of plant height and no of tillers m r l which means that mild stress only during vegetative phase coinciding with monsoon season did not cause adverse impact but lai 4 65 differed significantly due to the combined effect of slightly lower number of tillers m r l and crop growth in comparison to t1 further increase in soil matric potential to 45 kpa during initial phase of 90 das t7 resulted into lower values of plant growth indicators the worst growth indicators were recorded in t3 probably due to the fact that irrigation threshold of 45 kpa at all stages led to sub optimal soil moisture for 2 3 days between every cycle of two irrigations and consequently causing repeated water stress during crop season this poor performance observed with higher soil matric potential confirmed that limited water supply adversely influenced morpho physiological behavior of the crop as also reported earlier by cheng and song 2006 yadav et al 2011 also recorded lower tiller density and lai in dsr with irrigations scheduled at more negative soil matric potential of 40 and 70 kpa than 20 kpa because of water stress and deficiency of iron comparable crop growth performance in t2 with t6 and t3 with t7 also clearly indicated that frequent irrigations during reproductive stage did not have any positive impact on crop growth indicators our observations are in the line of the findings of sarvestani et al 2008 who reported that higher moisture regimes during reproductive stages of rice did not influence plant height significantly further pirdashti et al 2004 observed that water stress imposed during reproductive stages produces at par plant height with well watered transplanted rice but significantly lower in those plots which experienced water stress during vegetative stage 3 3 yield contributing attributes and grain yield variable irrigation thresholds adopted during different crop growth phases had significant effect on yield contributing attributes like number of panicles m r l grains panicle and 1000 grain weight the most of dsr treatments produced more than 130 tillers m r l interestingly about 20 30 less number of panicles m r l was recorded at the time of harvest than at 90 das but reduction was not similar in all treatments among different irrigation strategies t1 with irrigation threshold of 15 kpa at all stages produced the highest number of panicles m r l as well as grains panicle table 3 further stress due to increase in irrigation threshold to 30 kpa t2 and 45 kpa t3 at all stages significantly reduced number of panicles m r l and grains panicle however t4 and t8 produced relatively higher grains panicle with lower number of panicles m r l as compared to t1 this suggests that mild stress only during vegetative phase though reduced panicles m r l but produced more number of grains panicle than t1 this was probably due to lesser competition for water and nutrients at later crop growth stages under lower plant population liu et al 2015 also observed a reciprocal relationship between spikelets panicle and plant population and attributed it to more competition for production factor inputs t3 produced the lowest 61 4 grains panicle as well as number of panicles m r l among all dsr irrigation strategies it might be due to the fact that crop experienced repeated water shortage under 45 kpa irrigation schedule at all stages slight improvement in grains panicle in t7 than t3 shows the importance of frequent irrigations at reproductive stage but that was not sufficient to compensate significant reduction in grains panicle and number of panicles m r l similarly the best performance in terms of 1000 grain weight was recorded in t1 while t3 produced the lowest 1000 grains weight this variation was directly associated with water availability and crop vigour table 3 t4 t6 and t8 produced grains weight statistically at par with t1 this indicates that irrigation threshold at or below 30 kpa during initial phase 90 das and 15 kpa during remaining period was able to create conducive soil moisture regimes for producing vigorous grains in dsr significantly higher 1000 grains weight in t7 than t3 but lower than the other treatments indicates that irrigations at 15 kpa during reproductive stage alone had very little influence on grains weight when irrigation is applied at 45 kpa during the remaining period but higher 1000 grains weight in t8 than t6 indicates that frequent irrigations at ripening stage improved grains weight further the response of various irrigation strategies to grain yield was similar to that observed for yield contributing traits for different irrigation strategies of dsr grain yield varied from 1 72 to 2 89 mg ha higher frequency of irrigation with smp 15 kpa throughout the season t1 produced the maximum grain yield in dsr further increase in smp to 30 kpa t2 and 45 kpa t3 recorded significant reduction due to poor yield contributing parameters the yield reduction in t2 and t3 as compared to t1 was about 16 and 40 respectively higher yield in 15 kpa irrigation threshold was the combined positive effect of higher number of panicles m r l grains panicle and 1000 grains weight our finding of higher yield in irrigation at 15 kpa throughout the season is in line with the observations of yadav et al 2011 who reported that in dsr irrigations scheduled at 20 kpa and daily irrigation produced comparable grain yield the lowest grain yield recorded in t3 was due to dropping of soil moisture far below the field capacity between every cycle of two irrigations which might have led to insufficient water availability for full development of crop reproductive primordia and optimum yield realization earlier mostajean and eichi 2009 also reported that water shortage in rice significantly affected photosynthetic rate thereby reduction in production of assimilates for panicle growth and grain filling and ultimately total grain yield however t7 with irrigations at 15 kpa during reproductive stage and at 45 kpa during the remaining period produced significantly higher grain yield than t3 it confirms the positive impact of frequent irrigations during reproductive phase table 3 however insufficient to match the yield level of still better performing irrigation strategies t4 and t8 produced numerically lower but statistically at par grain yield to t1 since vegetative growth stage of rice coincides with active period of south west monsoon in indo gangetic plains of south asia so any mild water stress imposed during this phase had no or very little adverse effect on crop growth further mild stress during early stage of csr 30 prevents luxurious growth and crop lodging and thus higher grain yield jabran et al 2017 thus mild water stress as a result of irrigations at 30 kpa during first 90 das probably did not prove detrimental to good grain yield further lower yield of t2 than t8 indicated that even mild stress 30 kpa during reproductive and ripening stages adversely affected 1000 grains weight and grain yield lower 1000 grains weight was probably due to the fact that irrigation at smp more than 15 kpa during latter stage might have caused decreased translocation of assimilates to the grains as also observed earlier by rahman et al 2002 overall it can be summarized that irrigation threshold of 30 kpa during initial phase up to 90 das and at 15 kpa during remaining crop season saves significant irrigation input without adverse effect on grain yield 3 4 water productivity 3 4 1 irrigation water productivity variable irrigation frequency under different irrigation strategies registered a wide range of irrigation water productivity iwp for different irrigation strategies of dsr iwp ranged from 0 18 0 24 kg m3 table 3 despite of the highest grain yield t1 registered the lowest iwp among all dsr treatments the highest 0 24 kg m3 but identical iwp was recorded for t2 t3 and t7 which indicates that crop response in terms of grain yield for unit amount of water applied was better than the other dsr treatments t6 and t8 produced the second best iwp 0 22 kg m3 among all dsr treatments numerically lower iwp was found in t4 and t5 than t2 but difference was non significant among the treatments registering identical iwp t2 produced the highest grain yield it indicates that mild stress 30 kpa at all crop growth stages could be a good option for maximizing dsr yield per unit water applied under limited water supply 3 4 2 crop water productivity crop water productivity cwp i e yield response to et under different irrigation strategies ranged from 0 37 0 48 kg m3 in dsr table 3 the variation in cwp was mainly due to yield variation with almost similar et or vice versa the well watered dsr irrigation threshold 15 kpa at all stages recorded the highest cwp value 0 48 kg m3 t4 and t8 irrigation strategies recorded statistically at par cwp 0 47 kg m3 with t1 which clearly indicates that crop did not experience water stress much during vegetative phase despite of lesser and very little reduction in yield was in proportion of the et that shows effective contribution of rains towards crop et and yield this suggests that under limited water resources mild water stress 30 kpa can be imposed during early phase till the end of vegetative stage however irrigation threshold of 30 kpa t2 and 45 kpa t3 at all growth stages recorded significantly lower cwp as compared to other irrigation strategies the lowest cwp 0 37 kg m3 in t3 shows that 45 kpa irrigation threshold reduced crop yield drastically than et though frequent irrigation during reproductive stage t7 improved cwp significantly 0 43 kg m3 as compared to t3 because of greater proportional improvement in yield than et 3 5 dsr vs tpr despite of higher tiller density and lai even the best dsr treatment t1 did not match tpr yield fig 2 and table 3 tpr with 15 more irrigation input produced significantly higher grain yield and at par iwp than t1 however t4 and t8 saved substantial irrigation input with significantly higher iwp in comparison of tpr but the significantly higher cwp 0 58 kg m3 in tpr than all irrigation strategies of dsr clearly affirm the superiority of tpr for achieving higher yield with per unit crop water use the higher yield 3 25 mg ha in tpr despite less tillers m r l was due to significantly higher number of grains panicle 73 5 and 1000 grains weight than dsr competition for soil moisture by more tilleres m r l particularly during reproductive and ripening might had led to unfertile and or partially filled spiklets and grains leading to lower number of grains panicle and 1000 grains weight and ultimately lower yield in dsr liu et al 2015 also recorded lower spikelets panicle in dsr than tpr and established a reciprocal relationship between spikelets panicle and plant population relatively more yield reduction in dsr than tpr as observed in our study is consistent with 27 lower yield of dsr when irrigated at field capacity choudhury et al 2007 and in reduced or zero till dsr at farmers field ladha et al 2009 however contrary to above findings yadav et al 2011 reported comparable yield of dsr irrigated at 20 kpa and tpr likewise singh et al 2005 bhushan et al 2007 and saharawat et al 2010 have also reported similar yield of dsr and tpr relatively inconsistent performance of dsr was probably due to poor understanding of crop response to soil moisture at different growth stages site specific soil conditions and no standard plant population guidelines for dsr at seed rate of 25 kg ha higher plant population m2 with excellent growth was recorded in dsr during vegetative phase but that did not convert into good yield the dense population led to lower number of panicles m r l grains panicle and 1000 grain weight and thus ultimately lower yield further there is chance of reaching predefined smp earlier in top 10 cm layer than the depth of tensiometer installed 15 cm depth the porous cup depth of tensiometer was decided by keeping the fact in view that it will be an average representation of smp of 30 cm effective root zone of the rice crop but the yield gap between well watered dsr and tpr warrants further more systematic field investigations on placement depth of tensiometers for precise representation of available soil moisture in the effective root zone of dsr also there is a need for further studies to optimize plant density for ensuring better moisture nutrients and other production factors availability these two factors seem mainly responsible for lower yield in dsr in comparison to tpr 3 6 water balance in dsr irrigation input varied between 709 5 1540 5 mm with frequency and number of irrigations depending on smp adopted during different crop growth stages table 4 t1 adopting 15 kpa smp based continuous irrigations received the maximum irrigation 1541 mm increase in irrigation threshold to 30 kpa t2 and further to 45 kpa t3 at all stages saved about 35 and 54 irrigation water respectively the significant saving in water in 30 kpa 534 mm and 45 kpa 831 mm as compared to 15 kpa irrigation threshold at all stages was recorded due to longer irrigation interval and lesser number of irrigations however the saving in water simultaneously reduced yield it implied that both higher yield and water saving should be considered while deciding irrigation scheduling threshold in dsr treatments t4 and t5 also saved 19 and 29 irrigation water respectively over t1 likewise mild stress 30 kpa during initial stages and frequent irrigation during the reproductive season also saved 23 irrigation water than t1 estimated evapotranspiration et in different irrigation strategies of dsr differed with variation in soil moisture availability the most frequently irrigated 15 kpa dsr plots t1 registered the highest et while irrigations at threshold 45 kpa at all stages t3 recorded the lowest value bifurcation of et into evaporation and transpiration using lai revealed that the maximum evaporation was measured in t3 while minimum in t1 followed by t4 table 4 however transpiration was the highest in t1 followed by t8 with lowest being in t3 lower transpiration in t2 and t3 as compared to t1 indicates that more negative irrigation threshold of 30 kpa t2 and 45 kpa t3 at all stages had adverse effect on crop transpiration four days prolonged heavy rain generated about 5 5 10 5 mm runoff from different dsr treatments table 4 it was also noticed that well watered tpr plots due to shorter duration in the field registered lower evaporation as well as et values than the most of dsr treatments however transpiration day was significantly higher similarly higher irrigation and low infiltration rate resulted in substantially higher runoff in tpr in comparison to dsr plots about 74 4 mm runoff was measured from tpr plots it implies that dsr plots had better rain water storage capacity than tpr which ultimately led to reduced irrigation input maintenance of either water ponding and or continuous saturation in soil profile in tpr reduced the possibility of on farm rain water storage and thereby led to relatively more runoff the higher infiltration rate in dsr probably percolated water at faster rate and reduced the possibility of runoff these were the main reasons behind higher runoff from tpr field the recharge water reaching groundwater aquifer component rc from a cropped land depends on irrigation rainfall evapotranspiration and runoff volume in dsr the highest rc was registered in t1 due to the highest irrigation amount while the minimum 561 7 mm recorded in t3 with the lowest irrigation input of 709 5 mm table 4 the reduction in rc with t4 was about 19 over t1 among all dsr treatments percent contribution of total water input irrigation precipitation to rc was the highest in t1 and the lowest in t3 this implies that irrigation at more negative smp utilized the most of water input and contributed least to groundwater this was probably due to longer irrigation interval in 45 kpa threshold than 15 and 30 kpa leading to better use of rainfall higher rc was measured in tpr receiving more irrigation input though tpr generated more runoff than dsr but it might be recycled in region itself due flat topography of the area thus the real loss of irrigation input is in terms of et which was the lowest in tpr dsr being longer duration that too the extra duration coinciding with high evaporative demand period of the year in the field results in slightly higher water loss et than tpr 3 7 irrigation strategy for higher water productivity and yield of dsr two years field study indicated that dsr is very sensitive to available soil moisture irrigation thresholds varying with crop growth stages caused variable effect on crop growth yield and water productivity the duration of the period with irrigations scheduled at higher smp also had significant effect on yield and irrigation water saving irrigations at 15 kpa during all stages in dsr produced the highest yield but with the highest irrigation input mild water stress 30 kpa during initial stages and 15 kpa during reproductive phase resulted in at par 1000 grains weight and yield with that of 15 kpa at all stages but amount of irrigation water reduced by 21 the higher yield with lower irrigation amount indicates better utilization of applied water further increase in irrigation threshold to 45 kpa resulted into significant reduction in irrigation input but with proportionate simultaneous yield reduction the present study suggests that adopting optimal irrigation schedules based on varying smp according to growth stages can reduce irrigation input with higher iwp and good yield of dsr as such the study infers that irrigations at 30 kpa during initial phase 90 das and at 15 kpa during later stages would be safer irrigation schedule for dsr 4 conclusion variable smp based irrigation schedules imposed on different crop stages had significant influence on crop growth yield contributing attributes total grain yield and water balance components of dsr frequent irrigations 15 kpa throughout the crop season though registered the highest total grain yield and cwp but simultaneously consumed the maximum irrigation water with the lowest iwp however mild water stress 30 kpa during initial phase and frequent irrigations 15 kpa during reproductive stages proved the best option because it saved significant 21 irrigation input and produced comparable grain yield and cwp to 15 kpa irrigation threshold throughout the season the dsr method of cultivation due to longer duration in the field than tpr recorded higher water loss in terms of et but lower cwp despite of lower tiller density tpr recorded better yield contributing attributes and produced significantly higher total grain yield than best dsr irrigation strategy the denser plant stand in dsr proved detrimental for yield contributing attributes and crop yield comparatively lower yield of dsr than tpr suggests that further studies are needed to optimize plant population in dsr and depth of installation of tensiometer for standardizing irrigation scheduling thresholds to achieve potential yield with higher water productivity and

method of cultivation though dsr saves substantial amount of irrigation but there are contradictory observations on yield realization therefore a two year field study was undertaken with the aim to develop efficient irrigation strategy for maximizing tilled dsr yield with minimum irrigation input total 08 irrigation strategies based on 03 soil matric potential smp levels 15 30 and 45 kpa and their combinations based on crop growth stages were evaluated for fine grain aromatic basmati rice variety csr30 responses of respective irrigation strategies were evaluated on crop water use and its components biometric parameters and yield attributes and yield of dsr performance of dsr was also compared with standard tpr practice soil profile moisture content ranged from 32 to 39 27 39 and 22 39 in 15 30 and 45 kpa irrigation regimes respectively irrigation input in dsr method of cultivation varied between 709 1541 mm as compared to 1807 mm of tpr with different irrigation strategies dsr grain yield and irrigation water productivity iwp varied from 1 72 to 2 89 mg ha and 0 19 0 24 kg m3 respectively irrigation threshold 15 kpa at all stages in dsr produced the highest yield and crop water productivity cwp 0 48 kg m3 but with lowest iwp irrigations at or below 30 kpa during initial phase 90 das and at 15 kpa during remaining period produced comparable yield with significantly higher iwp though tpr registered lower iwp 0 18 kg m3 as compared to the best dsr treatment but recorded about 11 higher grain yield with significantly higher crop water productivity 0 58 kg m3 than dsr water balance studies revealed better utilization of precipitation in dsr due to irrigations at more negative smp overall study suggests irrigation scheduling at 30 kpa during initial phase and 15 kpa during the remaining crop season proved to be the optimum irrigation threshold for maximizing dsr yield with limited irrigation input keywords soil matric potential irrigation strategy water productivity direct seeded rice 1 introduction meeting the food demand of a continuously increasing world population has become a major challenge especially in water scarce regions where water management in agriculture is often inefficient yao et al 2012 it is more so in the most of resource poor communities in asia including india nevertheless the asian region which suffers the most from scarcity and uneven availability of water has been identified as an area of high climate risk under projected global climate change scenarios ipcc 2013 liu et al 2015 india cultivates rice in 4 34 mha the highest in the world with the second largest production of 15 72 million mg after china faostat 2014 the north western region of india comprising punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh has played an important role in food and livelihood security of the country by contributing a major share to national food basket the region produces 48 of the total rice production of the country rockström et al 2007 transplanted puddled rice tpr followed by conventional tilled wheat rw is the dominant cropping system of this part of the country the percolation and surface evaporation losses of water are very high from tpr fields farooq et al 2011 the evaporation loss is estimated to be 30 40 of total evapotranspiration tabbal et al 2002 depending upon texture of soil combine seepage and deep percolation losses vary between 25 85 of total water losses from the paddy field bouman et al 2005 tpr is also labour intensive and requires 2 3 times more water as compared to upland crops like maize bhushan et al 2007 leading to overexploitation of groundwater and thus has become uneconomical kumar and ladha 2011 under prevailing tpr wheat cropping system groundwater is depleting at a rate of about 0 33 m per year in north west part of india narjary et al 2014 creating shallow hard pan through puddling is beneficial in tpr tpr cropping system for reducing irrigation water demand by reducing deep percolation losses but it adversely affects productivity of upland cropping systems mcdonald et al 2006 the long term practice of tpr system has adverse effect on wheat yield due to sub soil compaction and restricted root growth in the lower layers naresh et al 2010 negative impacts of conventional rw system are further aggravated in rw cropping system with fine grain aromatic rice csr 30 because of its long duration causing delay in wheat sowing and reduction in grain yield water and labour scarcity and increasing cost of cultivation in tpr are forcing farmers to adopt input use efficient and cost effective direct seeded rice dsr technique dawe 2005 kakraliya et al 2018 establishment of crop by broadcasting line drilling seed directly in the non puddle soil having optimum moisture is referred as direct seeded rice liu et al 2015 dsr improves soil physical conditions adoption of zero tillage or minimum tillage operation in place of conventional agronomic practices improves water stable macro aggregates in surface soil choudhury et al 2014 the soil penetration resistance spr in direct seeded rice dsr is significantly lower at sub surface soil layer as compared to puddled rice in north west india jat et al 2018 research studies on dsr at various places revealed that though it saves substantial amount of irrigation water in addition to achieving higher water use efficiency and reducing greenhouse gases emission but with contradictory observations on yield gains and losses bhushan et al 2007 saharawat et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 it is an established fact that performance of crops is very sensitive to water stress rice being high water requiring crop is even more sensitive with dsr method of cultivation as compared to tpr though water stress tolerance level of crops varies with crop growth stages yadav et al 2011 but despite of some published guidelines systematic information on irrigation scheduling for dsr is lacking gopal et al 2010 so far very limited systematic studies that too with contradictory observations have been conducted for optimizing irrigation schedules for dsr yadav et al 2011 reported 20 kpa soil moisture potential smp as safe limit while mahajan et al 2011 recorded contradictory observations hence there is a great need to identify optimum irrigation schedules for getting the maximum benefit from dsr method of cultivation keeping above facts in view the present study was undertaken with a hypothesis that water stress during vegetative phase reduces irrigation demand without compromising crop yield and to develop suitable irrigation strategies for higher input factor productivity and production of tilled dsr method of cultivation 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experimental site present field study was carried out on the experimental farm of central soil salinity research institute karnal india 29 42ʹ 20 6ʺ n 76 57ʹ 19 80ʺ e 243 m amsl for two years during kharif seasons of 2014 and 2015 the climate of the area is semi arid to sub humid with an average annual rainfall of 655 mm about 486 and 386 mm rainfall was received during crop seasons of 2014 and 2015 respectively which was only 58 and 53 of the evaporation occurred during respective seasons total 21 and 14 numbers of rainy days were recorded during crop seasons of 2014 and 2015 respectively however 10 and 9 numbers of rainy days were observed during july august period of 2014 and 2015 respectively which coincides with vegetative phase of rice physio chemical properties of the soil of experimental site are listed in table 1 the soil was sodic alkali prior to start of extensive cultivation about 40 years back it was reclaimed using gypsum a chemical amendment but ph of the soil below 30 cm is still in alkali range 8 5 which limits moisture movement through soil profile and nutrient availability soil texture in 0 120 cm soil depth is loam to sandy clay loam 2 2 experimental design and treatments considering previous observations crop physiology and aim of reducing irrigation demand to maximize precipitation use soil moisture potential smp 15 30 and 45 kpa based irrigation scheduling treatments were planned and assessed in this study to develop suitable irrigation strategies for fine grain aromatic csr 30 tilled dsr the treatments consisted of continuous irrigation scheduling at respective smps and their selected combinations table 2 imposed during establishment 10 30 das vegetative 31 90 das reproductive 91 120 das and ripening 121 135 das phases of crop growth respectively to test our hypothesis i e water stress during vegetative phase reduces irrigation demand without compromising crop yield and proper implementation of treatments in field a total of eight irrigation scheduling strategies were imposed in dsr these comprised of continuous minimum t1 mild t2 and high t3 stress and mild to high stress except at reproductive phase t4 t5 t6 t7 and t8 during first 10 days all dsr plots received uniform irrigations for proper germination and establishment thereafter to impose water stress irrigations were applied at different crop growth stages as per pre decided smps smp was monitored with irrometer gauge type soil tensiometer made by irrometer riverside ca installed at 15 cm depth in every plot while in tpr 3 4 cm water depth was maintained continuously for first 20 days after transplanting dat however during remaining crop period subsequent irrigations were applied at 2 days after water disappearance dwd from the surface of field irrigation was stopped 15 days prior to harvesting in each plot the details of soil matric potential for imposing irrigation treatments at different crop stages is given in table 2 2 3 agronomic practices the field was ploughed and leveled with laser guided land leveler before laying out the experiment in first year field was prepared by 2 harrowings followed by planking however in second year plots were prepared using power tiller pre sowing irrigation was applied in each year and seeds placed at 3 4 cm below soil surface in dsr when soil moisture reached at the field capacity while in tpr prior to transplanting of seedlings soil was puddled using power tiller in dsr seeds were sown on 15 and 14 june in 2014 and 2015 respectively keeping row to row spacing of 20 cm nursery for transplanted plots was sown on the same day during respective seasons and transplanting was done in puddle plots with 25 days old seedlings about 20 13 25 and 10 kg ha of n p2o5 k2o and znso4 respectively were applied as basal dose in both dsr and tpr remaining 40 kg n ha was applied in two equal splits at 21 23 and 42 45 days after sowing das transplanting for controlling weeds pre and post emergence herbicides were applied at 1 and 21 das respectively in dsr but in tpr only post emergence herbicides were applied at 15 dat 2 4 water balance the water balance of each plot was computed by using the following relationship eq 1 1 r c i r r o e t c θ s m c where rc is recharge component mm i r ro and etc are irrigation applied mm rainfall mm runoff mm and evapotranspiration mm respectively while θsmc is change in soil moisture storage in different depths mm in a given period the proportion of input water moved beyond 1 2 m soil depth was considered as ground water recharge component rc rc was determined at weekly interval and summed up for the whole season among the water balance components rainfall irrigation amount runoff and change in soil moisture were measured directly from the field and evapotranspiration was estimated using related weather parameters a 50 cm wide uncultivated strip having bunds on both edges consisting 60 cm wide vertical plastic film were used to minimize any possibility of lateral seepage in addition to it 2 m strip bordering inside of the plots was left and not considered for data collection including soil matric potential smp observation hence lateral seepage was considered zero for water balance study with the help of water meter fitted on main outlet and pipe network approximately 5 5 6 0 cm water was applied directly to each of the plots the volume of water applied was divided by plot size 10 m 10 m to convert irrigation i in mm for individual treatment plots daily weather parameters viz temperature relative humidity wind speed sunshine hours rainfall etc were collected from the weather station situated adjacent to the experimental area runoff was generated only when heavy rains took place it was estimated as difference between height of bund depth of ponded water before rainfall and amount of rainfall occurred yadav et al 2011 the crop evapotranspiration for different treatments were estimated as eq 2 2 e t c e t 0 x k c x

calculation water stress coefficient ks was calculated on daily basis by using soil moisture content and following the procedure described in fao 56 estimated et was partitioned into evaporation e and transpiration t according to the relationship given by belmans et al 1983 as a function of crop growth the evaporation and transpiration were calculated using following relationships respectively eqs

different layers 0 15 15 30 30 60 60 90 and 90 120 cm was measured at weekly interval by using neutron moisture probe cpn 503 tdr hydroprobe for this purpose aluminum access tubes were installed in each plot tdr trime pico 64 was used to measure soil moisture from surface 15 cm soil layer 2 5 crop biometric observations and water productivity plant height tillers m row length m r l and leaf area index were measured at 15 days interval as crop growth indicators but in this paper the maximum values recorded at the end of vegetative phase were used for comparing treatments effect ten plants from each plot were selected randomly and tagged at 15 das dat for determining plant height and plot wise heights averaged for representing respective treatments in order to determine tillers in unit length of dsr one m r l was earmarked randomly at three places and used for counting tillers m r l for respective plots in tpr 0 9 m r l was used for counting tillers leaf area index lai was measured by using canopy analyzer sunscan delta t devices ltd uk lai was taken from 5 places in a plot and average value was used for comparing the treatments panicle numbers were recorded by harvesting randomly selected five rows of 0 9 and 1 0 m length from tpr and dsr respectively and averaged for representing panicles m r l in respective treatments to determine grains panicle 15 panicles were randomly picked from harvested samples grains separated manually and counted an area of 36 m2 was harvested from the middle of each plot and threshed manually for determining the grain yield representative grain samples from respective treatments were oven dried and total grain yield was expressed at 14 moisture content total grains produced in a hectare area were divided with volume of water applied for estimating irrigation water productivity iwp iwp was expressed as kilogram of grains produced for per m3 of irrigation applied the crop water productivity cwp kg m3 was estimated as crop yield per unit water consumed zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 the water consumed by the crop was taken equal to the crop evapotranspiration 2 6 statistical analysis eight dsr treatments and tpr as control were laid out in triplicate in randomized block design rbd and compared data on all crop biometric parameters were subjected to analysis of variance anova test to confirm significance of variability among treatments anova analysis was performed online with sas 9 2 version http stat iasri res in sscnarsportal treatment means of respective parameters were compared using least significant difference lsd at 5 p 0 05 level of probability 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil moisture content the irrigation scheduling thresholds varied according to pre decided soil matric potential of 15 30 and 45 kpa adopted during different crop growth phases however to get a distinct information about the soil moisture fluctuation soil moisture content of only three treatments providing irrigation continuously at 15 kpa t1 30 kpa t2 and 45 kpa t3 during all crop growth phases are included here and presented in fig 1 frequent peaks followed by declines were observed in soil moisture content in 15 kpa t1 treatment in this treatment soil moisture fluctuated between 32 39 and never dropped below the field capacity fc 31 at any crop growth phase in case of 30 kpa t2 treatment soil moisture content varied between 27 39 it decreased below fc for some time but rarely for more than one day contrary to these two treatments the soil moisture dropped far below i e 21 fc and remained so continuously for 2 3 days between two irrigations in 45 kpa t3 irrigation regime nevertheless though the soil moisture did not reach frequently to threshold of 45 kpa during vegetative period due to refilling of soil pores by rains 219 mm mean of two consecutive seasons received but it decreased to this level more frequently during reproductive stage due to lesser rains 3 2 crop growth the seed germination and crop stand in all plots were good during early period because irrigation treatments were imposed only at 10 das onwards however variation in crop growth was observed after introduction of treatments that became further conspicuous by the end of vegetative period 90 das the plant height number of tillers per m r l and leaf area index lai recorded at 90 das fig 2 a c served as growth indicators for comparing different irrigation strategies the data presented in fig 2 shows that t1 dsr with irrigation threshold 15 kpa at all stages produced the maximum plant height 118 8 cm number of tillers per m r l 150 3 and lai 4 9 significantly lower values for plant growth indicators in t2 and t3 as compared to t1 revealed that further increase in smp to 30 kpa and 45 kpa for scheduling irrigation had detrimental effect on plant growth the best crop performance with irrigation regime of 15 kpa at all stages was probably due to the maintenance of more conducive soil moisture as it always remained above the field capacity which might have facilitated better nutrient uptake as also observed earlier yadav et al 2011 jat et al 2018 and luxurious crop growth however performance in t4 was comparable with t1 in terms of plant height and no of tillers m r l which means that mild stress only during vegetative phase coinciding with monsoon season did not cause adverse impact but lai 4 65 differed significantly due to the combined effect of slightly lower number of tillers m r l and crop growth in comparison to t1 further increase in soil matric potential to 45 kpa during initial phase of 90 das t7 resulted into lower values of plant growth indicators the worst growth indicators were recorded in t3 probably due to the fact that irrigation threshold of 45 kpa at all stages led to sub optimal soil moisture for 2 3 days between every cycle of two irrigations and consequently causing repeated water stress during crop season this poor performance observed with higher soil matric potential confirmed that limited water supply adversely influenced morpho physiological behavior of the crop as also reported earlier by cheng and song 2006 yadav et al 2011 also recorded lower tiller density and lai in dsr with irrigations scheduled at more negative soil matric potential of 40 and 70 kpa than 20 kpa because of water stress and deficiency of iron comparable crop growth performance in t2 with t6 and t3 with t7 also clearly indicated that frequent irrigations during reproductive stage did not have any positive impact on crop growth indicators our observations are in the line of the findings of sarvestani et al 2008 who reported that higher moisture regimes during reproductive stages of rice did not influence plant height significantly further pirdashti et al 2004 observed that water stress imposed during reproductive stages produces at par plant height with well watered transplanted rice but significantly lower in those plots which experienced water stress during vegetative stage 3 3 yield contributing attributes and grain yield variable irrigation thresholds adopted during different crop growth phases had significant effect on yield contributing attributes like number of panicles m r l grains panicle and 1000 grain weight the most of dsr treatments produced more than 130 tillers m r l interestingly about 20 30 less number of panicles m r l was recorded at the time of harvest than at 90 das but reduction was not similar in all treatments among different irrigation strategies t1 with irrigation threshold of 15 kpa at all stages produced the highest number of panicles m r l as well as grains panicle table 3 further stress due to increase in irrigation threshold to 30 kpa t2 and 45 kpa t3 at all stages significantly reduced number of panicles m r l and grains panicle however t4 and t8 produced relatively higher grains panicle with lower number of panicles m r l as compared to t1 this suggests that mild stress only during vegetative phase though reduced panicles m r l but produced more number of grains panicle than t1 this was probably due to lesser competition for water and nutrients at later crop growth stages under lower plant population liu et al 2015 also observed a reciprocal relationship between spikelets panicle and plant population and attributed it to more competition for production factor inputs t3 produced the lowest 61 4 grains panicle as well as number of panicles m r l among all dsr irrigation strategies it might be due to the fact that crop experienced repeated water shortage under 45 kpa irrigation schedule at all stages slight improvement in grains panicle in t7 than t3 shows the importance of frequent irrigations at reproductive stage but that was not sufficient to compensate significant reduction in grains panicle and number of panicles m r l similarly the best performance in terms of 1000 grain weight was recorded in t1 while t3 produced the lowest 1000 grains weight this variation was directly associated with water availability and crop vigour table 3 t4 t6 and t8 produced grains weight statistically at par with t1 this indicates that irrigation threshold at or below 30 kpa during initial phase 90 das and 15 kpa during remaining period was able to create conducive soil moisture regimes for producing vigorous grains in dsr significantly higher 1000 grains weight in t7 than t3 but lower than the other treatments indicates that irrigations at 15 kpa during reproductive stage alone had very little influence on grains weight when irrigation is applied at 45 kpa during the remaining period but higher 1000 grains weight in t8 than t6 indicates that frequent irrigations at ripening stage improved grains weight further the response of various irrigation strategies to grain yield was similar to that observed for yield contributing traits for different irrigation strategies of dsr grain yield varied from 1 72 to 2 89 mg ha higher frequency of irrigation with smp 15 kpa throughout the season t1 produced the maximum grain yield in dsr further increase in smp to 30 kpa t2 and 45 kpa t3 recorded significant reduction due to poor yield contributing parameters the yield reduction in t2 and t3 as compared to t1 was about 16 and 40 respectively higher yield in 15 kpa irrigation threshold was the combined positive effect of higher number of panicles m r l grains panicle and 1000 grains weight our finding of higher yield in irrigation at 15 kpa throughout the season is in line with the observations of yadav et al 2011 who reported that in dsr irrigations scheduled at 20 kpa and daily irrigation produced comparable grain yield the lowest grain yield recorded in t3 was due to dropping of soil moisture far below the field capacity between every cycle of two irrigations which might have led to insufficient water availability for full development of crop reproductive primordia and optimum yield realization earlier mostajean and eichi 2009 also reported that water shortage in rice significantly affected photosynthetic rate thereby reduction in production of assimilates for panicle growth and grain filling and ultimately total grain yield however t7 with irrigations at 15 kpa during reproductive stage and at 45 kpa during the remaining period produced significantly higher grain yield than t3 it confirms the positive impact of frequent irrigations during reproductive phase table 3 however insufficient to match the yield level of still better performing irrigation strategies t4 and t8 produced numerically lower but statistically at par grain yield to t1 since vegetative growth stage of rice coincides with active period of south west monsoon in indo gangetic plains of south asia so any mild water stress imposed during this phase had no or very little adverse effect on crop growth further mild stress during early stage of csr 30 prevents luxurious growth and crop lodging and thus higher grain yield jabran et al 2017 thus mild water stress as a result of irrigations at 30 kpa during first 90 das probably did not prove detrimental to good grain yield further lower yield of t2 than t8 indicated that even mild stress 30 kpa during reproductive and ripening stages adversely affected 1000 grains weight and grain yield lower 1000 grains weight was probably due to the fact that irrigation at smp more than 15 kpa during latter stage might have caused decreased translocation of assimilates to the grains as also observed earlier by rahman et al 2002 overall it can be summarized that irrigation threshold of 30 kpa during initial phase up to 90 das and at 15 kpa during remaining crop season saves significant irrigation input without adverse effect on grain yield 3 4 water productivity 3 4 1 irrigation water productivity variable irrigation frequency under different irrigation strategies registered a wide range of irrigation water productivity iwp for different irrigation strategies of dsr iwp ranged from 0 18 0 24 kg m3 table 3 despite of the highest grain yield t1 registered the lowest iwp among all dsr treatments the highest 0 24 kg m3 but identical iwp was recorded for t2 t3 and t7 which indicates that crop response in terms of grain yield for unit amount of water applied was better than the other dsr treatments t6 and t8 produced the second best iwp 0 22 kg m3 among all dsr treatments numerically lower iwp was found in t4 and t5 than t2 but difference was non significant among the treatments registering identical iwp t2 produced the highest grain yield it indicates that mild stress 30 kpa at all crop growth stages could be a good option for maximizing dsr yield per unit water applied under limited water supply 3 4 2 crop water productivity crop water productivity cwp i e yield response to et under different irrigation strategies ranged from 0 37 0 48 kg m3 in dsr table 3 the variation in cwp was mainly due to yield variation with almost similar et or vice versa the well watered dsr irrigation threshold 15 kpa at all stages recorded the highest cwp value 0 48 kg m3 t4 and t8 irrigation strategies recorded statistically at par cwp 0 47 kg m3 with t1 which clearly indicates that crop did not experience water stress much during vegetative phase despite of lesser and very little reduction in yield was in proportion of the et that shows effective contribution of rains towards crop et and yield this suggests that under limited water resources mild water stress 30 kpa can be imposed during early phase till the end of vegetative stage however irrigation threshold of 30 kpa t2 and 45 kpa t3 at all growth stages recorded significantly lower cwp as compared to other irrigation strategies the lowest cwp 0 37 kg m3 in t3 shows that 45 kpa irrigation threshold reduced crop yield drastically than et though frequent irrigation during reproductive stage t7 improved cwp significantly 0 43 kg m3 as compared to t3 because of greater proportional improvement in yield than et 3 5 dsr vs tpr despite of higher tiller density and lai even the best dsr treatment t1 did not match tpr yield fig 2 and table 3 tpr with 15 more irrigation input produced significantly higher grain yield and at par iwp than t1 however t4 and t8 saved substantial irrigation input with significantly higher iwp in comparison of tpr but the significantly higher cwp 0 58 kg m3 in tpr than all irrigation strategies of dsr clearly affirm the superiority of tpr for achieving higher yield with per unit crop water use the higher yield 3 25 mg ha in tpr despite less tillers m r l was due to significantly higher number of grains panicle 73 5 and 1000 grains weight than dsr competition for soil moisture by more tilleres m r l particularly during reproductive and ripening might had led to unfertile and or partially filled spiklets and grains leading to lower number of grains panicle and 1000 grains weight and ultimately lower yield in dsr liu et al 2015 also recorded lower spikelets panicle in dsr than tpr and established a reciprocal relationship between spikelets panicle and plant population relatively more yield reduction in dsr than tpr as observed in our study is consistent with 27 lower yield of dsr when irrigated at field capacity choudhury et al 2007 and in reduced or zero till dsr at farmers field ladha et al 2009 however contrary to above findings yadav et al 2011 reported comparable yield of dsr irrigated at 20 kpa and tpr likewise singh et al 2005 bhushan et al 2007 and saharawat et al 2010 have also reported similar yield of dsr and tpr relatively inconsistent performance of dsr was probably due to poor understanding of crop response to soil moisture at different growth stages site specific soil conditions and no standard plant population guidelines for dsr at seed rate of 25 kg ha higher plant population m2 with excellent growth was recorded in dsr during vegetative phase but that did not convert into good yield the dense population led to lower number of panicles m r l grains panicle and 1000 grain weight and thus ultimately lower yield further there is chance of reaching predefined smp earlier in top 10 cm layer than the depth of tensiometer installed 15 cm depth the porous cup depth of tensiometer was decided by keeping the fact in view that it will be an average representation of smp of 30 cm effective root zone of the rice crop but the yield gap between well watered dsr and tpr warrants further more systematic field investigations on placement depth of tensiometers for precise representation of available soil moisture in the effective root zone of dsr also there is a need for further studies to optimize plant density for ensuring better moisture nutrients and other production factors availability these two factors seem mainly responsible for lower yield in dsr in comparison to tpr 3 6 water balance in dsr irrigation input varied between 709 5 1540 5 mm with frequency and number of irrigations depending on smp adopted during different crop growth stages table 4 t1 adopting 15 kpa smp based continuous irrigations received the maximum irrigation 1541 mm increase in irrigation threshold to 30 kpa t2 and further to 45 kpa t3 at all stages saved about 35 and 54 irrigation water respectively the significant saving in water in 30 kpa 534 mm and 45 kpa 831 mm as compared to 15 kpa irrigation threshold at all stages was recorded due to longer irrigation interval and lesser number of irrigations however the saving in water simultaneously reduced yield it implied that both higher yield and water saving should be considered while deciding irrigation scheduling threshold in dsr treatments t4 and t5 also saved 19 and 29 irrigation water respectively over t1 likewise mild stress 30 kpa during initial stages and frequent irrigation during the reproductive season also saved 23 irrigation water than t1 estimated evapotranspiration et in different irrigation strategies of dsr differed with variation in soil moisture availability the most frequently irrigated 15 kpa dsr plots t1 registered the highest et while irrigations at threshold 45 kpa at all stages t3 recorded the lowest value bifurcation of et into evaporation and transpiration using lai revealed that the maximum evaporation was measured in t3 while minimum in t1 followed by t4 table 4 however transpiration was the highest in t1 followed by t8 with lowest being in t3 lower transpiration in t2 and t3 as compared to t1 indicates that more negative irrigation threshold of 30 kpa t2 and 45 kpa t3 at all stages had adverse effect on crop transpiration four days prolonged heavy rain generated about 5 5 10 5 mm runoff from different dsr treatments table 4 it was also noticed that well watered tpr plots due to shorter duration in the field registered lower evaporation as well as et values than the most of dsr treatments however transpiration day was significantly higher similarly higher irrigation and low infiltration rate resulted in substantially higher runoff in tpr in comparison to dsr plots about 74 4 mm runoff was measured from tpr plots it implies that dsr plots had better rain water storage capacity than tpr which ultimately led to reduced irrigation input maintenance of either water ponding and or continuous saturation in soil profile in tpr reduced the possibility of on farm rain water storage and thereby led to relatively more runoff the higher infiltration rate in dsr probably percolated water at faster rate and reduced the possibility of runoff these were the main reasons behind higher runoff from tpr field the recharge water reaching groundwater aquifer component rc from a cropped land depends on irrigation rainfall evapotranspiration and runoff volume in dsr the highest rc was registered in t1 due to the highest irrigation amount while the minimum 561 7 mm recorded in t3 with the lowest irrigation input of 709 5 mm table 4 the reduction in rc with t4 was about 19 over t1 among all dsr treatments percent contribution of total water input irrigation precipitation to rc was the highest in t1 and the lowest in t3 this implies that irrigation at more negative smp utilized the most of water input and contributed least to groundwater this was probably due to longer irrigation interval in 45 kpa threshold than 15 and 30 kpa leading to better use of rainfall higher rc was measured in tpr receiving more irrigation input though tpr generated more runoff than dsr but it might be recycled in region itself due flat topography of the area thus the real loss of irrigation input is in terms of et which was the lowest in tpr dsr being longer duration that too the extra duration coinciding with high evaporative demand period of the year in the field results in slightly higher water loss et than tpr 3 7 irrigation strategy for higher water productivity and yield of dsr two years field study indicated that dsr is very sensitive to available soil moisture irrigation thresholds varying with crop growth stages caused variable effect on crop growth yield and water productivity the duration of the period with irrigations scheduled at higher smp also had significant effect on yield and irrigation water saving irrigations at 15 kpa during all stages in dsr produced the highest yield but with the highest irrigation input mild water stress 30 kpa during initial stages and 15 kpa during reproductive phase resulted in at par 1000 grains weight and yield with that of 15 kpa at all stages but amount of irrigation water reduced by 21 the higher yield with lower irrigation amount indicates better utilization of applied water further increase in irrigation threshold to 45 kpa resulted into significant reduction in irrigation input but with proportionate simultaneous yield reduction the present study suggests that adopting optimal irrigation schedules based on varying smp according to growth stages can reduce irrigation input with higher iwp and good yield of dsr as such the study infers that irrigations at 30 kpa during initial phase 90 das and at 15 kpa during later stages would be safer irrigation schedule for dsr 4 conclusion variable smp based irrigation schedules imposed on different crop stages had significant influence on crop growth yield contributing attributes total grain yield and water balance components of dsr frequent irrigations 15 kpa throughout the crop season though registered the highest total grain yield and cwp but simultaneously consumed the maximum irrigation water with the lowest iwp however mild water stress 30 kpa during initial phase and frequent irrigations 15 kpa during reproductive stages proved the best option because it saved significant 21 irrigation input and produced comparable grain yield and cwp to 15 kpa irrigation threshold throughout the season the dsr method of cultivation due to longer duration in the field than tpr recorded higher water loss in terms of et but lower cwp despite of lower tiller density tpr recorded better yield contributing attributes and produced significantly higher total grain yield than best dsr irrigation strategy the denser plant stand in dsr proved detrimental for yield contributing attributes and crop yield comparatively lower yield of dsr than tpr suggests that further studies are needed to optimize plant population in dsr and depth of installation of tensiometer for standardizing irrigation scheduling thresholds to achieve potential yield with higher water productivity and

11139,emitter clogging is one of the bottlenecks that restricts the application and promotion of drip irrigation technology applying intermittent fluctuated water pressure is regarded as an effective way to overcome drip irrigation emitter clogging when using high sediment water therefore a drip irrigation experiment using yellow river water was carried out at deng kou county inner mongolia china to study emitter clogging controlling effects of three fluctuation patterns the control group cg operation pressure was 40 kpa and three intermittent fluctuated water pressure modes were 40 kpa fluctuating water pressure for 1 h fp1 h 2 h fp2 h and 4 h fp4 h respectively the system was fluctuated once every 16 h and the amplitude of the fluctuating water pressure was 80 100 kpa with a cycle of 40 s the characteristics of the sediment size and mineral components of clogging substances found in emitters and laterals were also analyzed the results showed that intermittent fluctuated water pressure not only directly changed the flow velocity distribution in the emitter flow path to reduce the deposition of clogging substances but also controlled the formation of clogging substances inside the laterals to avoid enhanced emitter clogging by transporting into the emitter the intermittent fluctuated operating pressure could effectively reduce contents of emitter clogging substance in drip irrigation and the longer period it was applied the better controlling effect was observed comparing with the cg applying intermittent fluctuated water pressure with constant period of 4 h would reduce the total clogging substance contents by 26 the clay and powder particles were reduced by 56 and 34 respectively meanwhile the quartz silicate calcium magnesium and carbonate in the clogging substances decreased by 36 35 and 11 respectively thus the discharge ratio variation coefficient dra and christiansen uniformity coefficient cu increased by 10 1 16 7 and 8 9 14 2 correspondingly these results could provide references for the application and promotion of drip irrigation technology using water with high sediment load keywords water with high sediment load drip irrigation intermittent fluctuated water pressure clogging substance 1 introduction drip irrigation is one of the most effective irrigation technology for alleviating agricultural water resources shortage worldwide however emitter clogging is a bottleneck for the application and promotion of the drip irrigation technology water quality is regarded as the most direct and basic factor causing emitter clogging nakayama and bucks 1991 capra and scicolone 1998 zhou et al 2017 palacios díaz et al 2009 irrigation water with high sediment load is widely used in drip irrigation systems in northern china where water resources are more limited niu et al 2013 therefore increasing the risk of emitter clogging active number of scholars had extensively studied emitter clogging problem caused by high sediment water in drip irrigation systems different techniques has been used such as scaled grit chamber sand filter screen filter or disc filter to comprehensively control the sediment concentrations adin and alon 1986 duranros et al 2009 bové et al 2017 tao et al 2017 optimize the operation mode of the drip irrigation system such as using lateral flushing puig bargués and lamm 2013 li et al 2015 yellow river water yrw in china is famous for its high sediment concentration the multiple years average sediment concentration has been 1 2 35 0 kg cm3 and more than 90 of the sediments are smaller than 50 μm in diameter wang et al 2014a b hu et al 2004 even though an effective filtration system was installed but fine grained cohesive sediment still can enter in laterals and the emitters through the filtration system resulting in emitter clogging ge et al 2010 under these conditions lu 2010 proposed applying fluctuating water pressure in the drip irrigation system zhang et al 2017 observed the differences of emitter clogging with the labyrinth flow path under normal pressure and fluctuating water pressure and found that fluctuating water pressure could effectively improve the emitters anti clogging ability wang et al 2012 found that turbulence in emitter under fluctuating water pressure was generally higher than normal pressure and the strongest turbulence in emitter flow path was observed with the amplitude of 20 30 kpa however the application of fluctuating water pressure to improve the drip irrigation emitter clogging performance while using water with high sediment load had been rarely studied based on these an in situ experiment was conducted by using yrw the emitter s anti clogging performance and clogging substances compositions with intermittent fluctuated water pressure was quantified this study was mainly focused on 1 to evaluate the effects of intermittent fluctuated water pressure on clogging substances using high sediment water drip irrigation system 2 revealing the mechanism and inducing path of intermittent fluctuated pressure in controlling emitter clogging 3 suitability of fluctuated water pressure in controlling emitter clogging with long period and put forward the preliminary application mode 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental methods the experiment was carried out at the deng kou experimental station in northern china n 40 24 32 e 107 02 19 altitude 1072 m located at he tao irrigation district mongolia the experiment was conducted during 20 july 2017 to october 10 during experiment local average annual temperature precipitation and average annual wind speed was 24 5 c 37 1 mm and 2 4 m s respectively the meteorological data comes from the china meteorological data network irrigation water with high sediment utilized in this experiment directly fed from the yrw the water quality was tested once a week in professional testing organization and the characteristics are shown in table 1 the emitter testing chamber was arranged with treatments as normal pressure treatment i and intermittent fluctuate pressure treatment ii fig 1 they both combined with a scaled grit chamber length width and height were 8 m 2 m 2 5 m a sand filter particle size 0 5 1 0 mm with 30 cm thickness a screen filter 120 μm to control the sediments entering into the drip irrigation system fluctuating water pressure ii was controlled by an inverter and a programmable logic controller plc in this experiment 1 2 cycle of the fluctuating water pressure was divided into 7 types of pressures and outputting 7 frequencies through the inverter fig 2 and the plc was used to automatically program it through gx works2 software four working pressures were adopted in this experiment the control group cg operation at maintained pressure of 40 kpa and three intermittent fluctuate working pressures for 1 h fp1 h 2 h fp2 h and 4 h fp4 h respectively fp1 h represents drip irrigation system at operating pressure of 40 kpa for 16 h then fluctuate water pressure 80 100 kpa for 1 h fp2 h and fp4 h indicate that the fluctuating water pressure was running for 2 h and 4 h respectively the amplitude of the fluctuating water pressure was 80 100 kpa with a cycle of 40 s fig 2 the potassium dihydrogen phosphate was used in fertigation and was applied in the system for 2 h every day with the constant concentration of 0 15 g l the drip lines were washed every time with yrw before and after fertigation four types of non pressure compensating drip emitter fe1 fe2 fe3 fe4 with 16 mm internal diameter lateral were used as repetitions in table 2 the laterals were sectioned in three parts as inlet middle and tail parts drip irrigation testing chamber was accumulatively operated for 512 h 8 h each day all the treatment arrangements and operating cycle are illustrated in table 3 2 2 analysis of emitter discharge and the cross section average discharge ratio in present study weighing method was used to test emitter s

clogging degree in order to asses anti clogging performance of drip irrigation emitters discharge ratio and variation dra and coefficient of uniformity cu were calculated as described by li et al 2015 eq 4 4 d r a i n q i t q i 0 n 100 where q i 0 is emitter initial outflow in l h 1 q i t is the flow at t hour of emitter in l h 1 and n is the total number of emitters along the lateral the cu was

had the same meanings with those in eq 6 2 3 2 the total content of clogging substance in emitters and the laterals four types of non pressure compensating drip emitters fp1 h fp2 h fp3 h and fp4 h were subjected to experiment emitter samples were collected when the system was operated 64 h 128 h 192 h 256 h 320 h 384 h 448 h and 512 h to represent the whole laterals the samples were collected in each section of laterals inlet middle and tail parts each part of the sample is 30 cm long in this paper samples of the laterals and emitter that were processed at different times were placed in different zip lock bag and stored in the refrigerator the lateral samples were weighed using a high precision electronic balance with an accuracy of 10 4 g the clogging substances in the laterals were removed by an ultrasonic wave treatment and then they were dried in an oven which temperature was set to 50 c the differences between the weights were the weight of clogging substances deposited on lateral s wall the average value of the samples from different parts was the final result the same method was applied in emitters and in total nine emitters samples collected from the head middle and

the total contents of emitter clogging substances of the control group as the abscissa and the total contents of emitter clogging substances under different fluctuated water pressure treatments as the ordinate fig 3b although the difference among different treatments was obvious the linear correlations was obtained between these treatments with longer fluctuation time the gradient of the slope became smaller this also demonstrate that at the end of operation accumulative clogging substances content in fp1 h fp2 h and fp4 h were decreased by 11 19 and 26 when compared to cg 3 2 particles distribution of emitter clogging substances the distribution of clay powder and grit particles in emitter clogging substances under intermittent fluctuate water pressure modes and their correlations are shown in fig 4 significant analysis of particle size distribution under cg and fluctuating water pressure modes are shown in table 4 compared with the cg the clay particles of emitter clogging

were 0 25 0 71 mg cm2 0 72 2 74 mg cm2 and 1 02 4 15 mg cm2 respectively different fluctuating water pressure patterns had a negative influence on the content of grit particles consequently linear correlations were also obtained among different treatments for clay powder and grit particles with an increase in the fluctuation period the regression curve gradient became larger which indicated that the average content of the clay particles were decreased by 18 38 and 56 on average for the fp1 h fp2 h and fp4 h modes respectively similar effects were observed for the powder particles that decreased by 8 29 34 on average for the fp1 h fp2 h and fp4 h modes comparing with the cg over the entire operation period clay particles were easier to be removed by the fluctuated water pressure than the powder particles however the results of grit particles turned to be opposite as the grit particles under fp1 h fp2 h and fp4 h treatments were reduced by 7 increased by 5 and increased by 14 respectively when compared with the control group indicating that applying fluctuated water pressure was not so effective for the grit particles 3 3 mineral components in emitter clogging substances mineral components mainly included quartz muscovite alkaline feldspar chlorite calcium carbonate calcium magnesium carbonate and sodium chloride and ferric oxide but in small amount were observed in emitter deposits among these quartz and muscovite alkaline feldspar chlorite and silicates were the inherent mineral components originated from irrigation water source while calcium carbonate magnesium carbonate and other calcium or magnesium precipitates were mainly newly generated inorganic substances during the operation process and we found that the proportion of intrinsic components quartz and silicate was ranged from 60 1 to 74 1 calcium and magnesium carbonate were 23 6 38 7 and other substances only occupied 1 2 2 3 this small difference can be ignored due to the complexity of the clogging substances mineral components the difficulty of precise identification of existing test methods and the transformation of substances under natural conditions such as the transformation of aragonite and calcite the mineral components were divided into three types quartz silicate calcium and magnesium precipitations the contents of quartz silicate calcium and magnesium carbonate precipitates under intermittent fluctuate water pressure modes and their correlations are shown in fig 5 significant analysis of mineral components under cg and fluctuate water pressure treatments are shown in table 4 as the system continued operation quartz silicate calcium and magnesium precipitates all gradually increased compared with the cg quartz in fp1 h fp2 h and fp4 h treatments were reduced by 0 26 1 30 mg cm2 0 56 3 23 mg cm2 and 0 77 3 86 mg cm2 respectively and silicate were 0 29 1 28 mg cm2 0 24 1 82 mg cm2 and 0 32 2 59 mg cm2 respectively the effects of fluctuated water

linear correlations among different treatments was observed with longer fluctuation time the gradient of the regression curve decreased gradually average contents of quartz in fp1 h fp2 h and fp4 h treatments were reduced by 11 30 and 36 respectively while silicate were 19 28 and 35 respectively comparing with cg during the entire operation period however smaller impacts were found on calcium magnesium carbonate precipitations 11 17 4 discussion drip irrigation with high sediment water has been considered as an important measure to alleviate agricultural water resources shortage emitter is one of the main components of a drip irrigation system having flow path ranging from 0 5 to 1 2 mm wide to meet the energy dissipation however emitter could be easily subject to clogging especially when using water with high sediment load previous studies have demonstrated that operating pressure could directly influence emitter clogging process and the operating pressure should not be less than 50 kpa fan et al 2008 reducing the working pressure of a drip irrigation system is expected to become an effective measure to reduce the operation cost but up to date the clogging problem can not be effectively solved when the operating pressure is less than 50 kpa thus this study used inverters and plc to make the operating pressure fluctuate intermittently as an alternative way to control emitter clogging for drip irrigation system using high sediment water when the system operating pressure was under 40 kpa and the intermittent fluctuated water pressure varied continuously from 80 100 kpa in drip irrigation system we found that total contents of the clogging substances decreased by 0 13 5 83 mg cm2 when compared with the constant water pressure treatment it effectively removed 8 56 of the clay and powder particles and 11 35 of the mineral components the emitter cross section velocity in cg was relatively small under 40 kpa which was not enough to flush out the clogging substances effectively emitters flow path these results show similarity to li et al 2012 moreover the particles in water source adhere together and form a flocculating constituent that could then adhere to the emitters and continue to grow niu and liu 2011 the intermittent fluctuated water pressure changed continuously from 80 100 kpa and the average flow velocity for different emitter types became 1 31 1 86 m s while those in cg were merely 0 52 1 09 m s higher flow velocity and more intense turbulence in emitters made it easier to flush the clogging substance along with the water li et al 2015 however relatively larger particle size and weight of grit particles would lead to poor effects as the movement of grit particles was hindered by the clay and powder particles on the other hand with longer fluctuating water pressure period the turbulence in the emitter was enhanced and let to a higher probability of collisions between large particles and the grit particles tended to gather and form particle clusters and more likely blocked in the emitter so the effect of fluctuating water pressure on grit particles was not obvious even a negative effect was observed wang et al 2014a b wu and niu 2014 effects of fluctuating water pressure on precipitates of calcium carbonate was not so obvious because calcium and magnesium precipitates was mainly formed when the system was stopped operation in wet and dry alternation of long term drip irrigation the chemical deposit adhesion layer on the inner wall of the flow channel gradually thicken and the adhesive force of the wall increases and causes the flow channel s capacity of emitter to gradually decrease liu et al 2017 therefore the effect on magnesium carbonate precipitates in emitter was significantly lower than quartz and silicate the contents of total clogging substances in drip irrigation laterals under different intermittent fluctuated water pressure treatments fig 6 similar results were obtained as from emitters comparing with cg the quantity of total clogging substances under fp1 h fp2 h and fp4 h decreased by 0 11 1 50 mg cm2 a longer fluctuating water pressure period could better control clogging substance formation a good linear correlation was still obtained between clogging substances in laterals and emitters and it indicated that clogging in emitter gradually increased with the accumulation of clogging substances at lateral inner surface therefore reducing the content of clogging substance at laterals inner surface could also effectively decrease the formation of clogging substances in emitter based on these results the path analysis method was applied to further analyze the effects of clogging substance in both laterals and emitters on the emitters dra the path coefficient of emitter clogging substance to dra was 0 696 while that of clogging substances from laterals was 0 311 therefore it can conclude that the direct cause of the dra decline in the drip irrigation system is the accumulation of clogging substances in emitters and the indirect factor is due to the transportation of clogging substances from the laterals into the emitters these results were consistent with han et al 2018 the accumulated clogging substances could be reduced by an intermittent fluctuated water pressure resulting in better operating performance seen from fig 7 dra and cu under fluctuated pressure treatments increased by 10 1 16 7 and 8 9 14 2 respectively system pressure is the most important factor that affects the cost investment and operation cost of drip irrigation system also is a factor restricting its popularization and application some scholars have studied the feasibility of reducing the working pressure of drip irrigation emitters the research showed that the low pressure or micro pressure drip irrigation system can reduce the project investment cost by 30 70 the annual operating cost by 50 70 which reduce the pipe material standard and system investment in water distribution network of drip irrigation project zhang and wu 2005 at present the operating cost of fluctuating water pressure in drip irrigation systems is rarely literature the drip irrigation system operating cost is estimated simply in this paper the operating pressure of drip irrigation system was low pressure 40 kpa applying intermittent fluctuated water pressure 80 100 kpa the system service life can be effectively increased the investment of drip irrigation system in this region it was 3300 3750 ha the fluctuating water pressure of this experiment is realized by inverter and plc the total investment was increased to 5600 6370 ha which increases the cost of drip irrigation system by about 70 experiment is a low pressure operation mode farmers can afford it if investment was calculated by saving the project cost by 30 and annual operating cost by 50 of low pressure drip irrigation system and increasing service life of the system in addition the authors believe that applying intermittent fluctuated water pressure 80 00 kpa to greenhouse crops with good economic returns and high degree of automation management can obtain better income under low pressure condition overall some good results and conclusions were obtained however this paper also has the following limitations 1 the optimal operation time using intermittent fluctuated water pressure needs to be further studied 2 different wave amplitudes and periods are needed to proceed to offer more comprehensive guidelines for its application 5 conclusions the intermittent fluctuated water pressure treatments could effectively control the clogging substances accumulation was applied in drip irrigation system using high sediment water the controlling effect with a longer fluctuation period was quite better the results indicated that 4 h fluctuation pressure treatment fp4 h demonstrated better results among the applied treatments the drip irrigation system operating pressure 40 kpa for 16 h with fluctuating water pressure 80 100 kpa for 4 h reduced the clay particles powder particles quartz silicate and calcium magnesium carbonate precipitates by 26 56 34 36 35 and 11 respectively the system dra and cu compare with control treatment were increased by 16 7 and 14 2 respectively under the fp4 h treatment the fluctuating water pressure of the drip irrigation system ran for 102 h accounting for 1 5 of the whole operation cycle the intermittent fluctuating water pressure could directly change the emitter flow velocity distribution to prevent formation of clogging substance and indirectly controlled the clogging substance on laterals surface to reduce emitter clogging acknowledgements we are grateful for the financial support from the key research and

11139,emitter clogging is one of the bottlenecks that restricts the application and promotion of drip irrigation technology applying intermittent fluctuated water pressure is regarded as an effective way to overcome drip irrigation emitter clogging when using high sediment water therefore a drip irrigation experiment using yellow river water was carried out at deng kou county inner mongolia china to study emitter clogging controlling effects of three fluctuation patterns the control group cg operation pressure was 40 kpa and three intermittent fluctuated water pressure modes were 40 kpa fluctuating water pressure for 1 h fp1 h 2 h fp2 h and 4 h fp4 h respectively the system was fluctuated once every 16 h and the amplitude of the fluctuating water pressure was 80 100 kpa with a cycle of 40 s the characteristics of the sediment size and mineral components of clogging substances found in emitters and laterals were also analyzed the results showed that intermittent fluctuated water pressure not only directly changed the flow velocity distribution in the emitter flow path to reduce the deposition of clogging substances but also controlled the formation of clogging substances inside the laterals to avoid enhanced emitter clogging by transporting into the emitter the intermittent fluctuated operating pressure could effectively reduce contents of emitter clogging substance in drip irrigation and the longer period it was applied the better controlling effect was observed comparing with the cg applying intermittent fluctuated water pressure with constant period of 4 h would reduce the total clogging substance contents by 26 the clay and powder particles were reduced by 56 and 34 respectively meanwhile the quartz silicate calcium magnesium and carbonate in the clogging substances decreased by 36 35 and 11 respectively thus the discharge ratio variation coefficient dra and christiansen uniformity coefficient cu increased by 10 1 16 7 and 8 9 14 2 correspondingly these results could provide references for the application and promotion of drip irrigation technology using water with high sediment load keywords water with high sediment load drip irrigation intermittent fluctuated water pressure clogging substance 1 introduction drip irrigation is one of the most effective irrigation technology for alleviating agricultural water resources shortage worldwide however emitter clogging is a bottleneck for the application and promotion of the drip irrigation technology water quality is regarded as the most direct and basic factor causing emitter clogging nakayama and bucks 1991 capra and scicolone 1998 zhou et al 2017 palacios díaz et al 2009 irrigation water with high sediment load is widely used in drip irrigation systems in northern china where water resources are more limited niu et al 2013 therefore increasing the risk of emitter clogging active number of scholars had extensively studied emitter clogging problem caused by high sediment water in drip irrigation systems different techniques has been used such as scaled grit chamber sand filter screen filter or disc filter to comprehensively control the sediment concentrations adin and alon 1986 duranros et al 2009 bové et al 2017 tao et al 2017 optimize the operation mode of the drip irrigation system such as using lateral flushing puig bargués and lamm 2013 li et al 2015 yellow river water yrw in china is famous for its high sediment concentration the multiple years average sediment concentration has been 1 2 35 0 kg cm3 and more than 90 of the sediments are smaller than 50 μm in diameter wang et al 2014a b hu et al 2004 even though an effective filtration system was installed but fine grained cohesive sediment still can enter in laterals and the emitters through the filtration system resulting in emitter clogging ge et al 2010 under these conditions lu 2010 proposed applying fluctuating water pressure in the drip irrigation system zhang et al 2017 observed the differences of emitter clogging with the labyrinth flow path under normal pressure and fluctuating water pressure and found that fluctuating water pressure could effectively improve the emitters anti clogging ability wang et al 2012 found that turbulence in emitter under fluctuating water pressure was generally higher than normal pressure and the strongest turbulence in emitter flow path was observed with the amplitude of 20 30 kpa however the application of fluctuating water pressure to improve the drip irrigation emitter clogging performance while using water with high sediment load had been rarely studied based on these an in situ experiment was conducted by using yrw the emitter s anti clogging performance and clogging substances compositions with intermittent fluctuated water pressure was quantified this study was mainly focused on 1 to evaluate the effects of intermittent fluctuated water pressure on clogging substances using high sediment water drip

substance formation a good linear correlation was still obtained between clogging substances in laterals and emitters and it indicated that clogging in emitter gradually increased with the accumulation of clogging substances at lateral inner surface therefore reducing the content of clogging substance at laterals inner surface could also effectively decrease the formation of clogging substances in emitter based on these results the path analysis method was applied to further analyze the effects of clogging substance in both laterals and emitters on the emitters dra the path coefficient of emitter clogging substance to dra was 0 696 while that of clogging substances from laterals was 0 311 therefore it can conclude that the direct cause of the dra decline in the drip irrigation system is the accumulation of clogging substances in emitters and the indirect factor is due to the transportation of clogging substances from the laterals into the emitters these results were consistent with han et al 2018 the accumulated clogging substances could be reduced by an intermittent fluctuated water pressure resulting in better operating performance seen from fig 7 dra and cu under fluctuated pressure treatments increased by 10 1 16 7 and 8 9 14 2 respectively system pressure is the most important factor that affects the cost investment and operation cost of drip irrigation system also is a factor restricting its popularization and application some scholars have studied the feasibility of reducing the working pressure of drip irrigation emitters the research showed that the low pressure or micro pressure drip irrigation system can reduce the project investment cost by 30 70 the annual operating cost by 50 70 which reduce the pipe material standard and system investment in water distribution network of drip irrigation project zhang and wu 2005 at present the operating cost of fluctuating water pressure in drip irrigation systems is rarely literature the drip irrigation system operating cost is estimated simply in this paper the operating pressure of drip irrigation system was low pressure 40 kpa applying intermittent fluctuated water pressure 80 100 kpa the system service life can be effectively increased the investment of drip irrigation system in this region it was 3300 3750 ha the fluctuating water pressure of this experiment is realized by inverter and plc the total investment was increased to 5600 6370 ha which increases the cost of drip irrigation system by about 70 experiment is a low pressure operation mode farmers can afford it if investment was calculated by saving the project cost by 30 and annual operating cost by 50 of low pressure drip irrigation system and increasing service life of the system in addition the authors believe that applying intermittent fluctuated water pressure 80 00 kpa to greenhouse crops with good economic returns and high degree of automation management can obtain better income under low pressure condition overall some good results and conclusions were obtained however this paper also has the following limitations 1 the optimal operation time using intermittent fluctuated water pressure needs to be further studied 2 different wave amplitudes and periods are needed to proceed to offer more comprehensive guidelines for its application 5 conclusions the intermittent fluctuated water pressure treatments could effectively control the clogging substances accumulation was applied in drip irrigation system using high sediment water the controlling effect with a longer fluctuation period was quite better the results indicated that 4 h fluctuation pressure treatment fp4 h demonstrated better results among the applied treatments the drip irrigation system operating pressure 40 kpa for 16 h with fluctuating water pressure 80 100 kpa for 4 h reduced the clay particles powder particles quartz silicate and calcium magnesium carbonate precipitates by 26 56 34 36 35 and 11 respectively the system dra and cu compare with control treatment were increased by 16 7 and 14 2 respectively under the fp4 h treatment the fluctuating water pressure of the drip irrigation system ran for 102 h accounting for 1 5 of the whole operation cycle the intermittent fluctuating water pressure could directly change the emitter flow velocity distribution to prevent formation of clogging substance and indirectly controlled the clogging substance on laterals surface to reduce emitter clogging acknowledgements we are grateful for the financial support from the key research and
