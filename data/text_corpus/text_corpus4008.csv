realisation utilising the computational watershed application of spatial analyst tools metz et al 2011 subba rao et al 2001 this study made use of the srtm dem srtm 1 arc second at a spatial resolution of 30 m the first step after importing the dem file into arcgis 10 7 is projecting the dem into a co ordinate system since elevation data sinks are frequently the result of data inaccuracies it is crucial to eliminate all depressions or sinks from the dem layer using the fill function the dem is used to construct the flow direction raster which depicts the real direction of water flow a stream network which is defined by flow accumulation is produced when the grid is converted into a linear vector file shapefile using arcgis stream to feature tool run snap pour point to snap the pour points to the closest point of maximal flow accumulation after extracting stream instructions outlet use the hydrology toolbox s watershed function to delineate watershed convert the watershed layer s format from raster to polygon vector fig 2 depicts the flow chart used for watershed delineation 5 methodology fig 3 displays the whole methodology framework and data analysis the study s full methodology is listed below 5 1 pre processing prior to change detection pre processing of satellite images is crucial and has the specific objective of creating a more direct connection between biophysical processes and information coppin et al 2004 kayitesi et al 2022 the bands were combined into a single layer using layer stacking of the erdas imagine 2015 software for image processing and execution supervised classification of the satellite images then using arcgis 10 7 the shapefile of the murredu watershed area that was generated as a result of the watershed delineation procedure was used to extract these images for mapping a uniform false colour composite was made for each image 5 2 land cover classification scheme a classification scheme that specifies the lulc classes was taken into consideration when creating the lulc map from satellite imagery the ideal number of lulc classes depends on the specifications of a particular project for a particular application for mapping the entire watershed region the five key lulc classifications of built up area agricultural land forest barren land and waterbodies were selected table 2 5 3 post processing delimiting polygons around typical sites allowed training samples to be chosen for each of the specified lulc types the spectral signatures for the various land cover categories seen in the satellite images were determined using the pixels contained in these polygons confusion among them to be mapped land covers is assessed to be minimal when a spectral signature is deemed to be satisfactory gao and liu 2010 as a result using high definition satellite images from google earth pro signatures were added to the satellite images after the spectral signature had been determined to be satisfactory it was added to the classification procedure after creating a classification system all the lulc classes were mapped using one of the most used maximum likelihood methods were applied in this present study a google earth pro examination has been conducted to carry out supervised classifications choose a training site and assess classification accuracy ground truth data should be collected the google earth prowas used to gather training and testing interest sites for the ground truth information in this investigation the current research area classes were defined after interpretation and five lulc classes built up area agricultural land forest barren land and water bodies were identified because the google earth pro image has a high spatial resolution 5 4 lulc change detection the lulc mapping project was expected to produce data on the spatial distribution of land use categories as well as identify and estimate changes in land use over the previous decades furthermore the number of transitions from one land cover category to another between time periods 1996 and 2019 was quantified important information about the spatial distribution of lulc changes is presented by the change matrix shalaby and tateishi 2007 to evaluate the overall changes in lulc classes a change matrix illustrating the changes in land cover from 1996 to 2019 was created 5 5 accuracy assessment the comparison of a classification with actual data serves as an accuracy assessment which determines how accurately the classification captures the real world using a random sampling approach with 200 points an accuracy assessment of the classified images that resulted in this study was done to examine the quality of the information that was produced from the data the error matrix was used to conduct this evaluation to assess the degree of classification accuracy from the report portion of erdas imagine 2015 kappa statistics and the overall accuracy of the categorised images were conducted 6 results 6 1 murredu watershed this river s watershed covers 1593 km2 in total fig 4 this watershed had significant lulc changes over time the resulting lulc from supervised classification is listed in table 3 and includes five primary classes built up area agricultural land forest barren land and waterbodies for 1996 and 2019 respectively 6 2 lulc scenario of murredu watershed 1996 agriculture accounted for 54 19 percent of the watershed s land area in 1996 forest 40 30 was the watershed s second most prevalent land cover because a forest infiltrates the majority of the rain that falls during the monsoon and reduces both soil erosion and surface runoff it often plays a significant influence in the hydrological features of a watershed in low land watersheds it will also lessen flood intensity haque 2013 as indicated in fig 5 at that time the area was made up of 1 27 water bodies 2 80 of which were occupied by built up areas and 1 45 of bare ground 6 3 lulc scenario of murredu watershed 2019 after 1996 there was a significant amount of deforestation in the watershed region which left the land unforested and suitable for agriculture and other uses the majority of the watershed s land was used for agriculture in 2019 59 36 forest 30 63 was the second most prevalent land cover in the watershed as shown in fig 6 the water bodies make up 1 53 of the total area while the built up area occupies almost 3 64 and the bare land makes up 4 84 forests are recognised for promoting groundwater recharge and consuming a lot of water through evapotranspiration from the trees aladejana et al 2018 the deep roots of the forest act as flow pathways to replenish the ground water and raise the base flow farinosi et al 2019 in addition forest improves the soil s ability to store water and speeds up infiltration obahoundje et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 as a result deforestation reduces the infiltration processes because the soil is less permeable less rainfall is intercepted and more runoff baseflow and groundwater recharge occur as a result naha et al 2021 in 1996 about 40 30 of the area was covered by forest but in 2019 it was 30 63 showing a decrease in forest land compared to forests agricultural lands are more likely to experience higher surface runoff and sediment transportation baker and miller 2013 on the other side agriculture is increased from 1996 54 19 to 2019 59 36 barren land increased from 1996 1 45 to 2019 4 84 built up area increased from 1996 2 80 to 2019 3 64 table 3 to assess the total changes in lulc classes a change matrix illustrating the changes in land cover from 1996 to 2019 was created 6 4 accuracy assessment one of the significant differences between the classified image and the actual or real ground is accuracy evaluation the accuracy of the 2019 classified map was evaluated using one of the most popular kappa accuracy assessment techniques using high resolution satellite images from google earth pro 200 stratified random points were generated table 4 accurate assessment of the 1996 image was not possible due to a lack of clear images and their availability overall classification accuracy for the classified image of 2019 was found to be 90 with overall kappa statistics of 85 98 table 5 displays the accuracy of each producer and user for each class 7 discussion 7 1 lulc changes tables 6 exhibit the lulc change matrix for the years 1996 through 2019 in turn the numbers in bold indicate that there has been no change in the lulc classes for the specified time frame the murredu watershed underwent significant land cover changes over the research period according to the results of the lulc change matrix figs 7 and 8 show the lulc of the murredu watershed s temporal pattern and relative variations from 1996 to 2019 7 2 lulc patterns over the period of 1996 2019 the overall changes from 1996 to 2019 are shown in table 7 the forest one of the main land cover classes in this region has significantly decreased during the past decades from 1996 to 2019 the area covered by forests decreased by 154 01 km2 agriculture is one of the most significant land uses in the basin second only to forestry and is another type of land cover in this region agriculture has significantly increased during the past decades from 1996 to 2019 the area covered by forests decreased by 82 38 km2 overall the agricultural area in this watershed increased from 863 20 km2 in 1996 to 945 59 km2 in 2019 the shallow water and thick forest along the rivers made it challenging to map water bodies with 30 m of spatial resolution the challenge was heightened even more in 2019 the area covered by water bodies grew the overall change in waterbodies from 1996 to 2019 is 0 26 overall the agricultural area in this watershed increased by 5 17 from 1996 to 2019 additionally between 1996 and 2019 the proportion of land that is built up increased overall by 0 84 between 1996 and 2019 the amount of bare land overall changed by 3 39 8 conclusion this present study demonstrates how lulc changes in the murredu drainage basin have altered significantly over the past decades overall classification accuracy for the classified image of 2019 was found to be 90 with overall kappa statistics of 85 98 from these findings change detection analysis shows that the area used for agricultural land barren land forest built up areas and waterbodies has increased by 5 17 3 39 0 84 and 0 26 respectively between 1996 and 2019 the forest area has decreased by 9 67 at the same time the area of forest has decreased whereas the areas for agriculture waterbodies bare land and built up areas have all increased therefore this research anticipates that the findings might provide information to planners land managers and decision makers for the sustainable management and development of the natural resource in a future study sub watersheds could be created within the watershed since it is large enough to be included in management practices additionally these sub watersheds could be given higher priority for management and conservation based on the degree of deterioration funding there was no funding for this project

five lulc classes built up area agricultural land forest barren land and water bodies were identified because the google earth pro image has a high spatial resolution 5 4 lulc change detection the lulc mapping project was expected to produce data on the spatial distribution of land use categories as well as identify and estimate changes in land use over the previous decades furthermore the number of transitions from one land cover category to another between time periods 1996 and 2019 was quantified important information about the spatial distribution of lulc changes is presented by the change matrix shalaby and tateishi 2007 to evaluate the overall changes in lulc classes a change matrix illustrating the changes in land cover from 1996 to 2019 was created 5 5 accuracy assessment the comparison of a classification with actual data serves as an accuracy assessment which determines how accurately the classification captures the real world using a random sampling approach with 200 points an accuracy assessment of the classified images that resulted in this study was done to examine the quality of the information that was produced from the data the error matrix was used to conduct this evaluation to assess the degree of classification accuracy from the report portion of erdas imagine 2015 kappa statistics and the overall accuracy of the categorised images were conducted 6 results 6 1 murredu watershed this river s watershed covers 1593 km2 in total fig 4 this watershed had significant lulc changes over time the resulting lulc from supervised classification is listed in table 3 and includes five primary classes built up area agricultural land forest barren land and waterbodies for 1996 and 2019 respectively 6 2 lulc scenario of murredu watershed 1996 agriculture accounted for 54 19 percent of the watershed s land area in 1996 forest 40 30 was the watershed s second most prevalent land cover because a forest infiltrates the majority of the rain that falls during the monsoon and reduces both soil erosion and surface runoff it often plays a significant influence in the hydrological features of a watershed in low land watersheds it will also lessen flood intensity haque 2013 as indicated in fig 5 at that time the area was made up of 1 27 water bodies 2 80 of which were occupied by built up areas and 1 45 of bare ground 6 3 lulc scenario of murredu watershed 2019 after 1996 there was a significant amount of deforestation in the watershed region which left the land unforested and suitable for agriculture and other uses the majority of the watershed s land was used for agriculture in 2019 59 36 forest 30 63 was the second most prevalent land cover in the watershed as shown in fig 6 the water bodies make up 1 53 of the total area while the built up area occupies almost 3 64 and the bare land makes up 4 84 forests are recognised for promoting groundwater recharge and consuming a lot of water through evapotranspiration from the trees aladejana et al 2018 the deep roots of the forest act as flow pathways to replenish the ground water and raise the base flow farinosi et al 2019 in addition forest improves the soil s ability to store water and speeds up infiltration obahoundje et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 as a result deforestation reduces the infiltration processes because the soil is less permeable less rainfall is intercepted and more runoff baseflow and groundwater recharge occur as a result naha et al 2021 in 1996 about 40 30 of the area was covered by forest but in 2019 it was 30 63 showing a decrease in forest land compared to forests agricultural lands are more likely to experience higher surface runoff and sediment transportation baker and miller 2013 on the other side agriculture is increased from 1996 54 19 to 2019 59 36 barren land increased from 1996 1 45 to 2019 4 84 built up area increased from 1996 2 80 to 2019 3 64 table 3 to assess the total changes in lulc classes a change matrix illustrating the changes in land cover from 1996 to 2019 was created 6 4 accuracy assessment one of the significant differences between the classified image and the actual or real ground is accuracy evaluation the accuracy of the 2019 classified map was evaluated using one of the most popular kappa accuracy assessment techniques using high resolution satellite images from google earth pro 200 stratified random points were generated table 4 accurate assessment of the 1996 image was not possible due to a lack of clear images and their availability overall classification accuracy for the classified image of 2019 was found to be 90 with overall kappa statistics of 85 98 table 5 displays the accuracy of each producer and user for each class 7 discussion 7 1 lulc changes tables 6 exhibit the lulc change matrix for the years 1996 through 2019 in turn the numbers in bold indicate that there has been no change in the lulc classes for the specified time frame the murredu watershed underwent significant land cover changes over the research period according to the results of the lulc change matrix figs 7 and 8 show the lulc of the murredu watershed s temporal pattern and relative variations from 1996 to 2019 7 2 lulc patterns over the period of 1996 2019 the overall changes from 1996 to 2019 are shown in table 7 the forest one of the main land cover classes in this region has significantly decreased during the past decades from 1996 to 2019 the area covered by forests decreased by 154 01 km2 agriculture is one of the most significant land uses in the basin second only to forestry and is another type of land cover in this region agriculture has significantly increased during the past decades from 1996 to 2019 the area covered by forests decreased by 82 38 km2 overall the agricultural area in this watershed increased from 863 20 km2 in 1996 to 945 59 km2 in 2019 the shallow water and thick forest along the rivers made it challenging to map water bodies with 30 m of spatial resolution the challenge was heightened even more in 2019 the area covered by water bodies grew the overall change in waterbodies from 1996 to 2019 is 0 26 overall the agricultural area in this watershed increased by 5 17 from 1996 to 2019 additionally between 1996 and 2019 the proportion of land that is built up increased overall by 0 84 between 1996 and 2019 the amount of bare land overall changed by 3 39 8 conclusion this present study demonstrates how lulc changes in the murredu drainage basin have altered significantly over the past decades overall classification accuracy for the classified image of 2019 was found to be 90 with overall kappa statistics of 85 98 from these findings change detection analysis shows that the area used for agricultural land barren land forest built up areas and waterbodies has increased by 5 17 3 39 0 84 and 0 26 respectively between 1996 and 2019 the forest area has decreased by 9 67 at the same time the area of forest has decreased whereas the areas for agriculture waterbodies bare land and built up areas have all increased therefore this research anticipates that the findings might provide information to planners land managers and decision makers for the sustainable management and development of the natural resource in a future study sub watersheds could be created within the watershed since it is large enough to be included in management practices additionally these sub watersheds could be given higher priority for management and conservation based on the degree of deterioration funding there was no funding for this project

20041,it is vital to employ efficient methods to calculate and determine the threshold of river ecological flow these methods help to get the river ecological status control countermeasures in the plain river networks and construct a flawless long term mechanism of ecological flow control water level according to the river s current environment and the actual circumstances surrounding its operation and administration the upper middle and lower reaches make up the three sections of the zong liutang river in the plain of northern jiangsu furthermore the ecological water level governing factor for each reach was analyzed and studied the ecological water level threshold in the upper and lower reaches of the zong liutang river adopted the specified values of jiangsu provincial department of water resources the threshold of the middle reach was thoroughly analyzed by using the determination method with multi criteria which consisted of the hydrological and hydraulic methods including yearly minimum water level with a 90 assured rate method wetted perimeter method minimum monthly average water level method aquatic living conditions method and river landscape entertainment factor method taking into account the hydrological and hydrodynamic characteristics observed hydrological data conditions of rivers and the actual operation rules of rivers and water projects regulations in the northern jiangsu plain through comparing and contrasting actual operation and management plans the target values of the ecological water level for the river s upper middle and lower reaches were 17 4 m 8 96 m and 7 5 m respectively based on the river s ecological water level s control value which was found through a thorough analysis and the river s real operation and management conditions specific measures to protect the river s ecological water level were suggested these included developing a perfect and workable ecological flow control method speeding up the development of an ecological water level goal assurance early warning system and an ecological flow and inlet system keywords river ecological water level northern jiangsu plain threshold calculation methods determination method with multi criteria preventive measures introduction environmental flow assessments have evolved from the narrow purpose of describing flows for maintaining specific fish species to their present use as a tool in holistic catchment management richard and rafik 2003 in february 2019 the general office of the ministry of water resources in china issued a notice on the research and guaranteed work plan for the ecological flow of key rivers and lakes water volume the office sorted out a number of important river and lake sections preparing ecological flow guarantee implementation plans and evaluating the annual implementation cheng et al 2020 the minimum ecological flow water level is defined as maintaining the ecological environment function corresponding to the given ecological environmental protection goals of rivers and lakes without loss the minimum flow minimum water level that needs to be retained in the river channel is the basis for clarifying the ecological flow threshold of rivers and lakes which is crucial to the maintenance of ecosystem health in the river channel strictly controlling the ecological flow water level of rivers and lakes to ensure the safety of the regional water environment plays a positive role in effectively implementing the overall work of ecological civilization construction li et al 2019 the most important way to protect ecological flow is to keep the river s natural flow pattern as much as possible therefore the health of the river can be judged in many ways such as river hydrological change indicators and ecological flow satisfaction rates he and yin 2020 zhao et al 2019 environmental flow assessment methods fall into two categories prescriptive and interactive brown and king 2003 the commonly used calculation methods for river ecological flow water level include the hydrology method hydraulics method habitat simulation method overall method etc richter and others richter et al 1996 proposed the rva method to judge hydrological change characteristics according to different hydrological change indicators richter divided 33 hydrological parameters into five aspects comprehensive flow time frequency delay and change rate and evaluate the degree of change in the hydrological situation of the river from different perspectives at the same time on the basis of this method a variety of quantitative evaluation methods of river hydrological regime change have been extended such as the dhram method the dundee hydrological region alternation method black et al 2005 the histogram matching method hma shiau and wu 2008 etc jiang jiang et al 2014 and others used the rva method to evaluate the impact of the three gorges dam on the water regime of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river based on the observation data of seven hydrological stations in yichang hankou datong and other main streams of the yangtze river from 1980 to 2012 the research concluded that the regulation and storage of the reservoir had a greater impact on the runoff change rate and annual extreme flow and the farther away from the three gorges dam the weaker the impact gu xihui gu et al 2016 and others evaluated the overall change degree of the river hydrological process in the dongjiang river basin after being affected by the reservoir based on the overall hydrological change degree calculated by the iha index and the dhram method their research results showed that the overall change degree of important hydrological stations in the dongjiang river basin exceeded 50 and the dhram evaluation was also above medium impact ma and others ma et al 2019 proposed a river hydrological health evaluation method based on the ecological flow threshold and analyzed the basic role of ecological flow maintenance in the protection of river health huang and others huang zha and wang 2016 analyzed the ecological water level of the hydrological control sections of the main rivers in yancheng city by using the minimum living water depth 60 wet perimeter rate and 90 guarantee rate for the annual minimum water level li calculated and analyzed the minimum ecological flow of the qingjiang river through the monthly minimum ecological flow method the range of variability approach rva and the duration curve dc method li et al 2021 li obtained a suitable ecological flow of the qingjiang river in different scenarios through the monthly frequency method chu constructed a model for calculating urban rivers and lakes ecological flow and analyzing the degree of assurance musef model chu et al 2018 chu calculated the river and lake system in zhuzhou urban area quantitatively by using this model and provided the foundation for effective management and security of its ecological flow wu calculated the ecological water level of the songliao basin by applying vmf tessmann adapted and smakhtin adapted methods etc and analyzed the causes of the ecological flow deficit wu et al 2022 it has practical guiding significance for the determination and protection of ecological flow in the songliao basin dong modified the tennant method by replacing the average flow with the highest frequency of flow dong et al 2012 it is more suitable to reflect the law of flow by using the modified tennant method to calculate minimum instream ecological flow and we have more reasonable calculation results yu yu et al 2021 proposed a new optimization method an optimal method for the phased habitat demand omphd of key species by using relevant formulas the hydrodynamic and fish effective habitats were calculated and simulated the index gdi was introduced determining the ecological flow in the downstream dehydration section of the diversion small hydropower station wang wang et al 2019 developed a new approach for estimating the ecological flow of fish overwintering in plain rivers this method played an important role in modeling fish spawning habitats and the ecological flow of the target fish throughout its life cycle can be determined in recent years the river network area of the north jiangsu plain has implemented the renovation and reconstruction plan of the river water system in the region on a large scale although the landscape construction of rivers and lakes has been strengthened some aquatic organisms have been restored however local areas or river sections place a lot of emphasis on the urban landscape also the standardized development and utilization behavior based on the organic combination of river and lake water system connectivity and ecological functions has not been sufficiently deepened the hardening of the banks of the river network and changes in the characteristics of the riverside wetlands also lead to the deterioration of the aquatic ecosystem to some extent the reduction of biodiversity the weakening of the ecological stability of the system and the strength of the normal river network hydrodynamics are still insufficient in addition water conservancy projects such as the dam sluice gate and pump stations on the river channel play the functions of drainage and irrigation flood control and water supply in terms of water resource utilization dams are also considered one of the most important pillars of economic development including food security hydropower generation water supply and irrigation and mitigating drought and floods rafik and richard 2009 the dam sluice gate and pump stations also change the natural flow state of the river into an artificial flow state reducing the connectivity of the river and the channel the regulation and storage of the river interfere with the natural water cycle process of the river causing the disappearance of some biological communities in the river and causing serious water pollution and ecosystem health problems ge 2019 zuo and liang 2016 therefore it is necessary to use effective methods for calculating the river s ecological flow threshold water level based on a complete analysis of the situation and challenges of environmental flow control in the normal river network according to the overall route of river and lake ecological flow management and control in the new era special long term measures should be taken to enhance the management and control of the ecological flow of rivers the zong liutang river in the northern jiangsu plain is the research area considering the actual situation of river ecological flow water level management the corresponding environmental water level threshold will be determined by the subsection design method the comprehensive calculation the relevant methods and measures for targeted management and control of the river s environmental water level flow will be analyzed to provide technical and reference support to further enhance the environmental flow assurance of rivers and lakes in the study area materials and methods study area the zong liutang river is located in suqian city jiangsu province china with geographical coordinates of 118 16 31 east longitude and 37 57 48 north latitude its basin belongs to a typical plain river network area with vertical and horizontal channels and flat terrain and the river network is highly developed the river starts at the yanghe gate ends at the huaishu river and intersects with huaishu river horizontally after crossing the huaishu river the zong liutang river joins with the guanhe river and flows into the yellow sea the zong liutang river is the main river channel for regional waterlogging drainage in the yinan region it undertakes the tasks of waterlogging drainage and irrigation in suyu district and siyang county the total length of the river channel is 76 km and the drainage area is 691 km2 fig 1 the suqian water resources bulletin shows that the city s annual average precipitation is 909 6 mm and the annual distribution is uneven on average about 68 of the annual rainfall is concentrated in may to september in terms of the characteristics of the river section most of the rivers in the plain river network area where the zong liutang river is located have low velocity and calm water surfaces the distribution of gates and dams along the river will regulate the water volume in the river therefore the total zong liutang river has low velocity and flow and the measured flow data is too small to be used as a calculation reference the upstream section of the zong liutang river is connected to the beijing hangzhou grand canal through the zong liutang river sluice all year round so the water level of the upstream section is equal to that of suqian s section of the grand canal called the middle canal the downstream section of the river intersects with the huaishu river horizontally so the water level of the downstream section is the same as that of the huaishu river there were three hydrological monitoring stations along the zong liutang river namely yanghe gate hydrological station xiangzhuang hydrological station and fulong hydrological station yanghe gate hydrological station has some discharge observation data xiangzhuang hydrological station and fulong hydrological station have water level data according to the analysis of the collected measured water level data of yanghe gate xiangzhuang hydrological station and fulong hydrological station the hydrological monitoring data of yanghe gate hydrological station and fulong hydrological station began in 2013 but the water level data of xiangzhuang hydrological station has a short duration since 2019 for a long time the hydrologic observation data of the studied river in most periods of the year such as flow and velocity had little change except for the flood season with large rainfall in some years the monitored flow is almost zero therefore the local hydrologic monitoring department can only selectively carry out regular hydrologic measurement on rivers which leads to that the hydrologic monitoring data of rivers are not very long the hydrological data used by the present research is all the data that can be collected but it can basically meet the calculation requirements of the hydrological and hydraulic methods in the study work methodology sectional design for calculation of river ecological water level based on the current operation and management of the river it was found that the upstream section of the zong liutang river is connected withsuqian ssectionofthe beijing hangzhou grandcanal all year round the relevant water diversion station can regulate and store the water source of the grand canal into the zong liutang river therefore the limit of the ecological water level of suqian ssectionof the grand canal could be adopted as the ecological water level threshold of the upper reaches of the zong liutang river fig 2 shows hydraulic connection between upstream of zongliutang river and middle canal in the upstream section through connection channel and link culvert zongliutang river maintains the same water level as the middle canal the lower reaches of the zong liutang river starting from the miaochong rubber dam on the river intersect the huaishu river horizontally shown as fig 2 so the water level of the lower reaches is equal to that of the huaishu river tosummarize in combination with the first batch of specified ecological water levels of rivers and lakes in jiangsu province trial jpdwr 2019 the zong liutang river sluice and miaochong rubber sluice are taken as subsection points the total zong liutang river is divided into the upper reaches yanghe sluice gate zong liutang river sluice the river length is 6 km the middle reaches zong liutang river sluice miaochong rubber sluice river length 33 km and the downstream section miaochong rubber dam intersection point with huaishu river river length 37 km to calculate the ecological water level flow and analyze the management and control measures in 2019 the water resources department of jiangsu province issued the management regulations of the first batch of ecological water levels of rivers and lakes in jiangsu province trial in which the target control values of ecological water levels of all key rivers and lakes in jiangsu province were specified the upstream and downstream of zongliutang river are hydraulically connected with the relevant key rivers in the regulation so their ecological control water level needs to meet the requirements of the regulation consequently the ecological level for the upstream section and downstream section were determined according to the first batch of ecological water levels of rivers and lakes in jiangsu province trial in principle the ecological water level thresholds of the upstream section were based on the ecological water level limit of the upper section of the liulaojian gate in the suqian ssectionof the grand canal from the zaohe gate to the liulaojian gate specified by the first batch of river and lake ecological water levels in jiangsu province trial jpdwr 2019 the ecological water level value of downstream sections was determined by the upstream level limit of shuyang gate in the huaishu river the water level at the junction of the zong liutang river and the huaishu river could be calculated from the ecologically controlled water depth at the shuyang gate therefore the focal point of research is to figure out and analyze the control value of the ecological water level in the middle reaches of the zong liutang river the calculation of the threshold value of the ecological water level in the middle reaches was based on the hydrological and ecological data from the monitoring section of the fulong station calculation and determination of ecological water level in the middle reaches the rivers in the river network area of the north jiangsu plain have typical characteristics such as calm river surface small flow and velocity in the river channel and generally weak river hydrodynamics due to the characteristics of river basins in various regions the situation of water collecting areas is complex and the real time hydrological survey data of many rivers in the study area is limited generally the traditional and conventional calculation methods of river ecological flow cannot be used and the calculation method of lake ecological water level was used to complete the relevant calculation work chen et al 2017 at the same time considering the application of traditional river ecological flow calculation methods the ecological water level threshold of the zong liutang river will be calculated by using the water level data of yanghe sluice gate and fulong hydrological station over the years given the river flow characteristics within the scope of suqian city and referring to the relevant calculation methods in the relevant plain river ecological water level flow analysis literature various methods can be used to calculate ecological flow this paper selects three kinds of means the hydrological and hydraulic method including 90 annual minimum water level wet perimeter method and minimum monthly average water level aquatic living conditions method and river landscape entertainment factor method focused on the analysis of the ecological water level of the control section in the middle reaches of the zong liutang river the above three methods belong to different methodologies and have different calculation principles applicable conditions and calculation technologies however it is reliable to comprehensively apply them to the selected research area and research objectives in the paper and form a multi principal procedure to determine the river s ecological water level hydrological and hydraulic method 90 annual minimum water level method the minimum water level method with representative frequency 90 is to deduce the corresponding characteristic value based on the fitting and wiring of the long series of daily average water level empirical points through the review of the representativeness reliability and consistency of the hydrological data of fulong hydrological station in the middle reaches the daily water level series data of the hydrological station from april 2013 to september 2020 were selected for analysis through the empirical frequency calculation and analysis of the daily water level series it was found that the pearson iii which is p iii curve is suitable for fitting its empirical frequency curve the corresponding water level at different frequencies can be obtained from the fitted theoretical curve the formula for calculating the empirical frequency of the daily water level series is 1 p m n d 1 where m is the descending order of the daily average water level and n d is the sample capacity the three main statistical characteristic parameters of the p iii curve are the series mean value x the skewness coefficient c s distribution and the variation coefficient c v according to the fitted statistical characteristic curve and the determined frequency p the water level characteristic value of the corresponding frequency can be calculated by using the following formula 2 x p φ p c v 1 x k p x where φ p is the calculation parameter of the p iii curve k p the modulus coefficient x p the characteristic value of the water level corresponding to a specific frequency according to the hydrological data of the hydrological station arranged on the total zong liutang river the ecological water level of the control section of the zong liutang river s uplift was analyzed by using the annual minimum water level with a frequency of 90 fig 3 shows the water level frequency curve drawn according to the data of fulong hydrological station the calculation results are shown in table 1 according to the analysis of the drawn water level frequency curve under the best fitting conditions most of the empirical points fall on the theoretical frequency curve and the fitting degree was as high as 0 9843 therefore the water level value corresponding to 90 of the frequency of the section of fulong hydrological station was 8 96 m this elevation is based on the base level of the abandoned yellow river which following as the same wet perimeter method according to the measured cross section and the daily water level monitoring data of fulong hydrological station after the above review first calculated the water depth and multiply it by the slope coefficient to obtain the slope width when calculating it should be noted that the section was a compound section and the water depth corresponds to different water levels the side slope coefficients were different so a subdivision calculation was required then the length of the side slope was calculated by using the formula for the side length of the right triangle finally the wet perimeter corresponding to the water level was calculated by adding the width of the slope bottom the quantity relationship between the wet perimeter and the river s flow was calculated by the manning formula 3 q s n a 5 3 p 2 3 in the formula q is the instantaneous flow of the section m3 s n is the roughness coefficient s is the gradient of the channel p is the wet circumference m a is the cross sectional area of the water m2 the data from the same fulong hydrological station water level series used in the 90 annual minimum water level method were analyzed and a relationship curve was drawn using the calculated wet perimeter data and the water level monitoring data the inflection points on the wet perimeter water level relationship curve was 115 76 11 69 so when the wet perimeter was 115 76 m the corresponding water level was the required ecological water level of 11 69 m fig 4 shows the relationship between a wet perimeter and the water level of the zong liutang river this relationship was found by doing calculations and analyzing the data at fulong hydrological station minimum monthly average water level method the minimum monthly average water level method takes the multi year average value of the minimum monthly average measured water level as the basic ecological water level of the river the calculation can be made by the following formula 4 z min 1 n i 1 n z min i where z min is the minimum monthly average water level z min i is the minimum monthly measured water level of each year and n is the number of years the calculated minimum monthly average water level was 8 93 m according to the data of the fulong water level monitoring section historically the minimum monthly average water level was 8 73 m in april 2013 the maximum monthly average water level was 9 08 m in december 2017 and the difference between the two water levels was 0 35 m aquatic living conditions method the survival conditions of aquatic organisms mainly refer to meeting the minimum water depth requirements for the survival of various aquatic organisms aquatic organisms in rivers in this region mainly include fish and aquatic plants based on the relevant research and literature the empirical value of the minimum water depth that fish and aquatic plants need to survive can be found fish the survival minimum water depth method takes the hydraulic habitat adapted by aquatic organisms as the basis for determining the appropriate water level flow rate when the water depth was used as the habitat parameter index 2 to 3 times the fish body length was selected as the minimum survival depth the zong liutang river is connected to luoma lake referring to the 37 families and 148 species of fish in the waters of luoma lake and the actual statistics of fish catches in this area for many years most of the adult fish in the zong liutang river is about 0 3 m in length according to the technical guidelines for environmental impact assessment of ecological water use low temperature water and fish passing facilities in water conservancy construction projects gosepa 2006 the related research results on fish passages the minimum water depth for survival was finally set at 0 9 m the river bottom elevation of the fulong section of 6 22 m 6 66 m and the minimum living water depth were added together to obtain the minimum living water level of 7 12 m 7 56 m aquatic plants according to the distribution characteristics of aquatic plants in plain rivers in the study area this paper comprehensively considers the growth environment needs of hygrophytes emergent plants floating leaf plants submerged plants and so on in order to obtain the appropriate water depth to meet the living environment of aquatic plants wet plants such as wild buckwheat spotted grass pampas grass etc although water loving the rhizomes and upper parts of the plants should not be immersed in water for a long time these plants can only be planted above the normal water level because the whole plant floats on the water surface the depth of water generally does not affect its normal growth and development in the same way the ecological floating island is often used to improve the quality of the river s ecological environment it is an artificial ecosystem built with aquatic plants as the main body using soilless culture technology and polymer materials as the carrier and matrix this aquatic plant ecological floating island is not limited by the river revetment nor is it restricted by the water depth in the body of water there are many kinds of emergent plants and their adaptability to water depth has a certain relationship with plant height those with tall plants have a stronger ability to adapt to water depth on the contrary the ability is less generally the water depth should not be greater than 60 cm such as for plants such as zenith flower reed reed bamboo shallot and water candle which can reach 60 cm for example the water depth of tall plants such as zaili flower reed bamboo water onion and water candle can reach 60 cm celandine and other medium to large plants are about 55 cm while jasmine cicada flower alisma narrow leaf alisma flower leaf reed cattail fluorine rush fragrant grass the water depth suitable for calamus etc varies from 10 to 30 cm observations show that lotus flowers in this area are most comfortable in water that is about 80 cm deep deeper than this it is hard for them to bloom normally or even to stay alive some rely on petiole elongation while others rely on slender stems to keep the leaves floating on the water s surface the petioles of these plants or stem and leaf sponge tissue are more developed storing a lot of air the adaptability of floating leaf plants to water depth is generally better than that of emergent plants for example the water lily is generally 0 8 m gorgon s water depth can also reach 1 5 m and the water depth of chaling and nymphae is also about 1 m when it exceeds 1 2 m it is like a submerged plant and its submerged leaves are wrinkled which can be distinguished from floating leaves which are flat papery or leathery and densely pubescent on the lower edge submerged plants are planted whose entire root system is below the surface of the water common local submerged plants include bitter grass hornwort foxtail spear thorn grass etc the water depth adaptability of submerged plants is a relatively complex issue in addition to the ecological characteristics of the plants themselves the water depth adaptability of submerged plants is also affected by two biotic factors light factor and water visibility the better the visibility of the water the stronger the light generally the submerged plants are distributed so that they can adapt to the water depth twice as much as the water visibility based on the above characteristics of the living environment of various aquatic plants and combined with the main aquatic plant species common in the rivers in the study area the adaptive water depth of aquatic plants was taken as 0 8 1 2 m and the average value was taken as 1 0 m therefore according to the river bottom elevation of the complex section the adaptive water depth obtained by the aquatic living conditions method was 7 22 m 7 66 m river landscape entertainment factor method expert evaluation public investigation and the empirical method show that rivers with only a landscape function need at least 0 3 m of water depth to meet landscape needs for water bodies that serve both landscape and entertainment needs the minimum water depth for boating is 0 7 m and the minimum water depth for swimming is 1 m results and discussion determination of ecological water level threshold in the middle reach considering the three kinds of ecological water level determination means the outsourcing value maximum value of the calculated value of the three kinds of methods can be used as the ecological water level threshold of the river in this paper for a river whose main function is urban drainage and has no special ecological needs the ecological water level should be formulated in combination with the actual conditions of its water replenishment source and the threshold value of the river s ecological water level should be reasonably determined by comprehensively considering the relevant key factors in the middle reaches of the zong liutang river the calculation results obtained by the ecological water level determination means of the above three categories and six methods are analyzed as shown in table 2 the calculated ecological water level of the fulong station section from low to high was determined by the aquatic living conditions method the minimum monthly average water level method the 90 annual minimum water level method and the wet perimeter method the water level calculated by the aquatic living condition method was low and lower than the historical minimum water level of the control section while the water level calculated by the wet perimeter method was high the water level obtained by the wet perimeter method was higher than the river bottom elevation by more than 5 m this is mainly due to the weak hydrodynamic force of the river so the change in the relationship between water level and flow was not significantly affected the applicable conditions of this method were limited therefore the water level obtained by the wet perimeter method was only for reference through the statistics of measured hydrological data and the analysis of the characteristics of hydrometeorological conditions in the study area it was found that the monthly average water level of the study river varies greatly between years and the minimum monthly average water level was vulnerable to special circumstances according to the water level calculation results in table 2 the ecological water level calculated by the 90 annual minimum water level method and the minimum monthly average water level are relatively close according to the principle of water level outsourcing value as shown in formula 5 which constitutes a multi criteria determination method considering the above situation comprehensively the calculation result of the 90 annual minimum water level method 8 96 m was selected as the ecological water level control value of the complex control section middle reaches 5 h control max h 90 h wet h min m o n t h h fish h aquatic p l a n t h landscape where h control is the river ecological water level control value h 90 is the water level obtained by the annual minimum water level method with a 90 guarantee rate h wet is the water level obtained by the wet perimeter method h min m o n t h is the water level obtained by the minimum monthly average water level method h fish is the water level obtained by the fish survival adaptation water depth method h aquatic p l a n t is the water level obtained by aquatic plants adapting to the water depth method and h landscape is the water level obtained by considering landscape entertainment factors determination of river ecological water level threshold based on the above mentioned relevant determination principles of ecological water level and the results of the calculation methods adopted combined with the target control value of the ecological water level in the first batch of river and lake ecological water levels in the province trial jpdwr 2019 issued by the jiangsu provincial department of water resources partially shown in table 3 the target value of the ecological water level of the zong liutang river the threshold of the ecological water level is 1 the ecological water level threshold of the upstream section yanghe sluice to zong liutang river sluice was 17 4 m with reference to the ecological water level of the section from liulaojian sluice to zaohe sluice in suqian ssectionof the grand canal the middle canal 2 the ecological water level threshold of the middle reaches zong liutang river sluice to miaochong rubber barrier was based on the above calculation results and the value was 8 96 m 3 in general the downstream section s ecological water level threshold value from the miaochong rubber barrier to the confluence with the huaishu river should be determined by the water depth corresponding to the huaishu river s ecological water level value 7 5 m above shuyang gate plus the river s bottom elevation near the intersection of the zong liutang river and the huaishu river however according to data analysis the bottom elevation of the lower reaches of the zong liutang river near the huaishu river was generally about 5 0 m therefore the ecological water level threshold of the lower reaches of the river can be taken as 7 5 m the water level can maintain a river depth of 2 5 m which basically meets the basic ecological water depth required by the lower reaches of the zong liutang river preventive measures analysis for the ecological water level of the zong liutang river management and control of ecological water level flow in the river engineering and non engineering measures in order to achieve the goal of ecological water level flow control of the total zong liutang river the strategy of combining engineering measures with non engineering measures must be adopted engineering measures need to take into account the actual situation of river hydrology meteorology water resources development and utilization construction of water conservancy projects and planning and designing relevant engineering projects according to local conditions however it should mainly include river dredging and remediation projects ecological function area construction projects water resources allocation and river water volume regulation projects river and lake water system connection projects ecological vegetation maintenance and soil and water conservation projects and river ecological dispatch

setting up and improving the water supply compensation mechanism strengthening the construction of regional and departmental communication and coordination mechanisms strengthening the supervision and assessment of river ecological flow implementation and strengthening the supervision of drives establish a perfect and feasible ecological flow control system under the existing water resources management and water ecological management and protection mechanisms it is objectively necessary to build a multilayer ecological flow control system including the target demand layer information base layer decision support layer and core system layer the target demand layer refers to the ecological flow control elements control subjects objectives measures etc the basic layer of ecological flow control should mainly include laws and regulations an index system standards and specifications the decision support layer refers to the paid use system of water resources the water ecological

20041,it is vital to employ efficient methods to calculate and determine the threshold of river ecological flow these methods help to get the river ecological status control countermeasures in the plain river networks and construct a flawless long term mechanism of ecological flow control water level according to the river s current environment and the actual circumstances surrounding its operation and administration the upper middle and lower reaches make up the three sections of the zong liutang river in the plain of northern jiangsu furthermore the ecological water level governing factor for each reach was analyzed and studied the ecological water level threshold in the upper and lower reaches of the zong liutang river adopted the specified values of jiangsu provincial department of water resources the threshold of the middle reach was thoroughly analyzed by using the determination method with multi criteria which consisted of the hydrological and hydraulic methods including yearly minimum water level with a 90 assured rate method wetted perimeter method minimum monthly average water level method aquatic living conditions method and river landscape entertainment factor method taking into account the hydrological and hydrodynamic characteristics observed hydrological data conditions of rivers and the actual operation rules of rivers and water projects regulations in the northern jiangsu plain through comparing and contrasting actual operation and management plans the target values of the ecological water level for the river s upper middle and lower

an ecological water level goal assurance early warning system and an ecological flow and inlet system keywords river ecological water level northern jiangsu plain threshold calculation methods determination method with multi criteria preventive measures introduction environmental flow assessments have evolved from the narrow purpose of describing flows for maintaining specific fish species to their present use as a tool in holistic catchment management richard and rafik 2003 in february 2019 the general office of the ministry of water resources in china issued a notice on the research and guaranteed work plan for the ecological flow of key rivers and lakes water volume the office sorted out a number of important river and lake sections preparing ecological flow guarantee implementation plans and evaluating the annual implementation cheng et al 2020 the minimum ecological flow water level is defined as maintaining the ecological environment function corresponding to the given ecological environmental protection goals of rivers and lakes without loss the minimum flow minimum water level that needs to be retained in the river channel is the basis for clarifying the ecological flow threshold of rivers and lakes which is crucial to the maintenance of ecosystem health in the river channel strictly controlling the ecological flow water level of rivers and lakes to ensure the safety of the regional water environment plays a positive role in effectively implementing the overall work of ecological civilization construction li et al 2019 the most important way to protect ecological flow is to keep the river s natural flow pattern as much as possible therefore the health of the river can be judged in many ways such as river hydrological change indicators and ecological flow satisfaction rates he and yin 2020 zhao et al 2019 environmental flow assessment methods fall into two categories prescriptive and interactive brown and king 2003 the commonly used calculation methods for river ecological flow water level include the hydrology method hydraulics method habitat simulation method overall method etc richter and others richter et al 1996 proposed the rva method to judge hydrological change characteristics according to different hydrological change indicators richter divided 33 hydrological parameters into five aspects comprehensive flow time frequency delay and change rate and evaluate the degree of change in the hydrological situation of the river from different perspectives at the same time on the basis of this method a variety of quantitative evaluation methods of river hydrological regime change have been extended such as the dhram method the dundee hydrological region alternation method black et al 2005 the histogram matching method hma shiau and wu 2008 etc jiang jiang et al 2014 and others used the rva method to evaluate the impact of the three gorges dam on the water regime of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river based on the observation data of seven hydrological stations in yichang hankou datong and other main streams of the yangtze river from 1980 to 2012 the research concluded that the regulation and storage of the reservoir had a greater impact on the runoff change rate and annual extreme flow and the farther away from the three gorges dam the weaker the impact gu xihui gu et al 2016 and others evaluated the overall change degree of the river hydrological process in the dongjiang river basin after being affected by the reservoir based on the overall hydrological change degree calculated by the iha index and the dhram method their research results showed that the overall change degree of important hydrological stations in the dongjiang river basin exceeded 50 and the dhram evaluation was also above medium impact ma and others ma et al 2019 proposed a river hydrological health evaluation method based on the ecological flow threshold and analyzed the basic role of ecological flow maintenance in the protection of river health huang and others huang zha and wang 2016 analyzed the ecological water level of the hydrological control sections of the main rivers in yancheng city by using the minimum living water depth 60 wet perimeter rate and 90 guarantee rate for the annual minimum water level li calculated and analyzed the minimum ecological flow of the qingjiang river through the monthly minimum ecological flow method the range of variability approach rva and the duration curve dc method li et al 2021 li obtained a suitable ecological flow of the qingjiang river in different scenarios through the monthly frequency method chu constructed a model for calculating urban rivers and lakes ecological flow and analyzing the degree of assurance musef model chu et al 2018 chu calculated the river and lake system in zhuzhou urban area quantitatively by using this model and provided the foundation for effective management and security of its ecological flow wu calculated the ecological water level of the songliao basin by applying vmf tessmann adapted and smakhtin adapted methods etc and analyzed the causes of the ecological flow deficit wu et al 2022 it has practical guiding significance for the determination and protection of ecological flow in the songliao basin dong modified the tennant method by replacing the average flow with the highest frequency of flow dong et al 2012 it is more suitable to reflect the law of flow by using the modified tennant method to calculate minimum instream ecological flow and we have more reasonable calculation results yu yu et al 2021 proposed a new optimization method an optimal method for the phased habitat demand omphd of key species by using relevant formulas the hydrodynamic and fish effective habitats were calculated and simulated the index gdi was introduced determining the ecological flow in the downstream dehydration section of the diversion small hydropower station wang wang et al 2019 developed a new approach for estimating the ecological flow of fish overwintering in plain rivers this method played an important role in modeling fish spawning habitats and the ecological flow of the target fish throughout its life cycle can be determined in recent years the river network area of the north jiangsu plain has implemented the renovation and reconstruction plan of the river water system in the region on a large scale although the landscape construction of rivers and lakes has been strengthened some aquatic organisms have been restored however local areas or river sections place a lot of emphasis on the urban landscape also the standardized development and utilization behavior based on the organic combination of river and lake water system connectivity and ecological functions has not been sufficiently deepened the hardening of the banks of the river network and changes in the characteristics of the riverside wetlands also lead to the deterioration of the aquatic ecosystem to some extent the reduction of biodiversity the weakening of the ecological stability of the system and the strength of the normal river network hydrodynamics are still insufficient in addition water conservancy projects such as the dam sluice gate and pump stations on the river channel play the functions of drainage and irrigation flood control and water supply in terms of water resource utilization dams are also considered one of the most important pillars of economic development including food security hydropower generation water supply and irrigation and mitigating drought and floods rafik and richard 2009 the dam sluice gate and pump stations also change the natural flow state of the river into an artificial flow state reducing the connectivity of the river and the channel the regulation and storage of the river interfere with the natural water cycle process of the river causing the disappearance of some biological communities in the river and causing serious water pollution and ecosystem health problems ge 2019 zuo and liang 2016 therefore it is necessary to use effective methods for calculating the river s ecological flow threshold water level based on a complete analysis of the situation and challenges of environmental flow control in the normal river network according to the overall route of river and lake ecological flow management and control in the new era special long term measures should be taken to enhance the management and control of the ecological flow of rivers the zong liutang river in the northern jiangsu plain is the research area considering the actual situation of river ecological flow water level management the corresponding environmental water level threshold will be determined by the subsection design method the comprehensive calculation the relevant methods and measures for targeted management and control of the river s environmental water level flow will be analyzed to provide technical and reference support to further enhance the environmental flow assurance of rivers and lakes in the study area materials and methods study area the zong liutang river is located in suqian city jiangsu province china with geographical coordinates of 118 16 31 east longitude and 37 57 48 north latitude its basin belongs to a typical plain river network area with vertical and horizontal channels and flat terrain and the river network is highly developed the river starts at the yanghe gate ends at the huaishu river and intersects with huaishu river horizontally after crossing the huaishu river the zong liutang river joins with the guanhe river and flows into the yellow sea the zong liutang river is the main river channel for regional waterlogging drainage in the yinan region it undertakes the tasks of waterlogging drainage and irrigation in suyu district and siyang county the total length of the river channel is 76 km and the drainage area is 691 km2 fig 1 the suqian water resources bulletin shows that the city s annual average precipitation is 909 6 mm and the annual distribution is uneven on average about 68 of the annual rainfall is concentrated in may to september in terms of the characteristics of the river section most of the rivers in the plain river network area where the zong liutang river is located have low velocity and calm water surfaces the distribution of gates and dams along the river will regulate the water volume in the river therefore the total zong liutang river has low velocity and flow and the measured flow data is too small to be used as a calculation reference the upstream section of the zong liutang river is connected to the beijing hangzhou grand canal through the zong liutang river sluice all year round so the water level of the upstream section is equal to that of suqian s section of the grand canal called the middle canal the downstream section of the river intersects with the huaishu river horizontally so the water level of the downstream section is the same as that of the huaishu river there were three hydrological monitoring stations along the zong liutang river namely yanghe gate hydrological station xiangzhuang hydrological station and fulong hydrological station yanghe gate hydrological station has some discharge observation data xiangzhuang hydrological station and fulong hydrological station have water level data according to the analysis of the collected measured water level data of yanghe gate xiangzhuang hydrological station and fulong hydrological station the hydrological monitoring data of yanghe gate hydrological station and fulong hydrological station began in 2013 but the water level data of xiangzhuang hydrological station has a short duration since 2019 for a long time the hydrologic observation data of the studied river in most periods of the year such as flow and velocity had little change except for the flood season with large rainfall in some years the monitored flow is almost zero therefore the local hydrologic monitoring department can only selectively carry out regular hydrologic measurement on rivers which leads to that the hydrologic monitoring data of rivers are not very long the hydrological data used by the present research is all the data that can be collected but it can basically meet the calculation requirements of the hydrological and hydraulic methods in the study work methodology sectional design for calculation of river ecological water level based on the current operation and management of the river it was found that the upstream section of the zong liutang river is connected withsuqian ssectionofthe beijing hangzhou grandcanal all year round the relevant water diversion station can regulate and store the water source of the grand canal into the zong liutang river therefore the limit of the ecological water level of suqian ssectionof the grand canal could be adopted as the ecological water level threshold of the upper reaches of the zong liutang river fig 2 shows hydraulic connection between upstream of zongliutang river and middle canal in the upstream section through connection channel and link culvert zongliutang river maintains the same water level as the middle canal the lower reaches of the zong liutang river starting from the miaochong rubber dam on the river intersect the huaishu river horizontally shown as fig 2 so the water level of the lower reaches is equal to that of the huaishu river tosummarize in combination with the first batch of specified ecological water levels of rivers and lakes in jiangsu province trial jpdwr 2019 the zong liutang river sluice and miaochong rubber sluice are taken as subsection points the total zong liutang river is divided into the upper reaches yanghe sluice gate zong liutang river sluice the river length is 6 km the middle reaches zong liutang river sluice miaochong rubber sluice river length 33 km and the downstream section miaochong rubber dam intersection point with huaishu river river length 37 km to calculate the ecological water level flow and analyze the management and control measures in 2019 the water resources department of jiangsu province issued the management regulations of the first batch of ecological water levels of rivers and lakes in jiangsu province trial in which the target control values of ecological water levels of all key rivers and lakes in jiangsu province were specified the upstream and downstream of zongliutang river are hydraulically connected with the relevant key rivers in the regulation so their ecological control water level needs to meet the requirements of the regulation consequently the ecological level for the upstream section and downstream section were determined according to the first batch of ecological water levels of rivers and lakes in jiangsu province trial in principle the ecological water level thresholds of the upstream section were based on the ecological water level limit of the upper section of the liulaojian gate in the suqian ssectionof the grand canal from the zaohe gate to the liulaojian gate specified by the first batch of river and lake ecological water levels in jiangsu province trial jpdwr 2019 the ecological water level value of downstream sections was determined by the upstream level limit of shuyang gate in the huaishu river the water level at the junction of the zong liutang river and the huaishu river could be calculated from the ecologically controlled water depth at the shuyang gate therefore the focal point of research is to figure out and analyze the control value of the ecological water level in the middle reaches of the zong liutang river the calculation of the threshold value of the ecological water level in the middle reaches was based on the hydrological and ecological data from the monitoring section of the fulong station calculation and determination of ecological water level in the middle reaches the rivers in the river network area of the north jiangsu plain have typical characteristics such as calm river surface small flow and velocity in the river channel and generally weak river hydrodynamics due to the characteristics of river basins in various regions the situation of water collecting areas is complex and the real time hydrological survey data of many rivers in the study area is limited generally the traditional and conventional calculation methods of river ecological flow cannot be used and the calculation method of lake ecological water level was used to complete the relevant calculation work chen et al 2017 at the same time considering the application of traditional river ecological flow calculation methods the ecological water level threshold of the zong liutang river will be calculated by using the water level data of yanghe sluice gate and fulong hydrological station over the years given the river flow characteristics within the scope of suqian city and referring to the relevant calculation methods in the relevant plain river ecological water level flow analysis literature various methods can be used to calculate ecological flow this paper selects three kinds of means the hydrological and hydraulic method including 90 annual minimum water level wet perimeter method and minimum monthly average water level aquatic living conditions method and river landscape entertainment factor method focused on the analysis of the ecological water level of the control section in the middle reaches of the zong liutang river the above three methods belong to different methodologies and have different calculation principles applicable conditions and calculation technologies however it is reliable to comprehensively apply them to the selected research area and research objectives in the paper and form a multi principal procedure to determine the river s ecological water level hydrological and hydraulic method 90 annual minimum water level method the minimum water level method with representative frequency 90 is to deduce the corresponding characteristic value based on the fitting and wiring of the long series of daily average water level empirical points through the review of the representativeness reliability and consistency of the hydrological data of fulong hydrological station in the middle reaches the daily water level series data of the hydrological station from april 2013 to september 2020 were selected for analysis through the empirical frequency calculation and analysis of the daily water level series it was found that the pearson iii which is p iii curve is suitable for fitting its empirical frequency curve the corresponding water level at different frequencies can be obtained from the fitted theoretical curve the formula for calculating the empirical frequency of the daily water level series is 1 p m n d 1 where m is the descending order of the daily average water level and n d is the sample capacity the three main statistical characteristic parameters of the p iii curve are the series mean value x the skewness coefficient c s distribution and the variation coefficient c v according to the fitted statistical characteristic curve and the determined frequency p the water level characteristic value of the corresponding frequency can be calculated by using the following formula 2 x p φ p c v 1 x k p x where φ p is the calculation parameter of the p iii curve k p the modulus coefficient x p the characteristic value of the water level corresponding to a specific frequency according to the hydrological data of the hydrological station arranged on the total zong liutang river the ecological water level of the control section of the zong liutang river s uplift was analyzed by using the annual minimum water level with a frequency of 90 fig 3 shows the water level frequency curve drawn according to the data of fulong hydrological station the calculation results are shown in table 1 according to the analysis of the drawn water level frequency curve under the best fitting conditions most of the empirical points fall on the theoretical frequency curve and the fitting degree was as high as 0 9843 therefore the water level value corresponding to 90 of the frequency of the section of fulong hydrological station was 8 96 m this elevation is based on the base level of the abandoned yellow river which following as the same wet perimeter method according to the measured cross section and the daily water level monitoring data of fulong hydrological station after the above review first calculated the water depth and multiply it by the slope coefficient to obtain the slope width when calculating it should be noted that the section was a compound section and the water depth corresponds to different water levels the side slope coefficients were different so a subdivision calculation was required then the length of the side slope was calculated by using the formula for the side length of the right triangle finally the wet perimeter corresponding to the water level was calculated by adding the width of the slope bottom the quantity relationship between the wet perimeter and the river s flow was calculated by the manning formula 3 q s n a 5 3 p 2 3 in the formula q is the instantaneous flow of the section m3 s n is the roughness coefficient s is the gradient of the channel p is the wet circumference m a is the cross sectional area of the water m2 the data from the same fulong hydrological station water level series used in the 90 annual minimum water level method were analyzed and a relationship curve was drawn using the calculated wet perimeter data and the water level monitoring data the inflection points on the wet perimeter water level relationship curve was 115 76 11 69 so when the wet perimeter was 115 76 m the corresponding water level was the required ecological water level of 11 69 m fig 4 shows the relationship between a wet perimeter and the water level of the zong liutang river this relationship was found by doing calculations and analyzing the data at fulong hydrological station minimum monthly average water level method the minimum monthly average water level method takes the multi year average value of the minimum monthly average measured water level as the basic ecological water level of the river the calculation can be made by the following formula 4 z min 1 n i 1 n z min i where z min is the minimum monthly average water level z min i is the minimum monthly measured water level of each year and n is the number of years the calculated minimum monthly average water level was 8 93 m according to the data of the fulong water level monitoring section historically the minimum monthly average water level was 8 73 m in april 2013 the maximum monthly average water level was 9 08 m in december 2017 and the difference between the two water levels was 0 35 m aquatic living conditions method the survival conditions of aquatic organisms mainly refer to meeting the minimum water depth requirements for the survival of various aquatic organisms aquatic organisms in rivers in this region mainly include fish and aquatic plants based on the relevant research and literature the empirical value of the minimum water depth that fish and aquatic plants need to survive can be found fish the survival minimum water depth method takes the hydraulic habitat adapted by aquatic organisms as the basis for determining the appropriate water level flow rate when the water depth was used as the habitat parameter index 2 to 3 times the fish body length was selected as the minimum survival depth the zong liutang river is connected to luoma lake referring to the 37 families and 148 species of fish in the waters of luoma lake and the actual statistics of fish catches in this area for many years most of the adult fish in the zong liutang river is about 0 3 m in length according to the technical guidelines for environmental impact assessment of ecological water use low temperature water and fish passing facilities in water conservancy construction projects gosepa 2006 the related research results on fish passages the minimum water depth for survival was finally set at 0 9 m the river bottom elevation of the fulong section of 6 22 m 6 66 m and the minimum living water depth were added together to obtain the minimum living water level of 7 12 m 7 56 m aquatic plants according to the distribution characteristics of aquatic plants in plain rivers in the study area this paper comprehensively considers the growth environment needs of hygrophytes emergent plants floating leaf plants submerged plants and so on in order to obtain the appropriate water depth to meet the living environment of aquatic plants wet plants such as wild buckwheat spotted grass pampas grass etc although water loving the rhizomes and upper parts of the plants should not be immersed in water for a long time these plants can only be planted above the normal water level because the whole plant floats on the water surface the depth of water generally does not affect its normal growth and development in the same way the ecological floating island is often used to improve the quality of the river s ecological environment it is an artificial ecosystem built with aquatic plants as the main body using soilless culture technology and polymer materials as the carrier and matrix this aquatic plant ecological floating island is not limited by the river revetment nor is it restricted by the water depth in the body of water there are many kinds of emergent plants and their adaptability to water depth has a certain relationship with plant height those with tall plants have a stronger ability to adapt to water depth on the contrary the ability is less generally the water depth should not be greater than 60 cm such as for plants such as zenith flower reed reed bamboo shallot and water candle which can reach 60 cm for example the water depth of tall plants such as zaili flower reed bamboo water onion and water candle can reach 60 cm celandine and other medium to large plants are about 55 cm while jasmine cicada flower alisma narrow leaf alisma flower leaf reed cattail fluorine rush fragrant grass the water depth suitable for calamus etc varies from 10 to 30 cm observations show that lotus flowers in this area are most comfortable in water that is about 80 cm deep deeper than this it is hard for them to bloom normally or even to stay alive some rely on petiole elongation while others rely on slender stems to keep the leaves floating on the water s surface the petioles of these plants or stem and leaf sponge tissue are more developed storing a lot of air the adaptability of floating leaf plants to water depth is generally better than that of emergent plants for example the water lily is generally 0 8 m gorgon s water depth can also reach 1 5 m and the water depth of chaling and nymphae is also about 1 m when it exceeds 1 2 m it is like a submerged plant and its submerged leaves are wrinkled which can be distinguished from floating leaves which are flat papery or leathery and densely pubescent on the lower edge submerged plants are planted whose entire root system is below the surface of the water common local submerged plants include bitter grass hornwort foxtail spear thorn grass etc the water depth adaptability of submerged plants is a relatively complex issue in addition to the ecological characteristics of the plants themselves the water depth adaptability of submerged plants is also affected by two biotic factors light factor and water visibility the better the visibility of the water the stronger the light generally the submerged plants are distributed so that they can adapt to the water depth twice as much as the water visibility based on the above characteristics of the living environment of various aquatic plants and combined with the main aquatic plant species common in the rivers in the study area the adaptive water depth of aquatic plants was taken as 0 8 1 2 m and the average value was taken as 1 0 m therefore according to the river bottom elevation of the complex section the adaptive water depth obtained by the aquatic living conditions method was 7 22 m 7 66 m river landscape entertainment factor method expert evaluation public investigation and the empirical method show that rivers with only a landscape function need at least 0 3 m of water depth to meet landscape needs for water bodies that serve both landscape and entertainment needs the minimum water depth for boating is 0 7 m and the minimum water depth for swimming is 1 m results and discussion determination of ecological water level threshold in the middle reach considering the three kinds of ecological water level determination means the outsourcing value maximum value of the calculated value of the three kinds of methods can be used as the ecological water level threshold of the river in this paper for a river whose main function is urban drainage and has no special ecological needs the ecological water level should be formulated in combination with the actual conditions of its water replenishment source and the threshold value of the river s ecological water level should be reasonably determined by comprehensively considering the relevant key factors in the middle reaches of the zong liutang river the calculation results obtained by the ecological water level determination means of the above three categories and six methods are analyzed as shown in table 2 the calculated ecological water level of the fulong station section from low to high was determined by the aquatic living conditions method the minimum monthly average water level method the 90 annual minimum water level method and the wet perimeter method the water level calculated by the aquatic living condition method was low and lower than the historical minimum water level of the control section while the water level calculated by the wet perimeter method was high the water level obtained by the wet perimeter method was higher than the river bottom elevation by more than 5 m this is mainly due to the weak hydrodynamic force of the river so the change in the relationship between water level and flow was not significantly affected the applicable conditions of this method were limited therefore the water level obtained by the wet perimeter method was only for reference through the statistics of measured hydrological data and the analysis of the characteristics of hydrometeorological conditions in the study area it was found that the monthly average water level of the study river varies greatly between years and the minimum monthly average water level was vulnerable to special circumstances according to the water level calculation results in table 2 the ecological water level calculated by the 90 annual minimum water level method and the minimum monthly average water level are relatively close according to the principle of water level outsourcing value as shown in formula 5 which constitutes a multi criteria determination method considering the above situation comprehensively the calculation result of the 90 annual minimum water level method 8 96 m was selected as the ecological water level control value of the complex control section middle reaches 5 h control max h 90 h wet h min m o n t h h fish h aquatic p l a n t h landscape where h control is the river ecological water level control value h 90 is the water level obtained by the annual minimum water level method with a 90 guarantee rate h wet is the water level obtained by the wet perimeter method h min m o n t h is the water level obtained by the minimum monthly average water level method h fish is the water level obtained by the fish survival adaptation water depth method h aquatic p l a n t is the water level obtained by aquatic plants adapting to the water depth method and h landscape is the water level obtained by considering landscape entertainment factors determination of river ecological water level threshold based on the above mentioned relevant determination principles of ecological water level and the results of the calculation methods adopted combined with the target control value of the ecological water level in the first batch of river and lake ecological water levels in the province trial jpdwr 2019 issued by the jiangsu provincial department of water resources partially shown in table 3 the target value of the ecological water level of the zong liutang river the threshold of the ecological water level is 1 the ecological water level threshold of the upstream section yanghe sluice to zong liutang river sluice was 17 4 m with reference to the ecological water level of the section from liulaojian sluice to zaohe sluice in suqian ssectionof the grand canal the middle canal 2 the ecological water level threshold of the middle reaches zong liutang river sluice to miaochong rubber barrier was based on the above calculation results and the value was 8 96 m 3 in general the downstream section s ecological water level threshold value from the miaochong rubber barrier to the confluence with the huaishu river should be determined by the water depth corresponding to the huaishu river s ecological water level value 7 5 m above shuyang gate plus the river s bottom elevation near the intersection of the zong liutang river and the huaishu river however according to data analysis the bottom elevation of the lower reaches of the zong liutang river near the huaishu river was generally about 5 0 m therefore the ecological water level threshold of the lower reaches of the river can be taken as 7 5 m the water level can maintain a river depth of 2 5 m which basically meets the basic ecological water depth required by the lower reaches of the zong liutang river preventive measures analysis for the ecological water level of the zong liutang river management and control of ecological water level flow in the river engineering and non engineering measures in order to achieve the goal of ecological water level flow control of the total zong liutang river the strategy of combining engineering measures with non engineering measures must be adopted engineering measures need to take into account the actual situation of river hydrology meteorology water resources development and utilization construction of water conservancy projects and planning and designing relevant engineering projects according to local conditions however it should mainly include river dredging and remediation projects ecological function area construction projects water resources allocation and river water volume regulation projects river and lake water system connection projects ecological vegetation maintenance and soil and water conservation projects and river ecological dispatch monitoring system engineering etc non engineering measures include strictly regulating river water volume according to laws and regulations improving the river connection control and adjustment system setting up and improving the water supply compensation mechanism strengthening the construction of regional and departmental communication and coordination mechanisms strengthening the supervision and assessment of river ecological flow implementation and strengthening the supervision of drives establish a perfect and feasible ecological flow control system under the existing water resources management and water ecological management and protection mechanisms it is objectively necessary to build a multilayer ecological flow control system including the target demand layer information base layer decision support layer and core system layer the target demand layer refers to the ecological flow control elements control subjects objectives measures etc the basic layer of ecological flow control should mainly include laws and regulations an index system standards and specifications the decision support layer refers to the paid use system of water resources the water ecological compensation system and other systems that play a decision making supporting role in the management and control of ecological flow the construction of the core system layer should be guided by the target demand and adhere to the principle of always running the system guarantee through the whole process of ecological flow control quan 2019 establish a long term mechanism for ensuring river ecological flow efforts will be made to build a modern management and control system for the ecological flow of major rivers and lakes in suqian city and to grasp the ecological flow security of the main control sections of the river in real time so as to effectively protect the ecological health of the river to increase awareness of ecological civilization and the protection of river and lake

countermeasures in the development of wetlands in beijing 2 survey methodology we collected history data of wetland conservation in beijing statistical yearbook and beijing water resources bulletin to reveal the co evolutions of wetland and society in beijing 1950 2020 we also did individual interview to find characteristics in beijing through interviews with wetland protection personnel at different department we can understand the current problems and solutions of wetlands in beijing 3 status of wetland resources in beijing beijing is located in the north of china the city has 16 districts with a total area of 16 410 54 square kilometers according to the data of the seventh census by 2020 the permanent resident population of beijing was over 21 million and the gdp in 2020 of this city was 582 3 billion 109 the weather is warm mean temperature 25 and rainy mean rainfall 138 mm in the summer june september while it is cold mean temperature 7 and dry mean rainfall 0 mm in the winter december march in this section we analyzed the structure and function of wetlands in beijing as well as the current wetland protection conditions 3 1 structure of wetlands in beijing the structure of a wetland is characterized by the organization of both biotic and abiotic components this includes the distribution of energy in our environment it also includes the climatic conditions prevailing in that particular environment beijing is relatively rich in wetland resources with more than 200 rivers of all sizes throughout its territory with the rapid increase in its population and urbanization beijing s urban construction land has expanded dramatically and land types have changed leading to a gradual shrinkage and degradation of beijing s wetlands some of which have become the source of sand and dust liu et al 2018 from 1950 to 2015 the wetland area in beijing shrank by 205 400 ha with rice fields and marsh wetlands shrinking most significantly table 1 beijing s wetland area reached 256 800 ha in 1950 and by 1984 it was 76 560 ha wong et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 survey results as of 2015 showed that the total area of wetlands in beijing over 1 ha was 51 400 ha accounting for 3 06 of the total area of beijing https www gov cn xinwen 2019 09 15 content 5430017 htm currently wetland patches in beijing are small and scattered the urban center area is mainly scattered with park and linear artificial wetlands and the suburbs are mainly for example river wetlands water storage areas and ponds beijing s wetlands are dominated by five major water systems for example the yongding chaobai and beiyun rivers as well as more than 20 large and medium sized reservoirs the large wetlands include miyun reservoir yeyahu wetland and hanshiqiao wetland jia et al 2011 zhu et al 2011 sun et al 2012 wetland water resources are highly exploited and used for all aspects of urban drinking water industrial water agricultural cultivation and irrigation and environmental water in beijing wang et al 2017 additionally beijing requires large amounts of water resources because of the annual increase in urban grassland and woodland and because of the expansion of lakes and rivers ecological demand water will increase significantly for the development of eco city ma et al 2015 data from the beijing water authority show that from 2005 to 2019 the city s total annual water consumption increased from 3 45 billion m3 to 4 167 billion m3 and water used for ecological purposes increased from 114 million m3 to 1 466 billion m3 including 1 353 billion m3 for river and lake recharge and 113 million m3 for sanitation and greening additionally the annual water consumption of water in beijing from 2012 to 2019 also shows fig 1 that the residential domestic water consumption reached 1 524 million m3 of new water in 2019 with the second highest proportion of water used for ecological purposes at 398 million m3 https tjj beijing gov cn the water resources are managed by the beijing water authority while the all the wetlands in beijing are managed by the beijing s municipal forestry and parks bureau both of them belong to the people s government of beijing municipality the beijing water authority is in charge of water resources allocation including domestic and industrial water supply flood regulation in the flood season some wetlands may receive peak flow beijing s urban wetland restoration which issues related to site hydrology landscape position and regulatory requirements is in the development stage additionally problems have occurred in the restoration process for example reduced biodiversity increased water pollution and an increased urban heat island effect caused by using inappropriate treatment measures such as cement berm lining duan et al 2011 3 2 function of beijing wetland the functions of wetlands include 1 it regulates the essential ecological processes supports life systems and renders stability 2 it is also responsible for the cycling of nutrients between biotic and abiotic components 3 it maintains a balance among the various trophic levels in the ecosystem 4 it cycles the minerals through the biosphere 5 the abiotic components help in the synthesis of organic components that involves the exchange of energy 3 2 1 ecological service functions of urban wetland development the ecological service functions of urban wetland development are climate regulation environmental improvement and biodiversity support zhu et al 2011 beijing s wetlands have a significant urban cold island effect which can effectively improve the microclimate of the surrounding environment and the microclimate regulation effect has a significant correlation with wetland area xu et al 2013 data from 2012 showed that the average temperature of wetlands in beijing is 28 33 c which is lower than the average temperature of the greenbelt 28 43 c and the average temperature of the city 31 82 c sun et al 2012 the total area of wetlands in beijing is approximately 58 700 ha according to the starting adjusted area of 1 ha accounting for 3 6 of the city s land area zhang et al 2017 the city s wetlands provide habitat for nearly 50 of beijing s plants and 75 6 of its wildlife making them a key area for biodiversity conservation in beijing beijing s wetlands contain 1020 plant species and 202 vertebrate species including 107 bird species 77 fish species 8 amphibian species 9 reptile species and 1 mammal species wetlands are also home to many endangered species and as an important genetic reservoir protecting wetland ecosystems is an essential step toward biodiversity conservation the ecological service function of urban wetlands is an indirect service function created for socioeconomic systems and based on the provision of wetland water wildlife and other resources duan et al 2011 3 2 2 economic service functions of urban wetland development among the many wetlands in beijing the net economic benefit of one acre of phragmites australis land is approximately rmb 400 per year and the indirect economic benefit of one acre of lotus root is approximately rmb 1200 per year 2009 data beijing s agriculture fisheries pastoralism and secondary production depend on the natural resources provided by wetlands and the use of wetland flora and fauna resources also indirectly contributes to the development of processing industries the main food supplied by the wetlands is rice most of the rice fields in beijing are in areas close to water sources e g rivers canals reservoirs such as the baihe river and the yongding river the so called dragon king s land where the jingxi rice in liulangzhuang is irrigated by spring water from yuquan mountain and xishan mountain fish is the largest wetland biological resource in beijing s wetland economic output the total area of reservoir wetlands involved in aquaculture in beijing is approximately 72 km2 84 6 of which is distributed in changping shunyi tongzhou daxing and pinggu the area of freshwater aquaculture in beijing in the first half of 2010 was 57 09 km2 including 45 46 km2 of ponds this wetland resource ensures an effective supply of aquatic products production in beijing wetland fishery products provide a large source of food for the livelihood of beijing residents and create an important economic value in 2017 the output of aquatic products in beijing was approximately 45 100 tons and the total output value of fisheries was approximately rmb 961 million accounting for 3 1 of the city s total agricultural output value beijing municipal bureau of statistics et al 2018 3 2 3 social service functions of urban wetland development the social service functions of urban wetlands are divided into leisure and entertainment and cultural construction vierikko and niemelä 2016 the functions of wetlands are natural sightseeing tourism and leisure additionally beautiful natural scenery has become an ideal destination for sightseeing vacations recuperation and provides conditions for tourism development wetland landscape has two functions firstly wetlands can develop ecotourism optimize industrial structure increase employment stimulate the economic development of local and surrounding areas and improve the living standards of local residents secondly it also can provide residents with the opportunity to experience and enjoy wetlands expanding the impact of wetlands on the public and fulfilling the spiritual and cultural needs of residents wetland tourism can also enhance social influence and urban competitiveness and promote the rapid development of economic construction the construction of beijing wetland park will provide many ecological functions for society such as wetland protection ecotourism and environmental publicity and education beijing wetland park also contributes significantly to tourism making tourism income an important part of the income of local residents the complex system composition and biodiversity of beijing s wetlands provide a natural place to explore wetlands and conduct natural experiences or educational activities cuihu wetland park regularly holds science activities with rich themes including bird watching recognizing plants and learning wetland functions the activities are oriented toward young people and advocate every one approach understand and protect wetlands by providing professional explanations and various activities we can increase the awareness of protecting natural wetlands and science popularization can be realized 3 3 protection list of wetlands in beijing the people s government of beijing municipality announced the first list of local provincial protected wetlands in 2016 35 of which are in beijing in 2020 12 wetlands were added to the list fig 2 those wetlands were distributed in 15 of the 16 districts of beijing miyun and huairou districts each have six wetlands followed by haidian and fangshan districts notably 78 57 of protected wetlands are distributed on the northwest side of beijing the western mountain of beijing is part of the taihang mountains and the jundu mountain in north beijing is part of the yanshan mountain range the highest peak is dongling mountain in mentougou district west beijing with an altitude of 2303 m the lowest ground is the southeast boundary of tongzhou district thus the northwest mountain area is the main water yield zone beijing has five natural rivers the juma yongding beiyun chaobai and ji rivers all originate from the mountains in the northwest and run to the southeast additionally the protected wetlands contain all the wetland types in beijing and include 10 lakes 3 marshes 24 reservoirs and 10 rivers 4 problems and countermeasures in the development of wetlands in beijing 4 1 problems of wetlands in beijing 4 1 1 limited resource space shortage of water resources and difficulty in land type conversion beijing is a resource based metropolis experiencing a serious water deficit wu et al 2017 it relies on water replenishment year round within the city the utilization rate of rain and flood is less than 30 and the utilization rate of reclaimed water is low in recent years the decrease in inbound water volume and the deterioration of water quality have become main reasons for the shrinkage of beijing s wetland area ma et al 2015 spatial factors are

the winter december march in this section we analyzed the structure and function of wetlands in beijing as well as the current wetland protection conditions 3 1 structure of wetlands in beijing the structure of a wetland is characterized by the organization of both biotic and abiotic components this includes the distribution of energy in our environment it also includes the climatic conditions prevailing in that particular environment beijing is relatively rich in wetland resources with more than 200 rivers of all sizes throughout its territory with the rapid increase in its population and urbanization beijing s urban construction land has expanded dramatically and land types have changed leading to a gradual shrinkage and degradation of beijing s wetlands some of which have become the source of sand and dust liu et al 2018 from 1950 to 2015 the wetland area in beijing shrank by 205 400 ha with rice fields and marsh wetlands shrinking most significantly table 1 beijing s wetland area reached 256 800 ha in 1950 and by 1984 it was 76 560 ha wong et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 survey results as of 2015 showed that the total area of wetlands in beijing over 1 ha was 51 400 ha accounting for 3 06 of the total area of beijing https www gov cn xinwen 2019 09 15 content 5430017 htm currently wetland patches in beijing are small and scattered the urban center area is mainly scattered with park and linear artificial wetlands and the suburbs are mainly for example river wetlands water storage areas and ponds beijing s wetlands are dominated by five major water systems for example the yongding chaobai and beiyun rivers as well as more than 20 large and medium sized reservoirs the large wetlands include miyun reservoir yeyahu wetland and hanshiqiao wetland jia et al 2011 zhu et al 2011 sun et al 2012 wetland water resources are highly exploited and used for all aspects of urban drinking water industrial water agricultural cultivation and irrigation and environmental water in beijing wang et al 2017 additionally beijing requires large amounts of water resources because of the annual increase in urban grassland and woodland and because of the expansion of lakes and rivers ecological demand water will increase significantly for the development of eco city ma et al 2015 data from the beijing water authority show that from 2005 to 2019 the city s total annual water consumption increased from 3 45 billion m3 to 4 167 billion m3 and water used for ecological purposes increased from 114 million m3 to 1 466 billion m3 including 1 353 billion m3 for river and lake recharge and 113 million m3 for sanitation and greening additionally the annual water consumption of water in beijing from 2012 to 2019 also shows fig 1 that the residential domestic water consumption reached 1 524 million m3 of new water in 2019 with the second highest proportion of water used for ecological purposes at 398 million m3 https tjj beijing gov cn the water resources are managed by the beijing water authority while the all the wetlands in beijing are managed by the beijing s municipal forestry and parks bureau both of them belong to the people s government of beijing municipality the beijing water authority is in charge of water resources allocation including domestic and industrial water supply flood regulation in the flood season some wetlands may receive peak flow beijing s urban wetland restoration which issues related to site hydrology landscape position and regulatory requirements is in the development stage additionally problems have occurred in the restoration process for example reduced biodiversity increased water pollution and an increased urban heat island effect caused by using inappropriate treatment measures such as cement berm lining duan et al 2011 3 2 function of beijing wetland the functions of wetlands include 1 it regulates the essential ecological processes supports life systems and renders stability 2 it is also responsible for the cycling of nutrients between biotic and abiotic components 3 it maintains a balance among the various trophic levels in the ecosystem 4 it cycles the minerals through the biosphere 5 the abiotic components help in the synthesis of organic components that involves the exchange of energy 3 2 1 ecological service functions of urban wetland development the ecological service functions of urban wetland development are climate regulation environmental improvement and biodiversity support zhu et al 2011 beijing s wetlands have a significant urban cold island effect which can effectively improve the microclimate of the surrounding environment and the microclimate regulation effect has a significant correlation with wetland area xu et al 2013 data from 2012 showed that the average temperature of wetlands in beijing is 28 33 c which is lower than the average temperature of the greenbelt 28 43 c and the average temperature of the city 31 82 c sun et al 2012 the total area of wetlands in beijing is approximately 58 700 ha according to the starting adjusted area of 1 ha accounting for 3 6 of the city s land area zhang et al 2017 the city s wetlands provide habitat for nearly 50 of beijing s plants and 75 6 of its wildlife making them a key area for biodiversity conservation in beijing beijing s wetlands contain 1020 plant species and 202 vertebrate species including 107 bird species 77 fish species 8 amphibian species 9 reptile species and 1 mammal species wetlands are also home to many endangered species and as an important genetic reservoir protecting wetland ecosystems is an essential step toward biodiversity conservation the ecological service function of urban wetlands is an indirect service function created for socioeconomic systems and based on the provision of wetland water wildlife and other resources duan et al 2011 3 2 2 economic service functions of urban wetland development among the many wetlands in beijing the net economic benefit of one acre of phragmites australis land is approximately rmb 400 per year and the indirect economic benefit of one acre of lotus root is approximately rmb 1200 per year 2009 data beijing s agriculture fisheries pastoralism and secondary production depend on the natural resources provided by wetlands and the use of wetland flora and fauna resources also indirectly contributes to the development of processing industries the main food supplied by the wetlands is rice most of the rice fields in beijing are in areas close to water sources e g rivers canals reservoirs such as the baihe river and the yongding river the so called dragon king s land where the jingxi rice in liulangzhuang is irrigated by spring water from yuquan mountain and xishan mountain fish is the largest wetland biological resource in beijing s wetland economic output the total area of reservoir wetlands involved in aquaculture in beijing is approximately 72 km2 84 6 of which is distributed in changping shunyi tongzhou daxing and pinggu the area of freshwater aquaculture in beijing in the first half of 2010 was 57 09 km2 including 45 46 km2 of ponds this wetland resource ensures an effective supply of aquatic products production in beijing wetland fishery products provide a large source of food for the livelihood of beijing residents and create an important economic value in 2017 the output of aquatic products in beijing was approximately 45 100 tons and the total output value of fisheries was approximately rmb 961 million accounting for 3 1 of the city s total agricultural output value beijing municipal bureau of statistics et al 2018 3 2 3 social service functions of urban wetland development the social service functions of urban wetlands are divided into leisure and entertainment and cultural construction vierikko and niemelä 2016 the functions of wetlands are natural sightseeing tourism and leisure additionally beautiful natural scenery has become an ideal destination for sightseeing vacations recuperation and provides conditions for tourism development wetland landscape has two functions firstly wetlands can develop ecotourism optimize industrial structure increase employment stimulate the economic development of local and surrounding areas and improve the living standards of local residents secondly it also can provide residents with the opportunity to experience and enjoy wetlands expanding the impact of wetlands on the public and fulfilling the spiritual and cultural needs of residents wetland tourism can also enhance social influence and urban competitiveness and promote the rapid development of economic construction the construction of beijing wetland park will provide many ecological functions for society such as wetland protection ecotourism and environmental publicity and education beijing wetland park also contributes significantly to tourism making tourism income an important part of the income of local residents the complex system composition and biodiversity of beijing s wetlands provide a natural place to explore wetlands and conduct natural experiences or educational activities cuihu wetland park regularly holds science activities with rich themes including bird watching recognizing plants and learning wetland functions the activities are oriented toward young people and advocate every one approach understand and protect wetlands by providing professional explanations and various activities we can increase the awareness of protecting natural wetlands and science popularization can be realized 3 3 protection list of wetlands in beijing the people s government of beijing municipality announced the first list of local provincial protected wetlands in 2016 35 of which are in beijing in 2020 12 wetlands were added to the list fig 2 those wetlands were distributed in 15 of the 16 districts of beijing miyun and huairou districts each have six wetlands followed by haidian and fangshan districts notably 78 57 of protected wetlands are distributed on the northwest side of beijing the western mountain of beijing is part of the taihang mountains and the jundu mountain in north beijing is part of the yanshan mountain range the highest peak is dongling mountain in mentougou district west beijing with an altitude of 2303 m the lowest ground is the southeast boundary of tongzhou district thus the northwest mountain area is the main water yield zone beijing has five natural rivers the juma yongding beiyun chaobai and ji rivers all originate from the mountains in the northwest and run to the southeast additionally the protected wetlands contain all the wetland types in beijing and include 10 lakes 3 marshes 24 reservoirs and 10 rivers 4 problems and countermeasures in the development of wetlands in beijing 4 1 problems of wetlands in beijing 4 1 1 limited resource space shortage of water resources and difficulty in land type conversion beijing is a resource based metropolis experiencing a serious water deficit wu et al 2017 it relies on water replenishment year round within the city the utilization rate of rain and flood is less than 30 and the utilization rate of reclaimed water is low in recent years the decrease in inbound water volume and the deterioration of water quality have become main reasons for the shrinkage of beijing s wetland area ma et al 2015 spatial factors are the basis for the development of a metropolis in situations characterized by rapid increases in population and the development of industry and agriculture and thus accelerated urbanization converting

zno actts composites for mo dye degradation under irradiation is exposed in fig 5 firstly after 150 min of photolysis a very small decrease in mo dye concentration was found it is remarkable from the figure that the percentage of the amount of zn in the composite has a great influence on the two processes the adsorption efficiencies of mo dye on zno actts composites of 15 30 50 and 75 are 12 6 50 5 14 and 3 90 respectively the zno actts 15 composite has a much higher adsorption capacity than other composites while the adsorption capability decreases as the percentage amount of zn increases this result could be attributed to the decrease in the specific surface area caused by the zinc oxide in the presence of photocatalysts and under irradiation the degradation rate of mo dye slightly increased with the increase of zn loading which was due to the stronger catalytic activity of zno the zno actts 75 catalyst exhibits enhanced activity with a mo dye degradation of 52 10 slightly

thapsia transtagana stems to prepare the activated carbon used to remove two kinds of dyes the primary disadvantage of activated carbon adsorption techniques is the generation of secondary waste which must be adequately recycled or eliminated activated carbon may be regenerated physically by heating or chemically by utilizing various solvents thermal regeneration of loaded activated carbon on the

community based bio assessment tool as well as basis of water quality management plans to monitor the pollution level or conservation of aquatic ecology keywords ecological health zooplankton community macrophytes environmental parameters multivariate analyses trophic state index introduction ecosystem services play a vital role for human existence as it regulates a number of functions such as production of goods life supporting processes etc shao et al 2019 unfortunately disturbance from anthropogenic activities have imperil the delivery of ecosystem services and has made ecosystems most threatened habitats globally xiong et al 2016 additionally human made activities directly and or indirectly lead to water quality deterioration biodiversity loss and or re distribution in aquatic ecosystems and finally impaired the ecosystem stability schwarzenbach et al 2010 xiong et al 2016 zooplankton is the key component in aquatic ecosystems in particular aquatic food chain and acting as intermediate nexus between producers and higher trophic levels abdullah al et al 2018 more importantly zooplankton is considered as important ecological indicators for water quality and climate change as they respond quickly than fish and phytoplankton to natural and anthropogenic activities liu et al 2013 abdullah al et al 2018 especially copepodans were used as pollution indicators i e acartia clause temperature elevation i e acartia hudsonica and acartia tonsa hooff and peterson 2006 abdullah al et al 2018 and its distribution pattern have been employed as salinity variation indicator abu hena et al 2016 fontana et al 2016 they also provide information about trophic state of secondary production and ecological succession in aquatic ecosystems abdullah al et al 2018 moreover the fertility of ecosystem depends on zooplankton availability it also regulates the fisheries potentiality and sustainability srichandan et al 2015 abu hena et al 2016 abdullah al et al 2018 furthermore several studies demonstrated zooplankton assemblage as bioindicator of trophic dynamics and ecological state of freshwater ecosystem related to changes in nutrient loading and climate manickam et al 2018 therefore a small change in their abundance species diversity and composition can disrupt the normal ecosystem functioning al et al 2020 besides zooplankton community structure is potentially regulated most likely by morphology and water chemistry of natural waterbody manickam et al 2018 consequently small changes in physico chemical properties of waterbody brings acor responding change in their relative community structure species density abundance and species composition inhabiting in water ecosystem therefore zooplankton have been considered as bioindicator of water quality measurement jose et al 2015 sarkar and pal 2017 manickam et al 2018 till today several studies have suggested that environmental factors including dispersal rates spatial scale and extent and environmental gradient lengths play vital role in shaping community structure in lake estuaries running water ecosystems and other freshwater bodies heino et al 2014 xiong et al 2016 abdullah al et al 2018 manickam et al 2018 furthermore different indices are used for demonstrating ecological health status of such aquatic ecosystems higher the indexvalue depicts better quality status abu henaet al 2016 abdullah al et al 2018 however a very little information or comparison is available especially in between natural earthen and cistern waterbodies receiving run off water from different sources however there is a dearth of information on how and extent of anthropogenic activities that influence the aquatic community structure and its distribution pattern particularly for zooplankton hence the present investigation was designed to reveal the underlying mechanism of the taxonomic composition of zooplankton and their distribution pattern along with macrophytes diversity through a comparison between cisterns made and natural earthen waterbody on seasonal basis secondly advocation of the environmental factors i e water quality parameters in shaping the zooplankton community finally we investigated the potentiality of trophic state of the waterbodies to promote pisciculture materials and methods study area and water sample collection for limnological analysis

community parameters with water parameters using spss v 26 multivariate analysis was performed to interpret the temporal variation of limnological parameters and zooplankton communities euclidean distance and bray curtis similarity matrices were performed on square root transformed normalized environmental data and species abundance data respectively species contribution was conducted by simper analysis distance based redundancy analysis dbrda was used to check the temporal variation in zooplankton community from square root transformed species abundances data while principal coordinates pco analysis was used for analyzing temporal variation in limnological parameters based on transformed normalized data clarke and gorley 2015 mental analysis of significant biota

measured in the present investigation are shown in table 1 comparatively higher water transparency was observed in cistern waterbody compared to natural earthen made waterbody t test at p 0 05 secchi disk transparency values 67cmvs 60 5 cm with strong seasonal variations one way anova natural earthen waterbody revealed maximum water transparency in summer followed by winter and post monsoon while in cistern waterbody showed maximum water transparency in winter followed by summer and post monsoon likely water temperature showed significant higher values in cistern waterbody compared with natural earthen waterbody t test at p 0 05 with strong seasonal variations one way anova and maximum values in summer on the other hand in case of water ph comparatively higher values were observed in natural earthen waterbody compared with cistern waterbody t test at p 0 05 with strong seasonal variations one way anova the values of ec tds tss ta and th values in natural earthen waterbody were comparatively higher than cistern waterbody t test at p 0 05 additionally a strong seasonal variation in ec tds tss ta and th values were recorded in both the ponds one way anova with maximum values in winter season similarly higher do and bod values were recorded in natural earthen waterbody in comparison to cistern waterbody t test at p 0 05 with a strong seasonal variation in both the ponds one way anova although higher chl a and po4 values were recorded in natural earthen waterbody than cistern waterbody t test at p 0 05 the maximum chl a and po4 values were observed in summer season however the chl a value showed significant seasonal variation only during study period one way anova fig 2 on the other hand the nitrate value no3 didn t show any significant variation spatially and seasonally but the maximum values were recorded during post rainy season zooplankton composition and distribution a total of 8 species were identified during study period six species were arthopods viz moina sp daphnia sp diaptomus sp cyclops sp cypris sp bosmina sp and two species were rotifers namely keratella sp and brachionus sp according to simper analysis brachionus sp cyclops sp keratella sp and daphnia sp were commonly distributed also called dominant species in all the seasons in cistern pond while cyclops sp daphnia sp and moina sp were common also called dominant species in natural earthen pond among the total observed species in all the seasons eight species were recorded in summer april to june seven in post rainy october and eight species in winter november and december in both the ponds table s1 total abundance s was highest in summer while lowest was recorded in post rainy season in both the ponds fig 3 total species number n varied seasonally in both the ponds with highest number in summer and lowest in winter season fig 3 the species richness evenness and diversity indices fluctuated during study period and showed seasonal variations in both the conditions fig

gradually in winter followed by post rainy species evenness was peaked in post rainy but dropped gradually in winter followed by summer in both the ponds but the values were always higher in cistern pond fig 3 species diversity indices was peaked in summer but dropped gradually in winter followed by post rainy in cistern pond fig 3 but no significant differences were observed in natural pond multivariate the distance based redundancy analysis dbrda was conducted to evaluate the community structure across the different seasons fig 4 data clearly demonstrated the annual pattern of zooplankton communities for instance the first axis dbrda1 showed 63 4 variation compared to second axis 30 8 in cistern pond first axis separated the zooplankton species in winter and post rainy left side from those in summer right side while second axis clearly discriminated winter samples lower side from post rainy samples lower in cistern pond fig 4a in case of natural pond the first axis dbrda1 showed 75 1 variation compared with second axis 15 1 fig 4c likely first axis separated the zooplankton species in winter and post rainy left side from those in summer right side while second axis clearly discriminated post rainy samples lower side from summer samples lower fig 4c vector overlay of zooplankton species in cistern pond revealed that four species daphnia sp cyclops sp cypris sp and keratella sp were pointed towards summer upper in right and remaining four species moina sp diaptomus sp bosmina sp and brachionus sp were pointed towards summer lower right fig 4b in case of normal pond vector overlay of zooplankton species revealed that seven species daphnia sp cyclops sp cypris sp moina sp diaptomus sp bosmina sp and keratella sp were pointed towards summer and only brachionus sp was pointed towards post rainy and winter lower left fig 4c relationship between environmental factors and zooplankton community multivariate coefficient of correlation relate analysis depicted that annual zooplankton community variation was significantly correlated with environmental parameters ρ 0 70 p 0 01 and ρ 0 711 p 0 01 in cistern and natural pond respectively furthermore the bio env biological environmental best matching analyses depicted that seasonal variation in zooplankton community was mainly driven by water temperature ph th and bod ρ 0 773 p 0 05 individually or combined with other environmental parameters in case of cistern pond table 1 on the other hand water temperature ec and tss ρ 0 092 p 0 01 individually or in combination with other limnological parameters played dominant role for natural pond table 1 the principle coordinate analysis pco depicted clear temporal variation in water parameters in both the ponds fig 4 the pco axes i e pco1 and pco2 discriminated the samples among three seasons and together accounted 89 7 total variation for cistern pond fig 4d the pco1 74 8 temporal variation separated the post rainy and winter samples left side from summer right side while pco2 14 8 temporal variation distinguished summer and post rainy samples upper side from winter samples lower side fig 4d on the other hand in natural pond the pco1 79 9 temporal variation separated the post rainy and winter samples left side from summer right side while pco2 10 5 temporal variation clearly distinguished the summer samples upper side from winter samples lower side but in case of post rainy samples here distinction was not clear fig 4e vector overlay of water parameters in cistern pond revealed that bod do chl a water temperature transparency po4 and no3 were pointed towards summer right side and remaining parameters ph ec ta th tds and tss were pointed towards winter lower left fig 4d in case of natural pond vector overlay of water parameters revealed that only water temperature was pointed towards summer right upper side chl a transparency and po4 pointed towards winter lower left and remaining parameters ph ec ta th do bod tds tss and no3 were pointed towards mixed winter and post rainy season respectively fig 4e correlation study between zooplankton abundance and environmental parameters is summarized in table 2 among environmental parameters eleven except po4 and no3 showed significant correlation with zooplankton members in both the ponds with varied correlation level table 2 among eight zooplankton species six moina sp daphnia sp diaptomus sp cyclops sp cypris sp bosmina sp species along with s and n were positively significant correlated only with transparency water temperature and chl a p 0 05 in natural pond in addition to this species evenness was positively correlated with ph and do and negatively correlated with transparency and chl a table 2 on the other hand in cistern pond zooplankton species along with s n d and h were positively correlated with water temperature do bod and chl a species richness was positively correlated with ph ec tds tss th and ta in cistern pond table 2 macrophyte composition and distribution available macrophytes during the study period were lemna sp major lemna sp minor azolla sp pistia sp hydrilla sp nymphaes sp ipomoea sp eichhornia sp and ceratophyllum sp belonging to three separate groups viz free floating rooted submerged and rooted emerged table 3 maximum species diversity in macrophyte community was observed in natural pond compared with cistern pond eutrophication conditions the temporal variation of trophic condition of these ponds is presented in fig 5 according to index calculations the tsi values of natural and cistern ponds were recorded in the range of 98 1 to 108 4 and 90 3 to 93 2 respectively these values indicated that both the ponds were hypereutrophic the tsi values were always greater in cistern ponds than the natural pond additionally a strong seasonal difference in tsi value was recorded in both the ponds discussion temporal variations of zooplankton community limnological parameters as well as macrophyte diversity were assessed and compared between natural and cistern ponds limnological parameters showed significant temporal variations among different seasons throughout the study period this variation might be due to rainfall which could significantly reduce transparency total solids due to runoff from surrounding areas al et al 2020 water transparency plays an important role in influencing directly the presence of suspended solids and available phytoplankton levels dokulil et al 2006 apart from this water transparency regulates the productivity of water body through ec tds and tss higher water transparency indicates lower ec tds and tss value in the present study higher transparency was recorded in cistern pond compared to natural waterbody accordingly lower ec tds and tss values were recorded in cistern pond than natural waterbody these lower values of ec tds tss and higher water transparency in cistern pond might be due to concrete plastered structure this concrete structure produced lower amount of soil laden runoff compared to natural waterbody temperature is another most determinant factor directly regulating fish production water temperature ranged from 26 06 to 31 97 c is suitable for warm water fish culture boyd 1982 while 25 to 32 c is ideal for tropical fish culture bolorunduro and abdullah 1996 and temperature 12 c poses stress to fish bhatnagar et al 2004 our study showed temperature from 19 68 0 19⁰c natural waterbody to 20 92 0 20⁰c cistern pond which indicated ideal for pisciculture accordingly ph value was within the range of pisciculture value ideal range for pisciculture in tropical areas varies between 6 7 and 9 5 while 4 0 and beyond 10 5 are considered as threatening for fish health bhatnagar et al 2004 ekubo and abowei 2011 also do is another most important a1 parameter that regulates fish production reflects the physical and biological occurrences as well as degree of pollution level garg and bhatnagar 2000 the recorded do level in both the ponds was within the range of optimal fish production 5 to 14 mg l bhatnagar et al 2004 santhosh and singh 2007 here comparatively lower bod level was recorded in cistern pond as the pond is free from contamination to some extent and received only runoff during rainy season which indicated that lower pollution load barai and kumar 2013 ta and th is considered as important tools for measurement of productivity and water body condition jiwyam and chareontesprasit 2001 the study revealed higher ta and th value in natural waterbody indicated that it received runoff from different sources additionally the recorded ta and th values were suitable for fish culture range of 75 2000 mg l is ideal bhatnagar et al 2004 furthermore higher ta and th values in winter season than summer had also been reported by thirupathaiah et al 2012 chlorophyll a and nutrient po4 and no3 levels were higher in natural pond than cistern pond due to intrusion of higher amount of runoff from different sources al et al 2020 globally evaluation of pond status and ecosystem s integration fernandes and ramaiah 2008 liu et al 2013 srichandan et al 2015 were studied through zooplankton distribution pattern macrophyte diversity and water parameters still there are dearth of information in between natural waterbody and concrete pond in present investigation six arthopods and two rotifer species were recorded similar to our findings haque 2015 reported nine zooplankton species from krishna sayer lake with maximum abundance in summer zooplankton abundance s and total species number n were comparatively higher in natural waterbody than cistern pond this might be due to higher nutritional inputs into natural waterbody through runoff in addition to this the ecological condition of the cistern pond might be another reason for lower abundance further variation in environmental parameters may influence directly or indirectly composition and abundance of zooplankton higher abundance of zooplankton and total number in summer season than other two seasons were also confirmed by haque 2015 this phenomenon indicated the hyper trophical conditions of the ponds at high temperature and low water level singh et al 2002 haque 2015 it is noteworthy that in summer season the abundance of cyclops sp daphnia sp diaptomus sp moina sp and cypris sp superseded the abundance of other zooplankton species present study is in consonence with previous reports conducted on some specific habitats such as guaraíras lagoon almeida et al 2012 and krishna sayer lake haque 2015 showing maximum zooplankton abundance in summer zooplankton species displayed a clear seasonal variation in their distribution pattern in both the ponds differently moina sp daphnia sp and cyclops sp were commonly distributed in all the seasons in cistern pond while cyclops sp daphnia sp keratella sp and brachionus sp were common in natural pond highest number of zooplankton members was observed in summer followed by winter and post rainy in both the ponds this indicated that environmental conditions and food availability in the studied ponds were different from one season to another and ecological conditions in summer and winter were relatively favourable for zooplankton distribution accordingly zooplankton species namely moina sp daphnia sp diaptomus sp cyclops sp cypris sp bosmina sp were positively correlated only with transparency water temperature and chl a in natural pond while in cistern pond zooplankton species were positively correlated with water temperature do bod and chl a likely environmental factor dependent zooplankton abundance was also been reported by several authors sharif et al 2017 abdullah al et al 2018 apart from this daphnia sp and cyclops sp were common in both the ponds therefore moina sp keratella sp and brachinus sp could be determinant in these two ponds further nutrient deposition by microbial activities on bottom are circulated in the late summer due to up and down welling processes resulting into spatio temporal distribution of zooplankton sahu et al 2013 srichandan et al 2015 it has been widely recognized that to determine the interaction between environmental parameters and biotic communities and predicting influencing factors multivariate analysis is more efficient than univariate analysis clarke and gorley 2015 abdullah al et al 2018 in our study multivariate analysis namely clustering analysis based on bray curtis similarity dbrda and pco of eight species revealed a temporal zooplankton structural variations and significant relationship with seasonal environmental parameters furthermore mental analysis i e relate and best matching analyses bio env showed that this temporal variation in zooplankton community was driven by water temperature ph th bod and water temperature ec tss in cistern pond and natural waterbody respectively our study displayed similarity with previous reports conducted on some specific habitats like bay of bengal estuary al et al 2020 where zooplankton structural variation was governed mainly by no2 n along with salinity rainfall transparency tds tss and ph similarly sahu et al 2010 documented that transparency tss tds do and nutrients variations are responsible for seasonal variations of zooplankton composition and structure therefore present findings revealed that zooplankton community structure and abundance in cistern pond and natural waterbody were governed by different environmental factors of these ponds where summer activities provides the best suitable ecological niche for dominant zooplankton species especially for cyclops sp daphnia sp diaptomus sp moina sp and cypris sp the most prominent species total abundance total species number and community based indices namely species evenness richness and diversity indices are used to evaluate water quality higher values indicate better environmental status abu hena et al 2016 abdullah al et al 2018 in present study abundance and total number of dominant species in natural pond was significantly correlated with parameters like transparency water temperature and chl a water temperature do bod chl a po4 in case of cistern pond supporting previous findings prabhahar et al 2011 sahu et al 2013 srichandan et al 2013 2015 in addition to this we observed that abundance and total number of dominant species were significantly negatively correlated with ph ec tds tss do bod ta th po4 and no3 in natural pond and transparency ph ec tds tss ta th and no3 in concrete pond indicated that these parameters influenced the abundance of these species in these two ponds respectively according to bianchi et al 2003 the distribution of copepods was mainly dependent on water temperature and food availability endorsed by water transparency fazeli et al 2014 in present investigation species richness fluctuated throughout the study period and was peaked in winter but dropped gradually in summer followed by post rainy in natural pond while in concrete pond species richness was peaked in summer but dropped gradually in winter followed by post rainy this finding indicated that water quality was not stable throughout the study period mainly due to changes in water parameters especially transparency do bod chl a and nutrient po4 and no3 levels on the other hand species evenness was peaked in post rainy but dropped gradually in winter followed by summer in both the conditions additionally species evenness was positively correlated with ph and do in natural pond while in cistern pond it was correlated with ph ec tds tss ta and th indicating that these parameters regulating the zooplankton community strongly in respective ponds species diversity indices were peaked in summer but dropped gradually in winter followed by post rainy under both ponds mainly by dominant species cyclops sp daphnia sp diaptomus sp moina sp and cypris sp when water temperature was higher and do bod and chl a value were lower consequently a number of studies reported the role of environmental parameters on planktonic distribution and community structure development prabhahar et al 2011 sahu et al 2013 abu hena et al 2016 abdullah al et al 2018 in addition to this higher index values in cistern pond were due to dynamic environmental characteristics mainly governed by chl a and po4 al et al 2020 these findings demonstrated that zooplankton community patterns are mainly driven by environmental variables viz namely transparency water temperature tds tss chl a and nutrients accordingly these zooplankton indices could be used as water quality community based bio assessment tool aquatic macrophytes are important plant communities regulatingthe nutrient cycling and productivity of pond pal et al 2014 they provide food habitat for other aquatic organisms remove excessive carbon dioxide suspended materials and produce good oxygen flux in the aquatic ecosystem during the study period nine different types of perennial macrophytes viz lemna sp major lemna sp minor azolla sp pistia sp free floating hydrilla sp rooted submerged nymphaes sp rooted free floating leaves ipomoea sp emergent eichhornia sp free floating ceratophyllum sp free submerged had been grown and identified in these ponds submerged macrophytes played important role in mineral recycling in aquatic ecosystem qiu et al 2001 lauridsen et al 2003 among the identified species lemna sp major lemna sp minor pistia sp free floating hydrilla sp rooted submerged ceratophyllum sp free submerged were common in these ponds therefore nymphaes sp ipomoea sp eichhornia sp and azolla sp could play determinant role for macrophyte diversity in these ponds in particular the presence of eichhornia sp in natural pond indicated degradation of water quality by air water interface and greatly enhanced the bod level rameshkumar et al 2019 generally emergent species need high nutrients level and poor lighting conditions high suspended matter and chlorophylla while free floating macrophytes need intermediate concentrations and submerged species need very low amount of nutrients pereira et al 2012 accordingly we recorded only free floating and submerged macrophytes in cistern pond as this pond receives lower amounts of nutrients from surrounding environment compared with natural pond in addition to this several authors demonstrated that environmental variables namely ph and alkalinity strongly influence the macrophyte distribution pattern especially submerged ones vestergaard and sand jensen 2000 pereira et al 2012 apart from higher nutritional input maximum macrophyte diversity in natural pond rather might be due to gradual inclined slope structural stretch pal et al 2014 several studies demonstrated that proliferation of free floating species namely lemna sp major hydrilla sp nymphaes sp and eichhornia sp caused adverse impacts not only to multiple uses of water but also to other communities bini et al 1999 pereira et al 2012 on the other hand comparatively lower abundance of free floating and submerged macrophytes in cistern pond might be marked for growth of phytoplankton further the growth of macrophytes is dependent on water depth casanova and brock 2000 thomaz et al 2006 as well as environmental parameters mainly transparency nutrient load tss and tds best et al 2001 pal et al 2014 khatun et al 2016 likely silva et al 2008 reported varied macrophytes diversity due to changes in environmental parameters accordingly macrophytes are considered as vital bioindicators of water quality measurement of aquatic ecosystem and incidence of macrophytes diversity primarily depends on nutrient load of the aquatic ecosystem penning et al 2008 poikane et al 2015 besides the presence of the eichhornia sp and lemna sp revealed the pollution load of the ponds therefore aquatic macrophytes play a major role in shaping the aquatic ecosystem leading to eutrophication trophic status index tsi is widely used by limnologists to evaluate the trophic status of lakes ponds i e eutrophication condition picapedra et al 2021 it is also used to determine the potential algal growth limiting factors carlson and havens 2005 the recorded tsi value of these ponds revealed that both ponds have an index value above 67 and is categorized as hypereutrophic which indicated that dominance of blue green algae and extensive macrophytic problems el zokm et al 2018 comparatively higher index value in natural pond indicated higher anthropogenic pressure i e higher inflow of nutrients from surrounding areas as runoff compared with cistern pond devi prasad and siddaraju 2012 zokm et al 2018 additionally clear seasonal differences indicated varied ecological conditions of the ponds further higher index value in natural pond indicated that water quality in natural pond was worse compared to concrete pond liu et al 2019 phosphorous is considered as deciding parameter of trophic status of an aquatic waterbody slight changes in phosphorus concentration alter its trophic status according to carvalho and kirika 2003 lower nutrient inflow reduces phosphorus level in lakes which in turn reduces phytoplankton biomass this observation is found to be similar for the present comparative study of cistern waterbody and natural waterbody accordingly xie et al 2003 observed persistent coincidence between microcystis bloom and phosphorus concentrations in addition to this chlorophyll a is another most important driving factors for assessment of trophic state of water bodies as algal concentration biomass indirectly determined by chlorophyll a hosmani 2010 devi prasad and siddaraju 2012 furthermore chlorophyll corresponds to more phytoplankton and macrophytes levels and more eutrophic state of the waterbody devi prasad and siddaraju 2012 conclusions present investigations provide information about temporal variation in zooplankton distribution pattern and community structure macrophyte diversity and environmental parameters between cistern and natural waterbody on comparative basis species abundance total number species richness evenness and diversity indices fluctuated seasonally multivariate analyses revealed significant correlation between temporal variation in zooplankton distribution and community structure with environmental parameters bio env analyses depicted that water temperature ph th bod for cistern pond and water temperature ec tss for natural pond endorsed this temporal variation trophic state index tsi value indicated hyper

driving forces for temporal variations in species distribution and zooplankton community additionally correlation analysis depicted that moina sp daphnia sp diaptomus sp cyclops sp cypris sp bosmina sp and species abundance was positively significant correlated with transparency water temperature and chl a in natural pond on the other hand correlation analysis depicted that zooplankton species species abundance evenness and diversity were positively correlated with water temperature do bod and chl a in cistern pond moreover abundance of aquatic macrophytes were limited in three basic groups namely free floating lemna sp major lemna sp minor azolla sp pistia sp and eichhornia sp rooted submerged hydrilla sp ceratophyllum sp and rooted emerged nymphaes sp and ipomoea sp further trophic state index tsi value revealed that both the ponds are hyper eutrophic natural waterbody cistern waterbody with a strong temporal variations therefore these data could be used as water quality community based bio assessment tool as well as basis of water quality management plans to monitor the pollution level or conservation of aquatic ecology keywords ecological health zooplankton community macrophytes environmental parameters multivariate analyses trophic state index introduction ecosystem services play a vital role for human existence as it regulates a number of functions such as production of goods life supporting processes etc shao et al 2019 unfortunately disturbance from anthropogenic activities have imperil the delivery of ecosystem services and has made ecosystems most threatened habitats globally xiong et al 2016 additionally human made activities directly and or indirectly lead to water quality deterioration biodiversity loss and or re distribution in aquatic ecosystems and finally impaired the ecosystem stability schwarzenbach et al 2010 xiong et al 2016 zooplankton is the key component in aquatic ecosystems in particular aquatic food chain and acting as intermediate nexus between producers and higher trophic levels abdullah al et al 2018 more importantly zooplankton is considered as important ecological indicators for water quality and climate change as they respond quickly than fish and phytoplankton to natural and anthropogenic activities liu et al 2013 abdullah al et al 2018 especially copepodans were used as pollution indicators i e acartia clause temperature elevation i e acartia hudsonica and acartia tonsa hooff and peterson 2006 abdullah al et al 2018 and its distribution pattern have been employed as salinity variation indicator abu hena et al 2016 fontana et al 2016 they also provide information about trophic state of secondary production and ecological succession in aquatic ecosystems abdullah al et al 2018 moreover the fertility of ecosystem depends on zooplankton availability it also regulates the fisheries potentiality and sustainability srichandan et al 2015 abu hena et al 2016 abdullah al et al 2018 furthermore several studies demonstrated zooplankton assemblage as bioindicator of trophic dynamics and ecological state of freshwater ecosystem related to changes in nutrient loading and climate manickam et al 2018 therefore a small change in their abundance species diversity and composition can disrupt the normal ecosystem functioning al et al 2020 besides zooplankton community structure is potentially regulated most likely by morphology and water chemistry of natural waterbody manickam et al 2018 consequently small changes in physico chemical properties of waterbody brings acor responding change in their relative community structure species density abundance and species composition inhabiting in water ecosystem therefore zooplankton have been considered as bioindicator of water quality measurement jose et al 2015 sarkar and pal 2017 manickam et al 2018 till today several studies have suggested that environmental factors including dispersal rates spatial scale and extent and environmental gradient lengths play vital role in shaping community structure in lake estuaries running water ecosystems and other freshwater bodies heino et al 2014 xiong et al 2016 abdullah al et al 2018 manickam et al 2018 furthermore different indices are used for demonstrating ecological health status of such aquatic ecosystems higher the indexvalue depicts better quality status abu henaet al 2016 abdullah al et al 2018 however a very little information or comparison is available especially in between natural earthen and cistern waterbodies receiving run off water from different sources however there is a dearth of information on how and extent of anthropogenic activities that influence the aquatic community structure and its distribution pattern particularly for zooplankton hence the present investigation was designed to reveal the underlying mechanism of the taxonomic composition of zooplankton and their distribution pattern along with macrophytes diversity through a comparison between cisterns made and natural earthen waterbody on seasonal basis secondly advocation of the environmental factors i e water quality parameters in shaping the zooplankton community finally we investigated the potentiality of trophic state of the waterbodies to promote pisciculture materials and methods study area and water sample collection for limnological analysis

community parameters with water parameters using spss v 26 multivariate analysis was performed to interpret the temporal variation of limnological parameters and zooplankton communities euclidean distance and bray curtis similarity matrices were performed on square root transformed normalized environmental data and species abundance data respectively species contribution was conducted by simper analysis distance based redundancy analysis dbrda was used to check the temporal variation in zooplankton community from square root transformed species abundances data while principal coordinates pco analysis was used for analyzing temporal variation in limnological parameters based on transformed normalized data clarke and gorley 2015 mental analysis of significant biota

measured in the present investigation are shown in table 1 comparatively higher water transparency was observed in cistern waterbody compared to natural earthen made waterbody t test at p 0 05 secchi disk transparency values 67cmvs 60 5 cm with strong seasonal variations one way anova natural earthen waterbody revealed maximum water transparency in summer followed by winter and post monsoon while in cistern waterbody showed maximum water transparency in winter followed by summer and post monsoon likely water temperature showed significant higher values in cistern waterbody compared with natural earthen waterbody t test at p 0 05 with strong seasonal variations one way anova and maximum values in summer on the other hand in case of water ph comparatively higher values were observed in natural earthen waterbody compared with cistern waterbody t test at p 0 05 with strong seasonal variations one way anova the values of ec tds tss ta and th values in natural earthen waterbody were comparatively higher than cistern waterbody t test at p 0 05 additionally a strong seasonal variation in ec tds tss ta and th values were recorded in both the ponds one way anova with maximum values in winter season similarly higher do and bod values were recorded in natural earthen waterbody in comparison to cistern waterbody t test at p 0 05 with a strong seasonal variation in both the ponds one way anova although higher chl a and po4 values were recorded in natural earthen waterbody than cistern waterbody t test at p 0 05 the maximum chl a and po4 values were observed in summer season however the chl a value showed significant seasonal variation only during study period one way anova fig 2 on the other hand the nitrate value no3 didn t show any significant variation spatially and seasonally but the maximum values were recorded during post rainy season zooplankton composition and distribution a total of 8 species were identified during study period six species were arthopods viz moina sp daphnia sp diaptomus sp cyclops sp cypris sp bosmina sp and two species were rotifers namely keratella sp and brachionus sp according to simper analysis brachionus sp cyclops sp keratella sp and daphnia sp were commonly distributed also called dominant species in all the seasons in cistern pond while cyclops sp daphnia sp and moina sp were common also called dominant species in natural earthen pond among the total observed species in all the seasons eight species were recorded in summer april to june seven in post rainy october and eight species in winter november and december in both the ponds table s1 total abundance s was highest in summer while lowest was recorded in post rainy season in both the ponds fig 3 total species number n varied seasonally in both the ponds with highest number in summer and lowest in winter season fig 3 the species richness evenness and diversity indices fluctuated during study period and showed seasonal variations in both the conditions fig

gradually in winter followed by post rainy species evenness was peaked in post rainy but dropped gradually in winter followed by summer in both the ponds but the values were always higher in cistern pond fig 3 species diversity indices was peaked in summer but dropped gradually in winter followed by post rainy in cistern pond fig 3 but no significant differences were observed in natural pond multivariate the distance based redundancy analysis dbrda was conducted to evaluate the community structure across the different seasons fig 4 data clearly demonstrated the annual pattern of zooplankton communities for instance the first axis dbrda1 showed 63 4 variation compared to second axis 30 8 in cistern pond first axis separated the zooplankton species in winter and post rainy left side from those in summer right side while second axis clearly discriminated winter samples lower side from post rainy samples lower in cistern pond fig 4a in case of natural pond the first axis dbrda1 showed 75 1 variation compared with second axis 15 1 fig 4c likely first axis separated the zooplankton species in winter and post rainy left side from those in summer right side while second axis clearly discriminated post rainy samples lower side from summer samples lower fig 4c vector overlay of zooplankton species in cistern pond revealed that four species daphnia sp cyclops sp cypris sp and keratella sp were pointed towards summer upper in right and remaining four species moina sp diaptomus sp bosmina sp and brachionus sp were pointed towards summer lower right fig 4b in case of normal pond vector overlay of zooplankton species revealed that seven species daphnia sp cyclops sp cypris sp moina sp diaptomus sp bosmina sp and keratella sp were pointed towards summer and only brachionus sp was pointed towards post rainy and winter lower left fig 4c relationship between environmental factors and zooplankton community multivariate coefficient of correlation relate analysis depicted that annual zooplankton community variation was significantly correlated with environmental parameters ρ 0 70 p 0 01 and ρ 0 711 p 0 01 in cistern and natural pond respectively furthermore the bio env biological environmental best matching analyses depicted that seasonal variation in zooplankton community was mainly driven by water temperature ph th and bod ρ 0 773 p 0 05 individually or combined with other environmental parameters in case of cistern pond table 1 on the other hand water temperature ec and tss ρ 0 092 p 0 01 individually or in combination with other limnological parameters played dominant role for natural pond table 1 the principle coordinate analysis pco depicted clear temporal variation in water parameters in both the ponds fig 4 the pco axes i e pco1 and pco2 discriminated the samples among three seasons and together accounted 89 7 total variation for cistern pond fig 4d the pco1 74 8 temporal variation separated the post rainy and winter samples left side from summer right side while pco2 14 8 temporal variation distinguished summer and post rainy samples upper side from winter samples lower side fig 4d on the other hand in natural pond the pco1 79 9 temporal variation separated the post rainy and winter samples left side from summer right side while pco2 10 5 temporal variation clearly distinguished the summer samples upper side from winter samples lower side but in case of post rainy samples here distinction was not clear fig 4e vector overlay of water parameters in cistern pond revealed that bod do chl a water temperature transparency po4 and no3 were pointed towards summer right side and remaining parameters ph ec ta th tds and tss were pointed towards winter lower left fig 4d in case of natural pond vector overlay of water parameters revealed that only water temperature was pointed towards summer right upper side chl a transparency and po4 pointed towards winter lower left and remaining parameters ph ec ta th do bod tds tss and no3 were pointed towards mixed winter and post rainy season respectively fig 4e correlation study between zooplankton abundance and environmental parameters is summarized in table 2 among environmental parameters eleven except po4 and no3 showed significant correlation with zooplankton members in both the ponds with varied correlation level table 2 among eight zooplankton species six moina sp daphnia sp diaptomus sp cyclops sp cypris sp bosmina sp species along with s and n were positively significant correlated only with transparency water temperature and chl a p 0 05 in natural pond in addition to this species evenness was positively correlated with ph and do and negatively correlated with transparency and chl a table 2 on the other hand in cistern pond zooplankton species along with s n d and h were positively correlated with water temperature do bod and chl a species richness was positively correlated with ph ec tds tss th and ta in cistern pond table 2 macrophyte composition and distribution available macrophytes during the study period were lemna sp major lemna sp minor azolla sp pistia sp hydrilla sp nymphaes sp ipomoea sp eichhornia sp and ceratophyllum sp belonging to three separate groups viz free floating rooted submerged and rooted emerged table 3 maximum species diversity in macrophyte community was observed in natural pond compared with cistern pond eutrophication conditions the temporal variation of trophic condition of these ponds is presented in fig 5 according to index calculations the tsi values of natural and cistern ponds were recorded in the range of 98 1 to 108 4 and 90 3 to 93 2 respectively these values indicated that both the ponds were hypereutrophic the tsi values were always greater in cistern ponds than the natural pond additionally a strong seasonal difference in tsi value was recorded in both the ponds discussion temporal variations of zooplankton community limnological parameters as well as macrophyte diversity were assessed and compared between natural and cistern ponds limnological parameters showed significant temporal variations among different seasons throughout the study period this variation might be due to rainfall which could significantly reduce transparency total solids due to runoff from surrounding areas al et al 2020 water transparency plays an important role in influencing directly the presence of suspended solids and available phytoplankton levels dokulil et al 2006 apart from this water transparency regulates the productivity of water body through ec tds and tss higher water transparency indicates lower ec tds and tss value in the present study higher transparency was recorded in cistern pond compared to natural waterbody accordingly lower ec tds and tss values were recorded in cistern pond than natural waterbody these lower values of ec tds tss and higher water transparency in cistern pond might be due to concrete plastered structure this concrete structure produced lower amount of soil laden runoff compared to natural waterbody temperature is another most determinant factor directly regulating fish production water temperature ranged from 26 06 to 31 97 c is suitable for warm water fish culture boyd 1982 while 25 to 32 c is ideal for tropical fish culture bolorunduro and abdullah 1996 and temperature 12 c poses stress to fish bhatnagar et al 2004 our study showed temperature from 19 68 0 19⁰c natural waterbody to 20 92 0 20⁰c cistern pond which indicated ideal for pisciculture accordingly ph value was within the range of pisciculture value ideal range for pisciculture in tropical areas varies between 6 7 and 9 5 while 4 0 and beyond 10 5 are considered as threatening for fish health bhatnagar et al 2004 ekubo and abowei 2011 also do is another most important a1 parameter that regulates fish production reflects the physical and biological occurrences as well as degree of pollution level garg and bhatnagar 2000 the recorded do level in both the ponds was within the range of optimal fish production 5 to 14 mg l bhatnagar et al 2004 santhosh and singh 2007 here comparatively lower bod level was recorded in cistern pond as the pond is free from contamination to some extent and received only runoff during rainy season which indicated that lower pollution load barai and kumar 2013 ta and th is considered as important tools for measurement of productivity and water body condition jiwyam and chareontesprasit 2001 the study revealed higher ta and th value in natural waterbody indicated that it received runoff from different sources additionally the recorded ta and th values were suitable for fish culture range of 75 2000 mg l is ideal bhatnagar et al 2004 furthermore higher ta and th values in winter season than summer had also been reported by thirupathaiah et al 2012 chlorophyll a and nutrient po4 and no3 levels were higher in natural pond than cistern pond due to intrusion of higher amount of runoff from different sources al et al 2020 globally evaluation of pond status and ecosystem s integration fernandes and ramaiah 2008 liu et al 2013 srichandan et al 2015 were studied through zooplankton distribution pattern macrophyte diversity and water parameters still there are dearth of information in between natural waterbody and concrete pond in present investigation six arthopods and two rotifer species were recorded similar to our findings haque 2015 reported nine zooplankton species from krishna sayer lake with maximum abundance in summer zooplankton abundance s and total species number n were comparatively higher in natural waterbody than cistern pond this might be due to higher nutritional inputs into natural waterbody through runoff in addition to this the ecological condition of the cistern pond might be another reason for lower abundance further variation in environmental parameters may influence directly or indirectly composition and abundance of zooplankton higher abundance of zooplankton and total number in summer season than other two seasons were also confirmed by haque 2015 this phenomenon indicated the hyper trophical conditions of the ponds at high temperature and low water level singh et al 2002 haque 2015 it is noteworthy that in summer season the abundance of cyclops sp daphnia sp diaptomus sp moina sp and cypris sp superseded the abundance of other zooplankton species present study is in consonence with previous reports conducted on some specific habitats such as guaraíras lagoon almeida et al 2012 and krishna sayer lake haque 2015 showing maximum zooplankton abundance in summer zooplankton species displayed a clear seasonal variation in their distribution pattern in both the ponds differently moina sp daphnia sp and cyclops sp were commonly distributed in all the seasons in cistern pond while cyclops sp daphnia sp keratella sp and brachionus sp were common in natural pond highest number of zooplankton members was observed in summer followed by winter and post rainy in both the ponds this indicated that environmental conditions and food availability in the studied ponds were different from one season to another and ecological conditions in summer and winter were relatively favourable for zooplankton distribution accordingly zooplankton species namely moina sp daphnia sp diaptomus sp cyclops sp cypris sp bosmina sp were positively correlated only with transparency water temperature and chl a in natural pond while in cistern pond zooplankton species were positively correlated with water temperature do bod and chl a likely environmental factor dependent zooplankton abundance was also been reported by several authors sharif et al 2017 abdullah al et al 2018 apart from this daphnia sp and cyclops sp were common in both the ponds therefore moina sp keratella sp and brachinus sp could be determinant in these two ponds further nutrient deposition by microbial activities on bottom are circulated in the late summer due to up and down welling processes resulting into spatio temporal distribution of zooplankton sahu et al 2013 srichandan et al 2015 it has been widely recognized that to determine the interaction between environmental parameters and biotic communities and predicting influencing factors multivariate analysis is more efficient than univariate analysis clarke and gorley 2015 abdullah al et al 2018 in our study multivariate analysis namely clustering analysis based on bray curtis similarity dbrda and pco of eight species revealed a temporal zooplankton structural variations and significant relationship with seasonal environmental parameters furthermore mental analysis i e relate and best matching analyses bio env showed that this temporal variation in zooplankton community was driven by water temperature ph th bod and water temperature ec tss in cistern pond and natural waterbody respectively our study displayed similarity with previous reports conducted on some specific habitats like bay of bengal estuary al et al 2020 where zooplankton structural variation was governed mainly by no2 n along with salinity rainfall transparency tds tss and ph similarly sahu et al 2010 documented that transparency tss tds do and nutrients variations are responsible for seasonal variations of zooplankton composition and structure therefore present findings revealed that zooplankton community structure and abundance in cistern pond and natural waterbody were governed by different environmental factors of these ponds where summer activities provides the best suitable ecological niche for dominant zooplankton species especially for cyclops sp daphnia sp diaptomus sp moina sp and cypris sp the most prominent species total abundance total species number and community based indices namely species evenness richness and diversity indices are used to evaluate water quality higher values indicate better environmental status abu hena et al 2016 abdullah al et al 2018 in present study abundance and total number of dominant species in natural pond was significantly correlated with parameters like transparency water temperature and chl a water temperature do bod chl a po4 in case of cistern pond supporting previous findings prabhahar et al 2011 sahu et al 2013 srichandan et al 2013 2015 in addition to this we observed that abundance and total number of dominant species were significantly negatively correlated with ph ec tds tss do bod ta th po4 and no3 in natural pond and transparency ph ec tds tss ta th and no3 in concrete pond indicated that these parameters influenced the abundance of these species in these two ponds respectively according to bianchi et al 2003 the distribution of copepods was mainly dependent on water temperature and food availability endorsed by water transparency fazeli et al 2014 in present investigation species richness fluctuated throughout the study period and was peaked in winter but dropped gradually in summer followed by post rainy in natural pond while in concrete pond species richness was peaked in summer but dropped gradually in winter followed by post rainy this finding indicated that water quality was not stable throughout the study period mainly due to changes in water parameters especially transparency do bod chl a and nutrient po4 and no3 levels on the other hand species evenness was peaked in post rainy but dropped gradually in winter followed by summer in both the conditions additionally species evenness was positively correlated with ph and do in natural pond while in cistern pond it was correlated with ph ec tds tss ta and th indicating that these parameters regulating the zooplankton community strongly in respective ponds species diversity indices were peaked in summer but dropped gradually in winter followed by post rainy under both ponds mainly by dominant species cyclops sp daphnia sp diaptomus sp moina sp and cypris sp when water temperature was higher and do bod and chl a value were lower consequently a number of studies reported the role of environmental parameters on planktonic distribution and community structure development prabhahar et al 2011 sahu et al 2013 abu hena et al 2016 abdullah al et al 2018 in addition to this higher index values in cistern pond were due to dynamic environmental characteristics mainly governed by chl a and po4 al et al 2020 these findings demonstrated that zooplankton community patterns are mainly driven by environmental variables viz namely transparency water temperature tds tss chl a and nutrients accordingly these zooplankton indices could be used as water quality community based bio assessment tool aquatic macrophytes are important plant communities regulatingthe nutrient cycling and productivity of pond pal et al 2014 they provide food habitat for other aquatic organisms remove excessive carbon dioxide suspended materials and produce good oxygen flux in the aquatic ecosystem during the study period nine different types of perennial macrophytes viz lemna sp major lemna sp minor azolla sp pistia sp free floating hydrilla sp rooted submerged nymphaes sp rooted free floating leaves ipomoea sp emergent eichhornia sp free floating ceratophyllum sp free submerged had been grown and identified in these ponds submerged macrophytes played important role in mineral recycling in aquatic ecosystem qiu et al 2001 lauridsen et al 2003 among the identified species lemna sp major lemna sp minor pistia sp free floating hydrilla sp rooted submerged ceratophyllum sp free submerged were common in these ponds therefore nymphaes sp ipomoea sp eichhornia sp and azolla sp could play determinant role for macrophyte diversity in these ponds in particular the presence of eichhornia sp in natural pond indicated degradation of water quality by air water interface and greatly enhanced the bod level rameshkumar et al 2019 generally emergent species need high nutrients level and poor lighting conditions high suspended matter and chlorophylla while free floating macrophytes need intermediate concentrations and submerged species need very low amount of nutrients pereira et al 2012 accordingly we recorded only free floating and submerged macrophytes in cistern pond as this pond receives lower amounts of nutrients from surrounding environment compared with natural pond in addition to this several authors demonstrated that environmental variables namely ph and alkalinity strongly influence the macrophyte distribution pattern especially submerged ones vestergaard and sand jensen 2000 pereira et al 2012 apart from higher nutritional input maximum macrophyte diversity in natural pond rather might be due to gradual inclined slope structural stretch pal et al 2014 several studies demonstrated that proliferation of free floating species namely lemna sp major hydrilla sp nymphaes sp and eichhornia sp caused adverse impacts not only to multiple uses of water but also to other communities bini et al 1999 pereira et al 2012 on the other hand comparatively lower abundance of free floating and submerged macrophytes in cistern pond might be marked for growth of phytoplankton further the growth of macrophytes is dependent on water depth casanova and brock 2000 thomaz et al 2006 as well as environmental parameters mainly transparency nutrient load tss and tds best et al 2001 pal et al 2014 khatun et al 2016 likely silva et al 2008 reported varied macrophytes diversity due to changes in environmental parameters accordingly macrophytes are considered as vital bioindicators of water quality measurement of aquatic ecosystem and incidence of macrophytes diversity primarily depends on nutrient load of the aquatic ecosystem penning et al 2008 poikane et al 2015 besides the presence of the eichhornia sp and lemna sp revealed the pollution load of the ponds therefore aquatic macrophytes play a major role in shaping the aquatic ecosystem leading to eutrophication trophic status index tsi is widely used by limnologists to evaluate the trophic status of lakes ponds i e eutrophication condition picapedra et al 2021 it is also used to determine the potential algal growth limiting factors carlson and havens 2005 the recorded tsi value of these ponds revealed that both ponds have an index value above 67 and is categorized as hypereutrophic which indicated that dominance of blue green algae and extensive macrophytic problems el zokm et al 2018 comparatively higher index value in natural pond indicated higher anthropogenic pressure i e higher inflow of nutrients from surrounding areas as runoff compared with cistern pond devi prasad and siddaraju 2012 zokm et al 2018 additionally clear seasonal differences indicated varied ecological conditions of the ponds further higher index value in natural pond indicated that water quality in natural pond was worse compared to concrete pond liu et al 2019 phosphorous is considered as deciding parameter of trophic status of an aquatic waterbody slight changes in phosphorus concentration alter its trophic status according to carvalho and kirika 2003 lower nutrient inflow reduces phosphorus level in lakes which in turn reduces phytoplankton biomass this observation is found to be similar for the present comparative study of cistern waterbody and natural waterbody accordingly xie et al 2003 observed persistent coincidence between microcystis bloom and phosphorus concentrations in addition to this chlorophyll a is another most important driving factors for assessment of trophic state of water bodies as algal concentration biomass indirectly determined by chlorophyll a hosmani 2010 devi prasad and siddaraju 2012 furthermore chlorophyll corresponds to more phytoplankton and macrophytes levels and more eutrophic state of the waterbody devi prasad and siddaraju 2012 conclusions present investigations provide information about temporal variation in zooplankton distribution pattern and community structure macrophyte diversity and environmental parameters between cistern and natural waterbody on comparative basis species abundance total number species richness evenness and diversity indices fluctuated seasonally multivariate analyses revealed significant correlation between temporal variation in zooplankton distribution and community structure with environmental parameters bio env analyses depicted that water temperature ph th bod for cistern pond and water temperature ec tss for natural pond endorsed this temporal variation trophic state index tsi value indicated hyper eutrophic nature of both the ponds therefore these data might be used as bio assessment tool for monitoring the aquatic ecosystem health as well as baseline data for development of efficient water
