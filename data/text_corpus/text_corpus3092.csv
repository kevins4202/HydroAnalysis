15460,high microwave response cobalt substituted manganese ferrite cmfo 0 5 was successfully synthesized as a heterogeneous catalyst for efficient peracetic acid paa activation and tetracycline hydrochloride tch degradation with singlet oxygen 1o2 as the dominated reactive oxidized species ros the removal efficiency of tch could reach 98 16 within 6 min under microwave irradiation when the cmfo 0 5 was added at 20 mg l it s found that the co substitution could produce the oxygen vacancies ovs improve the microwave mw absorbing performance and enhance the internal electron transfer efficiency of materials the phenomenon why 1o2 as the dominated ros rather than hydroxyl radical oh and organic radicals r o would be explained by the following aspects the oxygen adsorbed on the ovs can accept the electron transformed from paa to form superoxide radical o2 which will disproportionate to form 1o2 the energy generated by the non thermal effect of mw can dissociate paa to generate peroxy group for 1o2 generation furthermore the possible tch degradation pathways were proposed based on dft theory calculations and product identification and the toxicity predictions of the degradation products were also performed by the ecological structure activity relationship model ecosar software additionally the decrease of acute toxicity of treated tch excellent stability and strong resistance towards water matrix fully demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system for practical application in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microwave cobalt substituted manganese ferrite peracetic acid activation oxygen vacancies singlet oxygen data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction an global assessment found that the consumption of antibiotics had increased by 39 from 2000 to 2015 reaching 42 3 billion defined daily doses ddds in 76 countries klein et al 2018 excessive use of antibiotics could lead to the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args whose access into humans and animals would promote the spread of args greatly reducing the original potential of antibiotic treatment sun et al 2021 tetracycline hydrochloride tch as a famous broad spectrum antibacterial agent has an excellent inhibitory effect on most gram positive and gram negative bacteria duan et al 2022 the massive accumulation of residual tetracycline in the water due to overuse of tch would induce serious impacts on the ecosystem and public health removal of these antibiotics is required and can be realized by advanced oxidation processes aops depending on the due to the strong oxidizing ability of generated reactive oxidized species ros in recent years peracetic acid paa has received increasing attention as a new oxidant because paa aops have advantages such as low dependence on ph value in the environment high sterilization ability and generation of few toxic by products compared with aops such as photocatalysis and fenton process wan et al 2021 yu et al 2021a yu et al 2021b however without the activation of paa a large number of refractory organic pollutants can not be directly degraded zhang et al 2021a at present the methods of activating paa mainly include ultraviolet uv irradiation transition metals and so on he et al 2022 uv irradiation could activate paa by breaking the oo bond resulting in the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh and acetyloxyl radicals ch3c o o zhu and liu 2022 in a homogeneous system paa can also be activated by co2 and ru3 to produce acetylperoxy radicals ch3c o oo and ch3c o o li et al 2021 wang et al 2019 unfortunately homogeneous activation paa faces secondary pollution caused by the harmful metal ions yang et al 2022 it is worthwhile to explore new types of heterogeneous catalysts for paa activation which are easier to separate from water and recycle spinel ferrites used as catalysts in aops have received widespread attention due to their high magnetism and stability ding et al 2021 among them mnfe2o4 mfo has the advantages of low environmental toxicity and good structural stability but its high saturation magnetization easily leads to agglomeration with a result of decrease in active sites qin et al 2020 it is necessary to explore a simple and effective method to further enhance the catalytic performance of mfo substitution of a third metal on the spinel ferrites has been proposed as a good strategy to further improve their catalytic performance since substitution of a or b sites in the spinel structure will generate oxygen vacancies ovs and the introduction of new transition metal will also participate in the reaction substitution of cu successfully improved the pms activation ability of znfe2o4 catalyst to degrade pollutants and the optimum performance can be reached when cu cu fe was 0 5 moreover introduction of cu can induce the generation of singlet oxygen yu et al 2019 it should be noted that singlet oxygen 1o2 shows stronger resistance to environmental interference and higher degradation selectivity in comparison with other radicals wei et al 2022 for instance 500 mm cl reacted with organic radicals r o ch3c o oo and ch3c o o to inhibit the degradation rate of orange g by 54 wu et al 2020 as such stimulating the production of singlet oxygen 1o2 in the paa based system would be promising for its practical application while which probably will be realized by the introduction of ovs on the mfo but still needs further exploration in addition in the microwave mw field manganese ferrite with high saturation magnetization and dielectric constant can absorb microwaves and quickly convert the absorbed mw energy into heat energy it can selectively heat the mw absorbing phases and components in the material without causing energy waste further boosting the reactivity of catalysts li et al 2018 more importantly the mw effect can also promote the electron transfer on the catalyst surface and subsequently the adsorbed oxygen would react with e to form superoxide radical o2 wang et al 2020c so far o2 disproportionation is the most commonly used method for 1o2 generation zhang et al 2021b as such it can be speculated that the simultaneous introduction of ovs via substitution of a third metal and mw would be a good strategy to improve paa activation and 1o2 generation generally co2 has been considered as one of the effective activators for paa process wang et al 2019 the substitution of mfo by co is capable of improving its catalytic performance co element can modify the lattice and improve the physical and chemical properties of the catalyst li et al 2022 moreover studies have shown that co substituted mfo can exhibit various electrical and magnetic properties which will be more responsive to the mw system narayanaswamy et al 2021 herein a co substituted mfo activating paa system with good cycling stability was firstly designed aiming for enhanced singlet oxygen 1o2 generation high microwave response and strong resistance towards water matrix in this study coxmn1 xfe2o4 cmfo x prepared via mw assisted hydrothermal synthesis was characterized and tested for activating paa to degrade tch the effects of catalyst dose paa concentration mw conditions initial pollutant concentration initial ph humic acid ha various anions and other variables on the experiment were investigated the degradation mechanism was studied in detail via the quenching experiment epr capture experiments the degradation pathway of tch and dft theoretical calculation this research reported the excellent performance of cmfo x to activate paa under mw irradiation for the tch degradation which would broaden the application potential of paa based aops in the field of wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials information about all chemicals and reagents are provided in text s1 the preparation and characterization methods of cmfo 0 5 are detailed in text s2 and text s3 except for experiments with different water bodies all experiments were conducted with ultrapure water 18 25 m ω cm 2 2 batch experiments see text s4 for specific details of degradation experiments considering the possible interference of the buffer the ph was not controlled by the buffer during the reaction and the initial ph was used for all experiments all batch experiments were conducted at least twice details of analysis methods are provided in text s5 2 3 theoretical calculation the materials studio software based on density functional theory dft was used to perform the calculations for this experiment and the corresponding operating parameters were provided in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of catalysts the morphologies of both mfo and cmfo 0 5 were observed to be spherical in scanning electron microscope sem images fig 1 a b further analysis showed that the particle size of the catalyst became smaller after cobalt substitution fig s2 and eds also verified the successful incorporation of cobalt fig 1 c and fig s3 fig 1 d e are the x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir spectra of the catalyst respectively it clearly demonstrated that the substitution of cobalt makes the crystal form sharper accelerates the stretching frequency of metal o bonds and reduces the specific surface area which has a favorable effect on the improvement of catalytic performance text s7 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used to analyze the surface species composition of mfo and cmfo 0 5 in fig s6 the peaks of co 2p 3 2 represented co3 and co2 779 3 and 781 1 ev and co 2p 1 2 795 5 ev could be observed with two satellite peaks 785 8 and 795 5 ev in the xps spectrum of co fig 1 f li et al 2020 the peaks belonging to mn2 mn3 fe2 and fe3 could be clearly identified in the high resolution spectrum of mn and fe of both two samples fig 1 g h liu et al 2022b zhang et al 2022 the high resolution spectrum of oxygen at 529 31 and 530 79 ev in the mfo spectrum were represented by lattice oxygen and surface adsorbed hydroxy species of the catalyst respectively fig 1 i when cobalt was substituted into mfo the lattice oxygen peak shifted toward lower binding energy and a new strong peak representing ovs is detected at 530 14 ev ovs is a kind of metal oxide defect the essence of which is that the metal oxide causes the detachment of oxygen in the lattice in a specific external environment the existence of defects plays a crucial role in catalyzing some reactions when cobalt is introduced the lattice oxygen of mfo is released in the process which contributes to the formation of ovs in the catalyst at the same time due to the appearance of ovs oxygen species would adsorb on the catalyst surface zhou et al 2021 3 2 cobalt substitution enhanced the catalytic performance of the mfo 3 2 1 performance of cmfo 0 5 on activating paa under mw irradiation the effect of different dosages of cobalt substitution was explored and mw cmfo 0 5 paa was determined as the best reaction system fig s7 it s clearly observed that the degradation ratio of tch reached the maximum value 98 61 within 5 min fig 2 a the system also has the largest reaction rate constant which was 7 25 times higher than that without mw irradiation and the degree of decomposition of paa fig 2 b commercial paa solutions contain h2o2 which can also cause the degradation of pollutants and the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh however only 8 74 tch was removed in the mw cmfo 0 5 h2o2 system under the same conditions indicating that h2o2 contained in paa does not play a major role fig s8 meanwhile the effect of the leached metal ions on the degradation of tch in the mw cmfo 0 5 paa system was also negligible fig s9 in addition regardless of the presence or absence of mw the removal rate of tch does not exceed 4 in 6 min when only catalyst was used implying the negligible role of tch adsorption on the cmfo 0 5 during the whole reaction process moreover the degradation ratio of tch is only 12 93 when only paa exists although the electron donating groups e g ch3 and oh of tch can enhance the oxidation of paa the selectivity of paa is too high to directly oxidize tch kim and huang 2021 since paa will decompose to form acetic acid eq 1 with a stronger acidity the ph value during the reaction decreased slightly with time fig s10 but the effect on the degradation of tch can be ignored the change of toc during the degradation process is shown in fig s11 and it can be observed that the addition of paa to initiate the reaction will generate a higher level of toc because paa is an organic acid both itself and its by products are carbon based organics which will affect the detection of toc combining paa aops with biological treatment may be a promising option because paa aops can increase toc in wastewater after treatment which can serve as a good carbon source for microorganisms wang et al 2020a wu et al 2020 1 2ch3c o ooh 2ch3c o oh o2 3 2 2 influence of reaction parameters as presented in fig 2 c when the initial dose of cmfo 0 5 was 5 10 15 and 20 mg l the degradation rates of tch were 85 95 89 96 94 82 and 98 61 respectively higher catalyst dosage means more reaction sites and the degradation performance increases accordingly however when the amount of cmfo 0 5 was 25 mg l the degradation rate of tch was hardly changed because the utilization of the active sites on the catalyst surface reached the maximum when the dosage of paa was increased from 50 μm to 250 μm the degradation ratio of tch enhanced from 78 96 to 98 61 fig 2 d thus the dosage of cmfo 0 5 and paa was chosen as 20 mg l and 250 μm in the following study respectively the impact of initial concentrations of tch and ph value was also investigated with results displayed in fig 2 e f when the initial concentration of tch was increased from 5 μm to 30 μm the degradation efficiency can still reach 85 54 it can be seen that the degradation efficiency of tch is the highest at neutral ph paa can undergo acid base dissociation due to the changes in ph which produces a conjugate base under alkaline conditions paa eq 2 zhang et al 2021a moreover the phiep of cmfo 0 5 is 3 33 fig s12 manifesting that it is negatively charged under alkaline conditions and it will produce electrostatic repulsion with paa when the negatively charged catalyst and paa are close to each other the molecular orbitals between them are dislocated and overlapped after they reach a certain distance the interaction force between the outer electrons exceeds the critical force allowed by the molecules resulting in uneven energy distribution between the molecules thus forming the phenomenon of electrostatic repulsion liu et al 2022a it is difficult for paa to be adsorbed on the reaction site of the cmfo 0 5 surface for electron transfer process which reduces the number of active species generated and leads to a decrease in the performance of the system to degrade tch tetracycline antibiotics are typical amphoteric antibiotics and when the ph of the solution is greater than 7 7 it will exist in the form of an anion at this time the pollutants exist in the form of anions and it is difficult to adsorb them on the surface of the catalyst for advanced oxidation reaction even with these interferences the degradation rate of tch still reached 70 34 thus paa is stable in a wide ph range to degrade tch wastewater in addition the metal leaching concentrations at different ph were also examined fig s13 under acidic conditions metals are susceptible to erosion and leaching since the mw cmfo 0 5 paa system has the highest reaction rate constant at ph 7 there will be more active sites on the surface of cmfo 0 5 to participate in the reaction and the degree of metal leaching is also slightly higher meanwhile since the continuous decrease of ph in the experimental process when the initial ph was 3 5 and 7 the corrosion effect on the metal catalyst is continuously enhanced and the degree of metal ion leaching also increases due to the presence of oh under alkaline conditions it is easy to form precipitation with metal ions so the degree of leached metal is the lowest at initial ph of 11 2 ch3c o ooh h2o ch3c o oo h3o pka 8 2 3 2 3 influence of water parameters different concentrations of anion humus ha and water quality conditions often directly affect the removal ratios of pollutants it is necessary to study the impact of different environmental factors on the mw cmfo 0 5 paa system in fig 3 a as the concentration of ha in the reaction system increased the degradation ratio of tch was gradually suppressed ha is capable of occupying the surface active sites of the catalyst wang et al 2020b resulting in a decrease in the number of active species produced by the system to reduce the degradation effect of tch when the concentration of humus reached 7 mg l the efficiency and kobs of tch removal was only reduced by 16 2 and 0 3614 min 1 respectively the system still had the ability to degrade most of the tch which shows that it has excellent oxidation and anti interference abilities the presence of co3 2 hco3 in the system inhibited the degradation of tch but to a limited degree fig 3 b it has been reported that co3 2 hco3 can capture oh and inhibit the decomposition of paa to reduce the generation of r o wu et al 2020 although the reaction was inhibited the system still exhibited a strong tch degradation rate with 7 mm co3 2 hco3 90 62 of co3 2 and 85 95 of hco3 which was probably attributed to the non radical effect overcoming the anion inhibition in the presence of no3 and so4 2 the degradation rate of tch is not affected because these two anions hardly react with the active species produced by the system fig 3 c cl will occupy the reaction sites of the catalyst similarly to ha resulting in the reduction of active species produced by activated paa however cl as a negatively charged electron donor can provide electrons to paa and generate active species thereby promoting the degradation of tch eq 3 4 these combined effects determine that the degradation rate of tch is hardly affected in the presence of cl fig 3 d 3 oh cl cloh 4 ch3c o oo cl h cl ch3c o ooh the degradation efficiency of tch by the mw cmfo 0 5 paa system was evaluated in both tap water and surface water to evaluate its actual performance it was pleasantly surprised that the tch degradation efficiency in tap water and surface water was decreased only by 3 2 and 8 17 respectively fig 3 e the quality and components of these two waters are listed in table s2 the reason for this phenomenon may be that the composition of the actual water body is complex and the soluble organic matter contained in it will form a competitive relationship with pollutants which will slightly inhibit the system it can be concluded that the mw cmfo 0 5 paa system has good degradation ability in actual water treatment 3 2 4 reusability and stability of the catalyst the ft ir and xrd spectra of the catalysts before and after the reaction had little change to prove the stability of the cmfo 0 5 fig s14 s15 the degradation efficiency of tch decreased by only 11 4 after four cycle experiments which showed the excellent reusability of the cmfo 0 5 fig 3 f in addition the exudation amount of metal ions is also lower than the standard gb t 31 962 2015 3 3 mechanism of improved paa activation in mw cmfo 0 5 paa system 3 3 1 the thermal and non thermal effect of mw mw irradiation has a significant effect on improving tch degradation via paa catalytic oxidation thus the thermal and non thermal effects on mw were investigated in detail in this part the polar molecules in the reaction system will absorb energy under the selective action of microwaves and cause vibrational friction which will increase the temperature of the reaction system and form heat at the macroscopic level in a heterogeneous system it forms hot spots on the surface of the catalyst which accelerates part of the reaction gao et al 2021 reaction descriptions and thermodynamic analyses in the mw radiation regime are provided in fig s16 s17 and text s8 in addition the catalytic abilities toward tch degradation between water bath heating wh and mw irradiation under the same temperature were compared in fig s18 when the temperature was set at 30 c the removal rates of tch in the wh and mw system were 45 26 and 49 71 respectively the energy generated at this temperature is not sufficient to activate paa however when the temperature was set at 60 c under mw irradiation the removal rate of tch was 26 52 higher than that in the wh system it helps to explain non thermal effects on the deformation of internal molecules under the action of microwaves the main reason is that the polar molecule paa absorbs mw and vibrates strongly releasing energy to accelerate the reaction dai et al 2022 at the same time under the same conditions the wh cmfo 0 5 paa system achieved a tch removal efficiency of 72 09 and the thermal effect of mw was reflected showing the phenomenon that the dielectric material absorbs energy and converts it into heat energy under the action of mw irradiation the polar molecules are transformed from the original random thermal motion to the regular motion oriented in the direction of the electric field the intermolecular interaction force plays a role similar to internal friction converting the absorbed energy into heat energy which improves the degradation performance of the system gogoi et al 2022 meanwhile the wave absorbing properties of the materials were examined to analyze their responsiveness to microwave irradiation and the calculation methods are included in text s9 the real part of dielectric loss ε and magnetic loss μ of cmfo 0 5 tend to be stable in the range of 2 18 ghz while ε is less than mfo and μ is greater than mfo fig s19 the imaginary part of the dielectric loss ε and magnetic loss μ of mfo is higher than that of cmfo 0 5 the small dielectric loss of cmfo 0 5 means that the stronger binding ability to electrons with a result of higher internal electron density when it is introduced into the oxidation system there will be stronger and more electron transfer processes gao et al 2021 magnetic loss means that some energy in the reaction will be irreversibly converted to heat and it is found that the magnetic loss of cmfo 0 5 is smaller which indicates that the non thermal effect of the microwave has a greater impact on it meng et al 2022 the dielectric loss tangent tan δε ε ε and magnetic loss tangent tan δμ μ μ of the material were calculated fig 4 a d the large tan δε of mfo means that it has strong dielectric loss ability this phenomenon is manifested in the heating of materials which indicates that the thermal effect of microwaves has a great impact on mfo the fluctuation of tan δμ values of the two materials disclosed that there is relaxation loss in microwave absorption gao et al 2021 the value of the reflection loss directly determines the microwave absorption performance of the material based on the rules that a greater negative reflection loss represents the stronger microwave absorption performance wang et al 2021 at a bandwidth of 16 72 ghz the minimum rl value of the mfo is 18 07 db corresponding to a thickness of 1 mm fig 4 b c while the minimum rl value of the cmfo 0 5 at a bandwidth of 4 68 ghz is 21 81 db indicative of 4 mm in thickness fig 4 e f this suggests that cmfo 0 5 has stronger absorbing performance than mfo in aops systems under microwave irradiation materials with stronger wave absorbing properties are more capable of promoting the degradation process wang et al 2020c 3 3 2 cobalt substitution enhanced the oxygen species generation the optimized structures of mfo and cmfo 0 5 are shown in fig s20 and fig s21 the electron density at the fermi level of the two catalysts is not zero and both of them exhibit a certain metallicity fig 5 a b in the formation of the total density of states tdos of cmfo 0 5 co mn and fe have similar trends at 8 3 ev their co hybridization plays a key role in the formation of the total density of states and the three metal ions show a good interaction in addition after the substitution of the cobalt it can be found that the total density of states near the fermi level is higher than the original indicating that the overall internal electron density of cmfo 0 5 is stronger than that of mfo and it will exhibit good catalytic activation performance the raman scattering peak at 620 cm 1 is considered to be induced by the signal of typical metal oxygen vibrations which are the a1g vibrational modes of symmetrical stretching of oxygen atoms along the fe o bond in tetrahedral coordination fig 5 c the peak area of cmfo 0 5 at 620 cm 1 is larger than that of mfo also implying that cmfo 0 5 possesses a higher content of ovs in order to further verify the amount of ovs epr spectral analysis of mfo and cmfo 0 5 was conducted and results illustrated e that there are typical peaks around g 2 003 indicative of captured unpaired electrons due to the formation of ovs fig 5 d the peak intensity also proves that cmfo 0 5 contains a higher content of ovs combined with theoretical calculations it is known that cobalt substitution enhances the generation of ovs and its internal electron transfer efficiency 3 3 3 identification of oxygen species generation contributing to tch degradation in order to further analyze the mechanism of the degradation process xps analysis was performed on cmfo 0 5 before and after the reaction fig 5 e i the peak changes of fe mn and co elements and ovs indicate that they are all involved in the activation of paa text s10 in addition the quenching experiments were used to detect the active species production in the reaction system it has been reported that the catalytic activation of paa generates free radicals such as oh and r o kiejza et al 2021 yang et al 2022 after adding 25 mm tba to the system it was found that the tch degradation rate was inhibited by only 2 06 and the rate constant decreased from 0 6219 min 1 to 0 4915 min 1 fig 6 a generally tba is regarded as a quencher of oh due to its high reaction rate with oh k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 however it should be noted tba can still react with other radicals but at a slower reaction rater like with 1o2 at a k of 3 04 103 with so4 at a k of 4 0 105 gao et al 2022 therefore the addition of tba can reduce the tch reaction rate to a greater extent than the removal efficiency due to its possible reaction with other radicals when the concentration of tba was further increased to 100 mm the degradation rate of tch was only inhibited by 4 5 using p cba as the probe compound to further evaluate the contribution of oh k 5 0 109 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2021a it was found that only 7 37 of p cba was removed after 6 min fig s22 subsequently the results showed that the degradation of p cba was completely inhibited in the presence of 100 mm tba which confirmed the small contribution of oh to the mw paa cmfo 0 5 system similarly after adding 25 mm 50 mm and 100 mm meoh to the system the degradation efficiency of tch decreased by 6 38 13 97 and 16 1 respectively fig 6 b meoh is known to quench oh and r o simultaneously so r o does not play a leading role in the tch degradation process which is different from the previous results for paa activation using heterogeneous metal catalysts wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a the generation of ovs was analyzed in the characterization of the catalyst which was accompanied by the generation of 1o2 and o2 therefore furfuryl alcohol fa and p benzoquinone p bq were used to quench 1o2 and o2 respectively wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 as shown in fig 6 c after adding excess p bq to the system the degradation rate of tch dropped to 58 94 proving the involvement of o2 in the degradation tch degradation after adding 25 mm ffa to the system it was found that the degradation of tch was inhibited by 39 08 fig 6 d when the amount of ffa continued to increase to 100 mm tch was inhibited by 82 25 and the rate constant was directly reduced to 0 0323 min 1 the quenching experiments showed that radicals o2 r o and oh and non radical 1o2 were generated in the mw cmfo 0 5 paa system and 1o2 played a leading role in the degradation of tch in addition in order to analyze whether 1o2 would also be generated under wh conditions 100 mm ffa was added to the wh cmfo 0 5 paa system under the same conditions it was observed that the degradation rate of tch was reduced to 11 80 fig s23 manifesting the generation of 1o2 in the wh cmfo 0 5 paa system due to the presence of ovs in cmfo 0 5 although the energy produced by wh is smaller than that of mw as shown in fig 6 e h the epr experiment verified the existence of oh r o o2 and 1o2 active species in the system which was consistent with the results of the quenching experiment and the amount of active species produced also increased with the reaction time text s11 in order to further determine the source of 1o2 in the system a comparative test was carried out in the presence of high purity n2 and it was found that the degradation rate of tch was reduced to 52 33 fig 6 i however it is known from the quenching experiment of meoh that if only oh and r o are present 52 33 of tch will not be degraded subsequently the quenching experiments of p bq and ffa in the presence of n2 were carried out results depicted in fig 6 i demonstrated that the addition of p bq in the presence of n2 did not continue to inhibit the progress of the reaction meanwhile epr experiments were carried out in the presence of n2 and it was found that no o2 trapped signal was produced fig 6 g in the absence of o2 no generation of o2 indicating that the main source of o2 in the system is the transfer of electrons from o2 adsorbed on ovs however it should be noted that a characteristic peak of 1o2 was observed under n2 atmosphere fig 6 h but its peak intensity was weakened similarly the intensity of 1o2 epr capture signal also decrease after adding excess p bq to the system fig s24 these two phenomena suggested that superoxide radicals would partially contribute to 1o2 generation instead of its direct reaction with tch zheng et al 2022 moreover in the ffa quenching experiment in the presence of n2 the degradation rate of tch was inhibited by 32 04 compared with that in the presence of n2 alone these results implied there were other ways of generating 1o2 except for produced from the adsorbed oxygen on ovs from the xps spectra of o 1 s of cmfo 0 5 before and after the reaction it can be seen that the peak of adsorbed hydroxyl groups become smaller after the reaction which indicates that there are active oxygen species o on the surface of the catalyst itself and participate in the reaction process which reacts with paa to form 1o2 in addition the addition of ffa was found to have obvious inhibition on tch degradation in the mw paa system which also verifies that the energy generated by mw can activate paa to generate peroxy group and further react to generate 1o2 fig s25 dai et al 2022 in order to further analyze the effect of co substitution the quenching experiment of the mw mfo paa system is shown in fig s26 it can be found that in the presence of tba and meoh the degradation of tch decreased from 68 97 to 62 12 and 25 21 respectively compared with other quenching experiments it can be concluded that r o in the mw mfo paa system plays a major role in the degradation of tch however the presence of ovs after co substitution resulted in the generation of abundant 1o2 and the non radical dominated system is not easily disturbed by environmental factors based on the above experimental results the pathway for the production of active species was deduced in the mw cmfo 0 5 paa system fig 7 firstly due to the non thermal effects of microwave and the influence of the dielectric properties of microwave irradiated materials abundant hot spots will be formed on the surface of the catalyst the hot spots not only have the appearance of a macro heat field but also has the acceleration of local electron transfer and the vibration and friction of polar molecules in the system gao and zou 2020 under the influence of the hot spot effect metal ions and paa can generate ch3c o o ch3c o oo and a small amount of oh through electron transfer to self decompose ch3 and co2 eq 6 9 ch3 is unstable under the condition and it will easily react with oxygen to generate ch3 o o and ch3c o oo can also be formed by the reaction of excess paa with ch3c o oo eq 10 11 the ovs induced by cobalt substitution can be used as reaction sites and charge separation points which can adsorb oxygen in the air on the oxygen vacancies to transfer electrons to form o2 and then disproportionate to form 1o2 eq 12 13 in addition the active oxygen attached to the catalyst itself would directly react with paa to generate 1o2 eq 14 the excellent mw absorbing properties of cmfo 0 5 enhance the ability of its surfaced ovs to transfer electrons under mw irradiation and the energy generated by the non thermal effect of mw also can dissociate paa to attack the central c atom to generate 1o2 eq 15 6 co2 mn2 fe2 ch3c o ooh co3 mn3 fe3 ch3c o o oh 7 co2 mn2 fe2 ch3c o ooh co3 mn3

ms detection the fukui index can determine whether electrophilic nucleophilic or radical reactions occur a greater absolute value of the fukui index of an atom is beneficial for accepting or providing electrons at the atom fig 8 a the size of the mulliken bond can determine the strength of the covalent bond and whether it is easy to break fig 8 b it can be seen from table s3 that the fukui values of c 16 c 18 and o 23 are large indicating that they are vulnerable to o2 c 16 c 25 and o 27 are mainly attacked by 1o2 because of their large fukui values c 16 o 23 and o 27 have larger fukui 0

of tch was proposed in fig 8 c tch was firstly hydrolyzed in aqueous solution to generate p1 tetracycline tc m z 445 which subsequently underwent oxidative degradation through three pathways in pathway i the oh produced by the system induces the hydroxylation of p1 to form p2 m z 461 after that the cn bond in p2 is broken to further generate p5 m z 305 and p5 undergoes a dehydrogenation reaction to generate p9 m z 298 p1 is demethylated in pathway ii to generate p3 m z 433 and p3 is demethylated through cc bond and co bond cleavage and deamination to generate p6 m z 312 and p7 m z 340 respectively c16 and c18 are easily attacked by active species so co bond cleavage and heterocyclic ring opening reaction will occur to further generate p10 m z 186 and p11 m z 162 from p6 and p7 due to the instability of some enol structures in p1 it is easy to convert to ketone structure p4 m z 351 pathway iii p4 continues to generate p8 m z 253 through ring opening and p8 generates p12 m z 122 through dehydrogenation and ring opening the intermediates were further degraded into small molecules such as p13 m z 146 p14 m z 72 and p15 m z 90 through these three pathways ultimately these products are mineralized to form h2o and co2 according to toxicity classification the chronic toxicity value of tch to fish was 9 07 mg l which was classified as toxic fig 9 ma et al 2020 all intermediate products were transformed into p13 p14 and p15 products with less toxicity than tch it indicated that the mw cmfo 0 5 paa process was an ecologically safe high efficiency fast method to degrade tch in water treatment 4 conclusion this study successfully demonstrated the good catalytic performance of cmfo 0 5 for paa activation to degrade tch under microwave system via the synergistic effect of mw and ovs the degradation efficiency of 98 61 tch was achieved within 6 min under initial ph of 7 and satisfied tch removal can still be observed in different anions and waters experiments via epr tests and quenching experiments it s found the generation of oh r o o2 and 1o2 in the system however according to the quenching experiments results it s revealed that 1o2 rather than r o and o2 played an important and direct role in tch degradation the ovs induced by cobalt substitution can be used as reaction sites and charge separation points which can adsorb oxygen in the air on the oxygen vacancies to transfer electrons to form o2 and then disproportionate to form 1o2 the excellent mw absorbing properties of cmfo 0 5 enhanced the ability of its surfaced ovs to transfer electrons under mw irradiation and the energy generated by the non thermal effect of mw also can dissociate paa to attack the central c atom to generate 1o2 furthermore the toxicity of tch intermediate products degraded by the mw cmfo 0 5 paa system was evaluated and analyzed via the ecosar with a result of successful detoxification this study provides a new strategy to improve the oxidation ability and water matrix resistance capacity of paa activation system which benefits the practical application of paa based technology for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors

15460,high microwave response cobalt substituted manganese ferrite cmfo 0 5 was successfully synthesized as a heterogeneous catalyst for efficient peracetic acid paa activation and tetracycline hydrochloride tch degradation with singlet oxygen 1o2 as the dominated reactive oxidized species ros the removal efficiency of tch could reach 98 16 within 6 min under microwave irradiation when the cmfo 0 5 was added at 20 mg l it s found that the co substitution could produce the oxygen vacancies ovs improve the microwave mw absorbing performance and enhance the internal electron transfer efficiency of materials the phenomenon why 1o2 as the dominated ros rather than hydroxyl radical oh and organic radicals r o would be explained by the following aspects the oxygen adsorbed on the ovs can accept the electron transformed from paa to form superoxide radical o2 which will disproportionate to form 1o2 the energy generated by the non thermal effect of mw can dissociate paa to generate peroxy group for 1o2 generation furthermore the possible tch degradation pathways were proposed based on dft theory calculations and product identification and the toxicity predictions of the degradation products were also performed by the ecological structure activity relationship model ecosar software additionally the decrease of acute toxicity of treated tch excellent stability and strong resistance towards water matrix fully demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system for practical application in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

found that the consumption of antibiotics had increased by 39 from 2000 to 2015 reaching 42 3 billion defined daily doses ddds in 76 countries klein et al 2018 excessive use of antibiotics could lead to the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args whose access into humans and animals would promote the spread of args greatly reducing the original potential of antibiotic treatment sun et al 2021 tetracycline hydrochloride tch as a famous broad spectrum antibacterial agent has an excellent inhibitory effect on most gram positive and gram negative bacteria duan et al 2022 the massive accumulation of residual tetracycline in the water due to overuse of tch would induce serious impacts on the ecosystem and public health removal of these antibiotics is required and can be realized by advanced oxidation processes aops depending on the due to the strong oxidizing ability of generated reactive oxidized species ros in recent years peracetic acid paa has received increasing attention as a new oxidant because paa aops have advantages such as low dependence on ph value in the environment high sterilization ability and generation of few toxic by products compared with aops such as photocatalysis and fenton process wan et al 2021 yu et al 2021a yu et al 2021b however without the activation of paa a large number of refractory organic pollutants can not be directly degraded zhang et al 2021a at present the methods of activating paa mainly include ultraviolet uv irradiation transition metals and so on he et al 2022 uv irradiation could activate paa by breaking the oo bond resulting in the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh and acetyloxyl radicals ch3c o o zhu and liu 2022 in a homogeneous system paa can also be activated by co2 and ru3 to produce acetylperoxy radicals ch3c o oo and ch3c o o li et al 2021 wang et al 2019 unfortunately homogeneous activation paa faces secondary pollution caused by the harmful metal ions yang et al 2022 it is worthwhile to explore new types of heterogeneous catalysts for paa activation which are easier to separate from water and recycle spinel ferrites used as catalysts in aops have received widespread attention due to their high magnetism and stability ding et al 2021 among them mnfe2o4 mfo has the advantages of low environmental toxicity and good structural stability but its high saturation magnetization easily leads to agglomeration with a result of decrease in active sites qin et al 2020 it is necessary to explore a simple and effective method to further enhance the catalytic performance of mfo substitution of a third metal on the spinel ferrites has been proposed as a good strategy to further improve their catalytic performance since substitution of a or b sites in the spinel structure will generate oxygen vacancies ovs and the introduction of new transition metal will also participate in the reaction substitution of cu successfully improved the pms activation ability of znfe2o4 catalyst to degrade pollutants and the optimum performance can be reached when cu cu fe was 0 5 moreover introduction of cu can induce the generation of singlet oxygen yu et al 2019 it should be noted that singlet oxygen 1o2 shows stronger resistance to environmental interference and higher degradation selectivity in comparison with other radicals wei et al 2022 for instance 500 mm cl reacted with organic radicals r o ch3c o oo and ch3c o o to inhibit the degradation rate of orange g by 54 wu et al 2020 as such stimulating the production of singlet oxygen 1o2 in the paa based system would be promising for its practical application while which probably will be realized by the introduction of ovs on the mfo but still needs further exploration in addition in the microwave mw field manganese ferrite with high saturation magnetization and dielectric constant can absorb microwaves and quickly convert the absorbed mw energy into heat energy it can selectively heat the mw absorbing phases and components in the material without causing energy waste further boosting the reactivity of catalysts li et al 2018 more importantly the mw effect can also promote the electron transfer on the catalyst surface and subsequently the adsorbed oxygen would react with e to form superoxide radical o2 wang et al 2020c so far o2 disproportionation is the most commonly used method for 1o2 generation zhang et al 2021b as such it can be speculated that the simultaneous introduction of ovs via substitution of a third metal and mw would be a good strategy to improve paa activation and 1o2 generation generally co2 has been considered as one of the effective activators for paa process wang et al 2019 the substitution of mfo by co is capable of improving its catalytic performance co element can modify the lattice and improve the physical and chemical properties of the catalyst li et al 2022 moreover studies have shown that co substituted mfo can exhibit various electrical and magnetic properties which will be more responsive to the mw system narayanaswamy et al 2021 herein a co substituted mfo activating paa system with good cycling stability was firstly designed aiming for enhanced singlet oxygen 1o2 generation high microwave response and strong resistance towards water matrix in this study coxmn1 xfe2o4 cmfo x prepared via mw assisted hydrothermal synthesis was characterized and tested for activating paa to degrade tch the effects of catalyst dose paa concentration mw conditions initial pollutant concentration initial ph humic acid ha various anions and other variables on the experiment were investigated the degradation mechanism was studied in detail via the quenching experiment epr capture experiments the degradation pathway of tch and dft theoretical calculation this research reported the excellent performance of cmfo x to activate paa under mw irradiation for the tch degradation which would broaden the application potential of paa based aops in the field of wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials information about all chemicals and reagents are provided in text s1 the preparation and characterization methods of cmfo 0 5 are detailed in text s2 and text s3 except for experiments with different water bodies all experiments were conducted with ultrapure water 18 25 m ω cm 2 2 batch experiments see text s4 for specific details of degradation experiments considering the possible interference of the buffer the ph was not controlled by the buffer during the reaction and the initial ph was used for all experiments all batch experiments were conducted at least twice details of analysis methods are provided in text s5 2 3 theoretical calculation the materials studio software based on density functional theory dft was used to perform the calculations for this experiment and the corresponding operating parameters were provided in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of catalysts the morphologies of both mfo and cmfo 0 5 were observed to be spherical in scanning electron microscope sem images fig 1 a b further analysis showed that the particle size of the catalyst became smaller after cobalt substitution fig s2 and eds also verified the successful incorporation of cobalt fig 1 c and fig s3 fig 1 d e are the x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir spectra of the catalyst respectively it clearly demonstrated that the substitution of cobalt makes the crystal form sharper accelerates the stretching frequency of metal o bonds and reduces the specific surface area which has a favorable effect on the improvement of catalytic performance text s7 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used to analyze the surface species composition of mfo and cmfo 0 5 in fig s6 the peaks of co 2p 3 2 represented co3 and co2 779 3 and 781 1 ev and co 2p 1 2 795 5 ev could be observed with two satellite peaks 785 8 and 795 5 ev in the xps spectrum of co fig 1 f li et al 2020 the peaks belonging to mn2 mn3 fe2 and fe3 could be clearly identified in the high resolution spectrum of mn and fe of both two samples fig 1 g h liu et al 2022b zhang et al 2022 the high resolution spectrum of oxygen at 529 31 and 530 79 ev in the mfo spectrum were represented by lattice oxygen and surface adsorbed hydroxy species of the catalyst respectively fig 1 i when cobalt was substituted into mfo the lattice oxygen peak shifted toward lower binding energy and a new strong peak representing ovs is detected at 530 14 ev ovs is a kind of metal oxide defect the essence of which is that the metal oxide causes the detachment of oxygen in the lattice in a specific external environment the existence of defects plays a crucial role in catalyzing some reactions when cobalt is introduced the lattice oxygen of mfo is released in the process which contributes to the formation of ovs in the catalyst at the same time due to the appearance of ovs oxygen species would adsorb on the catalyst surface zhou et al 2021 3 2 cobalt substitution enhanced the catalytic performance of the mfo 3 2 1 performance of cmfo 0 5 on activating paa under mw irradiation the effect of different dosages of cobalt substitution was explored and mw cmfo 0 5 paa was determined as the best reaction system fig s7 it s clearly observed that the degradation ratio of tch reached the maximum value 98 61 within 5 min fig 2 a the system also has the largest reaction rate constant which was 7 25 times higher than that without mw irradiation and the degree of decomposition of paa fig 2 b commercial paa solutions contain h2o2 which can also cause the degradation of pollutants and the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh however only 8 74 tch was removed in the mw cmfo 0 5 h2o2 system under the same conditions indicating that h2o2 contained in paa does not play a major role fig s8 meanwhile the effect of the leached metal ions on the degradation of tch in the mw cmfo 0 5 paa system was also negligible fig s9 in addition regardless of the presence or absence of mw the removal rate of tch does not exceed 4 in 6 min when only catalyst was used implying the negligible role of tch adsorption on the cmfo 0 5 during the whole reaction process moreover the degradation ratio of tch is only 12 93 when only paa exists although the electron donating groups e g ch3 and oh of tch can enhance the oxidation of paa the selectivity of paa is too high to directly oxidize tch kim and huang 2021 since paa will decompose to form acetic acid eq 1 with a stronger acidity the ph value during the reaction decreased slightly with time fig s10 but the effect on the degradation of tch can be ignored the change of toc during the degradation process is shown in fig s11 and it can be observed that the addition of paa to initiate the reaction will generate a higher level of toc because paa is an organic acid both itself and its by products are carbon based organics which will affect the detection of toc combining paa aops with biological treatment may be a promising option because paa aops can increase toc in wastewater after treatment which can serve as a good carbon source for microorganisms wang et al 2020a wu et al 2020 1 2ch3c o ooh 2ch3c o oh o2 3 2 2 influence of reaction parameters as presented in fig 2 c when the initial dose of cmfo 0 5 was 5 10 15 and 20 mg l the degradation rates of tch were 85 95 89 96 94 82 and 98 61 respectively higher catalyst dosage means more reaction sites and the degradation performance increases accordingly however when the amount of cmfo 0 5 was 25 mg l the degradation rate of tch was hardly changed because the utilization of the active sites on the catalyst surface reached the maximum when the dosage of paa was increased from 50 μm to 250 μm the degradation ratio of tch enhanced from 78 96 to 98 61 fig 2 d thus the dosage of cmfo 0 5 and paa was chosen as 20 mg l and 250 μm in the following study respectively the impact of initial concentrations of tch and ph value was also investigated with results displayed in fig 2 e f when the initial concentration of tch was increased from 5 μm to 30 μm the degradation efficiency can still reach 85 54 it can be seen that the degradation efficiency of tch is the highest at neutral ph paa can undergo acid base dissociation due to the changes in ph which produces a conjugate base under alkaline conditions paa eq 2 zhang et al 2021a moreover the phiep of cmfo 0 5 is 3 33 fig s12 manifesting that it is negatively charged under alkaline conditions and it will produce electrostatic repulsion with paa when the negatively charged catalyst and paa are close to each other the molecular orbitals between them are dislocated and overlapped after they reach a certain distance the interaction force between the outer electrons exceeds the critical force allowed by the molecules resulting in uneven energy distribution between the molecules thus forming the phenomenon of electrostatic repulsion liu et al 2022a it is difficult for paa to be adsorbed on the reaction site of the cmfo 0 5 surface for electron transfer process which reduces the number of active species generated and leads to a decrease in the performance of the system to degrade tch tetracycline antibiotics are typical amphoteric antibiotics and when the ph of the solution is greater than 7 7 it will exist in the form of an anion at this time the pollutants exist in the form of anions and it is difficult to adsorb them on the surface of the catalyst for advanced oxidation reaction even with these interferences the degradation rate of tch still reached 70 34 thus paa is stable in a wide ph range to degrade tch wastewater in addition the metal leaching concentrations at different ph were also examined fig s13 under acidic conditions metals are susceptible to erosion and leaching since the mw cmfo 0 5 paa system has the highest reaction rate constant at ph 7 there will be more active sites on the surface of cmfo 0 5 to participate in the reaction and the degree of metal leaching is also slightly higher meanwhile since the continuous decrease of ph in the experimental process when the initial ph was 3 5 and 7 the corrosion effect on the metal catalyst is continuously enhanced and the degree of metal ion leaching also increases due to the presence of oh under alkaline conditions it is easy to form precipitation with metal ions so the degree of leached metal is the lowest at initial ph of 11 2 ch3c o ooh h2o ch3c o oo h3o pka 8 2 3 2 3 influence of water parameters different concentrations of anion humus ha and water quality conditions often directly affect the removal ratios of pollutants it is necessary to study the impact of different environmental factors on the mw cmfo 0 5 paa system in fig 3 a as the concentration of ha in the reaction system increased the degradation ratio of tch was gradually suppressed ha is capable of occupying the surface active sites of the catalyst wang et al 2020b resulting in a decrease in the number of active species produced by the system to reduce the degradation effect of tch when the concentration of humus reached 7 mg l the efficiency and kobs of tch removal was only reduced by 16 2 and 0 3614 min 1 respectively the system still had the ability to degrade most of the tch which shows that it has excellent oxidation and anti interference abilities the presence of co3 2 hco3 in the system inhibited the degradation of tch but to a limited degree fig 3 b it has been reported that co3 2 hco3 can capture oh and inhibit the decomposition of paa to reduce the generation of r o wu et al 2020 although the reaction was inhibited the system still exhibited a strong tch degradation rate with 7 mm co3 2 hco3 90 62 of co3 2 and 85 95 of hco3 which was probably attributed to the non radical effect overcoming the anion inhibition in the presence of no3 and so4 2 the degradation rate of tch is not affected because these two anions hardly react with the active species produced by the system fig 3 c cl will occupy the reaction sites of the catalyst similarly to ha resulting in the reduction of active species produced by activated paa however cl as a negatively charged electron donor can provide electrons to paa and generate active species thereby promoting the degradation of tch eq 3 4 these combined effects determine that the degradation rate of tch is hardly affected in the presence of cl fig 3 d 3 oh cl cloh 4 ch3c o oo cl h cl ch3c o ooh the degradation efficiency of tch by the mw cmfo 0 5 paa system was evaluated in both tap water and surface water to evaluate its actual performance it was pleasantly surprised that the tch degradation efficiency in tap water and surface water was decreased only by 3 2 and 8 17 respectively fig 3 e the quality and components of these two waters are listed in table s2 the reason for this phenomenon may be that the composition of the actual water body is complex and the soluble organic matter contained in it will form a competitive relationship with pollutants which will slightly inhibit the system it can be concluded that the mw cmfo 0 5 paa system has good degradation ability in actual water treatment 3 2 4 reusability and stability of the catalyst the ft ir and xrd spectra of the catalysts before and after the reaction had little change to prove the stability of the cmfo 0 5 fig s14 s15 the degradation efficiency of tch decreased by only 11 4 after four cycle experiments which showed the excellent reusability of the cmfo 0 5 fig 3 f in addition the exudation amount of metal ions is also lower than the standard gb t 31 962 2015 3 3 mechanism of improved paa activation in mw cmfo 0 5 paa system 3 3 1 the thermal and non thermal effect of mw mw irradiation has a significant effect on improving tch degradation via paa catalytic oxidation thus the thermal and non thermal effects on mw were investigated in detail in this part the polar molecules in the reaction system will absorb energy under the selective action of microwaves and cause vibrational friction which will increase the temperature of the reaction system and form heat at the macroscopic level in a heterogeneous system it forms hot spots on the surface of the catalyst which accelerates part of the reaction gao et al 2021 reaction descriptions and thermodynamic analyses in the mw radiation regime are provided in fig s16 s17 and text s8 in addition the catalytic abilities toward tch degradation between water bath heating wh and mw irradiation under the same temperature were compared in fig s18 when the temperature was set at 30 c the removal rates of tch in the wh and mw system were 45 26 and 49 71 respectively the energy generated at this temperature is not sufficient to activate paa however when the temperature was set at 60 c under mw irradiation the removal rate of tch was 26 52 higher than that in the wh system it helps to explain non thermal effects on the deformation of internal molecules under the action of microwaves the main reason is that the polar molecule paa absorbs mw and vibrates strongly releasing energy to accelerate the reaction dai et al 2022 at the same time under the same conditions the wh cmfo 0 5 paa system achieved a tch removal efficiency of 72 09 and the thermal effect of mw was reflected showing the phenomenon that the dielectric material absorbs energy and converts it into heat energy under the action of mw irradiation the polar molecules are transformed from the original random thermal motion to the regular motion oriented in the direction of the electric field the intermolecular interaction force plays a role similar to internal friction converting the absorbed energy into heat energy which improves the degradation performance of the system gogoi et al 2022 meanwhile the wave absorbing properties of the materials were examined to analyze their responsiveness to microwave irradiation and the calculation methods are included in text s9 the real part of dielectric loss ε and magnetic loss μ of cmfo 0 5 tend to be stable in the range of 2 18 ghz while ε is less than mfo and μ is greater than mfo fig s19 the imaginary part of the dielectric loss ε and magnetic loss μ of mfo is higher than that of cmfo 0 5 the small dielectric loss of cmfo 0 5 means that the stronger binding ability to electrons with a result of higher internal electron density when it is introduced into the oxidation system there will be stronger and more electron transfer processes gao et al 2021 magnetic loss means that some energy in the reaction will be irreversibly converted to heat and it is found that the magnetic loss of cmfo 0 5 is smaller which indicates that the non thermal effect of the microwave has a greater impact on it meng et al 2022 the dielectric loss tangent tan δε ε ε and magnetic loss tangent tan δμ μ μ of the material were calculated fig 4 a d the large tan δε of mfo means that it has strong dielectric loss ability this phenomenon is manifested in the heating of materials which indicates that the thermal effect of microwaves has a great impact on mfo the fluctuation of tan δμ values of the two materials disclosed that there is relaxation loss in microwave absorption gao et al 2021 the value of the reflection loss directly determines the microwave absorption performance of the material based on the rules that a greater negative reflection loss represents the stronger microwave absorption performance wang et al 2021 at a bandwidth of 16 72 ghz the minimum rl value of the mfo is 18 07 db corresponding to a thickness of 1 mm fig 4 b c while the minimum rl value of the cmfo 0 5 at a bandwidth of 4 68 ghz is 21 81 db indicative of 4 mm in thickness fig 4 e f this suggests that cmfo 0 5 has stronger absorbing performance than mfo in aops systems under microwave irradiation materials with stronger wave absorbing properties are more capable of promoting the degradation process wang et al 2020c 3 3 2 cobalt substitution enhanced the oxygen species generation the optimized structures of mfo and cmfo 0 5 are shown in fig s20 and fig s21 the electron density at the fermi level of the two catalysts is not zero and both of them exhibit a certain metallicity fig 5 a b in the formation of the total density of states tdos of cmfo 0 5 co mn and fe have similar trends at 8 3 ev their co hybridization plays a key role in the formation of the total density of states and the three metal ions show a good interaction in addition after the substitution of the cobalt it can be found that the total density of states near the fermi level is higher than the original indicating that the overall internal electron density of cmfo 0 5 is stronger than that of mfo and it will exhibit good catalytic activation performance the raman scattering peak at 620 cm 1 is considered to be induced by the signal of typical metal oxygen vibrations which are the a1g vibrational modes of symmetrical stretching of oxygen atoms along the fe o bond in tetrahedral coordination fig 5 c the peak area of cmfo 0 5 at 620 cm 1 is larger than that of mfo also implying that cmfo 0 5 possesses a higher content of ovs in order to further verify the amount of ovs epr spectral analysis of mfo and cmfo 0 5 was conducted and results illustrated e that there are typical peaks around g 2 003 indicative of captured unpaired electrons due to the formation of ovs fig 5 d the peak intensity also proves that cmfo 0 5 contains a higher content of ovs combined with theoretical calculations it is known that cobalt substitution enhances the generation of ovs and its internal electron transfer efficiency 3 3 3 identification of oxygen species generation contributing to tch degradation in order to further analyze the mechanism of the degradation process xps analysis was performed on cmfo 0 5 before and after the reaction fig 5 e i the peak changes of fe mn and co elements and ovs indicate that they are all involved in the activation of paa text s10 in addition the quenching experiments were used to detect the active species production in the reaction system it has been reported that the catalytic activation of paa generates free radicals such as oh and r o kiejza et al 2021 yang et al 2022 after adding 25 mm tba to the system it was found that the tch degradation rate was inhibited by only 2 06 and the rate constant decreased from 0 6219 min 1 to 0 4915 min 1 fig 6 a generally tba is regarded as a quencher of oh due to its high reaction rate with oh k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 however it should be noted tba can still react with other radicals but at a slower reaction rater like with 1o2 at a k of 3 04 103 with so4 at a k of 4 0 105 gao et al 2022 therefore the addition of tba can reduce the tch reaction rate to a greater extent than the removal efficiency due to its possible reaction with other radicals when the concentration of tba was further increased to 100 mm the degradation rate of tch was only inhibited by 4 5 using p cba as the probe compound to further evaluate the contribution of oh k 5 0 109 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2021a it was found that only 7 37 of p cba was removed after 6 min fig s22 subsequently the results showed that the degradation of p cba was completely inhibited in the presence of 100 mm tba which confirmed the small contribution of oh to the mw paa cmfo 0 5 system similarly after adding 25 mm 50 mm and 100 mm meoh to the system the degradation efficiency of tch decreased by 6 38 13 97 and 16 1 respectively fig 6 b meoh is known to quench oh and r o simultaneously so r o does not play a leading role in the tch degradation process which is different from the previous results for paa activation using heterogeneous metal catalysts wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a the generation of ovs was analyzed in the characterization of the catalyst which was accompanied by the generation of 1o2 and o2 therefore furfuryl alcohol fa and p benzoquinone p bq were used to quench 1o2 and o2 respectively wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 as shown in fig 6 c after adding excess p bq to the system the degradation rate of tch dropped to 58 94 proving the involvement of o2 in the degradation tch degradation after adding 25 mm ffa to the system it was found that the degradation of tch was inhibited by 39 08 fig 6 d when the amount of ffa continued to increase to 100 mm tch was inhibited by 82 25 and the rate constant was directly reduced to 0 0323 min 1 the quenching experiments showed that radicals o2 r o and oh and non radical 1o2 were generated in the mw cmfo 0 5 paa system and 1o2 played a leading role in the degradation of tch in addition in order to analyze whether 1o2 would also be generated under wh conditions 100 mm ffa was added to the wh cmfo 0 5 paa system under the same conditions it was observed that the degradation rate of tch was reduced to 11 80 fig s23 manifesting the generation of 1o2 in the wh cmfo 0 5 paa system due to the presence of ovs in cmfo 0 5 although the energy produced by wh is smaller than that of mw as shown in fig 6 e h the epr experiment verified the existence of oh r o o2 and 1o2 active species in the system which was consistent with the results of the quenching experiment and the amount of active species produced also increased with the reaction time text s11 in order to further determine the source of 1o2 in the system a comparative test was carried out in the presence of high purity n2 and it was found that the degradation rate of tch was reduced to 52 33 fig 6 i however it is known from the quenching experiment of meoh that if only oh and r o are present 52 33 of tch will not be degraded subsequently the quenching experiments of p bq and ffa in the presence of n2 were carried out results depicted in fig 6 i demonstrated that the addition of p bq in the presence of n2 did not continue to inhibit the progress of the reaction meanwhile epr experiments were carried out in the presence of n2 and it was found that no o2 trapped signal was produced fig 6 g in the absence of o2 no generation of o2 indicating that the main source of o2 in the system is the transfer of electrons from o2 adsorbed on ovs however it should be noted that a characteristic peak of 1o2 was observed under n2 atmosphere fig 6 h but its peak intensity was weakened similarly the intensity of 1o2 epr capture signal also decrease after adding excess p bq to the system fig s24 these two phenomena suggested that superoxide radicals would partially contribute to 1o2 generation instead of its direct reaction with tch zheng et al 2022 moreover in the ffa quenching experiment in the presence of n2 the degradation rate of tch was inhibited by 32 04 compared with that in the presence of n2 alone these results implied there were other ways of generating 1o2 except for produced from the adsorbed oxygen on ovs from the xps spectra of o 1 s of cmfo 0 5 before and after the reaction it can be seen that the peak of adsorbed hydroxyl groups become smaller after the reaction which indicates that there are active oxygen species o on the surface of the catalyst itself and participate in the reaction process which reacts with paa to form 1o2 in addition the addition of ffa was found to have obvious inhibition on tch degradation in the mw paa system which also verifies that the energy generated by mw can activate paa to generate peroxy group and further react to generate 1o2 fig s25 dai et al 2022 in order to further analyze the effect of co substitution the quenching experiment of the mw mfo paa system is shown in fig s26 it can be found that in the presence of tba and meoh the degradation of tch decreased from 68 97 to 62 12 and 25 21 respectively compared with other quenching experiments it can be concluded that r o in the mw mfo paa system plays a major role in the degradation of tch however the presence of ovs after co substitution resulted in the generation of abundant 1o2 and the non radical dominated system is not easily disturbed by environmental factors based on the above experimental results the pathway for the production of active species was deduced in the mw cmfo 0 5 paa system fig 7 firstly due to the non thermal effects of microwave and the influence of the dielectric properties of microwave irradiated materials abundant hot spots will be formed on the surface of the catalyst the hot spots not only have the appearance of a macro heat field but also has the acceleration of local electron transfer and the vibration and friction of polar molecules in the system gao and zou 2020 under the influence of the hot spot effect metal ions and paa can generate ch3c o o ch3c o oo and a small amount of oh through electron transfer to self decompose ch3 and co2 eq 6 9 ch3 is unstable under the condition and it will easily react with oxygen to generate ch3 o o and ch3c o oo can also be formed by the reaction of excess paa with ch3c o oo eq 10 11 the ovs induced by cobalt substitution can be used as reaction sites and charge separation points which can adsorb oxygen in the air on the oxygen vacancies to transfer electrons to form o2 and then disproportionate to form 1o2 eq 12 13 in addition the active oxygen attached to the catalyst itself would directly react with paa to generate 1o2 eq 14 the excellent mw absorbing properties of cmfo 0 5 enhance the ability of its surfaced ovs to transfer electrons under mw irradiation and the energy generated by the non thermal effect of mw also can dissociate paa to attack the central c atom to generate 1o2 eq 15 6 co2 mn2 fe2 ch3c o ooh co3 mn3 fe3 ch3c o o oh 7 co2 mn2 fe2 ch3c o ooh co3 mn3

ms detection the fukui index can determine whether electrophilic nucleophilic or radical reactions occur a greater absolute value of the fukui index of an atom is beneficial for accepting or providing electrons at the atom fig 8 a the size of the mulliken bond can determine the strength of the covalent bond and whether it is easy to break fig 8 b it can be seen from table s3 that the fukui values of c 16 c 18 and o 23 are large indicating that they are vulnerable to o2 c 16 c 25 and o 27 are mainly attacked by 1o2 because of their large fukui values c 16 o 23 and o 27 have larger fukui 0 values which are susceptible to 1o2 o2 r o and oh attacks h14 n1 h12 o6 h9 o1 h13 n1 h11 o4 h24 o8 h10 o3 c16 o6 c20 n2 c12 o4 c11 o3 c7 o8 c3 o1 and c21 n2 are easily broken due to their smaller bond numbers table s4 degradation products of samples collected at every 2 min were detected by ultra performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry uplc ms fig s27 and a possible degradation pathway of tch was proposed in fig 8 c tch was firstly hydrolyzed in aqueous solution to generate p1 tetracycline tc m z 445 which subsequently underwent oxidative degradation through three pathways in pathway i the oh produced by the system induces the hydroxylation of p1 to form p2 m z 461 after that the cn bond in p2 is broken to further generate p5 m z 305 and p5 undergoes a dehydrogenation reaction to generate p9 m z 298 p1 is demethylated in pathway ii to generate p3 m z 433 and p3 is demethylated through cc bond and co bond cleavage and deamination to generate p6 m z 312 and p7 m z 340 respectively c16 and c18 are easily attacked by active species so co bond cleavage and heterocyclic ring opening reaction will occur to further generate p10 m z 186 and p11 m z 162 from p6 and p7 due to the instability of some enol structures in p1 it is easy to convert to ketone structure p4 m z 351 pathway iii p4 continues to generate p8 m z 253 through ring opening and p8 generates p12 m z 122 through dehydrogenation and ring opening the intermediates were further degraded into small molecules such as p13 m z 146 p14 m z 72 and p15 m z 90 through these three pathways ultimately these products are mineralized to form h2o and co2 according to toxicity classification the chronic toxicity value of tch to fish was 9 07 mg l which was classified as toxic fig 9 ma et al 2020 all intermediate products were transformed into p13 p14 and p15 products with less toxicity than tch it indicated that the mw cmfo 0 5 paa process was an ecologically safe high efficiency fast method to degrade tch in water treatment 4 conclusion this study successfully demonstrated the good catalytic performance of cmfo 0 5 for paa activation to degrade tch under microwave system via the synergistic effect of mw and ovs the degradation efficiency of 98 61 tch was achieved within 6 min under initial ph of 7 and satisfied tch removal can still be observed in different anions and waters experiments via epr tests and quenching experiments it s found the generation of oh r o o2 and 1o2 in the system however according to the quenching experiments results it s revealed that 1o2 rather than r o and o2 played an important and direct role in tch degradation the ovs induced by cobalt substitution can be used as reaction sites and charge separation points which can adsorb oxygen in the air on the oxygen vacancies to transfer electrons to form o2 and then disproportionate to form 1o2 the excellent mw absorbing properties of cmfo 0 5 enhanced the ability of its surfaced ovs to transfer electrons under mw irradiation and the energy generated by the non thermal effect of mw also can dissociate paa to attack the central c atom to generate 1o2 furthermore the toxicity of tch intermediate products degraded by the mw cmfo 0 5 paa system was evaluated and analyzed via the ecosar with a result of successful detoxification this study provides a new strategy to improve the oxidation ability and water matrix resistance capacity of paa activation system which benefits the practical application of paa based technology for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors

15461,addition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is a promising method to acutely suppress cyanobacterial blooms in lakes however a reliable h2o2 risk assessment to identify potential effects on non target species is currently hampered by a lack of appropriate ecotoxicity data the aim of the present study was therefore to quantify the responses of a wide diversity of freshwater phytoplankton zooplankton and macroinvertebrates to h2o2 treatments of cyanobacterial blooms to this end we applied a multifaceted approach first we investigated the 24 h toxicity of h2o2 to three cyanobacteria planktothrix agardhii microcystis aeruginosa anabaena sp and 23 non target species six green algae eight zooplankton and nine macroinvertebrate taxa using ec50 values based on photosynthetic yield for phytoplankton and lc50 values based on mortality for the other organisms the most sensitive species included all three cyanobacterial taxa but also the rotifer brachionus calyciflores and the cladocerans ceriodaphnia dubia and daphnia pulex next the ec50 and lc50 values obtained from the laboratory toxicity tests were used to construct a species sensitivity distribution ssd for h2o2 finally the species predicted to be at risk by the ssd were compared with the responses of phytoplankton zooplankton and macroinvertebrates to two whole lake treatments with h2o2 the predictions of the laboratory based ssd matched well with the responses of the different taxa to h2o2 in the lake the first lake treatment with a relatively low h2o2 concentration and short residence time successfully suppressed cyanobacteria without major effects on non target species the second lake treatment had a higher h2o2 concentration with a longer residence time which resulted in partial suppression of cyanobacteria but also in a major collapse of rotifers and decreased abundance of small cladocerans our results thus revealed a trade off between the successful suppression of cyanobacteria at the expense of adverse effects on part of the zooplankton community this delicate balance strongly depends on the applied h2o2 dosage and may affect the decision whether to treat a lake or not graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords rotifers zooplankton macroinvertebrates harmful algal blooms species sensitivity distribution lake treatments data availability we shared most data in the supplementary tables other data will be available on request 1 introduction cyanobacterial blooms threaten the water quality of lakes and reservoirs across the globe o neil et al 2012 huisman et al 2018 decay of cyanobacterial blooms may cause oxygen depletion with detrimental effects on many aquatic organisms rabalais et al 2010 moreover several bloom forming cyanobacteria produce potent toxins that may affect human and ecosystem health e g svirčev et al 2019 chorus and welker 2021 and can cause severe economic damage with implications for drinking water production agriculture fisheries and recreation dodds et al 2009 qin et al 2010 bullerjahn et al 2016 several methods have been developed to prevent and suppress cyanobacterial blooms ibelings et al 2016 reduction of external nutrient loading is the preferred approach for the restoration of lakes and prevention of harmful algal blooms conley et al 2009 fastner et al 2016 yet reducing the nutrient input is often a long term effort gulati and van donk 2002 while in some instances a fast and immediate elimination of cyanobacterial blooms is required e g when the provision of drinking water is in danger livestock is threatened or bathing waters are closed for recreation because of toxic blooms in those emergency cases addition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is a promising method to acutely suppress cyanobacterial blooms matthijs et al 2012 huang and zimba 2020 sukenik and kaplan 2021 the use of h2o2 has two major advantages first cyanobacteria are more sensitive to h2o2 and display much lower h2o2 degradation rates than most eukaryotic algae drábková et al 2007 barrington and ghadouani 2008 weenink et al 2021 hence a low dosage of h2o2 selectively kills cyanobacteria within one or two days while the eukaryotic phytoplankton community remains largely unaffected and may even increase in abundance and diversity after a cyanobacterial bloom has been largely suppressed weenink et al 2015 yang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 second in contrast to many other chemical treatments h2o2 addition leaves no long term chemical traces behind in the environment matthijs et al 2016 instead the added h2o2 breaks down into water and oxygen typically within a few hours to days depending on the biological and chemical characteristics of the lake and the applied h2o2 concentration matthijs et al 2012 cory et al 2016 weenink et al 2021 the use of h2o2 against cyanobacterial blooms has therefore been investigated extensively in controlled laboratory experiments and field incubations e g lürling et al 2014 yang et al 2018 piel et al 2020 lusty and gobler 2020 sandrini et al 2020 spoof et al 2020 and has been applied in several natural waters matthijs et al 2012 burson et al 2014 huang and zimba 2020 weenink et al 2021 piel et al 2021 the h2o2 dosage is a critical issue in applications to real ecosystems on the one hand the dosage should be high enough to effectively suppress the harmful bloom to this end the h2o2 dosage ranged from 2 mg l 1 matthijs et al 2012 to 10 mg l 1 huang and zimba 2020 in treatments of cyanobacterial blooms in ponds and lakes h2o2 has also been used to eradicate a highly toxic bloom of the dinoflagellate alexandrium ostenfeldii burson et al 2014 and a fish killing bloom of the haptophyte prymnesium parvum wagstaff et al 2021 since dinoflagellates and haptophytes are less sensitive to h2o2 than cyanobacteria these two lake treatments required a higher h2o2 dosage of 40 to 50 mg l 1 on the other hand the h2o2 dosage should not induce adverse effects on non target organisms to safeguard biodiversity food web structure and ecosystem integrity geist and hawkins 2016 sumudumali and jayawardana 2021 in aquaculture h2o2 is commonly applied to protect fish against infections by parasites bacteria and fungi which has shown that many fish species can tolerate h2o2 concentrations of 200 to 1500 mg l 1 e g rach et al 1997 avendaño herrera et al 2006 therefore it is unlikely that the much lower h2o2 concentrations used for lake treatments of cyanobacterial blooms will have direct negative effects on fish populations much less is known however about potential effects of h2o2 on other non target organisms some zooplankton taxa including the cladocerans daphnia carinata moina sp ceriodaphnia dubia and the rotifer brachionus sp appeared to be sensitive to h2o2 concentrations in the range from 1 to 10 mg l 1 h2o2 meinertz et al 2008 smit et al 2008 matthijs et al 2012 reichwaldt et al 2012 sinha et al 2018 yang et al 2018 knowledge concerning h2o2 toxicity to freshwater macroinvertebrates is even scarcer but studies of marine invertebrates have shown large interspecific variation in h2o2 sensitivity and some species appear sensitive to concentrations 10 mg l 1 smit et al 2008 friedman et al 2018 hence the few available toxicity data suggest that adverse effects on non target species cannot be ruled out in h2o2 treatments of lakes this knowledge gap limits our understanding of the potential environmental impacts of these lake treatments and an ecological risk assessment is thus urgently needed before h2o2 can be routinely applied to combat cyanobacterial blooms this study aims to quantify the responses of a wide diversity of freshwater phytoplankton zooplankton and aquatic macroinvertebrates to h2o2 treatments of cyanobacterial blooms we first investigated the acute 24 h toxicity of h2o2 to three target cyanobacteria and 23 non target species six green algae eight zooplankton and nine macroinvertebrate taxa under controlled laboratory conditions the decrease in photosynthetic yield was used as proxy for the h2o2 sensitivity of cyanobacteria and green algae whereas we monitored mortality for the other species using the obtained effect concentrations a species sensitivity distribution ssd was constructed for ecological risk assessment of the applied h2o2 dosage subsequently the results of these laboratory toxicity tests were compared with responses of phytoplankton zooplankton and macroinvertebrates to two whole lake treatments which provided a unique opportunity to assess how both target and non target organisms responded to two different levels of h2o2 exposure in the field 2 materials and methods 2 1 test organisms phytoplankton test species included the

both copepodite and adult stages the tested macroinvertebrate species included first instar larvae of the dipteran chironomus riparius and the trichopteran limnephilus lunatus and adults of the two

the mysid limnomysis benedeni and the amphipod gammarus pulex were collected from the field toxicity tests with field collected organisms were performed within 7 days after sampling the origins of the species and further experimental details are described in the supporting information table s1 and supplementary methods 2 2 laboratory toxicity experiments at the start of the toxicity tests predefined volumes of h2o2 stock solution were added to the experimental replicates to achieve the desired range of h2o2 concentrations see table s1 actual h2o2 concentrations were measured in triplicate water samples taken immediately after h2o2 addition the h2o2 concentration was analyzed by mixing 100 μl sample with 100 μl p nitrophenyl boronic acid reagent sigma according to lu et al 2011 the h2o2 dependent formation of di nitrophenol was quantified by absorbance at 405 nm measured with a microplate fluorescence reader spectrostar nano bmg labtech this method is able to detect h2o2 concentrations of 3 125 μm 0 106 mg l 1 and higher lu et al 2011 for the phytoplankton toxicity tests 12 well plates corning incorporated kennebunk usa were inoculated with phytoplankton cultures at a final biovolume concentration of 0 59 0 04 mm3 ml 1 average sd n 35 as quantified with a casy 1 ttt cell counter ols omni life science bremen germany we ran six replicates per h2o2 concentration three of which were used for measuring the h2o2 concentration and three for determination of the photosynthetic yield after 24 h of h2o2 exposure expressed as percentage of the control without h2o2 phytoplankton was dark adapted for 10 min before the photosynthetic yield was determined with a mini pam 2 fluorometer according to the manufacturer s instructions walz effeltrich germany with the sensor mounted just above the wells the maximum photosynthetic yield fv fm i e the maximum quantum yield of psii electron transport was calculated as 1 f v f m f m f 0 f m where f m is the maximum fluorescence in the dark following a saturating light pulse and f 0 is the minimum fluorescence maxwell and johnson 2000 toxicity tests with zooplankton and macroinvertebrates were performed following guidelines 202 and 235 of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd 2004 2011 with some modifications all tests with macroinvertebrates d magna and d pulex were performed in 6 well plates corning incorporated kennebunk usa using 10 ml of adam medium klüttgen et al 1994 for the two daphnia species 10 ml of dutch standard water dsw nen 6503 1980 for the cultured macroinvertebrate taxa and 10 ml of filtered 1 2 μm pore size field collected water for the field collected macroinvertebrate taxa toxicity tests with b calyciflorus c dubia h incongruens and t thermophila were performed according to the standard operating procedures sop provided by the supplier with slight modifications table s1 tests were performed with four replicates per h2o2 concentration except for b calyciflorus and h incongruens where we used eight replicates in accordance with the supplier s instructions five individuals were added to each replicate well except for c riparius where ten individuals were added following de baat et al 2012 after 24 h of exposure to h2o2 the number of surviving individuals per well was counted except for the ciliate t thermophila where the endpoint of the toxicity test was the turnover of provided substrate into biomass according to the supplier s instructions table s1 substrate concentration was determined by measuring the

3 km2 average depth 7 m were treated with h2o2 on 19 june and 7 august 2018 diluted h2o2 was homogeneously distributed into the lake by a specially designed boat equiped with a water harrow sensu matthijs et al 2012 this is a tubular injection system that was attached on a manifold extending 2 m on each side of the boat and consisted of tubes with outlet valves that can be positioned at various depths up to 5 m piel et al 2021 the boat slowly moved back and forth across the lake using a computer controlled system integrating the cruise track and cruise speed to calculate the required h2o2 injection rate the intended h2o2 concentration was 2 5 mg l 1 h2o2 to minimize potential effects on non target species during and after the treatments h2o2 concentrations in the water were measured throughout the entire lake at multiple time points and at depths up to 5 m using quantofix indicator sticks macherey nagel düren germany the weather during the first lake treatment was mostly cloudy but without rain daily mean temperature 18 5 c daily sunshine 4 8 h daily windspeed 4 6 m s 1 daily precipitation 0 mm water temperature at 0 5 m depth 18 0 c it was mostly sunny and warm with a little bit of rain during the second lake treatment daily mean temperature 26 2 c daily sunshine 10 0 h daily windspeed 2 6 m s 1 daily precipitation 20 mm water temperature at 0 5 m depth 27 0 c 2 4 sampling of biota phytoplankton was sampled on an approximately biweekly basis between 14 june and 30 august 2018 at three sampling locations in the lake with more intense sampling during the two lake treatments integrated water samples were taken from 0 to 6 m depth with a flexible pvc water hose 10 m length 5 cm width phytoplankton samples were preserved with 0 4 lugol s iodine solution and stored in the dark at 4 c until microscopic analysis phytoplankton was counted and identified to species level using an inverted microscope with a 1 ml counting chamber utermöhl 1958 biovolumes of the phytoplankton were calculated from cell numbers and cellular geometry following hillebrand et al 1999 zooplankton was sampled during the same time period using the same water hose at five locations in the open water of the lake at each location the zooplankton sample was concentrated by filtering 10 l of an integrated water sample over a 41 µm mesh size the concentrated samples were preserved with a 1 alkaline lugol s iodine solution and stored in the dark at 4 c until microscopic analysis zooplankton were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and counted with tubular and bogorov counting chambers hydro bios kiel germany macroinvertebrates were sampled six days before and six days after the second lake treatment at four locations in the littoral zone of lake oosterduinse meer at each location one macroinvertebrate sample was taken from the macrophyte vegetation and one from the sediment using a dip net 0 3 m wide 500 μm mesh size swiped over a length of 2 5 m macroinvertebrates were sorted and preserved in 70 ethanol except oligochaete worms 96 ethanol and water mites 50 glycerin 20 acetic acid 30 aqua dest organisms were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and counted 2 5 data analysis concentration response relationships were constructed by fitting the actual h2o2 concentrations and the corresponding 24 h effect data to a logistic response model according to haanstra et al 1985 and forfait dubuc et al 2012 from these concentration response relationships the 24 h lc50 and ec50 values with accompanying 95 confidence intervals were calculated with ibm spss statistic 23 the lc50 and ec50 values of the 26 species were used to construct an ssd using an online ssd generator posthuma et al 2002 us epa 2016 a two sample t test was used to compare population densities of each species before and after the lake treatments for phytoplankton and zooplankton we compared population densities on the first and second day before with those on the first and second day after each treatment for macroinvertebrates we used the same approach but with population densities sampled six days before and six days after the second lake treatment furthermore the shannon diversity index shannon 1949 and dominance index krebs 1989 of the macroinvertebrate community were calculated before and after the second lake treatment statistical analyses and index calculations were performed using past hammer et al 2001 3 results 3 1 laboratory toxicity experiments in the control treatments photosynthetic yield of the phytoplankton species after 24 h was at least 90 of the initial value similarly survival of zooplankton and macroinvertebrate taxa after 24 h was at least 90 and for most species no mortality was observed in the control treatment these controls confirm the validity of the laboratory toxicity experiments the phytoplankton toxicity tests showed that the cyanobacterial species were more sensitive to h2o2 than the green algae fig 1 a fig s1 the ec50 values for the cyanobacteria ranged from 1 39 mg l 1 h2o2 for planktothrix agardhii to 3 49 mg l 1 h2o2 for anabaena sp table 1 the ec50 values for the investigated green algae were approximately 20 times higher ranging from 27 7 to 74 4 mg l 1 h2o2 the zooplankton species also showed interspecific variation in h2o2 sensitivity fig 1b fig s2 the most sensitive taxa were the rotifer b calyciflorus and the cladocerans c dubia and d pulex with lc50 values ranging from 2 2 to 2 8 mg l 1 h2o2 table 1 the ciliate t thermophilla and cladoceran d magna showed higher lc50 values of 6 5 mg l 1 h2o2 calanoid and cyclopoid copepods and the ostracod h incongruens were the least sensitive zooplankton species with lc50 values ranging from 11 5 to 24 2 mg l 1 h2o2 macroinvertebrates showed large interspecific differences in h2o2 sensitivity as well fig 1c fig s3 the mysid shrimp limnomysis benedeni was the most sensitive species with a lc50 value of 5 0 mg l 1 h2o2 while the two annelid worms and the midge chironomus riparius had lc50 values in the range of 8 0 to 14 1 mg l 1 h2o2 table 1 the other five macroinvertebrate species were much less sensitive to h2o2 with lc50 values ranging from 269 to 1850 mg l 1 h2o2 3 2 predictions based on the ssd the ssd displays the lc50 and ec50 values of the species in increasing order fig 2 the ssd can be used to estimate the fraction of species potentially affected by a given h2o2 concentration during the first lake treatment h2o2 fluctuated between 0 2 and 2 7 mg l 1 for the first 5 5 hr after the start of the h2o2 addition fig 3 a and then decreased to concentrations below the detection limit after 6 5 hr the average h2o2 concentration sd over the first 5 5 hrs was 1 13 0 78 mg l 1 n 9 time points which is plotted on the ssd fig 3c accordingly the potentially affected fraction of species was estimated at 8 5 and of our laboratory species only the cyanobacterium p agardhii was likely to be affected during the second lake treatment the h2o2 concentration fluctuated between 1 7 and 3 7 mg l 1 for at least 13 hr fig 3b although the added h2o2 was degraded after 24 hr data not shown the average h2o2 concentration sd during the first 5 5 hrs was 2 19 0 39 mg l 1 n 11 which is also plotted on the ssd fig 3c hence during the second treatment the lake was exposed to slightly higher h2o2 concentrations and for a longer duration than during the first treatment consequently a larger fraction of the species pool was potentially affected by the second lake treatment 14 2 including the cyanobacteria p agardhii and m aeruginosa but also non target species such as the cladoceran c dubia and rotifer b calyciflorus fig 3c 3 3 phytoplankton responses to lake treatments before the first h2o2 treatment the lake was covered by a cyanobacterial bloom dominated by aphanizomenon klebahnii 86 9 of total phytoplankton biovolume with a smaller contribution by microcystis spp 1 9 fig 4 in response to the first lake treatment the total cyanobacterial biovolume decreased by 85 1 within two days fig 4a primarily due to a major collapse of the a klebahnii population fig 4c subsequently a klebahnii was completely eradicated and did not return the cyanobacterium microcystis spp also declined significantly by 35 9 within two days after the first lake treatment fig 4i the total eukaryotic phytoplankton biovolume and most eukaryotic taxa were not significantly affected by the first lake treatment fig 4 fig s2 the dinoflagellate c hirundinella decreased slightly but significantly during the first days after the treatment and increased again a few days later fig 4f before the second h2o2 treatment the lake suffered from another cyanobacterial bloom co dominated by planktothrix agardhii 26 5 and dolichospermum flos aquae 25 7 with a smaller contribution by microcystis spp 2 5 and several other cyanobacterial taxa 4 8 fig 4 in response to the second lake treatment the total cyanobacterial biovolume and the cyanobacterial taxa d flos aquae and microcystis spp decreased significantly in particular d flos aquae collapsed by 96 8 within two days and was permanently eradicated four days after the lake treatment fig 4g the cyanobacterium p agardhii did not decrease significantly however and returned within several weeks fig 4e the total eukaryotic biovolume decreased significantly after the second lake treatment fig 4b the two abundant dinoflagellate taxa c furcoides and c hirundinella declined just prior to the second lake treatment and similar to the green algae were not significantly affected by the lake treatment itself fig 4d f j the diatom a granulata declined significantly within two days after the second treatment but recovered in the subsequent weeks fig 4h 3 4 zooplankton responses to lake treatments the zooplankton community consisted of large populations of rotifers and smaller populations of copepods and cladocerans fig 5a table s3 the first lake treatment did not significantly affect the total number of zooplankton individuals fig 5 a nor any of the zooplankton taxa fig 5b j before the second lake treatment zooplankton was much more abundant than before the first lake treatment and largely dominated by rotifers 94 9 of the zooplankton individuals fig 5a in response to the second lake treatment the zooplankton abundance declined steeply and significantly primarily due to an 82 0 collapse of the rotifer community the most abundant rotifer keratella cochlearis and also pompholyx sp vanished almost completely after the second lake treatment and did not recover in the subsequent weeks fig 5b and c the rotifer trichocerca sp also declined significantly but maintained a lower stable population during the subsequent period fig 5d whereas k quadrata was not significantly affected by the second lake treatment fig 5e the cladoceran sididae sp decreased significantly but still maintained 70 of its population size fig 5f while daphnia sp did not respond significantly to the second lake treatment fig 5g copepod nauplii and calanoid copepods were not significantly affected fig 5h and i whereas cyclopoid copepods decreased significantly after the second lake treatment but subsequently recovered fig 5j 3 5 macroinvertebrate responses to the second lake treatment macroinvertebrates in both the vegetation and the sediment were less affected by the lake treatment than the zooplankton fig 6 a b table s4 both the total number of chironomidae and the most abundant chironomid taxa were not significantly different before and after the second lake treatment fig 6c fig s4 numbers of the mysid limnomysis benedenii in the vegetation were similar before and after the lake treatment but their numbers in the sediment were significantly lower after the treatment fig 6d numbers of trichoptera ephemeroptera hemiptera isopoda hirudinea and gastropoda were not significantly different before and after the treatment fig 6e j likewise the shannon diversity index of the macroinvertebrates was not significantly affected by the lake treatment fig 6k and neither was the dominance index fig s5 4 discussion 4 1 comparing the h2o2 sensitivity of aquatic organisms in laboratory and field this multifaceted study was motivated by the need to quantify the sensitivity of a wide diversity of phytoplankton zooplankton and macroinvertebrates to h2o2 treatments of cyanobacterial blooms to this end we generated laboratory toxicity data for 26 taxa which allowed the construction of an ssd such ssds are nowadays predominantly applied in environmental risk assessment where they serve as the basis for the derivation of environmental quality standards posthuma et al 2019 for example derived ssds based on acute and chronic ecotoxicity test data for more than 12 000 different compounds only a limited number of studies however evaluated if laboratory derived ssds matched with the responses of species in the field e g posthuma and de zwart 2012 therefore our study provided a unique opportunity to evaluate if the species identified to be at risk by the laboratory based ssd indeed matched with the field responses of phytoplankton zooplankton and macroinvertebrate taxa to h2o2 exposure during two whole lake treatments a good agreement between laboratory and field observations is not self evident since laboratory conditions do not necessarily match field conditions e g in terms of temperature light conditions and nutrient concentrations nonetheless the present comparison revealed that the taxa identified to be at risk by the ssd matched very well with the organisms that declined in abundance in response to the lake treatments our results thus confirm the predictive power of ssds and support the applicability of ssds in real world environmental impact assessments 4 2 phytoplankton in line with the high h2o2 sensitivity of cyanobacteria in the laboratory toxicity experiments the dominant cyanobacteria a klebahnii and d flos aquae disappeared after the first and second lake treatment respectively and both species did not return however p agardhii did not decline significantly after the second lake treatment despite its low ec50 value and increased ten days later this contrasts with the field study by matthijs et al 2012 where the p agardhii abundance declined quickly after h2o2 addition and remained low for about seven weeks a possible explanation for the persistence of p agardhii in the present study could be that part of the population survived the h2o2 treatment in deeper water layers furthermore p agardhii blooms may vary in their h2o2 sensitivity due to genetic variation as observed in laboratory studies with p rubescens lürling et al 2020 the h2o2 sensitivity of green algae measured in the laboratory was much lower than that of the cyanobacteria which aligns with previous studies drábková et al 2007 sinha et al 2018 weenink et al 2021 as well as with our lake treatments where green algae were not affected yet the abundances of the dinoflagellate c hirundinella and diatom a granulata declined significantly after the first and second lake treatment respectively although both eukaryotic species showed high resilience and their numbers increased again within days in a mesocosm study with a h2o2 concentration of 10 mg l 1 eukaryotic phytoplankton was also affected santos et al 2021 hence these results confirm that eukaryotic phytoplankton are generally less sensitive to h2o2 than bloom forming cyanobacteria although some eukaryotic taxa appear more sensitive than the green algae investigated in our laboratory experiments 4 3 zooplankton zooplankton was rather sensitive to h2o2 although there were clear species specific differences the rotifer b calyciflores had a similar lc50 value as the ec50 values of the investigated cyanobacteria and the lc50 value of the marine rotifer b plicatilis studied by smit et al 2008 the lake treatments confirmed these laboratory results in the first lake treatment the average h2o2 concentration of 1 13 mg l 1 was below the lc50 value for b calyciflores and had no significant effect on rotifer abundances in the second lake treatment the average h2o2 concentration of 2 19 mg l 1 was in the same range as the lc50 value for b calyciflores moreover the exposure time during the first lake treatment was only 5 5 h while h2o2 remained in the water for at least 13 h during the second lake treatment this combination of a higher h2o2 concentration and a longer h2o2 residence time during the second lake treatment was probably responsible for the major collapse of the rotifer populations including k cochlearis pompholyx spp and trichocerca spp similarly sinha et al 2018 showed that the abundance of brachionus spp in experimental ponds was not affected by exposure to 2 5 mg l 1 h2o2 whereas brachionus spp declined significantly when treated with 4 0 mg l 1 h2o2 the relatively small cladocerans c dubia and d pulex showed a similar h2o2 sensitivity as the rotifer b calyciflores while the larger d magna was somewhat less sensitive similarly reichwaldt et al 2012 reported a low lc50 value of 2 mg l 1 h2o2 for the small cladoceran moina sp and a higher lc50 of 5 6 mg l 1 h2o2 for the larger d carinata this variation in h2o2 sensitivity of cladocerans was also observed during the lake treatments where small sididae sp decreased significantly after the second lake treatment whereas abundances of the larger daphnia sp were not significantly affected in addition to direct effects of h2o2 indirect effects of the lake treatments cannot be ruled out for example the decline of small cladocerans could also result from the decline of cyanobacteria as a food source e g urrutia cordero et al 2015 in total however our results and previous studies e g matthijs et al 2012 sinha et al 2018 yang et al 2018 all indicate that cladoceran populations are negatively affected by h2o2 concentrations in the range of 2 to 7 mg l 1 albeit with considerable interspecific variation that might be size dependent copepods and ostracods were the least h2o2 sensitive zooplankton taxa in our laboratory tests possibly because their body tissue is protected from h2o2 exposure by an exoskeleton copepods or valves ostracod the lc50 values for these taxa were far above the h2o2 concentrations applied during the lake treatments which did not affect the abundances of copepod nauplii and calanoid copepods contrary to expectation however cyclopoid copepods declined significantly after the second lake treatment a possible explanation could be that cyclopoid copepods are efficient predators of rotifers brandl 2005 and hence declined as an indirect effect of their dwindling prey populations another possibility is that the temporary decrease of cyclopoid copepods was part of their natural population dynamics unrelated to the h2o2 treatment the latter explanation would be consistent with the lack of responses of copepods exposed to h2o2 concentrations 7 mg l 1 h2o2 in other studies sinha et al 2018 yang et al 2018 in the lake study of burson et al 2014 who applied 50 mg l 1 h2o2 zooplankton was almost completely wiped out but many copepod nauplii survived the treatment these observations all support the conclusion that copepods are generally less sensitive to h2o2 than rotifers and cladocerans 4 4 aquatic macroinvertebrates the survival of aquatic macroinvertebrates was less affected by h2o2 than the photosynthetic yield of the cyanobacteria investigated in our laboratory experiments yet the h2o2 sensitivity of aquatic macroinvertebrates showed large interspecific variation with lc50 values ranging from 5 mg l 1 h2o2 for the mysid l benedeni to more than 1800 mg l 1 h2o2 for the mayfly nymph e danica these results are consistent with the previous study of smit et al 2008 who found ec50 values of 46 mg l 1 for the amphipod corophium volutator and 188 mg l 1 for the fairy shrimp artemia salina in agreement with our laboratory experiments l benedeni was the only macroinvertebrate taxon with a significant negative response to the second lake treatment whereas all other macroinvertebrates showed no response similarly matthijs et al 2012 found no effect of a whole lake treatment with 2 mg l 1 h2o2 on macroinvertebrates and no clear effects on chironomids oligochaete worms and water mites acari in lake mesocosms treated with up to 8 mg l 1 h2o2 however some previous lake treatments have used higher h2o2 concentrations of 40 to 50 mg l 1 burson et al 2014 wagstaff et al 2021 our laboratory toxicity tests warn that the impacts of such high h2o2 dosages may kill several macrofaunal taxa including mysid shrimps annelid worms and chironomid larvae this is corroborated by results of burson et al 2014 who found dead specimens of ragworms nereis diversicolor and their table 3 also points at a complete removal of the chironomid larvae yet other macroinvertebrates including isopods snails and gammarid shrimps remained abundant and active despite this very severe h2o2 treatment 4 5 caveats and limitations as a first guideline matthijs et al 2016 argued that the h2o2 concentration in lake treatments should remain below 5 mg l 1 to avoid effects on non target species however our results show that 5 mg l 1 of h2o2 will have detrimental effects on rotifers and small cladocerans and may even have negative effects on mysid shrimps since this preliminary guideline is not tenable we propose a more detailed classification of h2o2 lake treatments see next section this classification may require further modification tailored to each specific lake since the h2o2 sensitivity of species and the efficacy of lake treatments is influenced by a plethora of biotic and abiotic factors these confounding factors include temperature rach et al 1997 light piel et al 2020 nutrients sandrini et al 2020 phytoplankton abundances weenink et al 2015 and protective mechanisms such as mucus embedded colony formation gao et al 2015 moreover not only the h2o2 concentration but also the duration of h2o2 exposure is of key importance smit et al 2008 the exposure time can differ substantially between lake treatments which may affect the damage to non target species as observed in the present study furthermore our study focused on direct effects of h2o2 but did not investigate indirect effects mediated by species interactions knocking out some of the species may have cascading effects throughout the food web an example is the decline of cyclopoid copepods after the second lake treatment which might be attributed to the h2o2 driven suppression of their rotifer prey interspecific protection against h2o2 is another important species interaction high abundances of green algae can rapidly degrade h2o2 thereby protecting cyanobacteria against oxidative stress which hampers successful suppression of cyanobacterial blooms weenink et al 2021 in addition the presence of h2o2 scavenging heterotrophic bacteria may protect some cyanobacterial strains smith et al 2022 5 recommendations and conclusions based on our findings we propose a classification of h2o2 lake treatments according to their effectivity to suppress cyanobacterial blooms and their expected effects on non target species mild treatments 2 mg l 1 are able to suppress some cyanobacterial blooms while avoiding effects on non target species moderate treatments 2 4 mg l 1 can suppress many cyanobacterial blooms but are likely to have negative effects on some zooplankton taxa particularly rotifers and small cladocerans while avoiding effects on macroinvertebrates severe treatments 4 10 mg l 1 can suppress most cyanobacterial blooms but will have negative effects on many zooplankton taxa rotifers cladocerans ciliates and some macroinvertebrates mysid shrimps annelid worms very severe treatments 10 100 mg l 1 will eliminate most cyanobacterial blooms and several eukaryotic harmful algae but will also suppress other eukaryotic phytoplankton taxa most zooplankton and several macroinvertebrates mysid shrimps annelid worms chironomids the choice of the most adequate treatment is a management decision in some lakes adverse effects on non target species should be avoided while in other cases terminating the detrimental effects of a toxic cyanobacterial bloom may outweigh the possible negative effects of a lake treatment this classification provides a starting point to assess the likely effects of h2o2 lake treatments but may require further modification tailored to the local lake conditions ultimately the decision to treat a lake or not should involve careful consideration of the delicate balance

15461,addition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is a promising method to acutely suppress cyanobacterial blooms in lakes however a reliable h2o2 risk assessment to identify potential effects on non target species is currently hampered by a lack of appropriate ecotoxicity data the aim of the present study was therefore to quantify the responses of a wide diversity of freshwater phytoplankton zooplankton and macroinvertebrates to h2o2 treatments of cyanobacterial blooms to this end we applied a multifaceted approach first we investigated the 24 h toxicity of h2o2 to three cyanobacteria planktothrix agardhii microcystis aeruginosa anabaena sp and 23 non target species six green algae eight zooplankton and nine macroinvertebrate taxa using ec50 values based on photosynthetic yield for phytoplankton and lc50 values based on mortality for the other organisms the most sensitive species included all three cyanobacterial taxa but also the rotifer brachionus calyciflores and the cladocerans ceriodaphnia dubia and daphnia pulex next the ec50 and lc50 values obtained from the laboratory toxicity tests were used to construct a species sensitivity distribution ssd for h2o2 finally the species predicted to be at risk by the ssd were compared with the responses of phytoplankton zooplankton and macroinvertebrates to two whole lake treatments with h2o2 the predictions of the laboratory based ssd matched well with the responses of the different taxa to h2o2 in the lake the first lake treatment with a relatively low h2o2 concentration and short residence time successfully suppressed cyanobacteria without major effects on non target species the second lake treatment had a higher h2o2 concentration with a longer residence time which resulted in partial suppression of cyanobacteria but also in a major collapse of rotifers and decreased abundance of small cladocerans our results thus revealed a trade off between the successful suppression of cyanobacteria at the expense of adverse effects on part of the zooplankton community this delicate balance strongly depends on the applied h2o2 dosage and may affect the decision whether to treat a lake or not graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords rotifers zooplankton macroinvertebrates harmful algal blooms species sensitivity distribution lake treatments data availability we

al 2012 huisman et al 2018 decay of cyanobacterial blooms may cause oxygen depletion with detrimental effects on many aquatic organisms rabalais et al 2010 moreover several bloom forming cyanobacteria produce potent toxins that may affect human and ecosystem health e g svirčev et al 2019 chorus and welker 2021 and can cause severe economic damage with implications for drinking water production agriculture fisheries and recreation dodds et al 2009 qin et al 2010 bullerjahn et al 2016 several methods have been developed to prevent and suppress cyanobacterial blooms ibelings et al 2016 reduction of external nutrient loading is the preferred approach for the restoration of lakes and prevention of harmful algal blooms conley et al 2009 fastner et al 2016 yet reducing the nutrient input is often a long term effort gulati and van donk 2002 while in some instances a fast and immediate elimination of cyanobacterial blooms is required e g when the provision of drinking water is in danger livestock is threatened or bathing waters are closed for recreation because of toxic blooms in those emergency cases addition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is a promising method to acutely suppress cyanobacterial blooms matthijs et al 2012 huang and zimba 2020 sukenik and kaplan 2021 the use of h2o2 has two major advantages first cyanobacteria are more sensitive to h2o2 and display much lower h2o2 degradation rates than most eukaryotic algae drábková et al 2007 barrington and ghadouani 2008 weenink et al 2021 hence a low dosage of h2o2 selectively kills cyanobacteria within one or two days while the eukaryotic phytoplankton community remains largely unaffected and may even increase in abundance and diversity after a cyanobacterial bloom has been largely suppressed weenink et al 2015 yang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 second in contrast to many other chemical treatments h2o2 addition leaves no long term chemical traces behind in the environment matthijs et al 2016 instead the added h2o2 breaks down into water and oxygen typically within a few hours to days depending on the biological and chemical characteristics of the lake and the applied h2o2 concentration matthijs et al 2012 cory et al 2016 weenink et al 2021 the use of h2o2 against cyanobacterial blooms has therefore been investigated extensively in controlled laboratory experiments and field incubations e g lürling et al 2014 yang et al 2018 piel et al 2020 lusty and gobler 2020 sandrini et al 2020 spoof et al 2020 and has been applied in several natural waters matthijs et al 2012 burson et al 2014 huang and zimba 2020 weenink et al 2021 piel et al 2021 the h2o2 dosage is a critical issue in applications to real ecosystems on the one hand the dosage should be high enough to effectively suppress the harmful bloom to this end the h2o2 dosage ranged from 2 mg l 1 matthijs et al 2012 to 10 mg l 1 huang and zimba 2020 in treatments of cyanobacterial blooms in ponds and lakes h2o2 has also been used to eradicate a highly toxic bloom of the dinoflagellate alexandrium ostenfeldii burson et al 2014 and a fish killing bloom of the haptophyte prymnesium parvum wagstaff et al 2021 since dinoflagellates and haptophytes are less sensitive to h2o2 than cyanobacteria these two lake treatments required a higher h2o2 dosage of 40 to 50 mg l 1 on the other hand the h2o2 dosage should not induce adverse effects on non target organisms to safeguard biodiversity food web structure and ecosystem integrity geist and hawkins 2016 sumudumali and jayawardana 2021 in aquaculture h2o2 is commonly applied to protect fish against infections by parasites bacteria and fungi which has shown that many fish species can tolerate h2o2 concentrations of 200 to 1500 mg l 1 e g rach et al 1997 avendaño herrera et al 2006 therefore it is unlikely that the much lower h2o2 concentrations used for lake treatments of cyanobacterial blooms will have direct negative effects on fish populations much less is known however about potential effects of h2o2 on other non target organisms some zooplankton taxa including the cladocerans daphnia carinata moina sp ceriodaphnia dubia and the rotifer brachionus sp appeared to be sensitive to h2o2 concentrations in the range from 1 to 10 mg l 1 h2o2 meinertz et al 2008 smit et al 2008 matthijs et al 2012 reichwaldt et al 2012 sinha et al 2018 yang et al 2018 knowledge concerning h2o2 toxicity to freshwater macroinvertebrates is even scarcer but studies of marine invertebrates have shown large interspecific variation in h2o2 sensitivity and some species appear sensitive to concentrations 10 mg l 1 smit et al 2008 friedman et al 2018 hence the few available toxicity data suggest that adverse effects on non target species cannot be ruled out in h2o2 treatments of lakes this knowledge gap limits our understanding of the potential environmental impacts of these lake treatments and an ecological risk assessment is thus urgently needed before h2o2 can be routinely applied to combat cyanobacterial blooms this study aims to quantify the responses of a wide diversity of freshwater phytoplankton zooplankton and aquatic macroinvertebrates to h2o2 treatments of cyanobacterial blooms we first investigated the acute 24 h toxicity of h2o2 to three target cyanobacteria and 23 non target species six green algae eight zooplankton and nine macroinvertebrate taxa under controlled laboratory conditions the decrease in photosynthetic yield was used as proxy for the h2o2 sensitivity of cyanobacteria and green algae whereas we monitored mortality for the other species using the obtained effect concentrations a species sensitivity distribution ssd was constructed for ecological risk assessment of the applied h2o2 dosage subsequently the results of these laboratory toxicity tests were compared with responses of phytoplankton zooplankton and macroinvertebrates to two whole lake treatments which provided a unique opportunity to assess how both target and non target organisms responded to two different levels of h2o2 exposure in the field 2 materials and methods 2 1 test organisms phytoplankton test species included the

the mysid limnomysis benedeni and the amphipod gammarus pulex were collected from the field toxicity tests with field collected organisms were performed within 7 days after sampling the origins of the species and further experimental details are described in the supporting information table s1 and supplementary methods 2 2 laboratory toxicity experiments at the start of the toxicity tests predefined volumes of h2o2 stock solution were added to the experimental replicates to achieve the desired range of h2o2 concentrations see table s1 actual h2o2 concentrations were measured in triplicate water samples taken immediately after h2o2 addition the h2o2 concentration was analyzed by mixing 100 μl sample with 100 μl p nitrophenyl boronic acid reagent sigma according to lu et al 2011 the h2o2 dependent formation of di nitrophenol was quantified by absorbance at 405 nm measured with a microplate fluorescence reader spectrostar nano bmg labtech this method is able to detect

3 km2 average depth 7 m were treated with h2o2 on 19 june and 7 august 2018 diluted h2o2 was homogeneously distributed into the lake by a specially designed boat equiped with a water harrow sensu matthijs et al 2012 this is a tubular injection system that was attached on a manifold extending 2 m on each side of the boat and consisted of tubes with outlet valves that can be positioned at various depths up to 5 m piel et al 2021 the boat slowly moved back and forth across the lake using a computer controlled system integrating the cruise track and cruise speed to calculate the required h2o2 injection rate the intended h2o2 concentration was 2 5 mg l 1 h2o2 to minimize potential effects on non target species during and after the treatments h2o2 concentrations in the water were measured throughout the entire lake at multiple time points and at depths up to 5 m using quantofix indicator sticks macherey nagel düren germany the weather during the first lake treatment was mostly cloudy but without rain daily mean temperature 18 5 c daily sunshine 4 8 h daily windspeed 4 6 m s 1 daily precipitation 0 mm water temperature at 0 5 m depth 18 0 c it was mostly sunny and warm with a little bit of rain during the second lake treatment daily mean temperature 26 2 c daily sunshine 10 0 h daily windspeed 2 6 m s 1 daily precipitation 20 mm water temperature at 0 5 m depth 27 0 c 2 4 sampling of biota phytoplankton was sampled on an approximately biweekly basis between 14 june and 30 august 2018 at three sampling locations in the lake with more intense sampling during the two lake treatments integrated water samples were taken from 0 to 6 m depth with a flexible pvc water hose 10 m length 5 cm width phytoplankton samples were preserved with 0 4 lugol s iodine solution and stored in the dark at 4 c until microscopic analysis phytoplankton was counted and identified to species level using an inverted microscope with a 1 ml counting chamber utermöhl 1958 biovolumes of the phytoplankton were calculated from cell numbers and cellular geometry following hillebrand et al 1999 zooplankton was sampled during the same time period using the same water hose at five locations in the open water of the lake at each location the zooplankton sample was concentrated by filtering 10 l of an integrated water sample over a 41 µm mesh size the concentrated samples were preserved with a 1 alkaline lugol s iodine solution and stored in the dark at 4 c until microscopic analysis zooplankton were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and counted with tubular and bogorov counting chambers hydro bios kiel germany macroinvertebrates were sampled six days before and six days after the second lake treatment at four locations in the littoral zone of lake oosterduinse meer at each location one macroinvertebrate sample was taken from the macrophyte vegetation and one from the sediment using a dip net 0 3 m wide 500 μm mesh size swiped over a length of 2 5 m macroinvertebrates were sorted and preserved in 70 ethanol except oligochaete worms 96 ethanol and water mites 50 glycerin 20 acetic acid 30 aqua dest organisms were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and counted 2 5 data analysis concentration response relationships were constructed by fitting the actual h2o2 concentrations and the corresponding 24 h effect data to a logistic response model according to haanstra et al 1985 and forfait dubuc et al 2012 from these concentration response relationships the 24 h lc50 and ec50 values with accompanying 95 confidence intervals were calculated with ibm spss statistic 23 the lc50 and ec50 values of the 26 species were used to construct an ssd using an online ssd generator posthuma et al 2002 us epa 2016 a two sample t test was used to compare population densities of each species before and after the lake treatments for phytoplankton and zooplankton we compared population densities on the first and second day before with those on the first and second day after each treatment for macroinvertebrates we used the same approach but with population densities sampled six days before and six days after the second lake treatment furthermore the shannon diversity index shannon 1949 and dominance index krebs 1989 of the macroinvertebrate community were calculated before and after the second lake treatment statistical analyses and index calculations were performed using past hammer et al 2001 3 results 3 1 laboratory toxicity experiments in the control treatments photosynthetic yield of the phytoplankton species after 24 h was at least 90 of the initial value similarly survival of zooplankton and macroinvertebrate taxa after 24 h was at least 90 and for most species no mortality was observed in the control treatment these controls confirm the validity of the laboratory toxicity experiments the phytoplankton toxicity tests showed that the cyanobacterial species were more sensitive to h2o2 than the green algae fig 1 a fig s1 the ec50 values for the cyanobacteria ranged from 1 39 mg l 1 h2o2 for planktothrix agardhii to 3 49 mg l 1 h2o2 for anabaena sp table 1 the ec50 values for the investigated green algae were approximately 20 times higher ranging from 27 7 to 74 4 mg l 1 h2o2 the zooplankton species also showed interspecific variation in h2o2 sensitivity fig 1b fig s2 the most sensitive taxa were the rotifer b calyciflorus and the cladocerans c dubia and d pulex with lc50 values ranging from 2 2 to 2 8 mg l 1 h2o2 table 1 the ciliate t thermophilla and cladoceran d magna showed higher lc50 values of 6 5 mg l 1 h2o2 calanoid and cyclopoid copepods and the ostracod h incongruens were the least sensitive zooplankton species with lc50 values ranging from 11 5 to 24 2 mg l 1 h2o2 macroinvertebrates showed large interspecific differences in h2o2 sensitivity as well fig 1c fig s3 the mysid shrimp limnomysis benedeni was the most sensitive species with a lc50 value of 5 0 mg l 1 h2o2 while the two annelid worms and the midge chironomus riparius had lc50 values in the range of 8 0 to 14 1 mg l 1 h2o2 table 1 the other five macroinvertebrate species were much less sensitive to h2o2 with lc50 values ranging from 269 to 1850 mg l 1 h2o2 3 2 predictions based on the ssd the ssd displays the lc50 and ec50 values of the species in increasing order fig 2 the ssd can be used to estimate the fraction of species potentially affected by a given h2o2 concentration during the first lake treatment h2o2 fluctuated between 0 2 and 2 7 mg l 1 for the first 5 5 hr after the start of the h2o2 addition fig 3 a and then decreased to concentrations below the detection limit after 6 5 hr the average h2o2 concentration sd over the first 5 5 hrs was 1 13 0 78 mg l 1 n 9 time points which is plotted on the ssd fig 3c accordingly the potentially affected fraction of species was estimated at 8 5 and of our laboratory species only the cyanobacterium p agardhii was likely to be affected during the second lake treatment the h2o2 concentration fluctuated between 1 7 and 3 7 mg l 1 for at least 13 hr fig 3b although the added h2o2 was degraded after 24 hr data not shown the average h2o2 concentration sd during the first 5 5 hrs was 2 19 0 39 mg l 1 n 11 which is also plotted on the ssd fig 3c hence during the second treatment the lake was exposed to slightly higher h2o2 concentrations and for a longer duration than during the first treatment consequently a larger fraction of the species pool was potentially affected by the second lake treatment 14 2 including the cyanobacteria p agardhii and m aeruginosa but also non target species such as the cladoceran c dubia and rotifer b calyciflorus fig 3c 3 3 phytoplankton responses to lake treatments before the first h2o2 treatment the lake was covered by a cyanobacterial bloom dominated by aphanizomenon klebahnii 86 9 of total phytoplankton biovolume with a smaller contribution by microcystis spp 1 9 fig 4 in response to the first lake treatment the total cyanobacterial biovolume decreased by 85 1 within two days fig 4a primarily due to a major collapse of the a klebahnii population fig 4c subsequently a klebahnii was completely eradicated and did not return the cyanobacterium microcystis spp also declined significantly by 35 9 within two days after the first lake treatment fig 4i the total eukaryotic phytoplankton biovolume and most eukaryotic taxa were not significantly affected by the first lake treatment fig 4 fig s2 the dinoflagellate c hirundinella decreased slightly but significantly during the first days after the treatment and increased again a few days later fig 4f before the second h2o2 treatment the lake suffered from another cyanobacterial bloom co dominated by planktothrix agardhii 26 5 and dolichospermum flos aquae 25 7 with a smaller contribution by microcystis spp 2 5 and several other cyanobacterial taxa 4 8 fig 4 in response to the second lake treatment the total cyanobacterial biovolume and the cyanobacterial taxa d flos aquae and microcystis spp decreased significantly in particular d flos aquae collapsed by 96 8 within two days and was permanently eradicated four days after the lake treatment fig 4g the cyanobacterium p agardhii did not decrease significantly however and returned within several weeks fig 4e the total eukaryotic biovolume decreased significantly after the second lake treatment fig 4b the two abundant dinoflagellate taxa c furcoides and c hirundinella declined just prior to the second lake treatment and similar to the green algae were not significantly affected by the lake treatment itself fig 4d f j the diatom a granulata declined significantly within two days after the second treatment but recovered in the subsequent weeks fig 4h 3 4 zooplankton responses to lake treatments the zooplankton community consisted of large populations of rotifers and smaller populations of copepods and cladocerans fig 5a table s3 the first lake treatment did not significantly affect the total number of zooplankton individuals fig 5 a nor any of the zooplankton taxa fig 5b j before the second lake treatment zooplankton was much more abundant than before the first lake treatment and largely dominated by rotifers 94 9 of the zooplankton individuals fig 5a in response to the second lake treatment the zooplankton abundance declined steeply and significantly primarily due to an 82 0 collapse of the rotifer community the most abundant rotifer keratella cochlearis and also pompholyx sp vanished almost completely after the second lake treatment and did not recover in the subsequent weeks fig 5b and c the rotifer trichocerca sp also declined significantly but maintained a lower stable population during the subsequent period fig 5d whereas k quadrata was not significantly affected by the second lake treatment fig 5e the cladoceran sididae sp decreased significantly but still maintained 70 of its population size fig 5f while daphnia sp did not respond significantly to the second lake treatment fig 5g copepod nauplii and calanoid copepods were not significantly affected fig 5h and i whereas cyclopoid copepods decreased significantly after the second lake treatment but subsequently recovered fig 5j 3 5 macroinvertebrate responses to the second lake treatment macroinvertebrates in both the vegetation and the sediment were less affected by the lake treatment than the zooplankton fig 6 a b table s4 both the total number of chironomidae and the most abundant chironomid taxa were not significantly different before and after the second lake treatment fig 6c fig s4 numbers of the mysid limnomysis benedenii in the vegetation were similar before and after the lake treatment but their numbers in the sediment were significantly lower after the treatment fig 6d numbers of trichoptera ephemeroptera hemiptera isopoda hirudinea and gastropoda were not significantly different before and after the treatment fig 6e j likewise the shannon diversity index of the macroinvertebrates was not significantly affected by the lake treatment fig 6k and neither was the dominance index fig s5 4 discussion 4 1 comparing the h2o2 sensitivity of aquatic organisms in laboratory and field this multifaceted study was motivated by the need to quantify the sensitivity of a wide diversity of phytoplankton zooplankton and macroinvertebrates to h2o2 treatments of cyanobacterial blooms to this end we generated laboratory toxicity data for 26 taxa which allowed the construction of an ssd such ssds are nowadays predominantly applied in environmental risk assessment where they serve as the basis for the derivation of environmental quality standards posthuma et al 2019 for example derived ssds based on acute and chronic ecotoxicity test data for more than 12 000 different compounds only a limited number of studies however evaluated if laboratory derived ssds matched with the responses of species in the field e g posthuma and de zwart 2012 therefore our study provided a unique opportunity to evaluate if the species identified to be at risk by the laboratory based ssd indeed matched with the field responses of phytoplankton zooplankton and macroinvertebrate taxa to h2o2 exposure during two whole lake treatments a good agreement between laboratory and field observations is not self evident since laboratory conditions do not necessarily match field conditions e g in terms of temperature light conditions and nutrient concentrations nonetheless the present comparison revealed that the taxa identified to be at risk by the ssd matched very well with the organisms that declined in abundance in response to the lake treatments our results thus confirm the predictive power of ssds and support the applicability of ssds in real world environmental impact assessments 4 2 phytoplankton in line with the high h2o2 sensitivity of cyanobacteria in the laboratory toxicity experiments the dominant cyanobacteria a klebahnii and d flos aquae disappeared after the first and second lake treatment respectively and both species did not return however p agardhii did not decline significantly after the second lake treatment despite its low ec50 value and increased ten days later this contrasts with the field study by matthijs et al 2012 where the p agardhii abundance declined quickly after h2o2 addition and remained low for about seven weeks a possible explanation for the persistence of p agardhii in the present study could be that part of the population survived the h2o2 treatment in deeper water layers furthermore p agardhii blooms may vary in their h2o2 sensitivity due to genetic variation as observed in laboratory studies with p rubescens lürling et al 2020 the h2o2 sensitivity of green algae measured in the laboratory was much lower than that of the cyanobacteria which aligns with previous studies drábková et al 2007 sinha et al 2018 weenink et al 2021 as well as with our lake treatments where green algae were not affected yet the abundances of the dinoflagellate c hirundinella and diatom a granulata declined significantly after the first and second lake treatment respectively although both eukaryotic species showed high resilience and their numbers increased again within days in a mesocosm study with a h2o2 concentration of 10 mg l 1 eukaryotic phytoplankton was also affected santos et al 2021 hence these results confirm that eukaryotic phytoplankton are generally less sensitive to h2o2 than bloom forming cyanobacteria although some eukaryotic taxa appear more sensitive than the green algae investigated in our laboratory experiments 4 3 zooplankton zooplankton was rather sensitive to h2o2 although there were clear species specific differences the rotifer b calyciflores had a similar lc50 value as the ec50 values of the investigated cyanobacteria and the lc50 value of the marine rotifer b plicatilis studied by smit et al 2008 the lake treatments confirmed these laboratory results in the first lake treatment the average h2o2 concentration of 1 13 mg l 1 was below the lc50 value for b calyciflores and had no significant effect on rotifer abundances in the second lake treatment the average h2o2 concentration of 2 19 mg l 1 was in the same range as the lc50 value for b calyciflores moreover the exposure time during the first lake treatment was only 5 5 h while h2o2 remained in the water for at least 13 h during the second lake treatment this combination of a higher h2o2 concentration and a longer h2o2 residence time during the second lake treatment was probably responsible for the major collapse of the rotifer populations including k cochlearis pompholyx spp and trichocerca spp similarly sinha et al 2018 showed that the abundance of brachionus spp in experimental ponds was not affected by exposure to 2 5 mg l 1 h2o2 whereas brachionus spp declined significantly when treated with 4 0 mg l 1 h2o2 the relatively small cladocerans c dubia and d pulex showed a similar h2o2 sensitivity as the rotifer b calyciflores while the larger d magna was somewhat less sensitive similarly reichwaldt et al 2012 reported a low lc50 value of 2 mg l 1 h2o2 for the small cladoceran moina sp and a higher lc50 of 5 6 mg l 1 h2o2 for the larger d carinata this variation in h2o2 sensitivity of cladocerans was also observed during the lake treatments where small sididae sp decreased significantly after the second lake treatment whereas abundances of the larger daphnia sp were not significantly affected in addition to direct effects of h2o2 indirect effects of the lake treatments cannot be ruled out for example the decline of small cladocerans could also result from the decline of cyanobacteria as a food source e g urrutia cordero et al 2015 in total however our results and previous studies e g matthijs et al 2012 sinha et al 2018 yang et al 2018 all indicate that cladoceran populations are negatively affected by h2o2 concentrations in the range of 2 to 7 mg l 1 albeit with considerable interspecific variation that might be size dependent copepods and ostracods were the least h2o2 sensitive zooplankton taxa in our laboratory tests possibly because their body tissue is protected from h2o2 exposure by an exoskeleton copepods or valves ostracod the lc50 values for these taxa were far above the h2o2 concentrations applied during the lake treatments which did not affect the abundances of copepod nauplii and calanoid copepods contrary to expectation however cyclopoid copepods declined significantly after the second lake treatment a possible explanation could be that cyclopoid copepods are efficient predators of rotifers brandl 2005 and hence declined as an indirect effect of their dwindling prey populations another possibility is that the temporary decrease of cyclopoid copepods was part of their natural population dynamics unrelated to the h2o2 treatment the latter explanation would be consistent with the lack of responses of copepods exposed to h2o2 concentrations 7 mg l 1 h2o2 in other studies sinha et al 2018 yang et al 2018 in the lake study of burson et al 2014 who applied 50 mg l 1 h2o2 zooplankton was almost completely wiped out but many copepod nauplii survived the treatment these observations all support the conclusion that copepods are generally less sensitive to h2o2 than rotifers and cladocerans 4 4 aquatic macroinvertebrates the survival of aquatic macroinvertebrates was less affected by h2o2 than the photosynthetic yield of the cyanobacteria investigated in our laboratory experiments yet the h2o2 sensitivity of aquatic macroinvertebrates showed large interspecific variation with lc50 values ranging from 5 mg l 1 h2o2 for the mysid l benedeni to more than 1800 mg l 1 h2o2 for the mayfly nymph e danica these results are consistent with the previous study of smit et al 2008 who found ec50 values of 46 mg l 1 for the amphipod corophium volutator and 188 mg l 1 for the fairy shrimp artemia salina in agreement with our laboratory experiments l benedeni was the only macroinvertebrate taxon with a significant negative response to the second lake treatment whereas all other macroinvertebrates showed no response similarly matthijs et al 2012 found no effect of a whole lake treatment with 2 mg l 1 h2o2 on macroinvertebrates and no clear effects on chironomids oligochaete worms and water mites acari in lake mesocosms treated with up to 8 mg l 1 h2o2 however some previous lake treatments have used higher h2o2 concentrations of 40 to 50 mg l 1 burson et al 2014 wagstaff et al 2021 our laboratory toxicity tests warn that the impacts of such high h2o2 dosages may kill several macrofaunal taxa including mysid shrimps annelid worms and chironomid larvae this is corroborated by results of burson et al 2014 who found dead specimens of ragworms nereis diversicolor and their table 3 also points at a complete removal of the chironomid larvae yet other macroinvertebrates including isopods snails and gammarid shrimps remained abundant and active despite this very severe h2o2 treatment 4 5 caveats and limitations as a first guideline matthijs et al 2016 argued that the h2o2 concentration in lake treatments should remain below 5 mg l 1 to avoid effects on non target species however our results show that 5 mg l 1 of h2o2 will have detrimental effects on rotifers and small cladocerans and may even have negative effects on mysid shrimps since this preliminary guideline is not tenable we propose a more detailed classification of h2o2 lake treatments see next section this classification may require further modification tailored to each specific lake since the h2o2 sensitivity of species and the efficacy of lake treatments is influenced by a plethora of biotic and abiotic factors these confounding factors include temperature rach et al 1997 light piel et al 2020 nutrients sandrini et al 2020 phytoplankton abundances weenink et al 2015 and protective mechanisms such as mucus embedded colony formation gao et al 2015 moreover not only the h2o2 concentration but also the duration of h2o2 exposure is of key importance smit et al 2008 the exposure time can differ substantially between lake treatments which may affect the damage to non target species as observed in the present study furthermore our study focused on direct effects of h2o2 but did not investigate indirect effects mediated by species interactions knocking out some of the species may have cascading effects throughout the food web an example is the decline of cyclopoid copepods after the second lake treatment which might be attributed to the h2o2 driven suppression of their rotifer prey interspecific protection against h2o2 is another important species interaction high abundances of green algae can rapidly degrade h2o2 thereby protecting cyanobacteria against oxidative stress which hampers successful suppression of cyanobacterial blooms weenink et al 2021 in addition the presence of h2o2 scavenging heterotrophic bacteria may protect some cyanobacterial strains smith et al 2022 5 recommendations and conclusions based on our findings we propose a classification of h2o2 lake treatments according to their effectivity to suppress cyanobacterial blooms and their expected effects on non target species mild treatments 2 mg l 1 are able to suppress some cyanobacterial blooms while avoiding effects on non target species moderate treatments 2 4 mg l 1 can suppress many cyanobacterial blooms but are likely to have negative effects on some zooplankton taxa particularly rotifers and small cladocerans while avoiding effects on macroinvertebrates severe treatments 4 10 mg l 1 can suppress most cyanobacterial blooms but will have negative effects on many zooplankton taxa rotifers cladocerans ciliates and some macroinvertebrates mysid shrimps annelid worms very severe treatments 10 100 mg l 1 will eliminate most cyanobacterial blooms and several eukaryotic harmful algae but will also suppress other eukaryotic phytoplankton taxa most zooplankton and several macroinvertebrates mysid shrimps annelid worms chironomids the choice of the most adequate treatment is a management decision in some lakes adverse effects on non target species should be avoided while in other cases terminating the detrimental effects of a toxic cyanobacterial bloom may outweigh the possible negative effects of a lake treatment this classification provides a starting point to assess the likely effects of h2o2 lake treatments but may require further modification tailored to the local lake conditions ultimately the decision to treat a lake or not should involve careful consideration of the delicate balance

15462,although the distribution of ammonia nitrite oxidizers had been profiled in different habitats current understanding is still limited regarding their niche differentiation in the integrated biofilm reactors the symbiotic associations of ammonia nitrite oxidizers as well as the parasitic interaction between viruses and those functional organisms involved in the nitrogen cycle here the integrated metagenomics and metatranscriptomics are applied to profile the ammonia nitrite oxidizers communities and transcriptional activities changes along the flowpath of a concatenated full scale rotating biological contactor rbc frontend stage a and backend stage b 19 metagenome assembled genomes mags of ammonia nitrite oxidizers were recovered by using a hybrid assembly approach including four ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob two ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa two complete ammonia oxidation bacteria comammox eight nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and three anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria anammox diverse aob and anammox dominated stage a and collectively contributed to nitrogen conversion with the decline of ammonia concentration along the flowpath comammox and aoa appeared and increased in relative abundance in stage b accounting for 8 8 of the entire community at the end of this reactor and their dominating role in nitrogen turnover was indicated by the high transcription activity of their corresponding function genes moreover the variation in the abundance of viruses infecting ammonia and nitrite oxidizers suggests that viruses likely act as a biotic factor mediating ammonia nitrite oxidizer populations this study demonstrates that complex factors shaped niche differentiation and symbiotic associations of ammonia nitrite oxidizers in the rbc and highlights the importance of rbcs as model systems for the investigation of biotic and abiotic factors affecting the composition of microbiomes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonia nitrite oxidizers rbc niche differentiation symbiotic associations phage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aerobic chemolithoautotrophic nitrification as one crucial process involved in the nitrogen cycle is the earliest and most commonly adopted approach for nitrogen removal in engineered systems mccarty 2018 this process is mediated by universal ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob as well as the recently discovered complete ammonia oxidizer comammox daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 in addition to aerobic ammonia oxidation the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process also plays a vital role in global nitrogen cycling which has been estimated to account for 50 of n2 production in marine environments and contribute to efficient nitrogen removal in some freshwater systems wang et al 2021a as one of the most energy efficient biotechnologies for nitrogen removal anammox process has been widely applied in wastewater treatment works lackner et al 2014 lawson et al 2017 remarkably both nitrification and anammox processes in the engineered systems are commonly achieved in microbial cell aggregates either in the form of flocs granules or biofilms as they enable the higher biomass retention times that are necessary for the slow growing ammonia nitrite oxidizers kuenen 2008 navada et al 2020 nicolella et al 2000 moreover distinctive niches created by the substrate or oxygen gradients in the cell aggregates correspond to ecological niche differentiations and enable several microbial guilds to coexist navada et al 2020 yang et al 2020a 2020b among the cell aggregation ecosystems mentioned above some specific biofilm wastewater treatment systems such as the rotating biological contactor rbc and sand filters are of larger substrate gradients both in the layered biofilm and along the overall flowpath and this may facilitate the colonization of more diverse n metabolizing microorganisms with distinct substrate affinities fowler et al 2018 freeman et al 2020 co occurrence and distribution of aoa aob and nob in the rbc had been characterized in our previous study peng et al 2014 with declining ammonium and nitrite concentrations in the latter stages of the rbc reactor an increment in nitrospira abundance was observed and we speculated that a portion of these nitrospira populations might be comammox distribution of comammox nitrospira and accompanied by other ammonia oxidizers e g aob and aoa has been reported in the biofilm of rbc reactor spasov et al 2020 although the community structure and ecological role of microbes related to the nitrogen cycle in wwtps have been explored in previous studies systematic investigation of the distribution and symbiotic interactions have received little attention in the biofilm associated ecosystems beyond the aforementioned microbes directly involved in nitrogen metabolism viruses may also play a crucial role in the nitrogen cycle by mediating the metabolism of their hosts in the wwtps chen et al 2021 viruses infecting aob and nob have been reported in previous studies chen et al 2021 coutinho et al 2020 however less information is available about the viruses infecting aoa anammox and comammox the vast microbial diversity in the biofilm ecosystems implies that there might also be higher diversity of viruses and the relatively high abundance of microorganisms involved in nitrogen cycling harbored by biofilm may also lead us to uncover some related viruses peng et al 2014 spasov et al 2020 with the research questions illustrated above the distribution transcriptional activities and symbiotic interactions of ammonia nitrite oxidizers in a full scale rbc treating domestic wastewater were investigated through integrated metagenomics and metatranscriptomics approaches biofilm samples collected from different spatial locations along the flowpath were employed for the investigation additionally specific virus dna extraction and identification approaches were applied to establish the virus catalog profile the distribution of viruses and predict the potential interactions between viruses and their hosts the detailed profiles of the ammonia nitrite oxidizers and associated viruses enable us to have a more comprehensive understanding on their niche distribution interactions and metabolic capacities within the biofilm associated ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection nucleotide extraction and sequencing the studied rbc reactor operated at ma wan sewage treatment plant of hong kong is composed of two concatenated stages defined as stage a and stage b respectively nine biofilm samples were collected using clean brushes from the rbc train on march 19 2020 covering stage a four sampling points defined as a1 a2 a3 and a4 and stage b five sampling points defined as b1 b2 b3 b4 and b5 fig 1a samples were flash frozen in

genome kegg ghostkoala kanehisa et al 2016 in addition the key genes involved in nitrogen metabolism and metabolic functional traits of both the newly recovered and reference genomes were also profiled by metabolic v4 0 zhou et al 2020 with default parameters 2 4 metatranscriptomic analysis sortmerna v4 0 0 kopylova et al 2012 was applied to remove non coding rna sequences from the metatranscriptomic data based on the multiple rrna databases for bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic sequences the transcription activity of individual mags was calculated by mapping the

2011 were employed in this study to profile the gene expression 2 5 viral sample collection treatment and dna processing the samples used for phage catalog establishment were taken from the same rbc reactor simultaneously biofilms were randomly collected from rbc trains at different locations using sterilized brushes and milli q water composite samples were collected from stage a and stage b respectively in addition a total of 5 l liquor sample was also collected from stage a and stage b simultaneously fig 1a the detailed sample filtration and purification processes were described in the supplementary information dna was extracted from processed liquid samples with enriched viral particles using phage dna isolation kit norgen biotek corp canada with proteinase k following the manufacturer s instructions dna concentrations were measured using nanodrop thermo fisher scientific usa and dna samples were stored at 80 c for subsequent metagenomic sequencing 2 6 metagenomic viral contigs identification classification and annotation the sequencing data from three phage metagenomes were de novo co assembled using metaspades v3 13 0 nurk et al 2017 and subsequently assembled

dram shaffer et al 2020 2 7 host prediction of viruses to identify the broad host virus associations the viral contigs were searched against the manually curated crispr cas spacer database established by our group chen et al 2021 in addition the host virus interactions were specifically investigated on the mags of ammonia nitrite oxidizers retrieved from nine metagenomes of this rbc reactor to be

3 results 3 1 ammonia nitrite oxidizers occupy different ecological niches along the rbc flowpath the sampling points substrates concentrations and presence of microbiotas related to the nitrogen cycle are shown in fig 1 ammonium concentrations in the wastewater decreased along the rbc flowpath and a noticeable decrease trend from 34 7 mg l to 3 8 mg l was observed at stage b fig 1b the nitrite concentration exhibited low variation ranging from 0 1 mg l to 1 6 mg l at a relatively low level across all locations albeit with a slight increase along the flowpath except for point a1 the concentration of nitrate increased along the flowpath such concentration gradients observed in the different n chemicals may correlate to the prevalence of varying n metabolizing microbes along the rbc flowpath as expected variations in chemical and physical conditions along the rbc flowpath corresponded to a shift in ammonia and nitrite oxidizing communities fig 1c that were represented by the high quality mags fig 2a and table s2 recovered from this complex biofilm system including four aob two aoa two comammox eight nob include three canonical nob and five nob like and three anammox prevalence of aob was observed at all locations fig 1a and 1c albeit an extremely low abundance of aob was observed at a1 with the appearance of aob anammox bacteria were first found at a2 and relatively high abundance was observed in both stage a and the front part of stage b nob was first detected at a2 fig 1c and then colonized the entire flowpath after that intriguingly distinct nitrifying guilds i e aoa and comammox were found in the backend rbc train stage b the prevalence and colonization of diverse ammonia nitrite oxidizers suggested that the biofilm associated system is vital for us to explore the distribution pattern and symbiotic interactions of these microorganisms 3 2 shifts in abundance and transcriptional activity of ammonia nitrite oxidizers along the rbc flowpath the four aob organisms represented by the obtained mags were all affiliated with the genus nitrosomonas but had distinct distribution patterns along the rbc flowpath aob1 and aob4 colonized all locations with stable transcriptional activities while the dominating in abundance species shifted to the other two aob organisms especially aob2 at stage b fig 2b c and table s3 intriguingly lower activities of aob2 were observed at stage b which was not consistent with its higher abundance together with the prevalence of aob three anammox were first detected at a2 and their relative abundances gradually increased before b1 fig 2b the sum of the relative abundances of these three anammox bacteria in the community increased from 0 16 to 1 27 fig 2d and the portion in transcripts increased from 0 21 to 1 46 fig 2e which were in line with the increasing trend of aob relative abundance from 0 33 a2 to 0 85 a4 fig 2d at stage b the cumulative relative abundance of anammox bacteria decreased obviously albeit relatively high cumulative abundance of aob were observed compared to stage a stage b harbors more diverse ammonia nitrite oxidizers the transcriptional activities of eight recovered nob organisms fig 2c were in line with their relative abundance at each location fig 2b these nob had distinct distribution patterns although they colonized at all points of stage b in addition to these nob two comammox i e com1 and com2 also dominated in stage b fig 2b especially from b3 to b5 with the cumulative relative abundance of 4 50 6 63 fig 2d remarkable decreases in both the cumulative relative abundance and transcriptional activity of nob were observed from b3 while the relative abundance of comammox started to increase furthermore two aoa organisms were first detected at b3 aoa2 and b4 aoa1 fig 2b respectively the relatively high transcriptional activities of these two aoa were observed at the end of this rbc reactor in particular which represented a major proportion 0 46 in the transcripts at b5 3 3 collaboration of novel anammox bacteria and aob at stage a the consistent trend in the relative abundance and transcriptional activities of anammox and aob indicated that they could be the collaborators involved in the nitrogen metabolism at stage a phylogenetic analysis showed that all four aob were affiliated with the same genus nitrosomonas with 77 6 97 2 ani while diverse anammox bacteria affiliated to different genera were discovered among the three retrieved anammox mags amx1 might affiliate to a novel genus because it could only be assigned to the family level based on the gtdb tk annotation result and the phylogenetic analysis based on concatenated bacterial core protein alignments and 16s rrna gene sequences of published anammox genome representatives showed a consistent phylogenetic relationship of amx1 which formed a distinct branch relatively close to candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis whereas the other two anammox formed a separate clade with the representative anammox genomes retrieved from the marine environment and represent two novel species in the genus of scaelec01 fig 3a and fig s1 amx1 had a 93 similarity of 16s rrna gene with its phylogenetically closely related candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis also indicating that amx1 may represent a novel genus considering the commonly accepted cut off of 95 at genus level schloss and handelsman 2005 based on the annotation of metabolic pathways fig s2 the distinct metabolic traits of amx1 and other anammox species were observed regarding the ammonia oxidation capacity and metabolic divergence of these microbes the abundances and expression profiles of the amoabc and hao genes of aob1 and aob4 had 97 2 of ani indicated that they were the primary nitrite producer at stage a fig 3b surprisingly the extremely low expressions of the key genes in aob2 were observed albeit their relative higher abundances different from the above three aob species the ammonia oxidation genes in aob3 were more active at stage b based on the distribution patterns and transcriptional activities of these key genes it could be speculated that nitrite generated by aob1 and aob4 was transported to the anammox cells through the highly expressed nitrite transporters encoded by amx1 and amx2 table s4 to mediate anammox reaction at stage a no nirs or nirk genes mediating nitrite reduction were discovered in these three recovered anammox mags whereas multiple hao like genes with high transcriptional activity were identified fig 3c suggesting that some of these hao like genes might encode physiological nitrite reductases that reduce nitrite to nitric oxide kartal et al 2013 the highly expressed hzs complex and hdh genes of amx1 and amx2 at stage a were consistent with their transcriptional activities at the genome level on the contrary the high expression of these key metabolic genes encoded by amx3 was observed at stage b especially at b1 in addition the cyanase encoding gene cyns was identified and transcribed in amx3 table s4 implying that this anammox species is capable of converting the cyanate to ammonia directly serving as the alternative substrate the active expression of genes involved in ammonia oxidation suggested that the cooperation of aob and anammox contributed to the nitrogen conversion at stage a 3 4 abundant and active comammox nitrospira and nob at stage b the two comammox nitrospira mags com1 and com2 recovered in the present study were affiliated with clade a and clustered together with four comammox nitrospira mags rbc083 rbc001 rbc047 and rbc021 previously retrieved from an rbc reactor spasov et al 2020 and two comammox nitrospira mags ws110 and ws238 retrieved from a wwtp yang et al 2020a forming a basal monophyletic lineage fig 4a com1 had 98 3 of ani between it and com2 indicating that they may affiliate to the same species ani species level cutoff 95 jain et al 2018 and com1 and com2 had 89 3 and 89 1 ani to phylogenetically closest ws110 respectively the phylogenetic analysis based on amoa amino acids sequences confirmed the phylogenetically closed relationships among these genomes fig s3 of the eight nob mags three of them were canonical nob within the nitrospira a genera of the nitrospiraceae family and the other five classified as nob like based on the presence of nxra and nxrb genes affiliated to the same family of uba8639 belonging to the nitrospirales order taxonomy classification based on gtdb tk table s2 the nearly complete comammox nitrospira com1 encoded all key enzymes amo hao and nxr for complete ammonia oxidation the abundances and expressions of amoabc genes increased along the flowpath except for b4 which were consistent with the abundances and activities at the genome level fig 4b intriguingly the transcript numbers of amob gene were higher than that of amoa and amoc genes although the abundances of these genes were comparable notably the relatively highly expressed genes encoding urease ureabc and urea transporters urtabcde were also identified in these two comammox mags table s4 suggesting that the urea may be an additional ammonia source for comammox in wastewater genes encoding nitrite oxidoreductase nxr were prevalent in all newly recovered comammox and nob mags except the nxrb which was missing in com2 and nob5 the abundances and transcripts of nxr genes fig 4c fig s4 and table s4 in comammox mags increased along the flowpath and the highest expression was observed at b5 for canonical nob the active expression of nxr genes was only observed in nob6 nob7 and nob8 at stage a different scenarios were shown at stage b high expressions of nxra and nxrb genes especially nob2 were observed in almost all nob except nob3 and nob5 3 5 active ammonia oxidizing archaea at the end of rbc the two newly recovered aoa mags were phylogenetically clustered with the recently reported group i 1b wwtp aoa ca nitrosocosmicus hydrocola had a maximum aai of 56 3 and 72 6 respectively they all affiliated with the genus nitrosocosmicus fig 5 in addition aoa2 was phylogenetically close to the ca nitrosocosmicus sp ss belongs to the soil group i 1b thaumarchaeota aai 98 7 liu et al 2019 intriguingly the phylogenetic relationship was distinct between the newly recovered aoa mags and the recently reported wwtp aoa belonging to group i 1a ca nitrosopumilus sp st1 ca nitrosarchaeum sp st2 and ca nitrosarchaeum sp st3 by our group wang et al 2021b the high abundance and active expression of amoabc genes table s4 indicated that aoa were active ammonia oxidizers at the end of stage b which well correlated with the abundance and transcriptional activity at the genome level moreover the relatively highly expressed genes that encode urease ureabc were also identified in these two aoa mags table s4 hao gene was not identified in these two recovered aoa genomes which was consistent with the previous report reyes et al 2020 3 6 novel phages infect ammonia nitrite oxidizers spacer based searching results reported ten phages that might infect the studied microbes anammox 1 comammox 2 nob 3 aoa 4 table s5 in addition the homology match based searching results uncovered four phages infecting aoa 2 and comammox 2 only the viruses that had direct interactions with the hosts that recovered from this reactor i e amx1 1 nob8 1 comammox 4 aoa2 2 were selected for downstream analyses fig 6a and 6b results demonstrated that abundant anammox associated phages were identified in both the enriched viral metagenomes stage a and liquor and the biofilm metagenomes a3 and a4 additionally the phages associated with nob comammox and aoa were detected to be dominant in both the enriched and biofilm metagenomes of stage b which was consistent with their hosts prevalence and abundance the taxonomy classification results indicated that these viruses had not been clustered together with taxonomically known viromes from the database indicating that this ecosystem harbors novel viruses table s5 additionally only the genome of the com1 associated phage was complete and the other four were medium quality low quality and not determined tiers table s5 nonetheless all these phages encode the vital structural genes and viral like genes based on the annotation results of dram v fig 6c some putative amgs were identified from these phage genomes including one amg belongs to the sulfotransferases family was predicted in the amx2 associated phage which was associated with sulfation that contributes to the transfer reaction of sulfate groups and potentially plays a central role in some biological processes such as cell communication and growth zhong et al 2021 furthermore one amg encoding the ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase was predicted in the aoa2 associated phage which could provide the precursors necessary for dna synthesis catalyzing the biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotides from the corresponding ribonucleotides dwivedi et al 2013 moreover two phages infect nob and aoa based on widespread host search carrying the amg encoding the dctp deaminase an enzyme that supplies deoxyuridine monophosphates to thymidylate synthetase and is thought to regulate the levels of dntp required for phage dna synthesis šulčius et al 2019 however amgs involved in nitrogen metabolism have not been identified in these phages 4 discussion in this study variations in chemical and physical conditions along the rbc flowpath corresponded to a shift in the compositions of four types of reported ammonia oxidizers as well as diverse nob suggesting that the biofilm associated system is a great habitat for us to explore the distribution pattern symbiotic interactions and metabolic potential of these microorganisms in the wastewater treatment systems physicochemical factors had been proposed as the main factors that affect the diversity and distribution of the autotrophic ammonia nitrite oxidizers in the rbc reactor sauder et al 2012 spasov et al 2020 ammonium is presumed to be the primary biological substrate for ammonia oxidizers in this rbc reactor so the impact of the ammonium concentrations on community structure shifts was not surprising the occurrence of diverse aob and anammox bacteria with relatively high ammonium concentrations at stage a was consistent with a previous report shen et al 2016 the higher ammonium concentration creates a favorable environment for the growth of aob and anammox bacteria while the absence or lower abundance of nob at stage a may be explained by the high residual ammonium concentration and reduced oxygen accessibility some reports have demonstrated that residual ammonium facilitates nob suppression via favoring aob in the oxygen competition within the biofilm pérez et al 2014 wang et al 2022 in addition the lower oxygen monod half saturation constant of aob improves their competitiveness for oxygen within the oxygen limit conditions yang et al 2020b subsequently the decreased ammonium concentration along the rbc flowpath resulted in the prevalence and dominance of comammox and aoa at the end of stage b the verified high substrate affinities of comammox and aoa enable them to grow under lower substrate concentration jung et al 2021 kits et al 2017 and endow them with stronger competitiveness than nob and aob under the decreased substrate concentration in addition the layered structure of the rbc biofilm enables the colonization of these diverse microbes with different oxygen affinities the anoxic zone formed inside biofilm layers provides suitable living conditions for anammox bacteria the large surface area for attached growth may be an important factor explaining the dominance of comammox bacteria in which comammox might maintain high abundance due to their higher growth yield and oxygen affinity kits et al 2017 koch et al 2019 lawson and lücker 2018 similarly in addition to a high substrate affinity the higher oxygen affinity of aoa may explain its dominance at the end of stage b freeman et al 2020 in addition the mutualism or competition among microbes may be biotic factors that determine the ecological niche differentiations among ammonia nitrite oxidizers faust and raes 2012 gracia lázaro et al 2018 as has been demonstrated above aob and anammox co occurred at stage a and the lower concentration of nitrite 0 16 mg l in influent a1 implied that nitrite assimilated in the anammox process was mainly contributed by aob the only observed representative aerobic ammonia oxidizers at stage a subsequently the decreased cumulative relative abundance of anammox bacteria and shift of preponderant anammox species at stage b indicated the intense competition for ammonia and nitrite from other microbes related to nitrogen cycling e g comammox aob nob or even denitrifiers furthermore the relatively high relative abundance and expression of nob at stage b suggest that nitrite generated by comammox nitrospira aob and aoa may support the growth of nob at stage b implying the close connections and metabolites exchange between organisms in this system furthermore the high relative abundance and transcriptional activity of amx3 at stage b especially b1 are considered to be relevant to the genomic traits that allow them to occupy different ecological niches amx3 found in this ecosystem was affiliated to the genus scalindua derived from the marine environment mainly introduced by the seawater toilet flushing practice in hong kong the marine anammox bacteria adapt to growth in the anoxic zone with lower substrate concentrations or substrate limited conditions as well as the identified cyns coding gene in amx3 might contribute to the ammonia supply when the competition increased at stage b ganesh et al 2018 moreover the two aoa species dominating the end of this rbc reactor b4 and b5 were all affiliated to the genus nitrosocosmicus having the lowest affinity for both ammonia and total ammonium among all characterized aoa jung et al 2021 lehtovirta morley et al 2016 nicol et al 2019 as metabolically versatile microorganisms aoa have been verified to utilize some organic matters such as antibiotics or petroleum suggesting that the relatively high abundance of aoa might not only result from autotrophic growth but also their metabolic versatility zheng et al 2021 therefore the metabolic versatilities and adaptive mechanisms of aoa organisms are of great interest to be further investigated in the future numerous studies have presented that viruses are capable of adjusting the microbial community by mediating the recycling of organic matter in the habitats through bacterial killing and affecting the physiology and metabolism of their hosts during infection coutinho et al 2020 dion et al 2020 howard varona et al 2020 in this study a more comprehensive virus catalog was established through an enriched extraction approach which could potentially improve the integrity of the virus database and further contribute to the deep understanding of the host virus connections the consistent pattern regarding the prevalence and coverage of studied phages and their hosts implies their close connection and the probability that the phage infection might affect the abundance and metabolism of the microbial population amgs mainly responsible for cell communication and growth were identified in this study suggesting that phages might modulate host growth and metabolism through auxiliary metabolism however no amgs involved in the nitrogen cycle have been predicted in these phages viruses influence microbial nitrogen cycle as well as other hydrocarbon biodegradation and sulfur cycling via auxiliary metabolism have been reported previously gazitúa et al 2021 kieft et al 2021 li et al 2021 suggesting that the auxiliary metabolism of these phages in biofilm systems requires further study additionally the crispr cas spacers identified in most ammonia nitrite oxidizers indicated the prevalence of phage infection table s2 suggesting that understanding and exploration of the host virus associations in this ecosystem requires more contributions and knowledge the distribution pattern and symbiotic interactions of these microbes contributed to the efficient nitrogen conversion process in this rbc reactor the highly expressed key genes involved in the anammox reaction and abundant transcripts of ammonium and nitrite transporters implied that the anammox reaction was active at stage a although the potential nitrite competitors i e nob and key genes mediating the nitrite oxidation process were identified and expressed notably aob play an important role in providing nitrite at stage a distinct from the transcriptional activities of microbes at stage a the abundant transcripts of ammonia oxidation genes amoabc encoded by aoa and comammox suggested that they acted as the primary ammonia oxidizers especially at the end of this rbc reactor moreover the highly expressed nxra and nxrb genes encoded by comammox indicated that they also play a crucial role in the nitrite oxidation at the end of this rbc reactor theoretically the coupling of ammonia and nitrite oxidation of comammox could potentially decrease the production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide and may become the energy and cost effective alternative to the conventional biological nitrogen removal processes annavajhala et al 2018 therefore many studies focused on the potential of comammox capabilities in different natural and engineered systems have been conducted sun et al 2021 yang et al 2020a 2020b yuan et al 2021 furthermore the highly expressed ureabc genes highlight the potential of comammox nitrospira and aoa in urea utilization the generated ammonia can be used for ammonia oxidation in some ammonia limited environments collectively these microbes occupied different ecological niches and cooperated well to achieve autotrophic nitrogen conversion anammox and aob contributed to nitrogen turnover at stage a and comammox and aoa play a pivotal role in the nitrogen conversion at stage b especially at the end of this rbc reactor 5 conclusions in this rbc reactor the physicochemical factors associated with the variations of substrate concentration along the rbc flowpath characteristics of the biofilms and symbiotic interactions were linked to significant and disciplinary shifts in the spatial distribution and transcriptional activities of ammonia nitrite oxidizers including anammox aob aoa comammox and nob as well as the distribution of phages associated with these microbes the nontrivial collaboration of ammonia nitrite oxidizers at different treatment stages contributed to efficient nitrogen conversion in this ecosystem and the comprehensive interpretation of the spatial distribution and transcriptional activity highlighted the potential of comammox and aoa capacities in engineered systems furthermore ammonia nitrite oxidizers associated phages may modulate the host growth and metabolism via auxiliary metabolism thereby affecting the nitrogen cycle in this system overall our work may contribute substantially to the understanding of the niche distribution symbiotic relationships and metabolic capacity of ammonia nitrite oxidizers in a full scale rotating biological contactor furthermore the metabolic versatilities and adaptive mechanisms of these microbes are of great interest to be investigated in further studies authors contributions dou wang conceptualization

15462,although the distribution of ammonia nitrite oxidizers had been profiled in different habitats current understanding is still limited regarding their niche differentiation in the integrated biofilm reactors the symbiotic associations of ammonia nitrite oxidizers as well as the parasitic interaction between viruses and those functional organisms involved in the nitrogen cycle here the integrated metagenomics and metatranscriptomics are applied to profile the ammonia nitrite oxidizers communities and transcriptional activities changes along the flowpath of a concatenated full scale rotating biological contactor rbc frontend stage a and backend stage b 19 metagenome assembled genomes mags of ammonia nitrite oxidizers were recovered by using a hybrid assembly approach including four ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob two ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa two complete ammonia oxidation bacteria comammox eight nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and three anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria anammox diverse aob and anammox dominated stage a and collectively contributed to nitrogen conversion with the decline of ammonia concentration along the flowpath comammox and aoa appeared and increased in relative abundance in stage b accounting for 8 8 of the entire community at the end of this reactor and their dominating role in nitrogen turnover was indicated by the high transcription activity of their corresponding function genes moreover the variation in the abundance of viruses infecting ammonia and nitrite oxidizers suggests that viruses likely act as a biotic factor mediating ammonia nitrite oxidizer populations this study demonstrates that complex factors shaped niche differentiation and symbiotic associations of ammonia nitrite oxidizers in the rbc and highlights the importance of rbcs as model systems for the investigation of biotic and abiotic factors affecting the composition of microbiomes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonia nitrite oxidizers rbc niche differentiation symbiotic associations phage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aerobic chemolithoautotrophic nitrification as one crucial process involved in the nitrogen cycle is the earliest and most commonly adopted approach for nitrogen removal in engineered systems mccarty 2018 this process is mediated by universal ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob as well as the recently discovered complete ammonia oxidizer comammox daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 in addition to aerobic ammonia oxidation the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process also plays a vital role in global nitrogen cycling which has been estimated to account for 50 of n2 production in marine environments and contribute to efficient nitrogen removal in some freshwater systems wang et al 2021a as one of the most energy efficient biotechnologies for nitrogen removal anammox process has been widely applied in wastewater treatment works lackner et al 2014 lawson et al 2017 remarkably both nitrification and anammox processes in the engineered systems are commonly achieved in microbial cell aggregates either in the form of flocs granules or biofilms as they enable the higher biomass retention times that are necessary for the slow growing ammonia nitrite oxidizers kuenen 2008 navada et al 2020 nicolella et al 2000 moreover distinctive niches created by the substrate or oxygen gradients in the cell aggregates correspond to ecological niche differentiations and enable several microbial guilds to coexist navada et al 2020 yang et al 2020a 2020b among the cell aggregation ecosystems mentioned above some specific biofilm wastewater treatment systems such as the rotating biological contactor rbc and sand filters are of larger substrate gradients both in the layered biofilm and along the overall flowpath and this may facilitate the colonization of more diverse n metabolizing microorganisms with distinct substrate affinities fowler et al 2018 freeman et al 2020 co occurrence and distribution of aoa aob and nob in the rbc had been characterized in our previous study peng et al 2014 with declining ammonium and nitrite concentrations in the latter stages of the rbc reactor an increment in nitrospira abundance was observed and we speculated that a portion of these nitrospira populations might be comammox distribution of comammox nitrospira and accompanied by other ammonia oxidizers e g aob and aoa has been reported in the biofilm of rbc reactor spasov et al 2020 although the community structure and ecological role of microbes related to the nitrogen cycle in wwtps have been explored in previous studies systematic investigation of the distribution and symbiotic interactions have received little attention in the biofilm associated ecosystems beyond the aforementioned microbes directly involved in nitrogen metabolism viruses may also play a crucial role in the nitrogen cycle by mediating the metabolism of their hosts in the wwtps chen et al 2021 viruses infecting aob and nob have been reported in previous studies chen et al 2021 coutinho et al 2020 however less information is available about the viruses infecting aoa anammox and comammox the vast microbial diversity in the biofilm ecosystems implies that there might also be higher diversity of viruses and the relatively high abundance of microorganisms involved in nitrogen cycling harbored by biofilm may also lead us to uncover some related viruses peng et al 2014 spasov et al 2020 with the research questions illustrated above the distribution transcriptional activities and symbiotic interactions of ammonia nitrite oxidizers in a full scale rbc treating domestic wastewater were investigated through integrated metagenomics and metatranscriptomics approaches biofilm samples collected from different spatial locations along the flowpath were employed for the investigation additionally specific virus dna extraction and identification approaches were applied to establish the virus catalog profile the distribution of viruses and predict the potential interactions between viruses and their hosts the detailed profiles of the ammonia nitrite oxidizers and associated viruses enable us to have a more comprehensive understanding on their niche distribution interactions and metabolic capacities within the biofilm associated ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection nucleotide extraction and sequencing the studied rbc reactor operated at ma wan sewage treatment plant of hong kong is composed of two concatenated stages defined as stage a and stage b respectively nine biofilm samples were collected using clean brushes from the rbc train on march 19 2020 covering stage a four sampling points defined as a1 a2 a3 and a4 and stage b five sampling points defined as b1 b2 b3 b4 and b5 fig 1a samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after collection delivered to the lab and preserved at 80 c for subsequent dna and rna extraction and sequencing the detailed information on nucleotide extraction

different sampling points are listed in table s1 2 2 metagenomic analysis the iterative haplotype resolved hierarchical clustering based hybrid assembly hcbha approach was employed to reconstruct high quality genomes from highly complex metagenomes in the present study liu et al 2021 the recovered metagenome assembled genomes mags were dereplicated using drep v2 6 2 olm et al 2017 with an average nucleotide identity ani cutoff of 99 and minimum completeness of 50 checkm v1 1 3 parks et al 2015 was used to estimate the quality of the mags and only those mags with 50 completeness and 10 contamination were selected for the subsequent analyses the relative abundance of the recovered mags was calculated using coverm v0 4 0 https github com wwood coverm with the parameters of 90 read percent identity and 80 read aligned percent prodigal v2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 was used for open reading frames orfs prediction from the recovered mags to quantify the abundance of metabolic genes involved in nitrogen metabolism metagenomic reads were mapped to the predicted and annotated orfs from all recovered mags the gene abundance was expressed as genes per million gpm the mapped read counts were first divided by the gene length to get reads per kilobase rpk then the rpk values in a sample were summed up and divided the number by 1000 000 leading to gpm niederdorfer et al 2021 the mags discussed in this study have been deposited in the ncbi database under bioproject accession number prjna817718 and the genome accession numbers are listed in table s2 2 3 phylogenetic analysis and mags annotation gtdb tk v1 3 0 reference data version r95 chaumeil et al 2019 parks et al 2018 was used for the taxonomic classification of the recovered mags and the construction of the anammox comammox and aoa phylogenetic tree with reference genomes mags downloaded from ncbi database with a concatenated set of 120 bacteria specific and 122 archaea specific conserved marker genes respectively fasttree v2 1 10 price et al 2010 was used to infer the genome tree which was then imported into the interactive tree of life itol https itol embl de for tree annotation and interpretation letunic and bork 2021 the ani and average amino acid identity aai between newly recovered mags and reported genomes mags were determined using fastani v1 2 jain et al 2018 and comparem v0 1 1 https github com dparks1134 comparem with default parameters respectively the genes and metabolic traits of the newly recovered mags were annotated using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genome kegg ghostkoala kanehisa et al 2016 in addition the key genes involved in nitrogen metabolism and metabolic functional traits of both the newly recovered and reference genomes were also profiled by metabolic v4 0 zhou et al 2020 with default parameters 2 4 metatranscriptomic analysis sortmerna v4 0 0 kopylova et al 2012 was applied to remove non coding rna sequences from the metatranscriptomic data based on the multiple rrna databases for bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic sequences the transcription activity of individual mags was calculated by mapping the metatranscriptomic reads to the mags using coverm v0 4 0 with the parameters of 90 read percent identity and 80 read aligned percent transcripts per million tpm values calculated by rsem li and dewey 2011 were employed in this study to profile the gene expression 2 5 viral sample collection treatment and dna processing the samples used for phage catalog establishment were taken from the same rbc reactor simultaneously biofilms were randomly collected from rbc trains at different locations using sterilized brushes and milli q water composite samples were collected from stage a and stage b respectively in addition a total of 5 l liquor sample was also collected from stage a and stage b simultaneously fig 1a the detailed sample filtration and purification processes were described in the supplementary information dna was extracted from processed liquid samples with enriched viral particles using phage dna isolation kit norgen biotek corp canada with proteinase k following the manufacturer s instructions dna concentrations were measured using nanodrop thermo fisher scientific usa and dna samples were stored at 80 c for subsequent metagenomic sequencing 2 6 metagenomic viral contigs identification classification and annotation the sequencing data from three phage metagenomes were de novo co assembled using metaspades v3 13 0 nurk et al 2017 and subsequently assembled contigs were processed for downstream viral sequence identification two different approaches were employed for viral sequence identification a virsorter2 v2 1 guo et al 2021 and b a modified vhmm dna virus detection pipeline paez espino et al 2017 the detailed identification process and filtering criteria are described in the supplementary information metagenomic viral contigs identified by these two pipelines were merged and dereplicated for further analyses the taxonomy classification of retrieved viruses was conducted based on gene sharing network clustering using vcontact2 jang et al 2019 with the database version prokaryoticviralrefseq201 merged prediction and annotations of auxiliary metabolic genes amgs encoded by viral contigs were performed by dram v the viral mode embedded in dram shaffer et al 2020 2 7 host prediction of viruses to identify the broad host virus associations the viral contigs were searched against the manually curated crispr cas spacer database established by our group chen et al 2021 in addition the host virus interactions were specifically investigated on the mags of ammonia nitrite oxidizers retrieved from nine metagenomes of this rbc reactor to be specific four aob mags three anammox mags two aoa mags two comammox mags and eight nob mags a combination approach of crispr spacer matches blastn short 97 identity 90 coverage and 1 mismatch chen et al 2021 and genome sequence matches 90 identity over 500 bp nayfach et al 2021 was implemented crispr spacers were identified in these recovered mags using crispr recognition tool crt bland et al 2007 3 results 3 1 ammonia nitrite oxidizers occupy different ecological niches along the rbc flowpath the sampling points substrates concentrations and presence of microbiotas related to the nitrogen cycle are shown in fig 1 ammonium concentrations in the wastewater decreased along the rbc flowpath and a noticeable decrease trend from 34 7 mg l to 3 8 mg l was observed at stage b fig 1b the nitrite concentration exhibited low variation ranging from 0 1 mg l to 1 6 mg l at a relatively low level across all locations albeit with a slight increase along the flowpath except for point a1 the concentration of nitrate increased along the flowpath such concentration gradients observed in the different n chemicals may correlate to the prevalence of varying n metabolizing microbes along the rbc flowpath as expected variations in chemical and physical conditions along the rbc flowpath corresponded to a shift in ammonia and nitrite oxidizing communities fig 1c that were represented by the high quality mags fig 2a and table s2 recovered from this complex biofilm system including four aob two aoa two comammox eight nob include three canonical nob and five nob like and three anammox prevalence of aob was observed at all locations fig 1a and 1c albeit an extremely low abundance of aob was observed at a1 with the appearance of aob anammox bacteria were first found at a2 and relatively high abundance was observed in both stage a and the front part of stage b nob was first detected at a2 fig 1c and then colonized the entire flowpath after that intriguingly distinct nitrifying guilds i e aoa and comammox were found in the backend rbc train stage b the prevalence and colonization of diverse ammonia nitrite oxidizers suggested that the biofilm associated system is vital for us to explore the distribution pattern and symbiotic interactions of these microorganisms 3 2 shifts in abundance and transcriptional activity of ammonia nitrite oxidizers along the rbc flowpath the four aob organisms represented by the obtained mags were all affiliated with the genus nitrosomonas but had distinct distribution patterns along the rbc flowpath aob1 and aob4 colonized all locations with stable transcriptional activities while the dominating in abundance species shifted to the other two aob organisms especially aob2 at stage b fig 2b c and table s3 intriguingly lower activities of aob2 were observed at stage b which was not consistent with its higher abundance together with the prevalence of aob three anammox were first detected at a2 and their relative abundances gradually increased before b1 fig 2b the sum of the relative abundances of these three anammox bacteria in the community increased from 0 16 to 1 27 fig 2d and the portion in transcripts increased from 0 21 to 1 46 fig 2e which were in line with the increasing trend of aob relative abundance from 0 33 a2 to 0 85 a4 fig 2d at stage b the cumulative relative abundance of anammox bacteria decreased obviously albeit relatively high cumulative abundance of aob were observed compared to stage a stage b harbors more diverse ammonia nitrite oxidizers the transcriptional activities of eight recovered nob organisms fig 2c were in line with their relative abundance at each location fig 2b these nob had distinct distribution patterns although they colonized at all points of stage b in addition to these nob two comammox i e com1 and com2 also dominated in stage b fig 2b especially from b3 to b5 with the cumulative relative abundance of 4 50 6 63 fig 2d remarkable decreases in both the cumulative relative abundance and transcriptional activity of nob were observed from b3 while the relative abundance of comammox started to increase furthermore two aoa organisms were first detected at b3 aoa2 and b4 aoa1 fig 2b respectively the relatively high transcriptional activities of these two aoa were observed at the end of this rbc reactor in particular which represented a major proportion 0 46 in the transcripts at b5 3 3 collaboration of novel anammox bacteria and aob at stage a the consistent trend in the relative abundance and transcriptional activities of anammox and aob indicated that they could be the collaborators involved in the nitrogen metabolism at stage a phylogenetic analysis showed that all four aob were affiliated with the same genus nitrosomonas with 77 6 97 2 ani while diverse anammox bacteria affiliated to different genera were discovered among the three retrieved anammox mags amx1 might affiliate to a novel genus because it could only be assigned to the family level based on the gtdb tk annotation result and the phylogenetic analysis based on concatenated bacterial core protein alignments and 16s rrna gene sequences of published anammox genome representatives showed a consistent phylogenetic relationship of amx1 which formed a distinct branch relatively close to candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis whereas the other two anammox formed a separate clade with the representative anammox genomes retrieved from the marine environment and represent two novel species in the genus of scaelec01 fig 3a and fig s1 amx1 had a 93 similarity of 16s rrna gene with its phylogenetically closely related candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis also indicating that amx1 may represent a novel genus considering the commonly accepted cut off of 95 at genus level schloss and handelsman 2005 based on the annotation of metabolic pathways fig s2 the distinct metabolic traits of amx1 and other anammox species were observed regarding the ammonia oxidation capacity and metabolic divergence of these microbes the abundances and expression profiles of the amoabc and hao genes of aob1 and aob4 had 97 2 of ani indicated that they were the primary nitrite producer at stage a fig 3b surprisingly the extremely low expressions of the key genes in aob2 were observed albeit their relative higher abundances different from the above three aob species the ammonia oxidation genes in aob3 were more active at stage b based on the distribution patterns and transcriptional activities of these key genes it could be speculated that nitrite generated by aob1 and aob4 was transported to the anammox cells through the highly expressed nitrite transporters encoded by amx1 and amx2 table s4 to mediate anammox reaction at stage a no nirs or nirk genes mediating nitrite reduction were discovered in these three recovered anammox mags whereas multiple hao like genes with high transcriptional activity were identified fig 3c suggesting that some of these hao like genes might encode physiological nitrite reductases that reduce nitrite to nitric oxide kartal et al 2013 the highly expressed hzs complex and hdh genes of amx1 and amx2 at stage a were consistent with their transcriptional activities at the genome level on the contrary the high expression of these key metabolic genes encoded by amx3 was observed at stage b especially at b1 in addition the cyanase encoding gene cyns was identified and transcribed in amx3 table s4 implying that this anammox species is capable of converting the cyanate to ammonia directly serving as the alternative substrate the active expression of genes involved in ammonia oxidation suggested that the cooperation of aob and anammox contributed to the nitrogen conversion at stage a 3 4 abundant and active comammox nitrospira and nob at stage b the two comammox nitrospira mags com1 and com2 recovered in the present study were affiliated with clade a and clustered together with four comammox nitrospira mags rbc083 rbc001 rbc047 and rbc021 previously retrieved from an rbc reactor spasov et al 2020 and two comammox nitrospira mags ws110 and ws238 retrieved from a wwtp yang et al 2020a forming a basal monophyletic lineage fig 4a com1 had 98 3 of ani between it and com2 indicating that they may affiliate to the same species ani species level cutoff 95 jain et al 2018 and com1 and com2 had 89 3 and 89 1 ani to phylogenetically closest ws110 respectively the phylogenetic analysis based on amoa amino acids sequences confirmed the phylogenetically closed relationships among these genomes fig s3 of the eight nob mags three of them were canonical nob within the nitrospira a genera of the nitrospiraceae family and the other five classified as nob like based on the presence of nxra and nxrb genes affiliated to the same family of uba8639 belonging to the nitrospirales order taxonomy classification based on gtdb tk table s2 the nearly complete comammox nitrospira com1 encoded all key enzymes amo hao and nxr for complete ammonia oxidation the abundances and expressions of amoabc genes increased along the flowpath except for b4 which were consistent with the abundances and activities at the genome level fig 4b intriguingly the transcript numbers of amob gene were higher than that of amoa and amoc genes although the abundances of these genes were comparable notably the relatively highly expressed genes encoding urease ureabc and urea transporters urtabcde were also identified in these two comammox mags table s4 suggesting that the urea may be an additional ammonia source for comammox in wastewater genes encoding nitrite oxidoreductase nxr were prevalent in all newly recovered comammox and nob mags except the nxrb which was missing in com2 and nob5 the abundances and transcripts of nxr genes fig 4c fig s4 and table s4 in comammox mags increased along the flowpath and the highest expression was observed at b5 for canonical nob the active expression of nxr genes was only observed in nob6 nob7 and nob8 at stage a different scenarios were shown at stage b high expressions of nxra and nxrb genes especially nob2 were observed in almost all nob except nob3 and nob5 3 5 active ammonia oxidizing archaea at the end of rbc the two newly recovered aoa mags were phylogenetically clustered with the recently reported group i 1b wwtp aoa ca nitrosocosmicus hydrocola had a maximum aai of 56 3 and 72 6 respectively they all affiliated with the genus nitrosocosmicus fig 5 in addition aoa2 was phylogenetically close to the ca nitrosocosmicus sp ss belongs to the soil group i 1b thaumarchaeota aai 98 7 liu et al 2019 intriguingly the phylogenetic relationship was distinct between the newly recovered aoa mags and the recently reported wwtp aoa belonging to group i 1a ca nitrosopumilus sp st1 ca nitrosarchaeum sp st2 and ca nitrosarchaeum sp st3 by our group wang et al 2021b the high abundance and active expression of amoabc genes table s4 indicated that aoa were active ammonia oxidizers at the end of stage b which well correlated with the abundance and transcriptional activity at the genome level moreover the relatively highly expressed genes that encode urease ureabc were also identified in these two aoa mags table s4 hao gene was not identified in these two recovered aoa genomes which was consistent with the previous report reyes et al 2020 3 6 novel phages infect ammonia nitrite oxidizers spacer based searching results reported ten phages that might infect the studied microbes anammox 1 comammox 2 nob 3 aoa 4 table s5 in addition the homology match based searching results uncovered four phages infecting aoa 2 and comammox 2 only the viruses that had direct interactions with the hosts that recovered from this reactor i e amx1 1 nob8 1 comammox 4 aoa2 2 were selected for downstream analyses fig 6a and 6b results demonstrated that abundant anammox associated phages were identified in both the enriched viral metagenomes stage a and liquor and the biofilm metagenomes a3 and a4 additionally the phages associated with nob comammox and aoa were detected to be dominant in both the enriched and biofilm metagenomes of stage b which was consistent with their hosts prevalence and abundance the taxonomy classification results indicated that these viruses had not been clustered together with taxonomically known viromes from the database indicating that this ecosystem harbors novel viruses table s5 additionally only the genome of the com1 associated phage was complete and the other four were medium quality low quality and not determined tiers table s5 nonetheless all these phages encode the vital structural genes and viral like genes based on the annotation results of dram v fig 6c some putative amgs were identified from these phage genomes including one amg belongs to the sulfotransferases family was predicted in the amx2 associated phage which was associated with sulfation that contributes to the transfer reaction of sulfate groups and potentially plays a central role in some biological processes such as cell communication and growth zhong et al 2021 furthermore one amg encoding the ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase was predicted in the aoa2 associated phage which could provide the precursors necessary for dna synthesis catalyzing the biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotides from the corresponding ribonucleotides dwivedi et al 2013 moreover two phages infect nob and aoa based on widespread host search carrying the amg encoding the dctp deaminase an enzyme that supplies deoxyuridine monophosphates to thymidylate synthetase and is thought to regulate the levels of dntp required for phage dna synthesis šulčius et al 2019 however amgs involved in nitrogen metabolism have not been identified in these phages 4 discussion in this study variations in chemical and physical conditions along the rbc flowpath corresponded to a shift in the compositions of four types of reported ammonia oxidizers as well as diverse nob suggesting that the biofilm associated system is a great habitat for us to explore the distribution pattern symbiotic interactions and metabolic potential of these microorganisms in the wastewater treatment systems physicochemical factors had been proposed as the main factors that affect the diversity and distribution of the autotrophic ammonia nitrite oxidizers in the rbc reactor sauder et al 2012 spasov et al 2020 ammonium is presumed to be the primary biological substrate for ammonia oxidizers in this rbc reactor so the impact of the ammonium concentrations on community structure shifts was not surprising the occurrence of diverse aob and anammox bacteria with relatively high ammonium concentrations at stage a was consistent with a previous report shen et al 2016 the higher ammonium concentration creates a favorable environment for the growth of aob and anammox bacteria while the absence or lower abundance of nob at stage a may be explained by the high residual ammonium concentration and reduced oxygen accessibility some reports have demonstrated that residual ammonium facilitates nob suppression via favoring aob in the oxygen competition within the biofilm pérez et al 2014 wang et al 2022 in addition the lower oxygen monod half saturation constant of aob improves their competitiveness for oxygen within the oxygen limit conditions yang et al 2020b subsequently the decreased ammonium concentration along the rbc flowpath resulted in the prevalence and dominance of comammox and aoa at the end of stage b the verified high substrate affinities of comammox and aoa enable them to grow under lower substrate concentration jung et al 2021 kits et al 2017 and endow them with stronger competitiveness than nob and aob under the decreased substrate concentration in addition the layered structure of the rbc biofilm enables the colonization of these diverse microbes with different oxygen affinities the anoxic zone formed inside biofilm layers provides suitable living conditions for anammox bacteria the large surface area for attached growth may be an important factor explaining the dominance of comammox bacteria in which comammox might maintain high abundance due to their higher growth yield and oxygen affinity kits et al 2017 koch et al 2019 lawson and lücker 2018 similarly in addition to a high substrate affinity the higher oxygen affinity of aoa may explain its dominance at the end of stage b freeman et al 2020 in addition the mutualism or competition among microbes may be biotic factors that determine the ecological niche differentiations among ammonia nitrite oxidizers faust and raes 2012 gracia lázaro et al 2018 as has been demonstrated above aob and anammox co occurred at stage a and the lower concentration of nitrite 0 16 mg l in influent a1 implied that nitrite assimilated in the anammox process was mainly contributed by aob the only observed representative aerobic ammonia oxidizers at stage a subsequently the decreased cumulative relative abundance of anammox bacteria and shift of preponderant anammox species at stage b indicated the intense competition for ammonia and nitrite from other microbes related to nitrogen cycling e g comammox aob nob or even denitrifiers furthermore the relatively high relative abundance and expression of nob at stage b suggest that nitrite generated by comammox nitrospira aob and aoa may support the growth of nob at stage b implying the close connections and metabolites exchange between organisms in this system furthermore the high relative abundance and transcriptional activity of amx3 at stage b especially b1 are considered to be relevant to the genomic traits that allow them to occupy different ecological niches amx3 found in this ecosystem was affiliated to the genus scalindua derived from the marine environment mainly introduced by the seawater toilet flushing practice in hong kong the marine anammox bacteria adapt to growth in the anoxic zone with lower substrate concentrations or substrate limited conditions as well as the identified cyns coding gene in amx3 might contribute to the ammonia supply when the competition increased at stage b ganesh et al 2018 moreover the two aoa species dominating the end of this rbc reactor b4 and b5 were all affiliated to the genus nitrosocosmicus having the lowest affinity for both ammonia and total ammonium among all characterized aoa jung et al 2021 lehtovirta morley et al 2016 nicol et al 2019 as metabolically versatile microorganisms aoa have been verified to utilize some organic matters such as antibiotics or petroleum suggesting that the relatively high abundance of aoa might not only result from autotrophic growth but also their metabolic versatility zheng et al 2021 therefore the metabolic versatilities and adaptive mechanisms of aoa organisms are of great interest to be further investigated in the future numerous studies have presented that viruses are capable of adjusting the microbial community by mediating the recycling of organic matter in the habitats through bacterial killing and affecting the physiology and metabolism of their hosts during infection coutinho et al 2020 dion et al 2020 howard varona et al 2020 in this study a more comprehensive virus catalog was established through an enriched extraction approach which could potentially improve the integrity of the virus database and further contribute to the deep understanding of the host virus connections the consistent pattern regarding the prevalence and coverage of studied phages and their hosts implies their close connection and the probability that the phage infection might affect the abundance and metabolism of the microbial population amgs mainly responsible for cell communication and growth were identified in this study suggesting that phages might modulate host growth and metabolism through auxiliary metabolism however no amgs involved in the nitrogen cycle have been predicted in these phages viruses influence microbial nitrogen cycle as well as other hydrocarbon biodegradation and sulfur cycling via auxiliary metabolism have been reported previously gazitúa et al 2021 kieft et al 2021 li et al 2021 suggesting that the auxiliary metabolism of these phages in biofilm systems requires further study additionally the crispr cas spacers identified in most ammonia nitrite oxidizers indicated the prevalence of phage infection table s2 suggesting that understanding and exploration of the host virus associations in this ecosystem requires more contributions and knowledge the distribution pattern and symbiotic interactions of these microbes contributed to the efficient nitrogen conversion process in this rbc reactor the highly expressed key genes involved in the anammox reaction and abundant transcripts of ammonium and nitrite transporters implied that the anammox reaction was active at stage a although the potential nitrite competitors i e nob and key genes mediating the nitrite oxidation process were identified and expressed notably aob play an important role in providing nitrite at stage a distinct from the transcriptional activities of microbes at stage a the abundant transcripts of ammonia oxidation genes amoabc encoded by aoa and comammox suggested that they acted as the primary ammonia oxidizers especially at the end of this rbc reactor moreover the highly expressed nxra and nxrb genes encoded by comammox indicated that they also play a crucial role in the nitrite oxidation at the end of this rbc reactor theoretically the coupling of ammonia and nitrite oxidation of comammox could potentially decrease the production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide and may become the energy and cost effective alternative to the conventional biological nitrogen removal processes annavajhala et al 2018 therefore many studies focused on the potential of comammox capabilities in different natural and engineered systems have been conducted sun et al 2021 yang et al 2020a 2020b yuan et al 2021 furthermore the highly expressed ureabc genes highlight the potential of comammox nitrospira and aoa in urea utilization the generated ammonia can be used for ammonia oxidation in some ammonia limited environments collectively these microbes occupied different ecological niches and cooperated well to achieve autotrophic nitrogen conversion anammox and aob contributed to nitrogen turnover at stage a and comammox and aoa play a pivotal role in the nitrogen conversion at stage b especially at the end of this rbc reactor 5 conclusions in this rbc reactor the physicochemical factors associated with the variations of substrate concentration along the rbc flowpath characteristics of the biofilms and symbiotic interactions were linked to significant and disciplinary shifts in the spatial distribution and transcriptional activities of ammonia nitrite oxidizers including anammox aob aoa comammox and nob as well as the distribution of phages associated with these microbes the nontrivial collaboration of ammonia nitrite oxidizers at different treatment stages contributed to efficient nitrogen conversion in this ecosystem and the comprehensive interpretation of the spatial distribution and transcriptional activity highlighted the potential of comammox and aoa capacities in engineered systems furthermore ammonia nitrite oxidizers associated phages may modulate the host growth and metabolism via auxiliary metabolism thereby affecting the nitrogen cycle in this system overall our work may contribute substantially to the understanding of the niche distribution symbiotic relationships and metabolic capacity of ammonia nitrite oxidizers in a full scale rotating biological contactor furthermore the metabolic versatilities and adaptive mechanisms of these microbes are of great interest to be investigated in further studies authors contributions dou wang conceptualization

15463,intensive use of antibiotics affects biogeochemical cycles and stimulates the evolution of antibiotic resistance thus threatening global health and social development the spatiotemporal distributions of antibiotics in single aqueous matrices have been widely documented however their occurrence in surface groundwater systems has received less attention especially in arid regions that usually have fragile ecosystems therefore we investigated the occurrence of thirty one antibiotics in the surface water and adjacent groundwater in the xinjiang uygur autonomous region china the results showed that the total concentrations of detected antibiotics varied from 17 37 to 84 09 ng l 1 and from 16 38 to 277 41 ng l 1 in surface and groundwater respectively the median concentration of antibiotics showed the pattern of norfloxacin 4 86 ng l 1 ciprofloxacin 3 93 ng l 1 pefloxacin 3 39 ng l 1 in surface water whereas in groundwater this was in the order of pefloxacin 6 30 ng l 1 norfloxacin 4 33 ng l 1 ciprofloxacin 2 68 ng l 1 heatmap analysis indicated that vertical infiltration had limited effects on antibiotic exchange in surface ground water systems because of the high potential evaporation and low water storage redundancy analysis suggested that the oxidation reduction potential p 0 01 and dissolved oxygen p 0 05 jointly affected the distribution of antibiotics in surface water ecological risk assessment showed that antibiotics in 98 9 of surface water and 99 1 of groundwater did not pose significant risks to aquatic species the findings of this study will help develop effective mitigation strategies for antibiotics in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotics arid regions redundancy analysis risk quotient surface groundwater system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics are intensively used to promote livestock growth and treat animal and human diseases oecd 2019 it has been reported that 63 151 tons of antibiotics were used for food animals globally in 2010 and this number is projected to reach 105 596 tons by 2030 van boeckel et al 2015 the daily dose consumption of antibiotics by humans is expected to rise by 202 worldwide from 42 3 billion in 2015 to 128 billion by 2030 klein et al 2018 in terms of environmental behavior antibiotics enter the natural environment during production cardoso et al 2014 administration ghirardini et al 2020 roberts et al 2016 and disposal yu et al 2020 antibiotics have been widely detected in different environments including soils pan et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 sediments kalantzi et al 2021 plants tadić et al 2021 food products li et al 2017 and water chen et al 2020 fattore et al 2018 zainab et al 2021 high antibiotic load in the environment disturbs environmental microbial processes mcrose and newman 2021 and promotes global antibiotic resistance gene transitions pärnänen et al 2022 zhu et al 2017 thus antibiotic residues are of great concern for the ecological safety of stakeholders and policymakers surface water provides habitat and food for amphibians and aquatic organisms whereas groundwater provides 50 of domestic water use globally unesco world water assessment programme 2022 however water has been recognized as the receptor for mass fluxes of antibiotics in the environment chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 aquatic antibiotic pollution has been investigated and reviewed globally anh et al 2021 bexfield et al 2019 carvalho and santos 2016 the concentrations of antibiotics in freshwater range from undetectable to several mg l 1 kovalakova et al 2020 which potentially exceed the upper thresholds of antibiotic resistance and pose health risks bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 as a result pharmaceutical contamination in surface water poses health threats to aquatic organisms in more than a quarter of the world s rivers wilkinson et al 2022 furthermore 80 2 of the isolates from global groundwater samples were resistant to at least one antimicrobial andrade et al 2020 surface water and groundwater are interconnected and pollutants migrate between them mutually hintze et al 2020 wallis et al 2020 during the hydrological cycling process groundwater serves as the receiver of infiltration from surface water and in turn the provider or origin of streamflow unesco who unep 1996 considerable surface groundwater exchanges have been discovered downstream of wastewater treatment plants and effluent discharge has been identified as the main source of pharmaceutical contamination in groundwater bradley et al 2014 nevertheless antibiotic behavior in the surface groundwater system and factors that control the connectivity between them are not well understood therefore a comprehensive understanding of antibiotic contamination in surface groundwater systems is required for clean water availability and environmental sustainability in addition drylands largely act as rangelands for livestock production covering 41 of the earth s land surface which potentially introduces a large burden of antibiotics into the environment u n convention to combat desertification 2017 drylands are the most vulnerable areas because of their exploited resources and increasing stress from climate change causing a lack of resistance to environmental pollution sietz et al 2011 u n convention to combat desertification 2017 thus drylands are hotspots not only for environmental regulation but also for ecosystem diversity the environmental behavior of antibiotics under drought conditions has been previously examined among the different climate regions groundwater in semi arid zones was found to have higher antibiotic concentrations than that in semi humid and humid zones ma et al 2015 in contrast evaporative enrichment of pharmaceuticals was found in an unsaturated column study indicating the accumulation effect of pharmaceuticals in groundwater under arid climate conditions zemann et al 2016 several studies have investigated the distribution of antibiotics in surface water and wastewater in arid areas lei et al 2015 li et al 2016 wang et al 2021 however relatively little research has focused on the interactions between antibiotics in aqueous environments particularly in arid regions accordingly to establish a thorough understanding of antibiotic behavior and latent effects on ecosystems thirty one antibiotics in surface water and groundwater were studied in a typical oasis with a focus on antibiotic transport drivers and risk assessment the detailed objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the occurrence and distribution patterns of antibiotics in surface water and its surrounding groundwater 2 understand the potential interactions between surface water and groundwater and their influencing factors and 3 evaluate the species specific ecological risks of antibiotics in the short and long term in the study area the results of this study can help regulate water protection strategies in arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the xinjiang uygur autonomous region is located inland in eurasia and northwest china the annual average temperature and precipitation in the xinjiang uygur autonomous region are 10 5 c and 145 7 mm respectively statistic bureau of xinjiang uygur autonomous region 2020 the population density 15 people per square kilometer in xinjiang is approximately one tenth of the national average population density chn national bureau of statistic 2020 statistic bureau of xinjiang uygur autonomous region 2020 as shown in fig 1 eighteen surface water samples were collected from the qira river chs1 chs10 and sangong river ws1 ws8 five groundwater samples cds1 cds5 were collected from the qira oasis the sampling campaign was conducted in august 2019 detailed descriptions of the sampling sites and sample collection procedures are listed in tables s1 and supplementary text s1 respectively supplementary material 2 2 chemicals and standards thirty one target antibiotics were tested including one chloramphenicol cps two diaminopyrimidines dps nine fluoroquinolones fqs one lincosamide las three macrolides mls thirteen sulfonamides sas and two tetracyclines tcs nine isotopically labeled antibiotics were spiked for chemical quantification the details are listed in table s2 2 3 sample extraction and quantification briefly water samples 1 l were first filtered through 0 7 μm glass fiber filters whatman gf f fisher scientific loughborough uk supernatants extracted from suspended particles that were attached to filters were transferred to the filtered samples filtered water samples were then extracted and eluted using oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb cartridges 500 mg 6 ml waters milford usa which were subsequently evaporated by nitrogen and redissolved in 1 ml methanol until instrumental analysis ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry uplc acquity xevo tq s waters milford usa was used to quantify the target antibiotics two duplicates for each sample were analyzed to avoid random errors the standard concentrations ranged from 1 to 250 ng l 1 supplementary text s2 provides details regarding the sample extraction procedures and instrumental analysis parameters table s2 lists information regarding compound recoveries 46 6 162 7 and standard curves r2 0 9776 0 9999 2 4 risk assessment ecological risks were evaluated using the risk quotient rq approach u s epa 2021 the rq is defined as the ratio of the measured environmental concentration mec to the predicted no effect concentration pnec indicating the likelihood of adverse effects the toxicity profile consists of acute short term and chronic long term toxicity toxicity data were selected from the ecotox database cfpub epa gov ecotox accessed may 2022 on three trophic levels primary producers e g green algae and blue green algae primary consumers e g crustaceans and secondary consumers e g fish according to the recommendations of the u s epa 2016 when experimental data were not available from ecotox predicted values from ecosar v2 0 www epa gov tsca screening tools ecological structure activity relationships ecosar predictive model accessed august 2022 were chosen instead danofloxacin was not included in the ecological risk evaluation owing to the lack of toxicity data erythromycin h2o etm h2o toxicity values were acquired from its parent compound erythromycin because relevant data were not available detailed formulas and toxicity data are provided in supplementary text s3 and table s6 the ecological risks are classified into three levels according to the rq values 0 01 0 1 indicating a low risk 0 1 1 indicating a medium risk and 1 high risk to the environment 2 5 statistical analysis the maximum likelihood estimation method was performed to acquire descriptive statistics data median arithmetic mean and standard deviation values using cenmle function in the r nada package the concentration data were assumed to follow a log normal distribution cenanova and cen2means functions in the r nada2 package were performed with the concentration data to understand the distribution patterns of antibiotics a one way anova test aov function coupled with a tukey s posthoc test tukeyhd function was conducted for ecological risk evaluations heatmap and redundancy analyses were conducted using the pheatmap and rda functions respectively all analyses and functions were performed in r version 4 0 3 the r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria 3 results and discussion 3 1 antibiotics in surface water 3 1 1 concentrations and compositions the concentrations and detection frequencies df of the antibiotics are listed in table s3 twenty of thirty one target antibiotics were detected in the surface water for the antibiotic groups lincosamides las showed the highest median concentration in surface water samples 2 85 ng l 1 fluoroquinolones fqs were the dominant antibiotic group ranging from 42 8 to 92 2 median 63 6 followed by lincosamides las 0 29 3 median 10 5 and sulfonamides sas 2 5 13 6 median 8 1 individual antibiotic concentrations ranged from nd not detected i e lower than the method detection limits to 25 10 ng l 1 norfloxacin nfx with a range of 1 16 25 10 ng l 1 median value 4 86 ng l 1 showed the highest concentration among selected antibiotics followed by ciprofloxacin cfx median 3 93 ng l 1 and pefloxacin pef median 3 39 ng l 1 fig 2 even though pef and lincomycin lin displayed a slightly higher median concentration than that of cfx fig 2 we consider that the median values generated using the cenmle method nada package which handles left censoring data are more reasonable the summed concentrations of the fqs were significantly correlated with the total concentrations n 18 p 0 001 pearson correlation the relatively low octanol water partition coefficient of fqs log kow from 2 92 to 1 07 table s4 suggests that fqs are more soluble in water and tend to be transported in the environment yao et al 2017 however the highest concentration of las in surface water was related to the intensive use of lincomycin the third most prescribed antibiotic in china in 2013 zhang et al 2015 likewise sas and dps conjointly shared 8 of the total antibiotic usage in northwest china zhang et al 2015 both of which were detected at a median concentration of only 0 17 ng l 1 in the study area compared to the rest of china antibiotic concentrations in the study area were substantially lower than those in southern china with a mean concentration of 34 ng l 1 zhang et al 2021 in central china within the range of nd 745 2 ng l 1 wang et al 2017 and in eastern china within the range of 0 02 502 43 ng l 1 zhu et al 2021 compared to global concentrations in this study surface water showed higher concentrations of antibiotics than those in italy range 2 25 ng l 1 verlicchi et al 2014 but relatively lower concentrations than those in vietnam nd 15 591 ng l 1 tran et al 2019 and ghana nd 2861 ng l 1 azanu et al 2018 the detected antibiotic concentrations were similar to those in spain ranging from nd 150 43 ng l 1 osorio et al 2016 and those in the rhine river 2 101 ng l 1 ruff et al 2015 accordingly the surface water in the studied rivers was less polluted with antibiotics compared to the rest of china and was at an intermediate level of antibiotic pollution 3 1 2 spatial distribution patterns the total concentrations of the thirty one antibiotics varied from 17 37 to 84 09 ng l 1 in surface water fig 3 a spatial variability of antibiotic concentrations was found neither in the qira river nor in the sangong river p 0 05 for both the qira and sangong river cenanova function however except for site chs3 the total concentrations of antibiotics at the lower reaches of the qira river chs7 chs10 17 37 21 04 ng l 1 were lower than those at the upper reaches chs1 chs6 21 45 80 48 ng l 1 chs3 17 95 ng l 1 the majority of sampling sites in the qira river are located in grassland desert areas with less impact from anthropogenic activities and natural attenuation led to decreased antibiotic concentrations in the qira river concerning the sangong river generally antibiotic concentrations in waters downstream of the sangong river were higher than those upstream except for ws2 increased by 71 4 from 30 13 ng l 1 at ws1 to 51 64 ng l 1 at ws8 fig 3a because the sangong river is a local creek with few tributaries continuous inputs along the river caused antibiotic accumulation lei et al 2019 the high occurrence of antibiotics at ws2 could be attributed to intensive human activity specifically ws2 is close to the tianshan tianchi scenic area which leads to greater antibiotic loads from a more densely populated region particularly during the peak tourist season of august 3 2 antibiotics in groundwater 3 2 1 concentrations and compositions twenty four of the target antibiotics were detected in the groundwater the fqs had the highest median concentration 1 83 ng l 1 among the seven groups of antibiotics dps were detected only at cds3 fqs were also the predominant group in groundwater with proportions ranging from 19 1 to 86 6 median 73 0 followed by sas 4 9 44 5 median 8 0 and macrolides mls 3 3 7 4 median 4 5 the concentrations of the individual antibiotics ranged from nd to 55 19 ng l 1 pef had the highest concentration with a median value of 6 30 ng l 1 followed by nfx 4 33 ng l 1 and cfx 2 68 ng l 1 the pollution level of antibiotics in this study was at an intermediate level compared with that reported in previous studies fu et al 2022 reported a total concentration of 39 antibiotics ranging from nd to 196 12 ng l 1 in northern china yao et al 2017 reported the highest nfx and cip concentrations with the median value of 8 55 ng l 1 and 4 51 ng l 1 respectively antibiotic contamination in a karst river in southwest china median concentrations nd 433 ng l 1 was more severe than that observed in this study zou et al 2018 globally antibiotic concentrations in the study area were lower than those in romania szekeres et al 2018 spain boy roura et al 2018 and pakistan zainab et al 2021 but higher than those in germany balzer et al 2016 burke et al 2016 antibiotic pollution levels in the study area were comparable to those in kenya k oreje et al 2016 and switzerland huntscha et al 2012 3 2 2 spatial distribution patterns the total concentrations of the thirty one antibiotics ranged from 16 38 to 277 41 ng l 1 in groundwater fig 3b although the straight line distance between sites cds2 and cds3 was approximately 100 m the total antibiotic concentration at cds3 was 10 fold that at cds2 the difference in concentrations between cds2 and cds3 can be attributed to differences in land use patterns specifically cds2 is located in forestland with relatively high soil moisture whereas cds3 is located in a grassland with more arid soils tang et al 2021 and zhang et al 2022 also observed negative correlations between pharmaceutical concentrations and the percentage of forest area besides sas were proven to be persistent and accumulable in deep and aged groundwaters kivits et al 2018 their higher percentage in the total concentration at cds3 44 5 than that at cds2 8 0 was also a contributor to the higher antibiotic concentration at cds3 than that at cds2 3 3 comparison between antibiotics in surface water and groundwater 3 3 1 concentrations and compositions the mean detection frequency of antibiotics in groundwater 55 5 was slightly higher than that in surface water 51 8 indicating the ubiquity of antibiotics in groundwater and emphasizing the importance of routine groundwater monitoring programs no significant differences in antibiotic concentrations between surface water and groundwater were found p 0 06 cen2means function hereafter however the median and mean concentration of antibiotics in groundwater median 0 42 ng l 1 mean standard deviations 2 84 19 05 ng l 1 were higher than the corresponding concentration in surface water median 0 35 ng l 1 mean standard deviations 1 35 5 11 ng l 1 likewise dps and sas concentrations in groundwater were higher than the concentration of the corresponding antibiotic group in surface water p 0 06 for dps p 0 01 for sas in contrast the concentrations of las and tetracyclines tcs in surface water were significantly higher than those of the corresponding group of antibiotics in groundwater p 0 05 for las and tcs gray et al 2020 reported comparable levels of antibiotic contamination in surface water and groundwater however several studies have revealed higher concentrations in river water than those in groundwater fu et al 2022 vulliet and cren olivé 2011 yao et al 2017 the interception of soil and the unsaturated zone protects groundwater from surface water pollution gaston et al 2019 in our study we considered that the higher contamination of groundwater by antibiotics could be explained by the aeolian sandy soil texture in the qira oasis which is located on the verge of the taklamakan desert liu et al 2018 the average 76 50 μm size of soil particles and mean 1 8 clay content 2 μm in soils in the qira oasis have been recorded previously su et al 2021 wan et al 2013 soils with higher sandy minerals are prone to have better permeability and low antibiotic retention capacity pils and laird 2007 zhi et al 2019 which results in a greater migration of pollutants from soil to groundwater furthermore geothermal activity which creates aerobic redox conditions and hinders antibiotic degradation contributes to the prevalence of antibiotics in groundwater garcía gil et al 2018 fqs were the most detected and highly concentrated antibiotic groups in both the surface and groundwater indicating the widespread use of fqs in the study area however two compounds with the highest concentrations pef and nfx were banned in 2016 for food animals in china chn ministry of agriculture and rural affairs 2015 this implies that fqs persist in the environment sas have much smaller distribution coefficient kd values e g sulfamethazine 1 37 0 16 l kg 1 than those of other antibiotic groups e g tetracycline 1093 91 6 l kg 1 nfx 591 35 0 l kg 1 pan and chu 2016 implying the strong mobility of sas in soil harrower et al 2021 and subsequent accumulation in groundwater in addition because biodegradation is the main removal pathway for sas oberoi et al 2019 sas are eliminated to a lesser extent by microbial communities in anaerobic groundwater compared with aerobic surface water studies have reported either moderate or strong sorptions of trimethoprim tmp which belongs to dps in the soil resulting in a low possibility for tmp leaching into groundwater burke et al 2016 lin and gan 2011 however the sorption coefficients of tmp are positively related to cation exchange capability cec and organic carbon oc content kodešová et al 2015 peng et al 2015 sandy soils which usually have smaller cec and oc values provide fewer active sorption sites for ionized tmp in high ph environments which leads to less tmp retention in soils franklin et al 2022 tcs molecules are rich in functional groups which induce a high affinity of tcs to the soil through electrostatic interactions and ion exchanges dominated by positively charged groups figueroa et al 2004 and hydrogen bonding dominated by polar functional groups gu et al 2007 the chelator nature of tcs causes their high residue in soil and low occurrence in groundwater boy roura et al 2018 3 3 2 spatial distribution characteristics of the thirty one compounds only frequently detected antibiotics detection frequency 87 0 were included in the heatmap analysis the heatmap interpreted the distribution patterns of antibiotics fig 3c in the vertical direction antibiotics were divided into two main clusters cluster 1 including three fqs sarafloxacin ofx and pef two sas sulfathiazole and sulfamerazine and doxycycline was the dominant pollutant not only at the groundwater sites cds but also at the surface water sites in the sangong river ws cluster 2a which includes lin sulfapyridine and two fqs fleroxacin and marbofloxacin was largely loaded only at site cds3 cluster 2b includes etm h2o ff sulfaguanidine sg and three fqs nfx cfx and danofloxacin which was highly loaded in surface water in the horizontal direction the sampling sites were divided into five minor clusters according to their geographic positions i site cds3 groundwater ii the sangong river ws iii the rest of the groundwater except for cds3 iv upstream of the qira river chs and v downstream of the qira river chs9 and chs10 are located in qira county which is more densely populated than the upstream sampling sites ff and sg are two veterinary drugs that are heavily enriched in the lower reaches of the qira river indicating the impact of human activity notably although the groundwater sampling sites cluster i and cluster iii are geographically closer to surface water sites near the qira river cluster v their antibiotic distribution patterns were dissimilar this finding revealed that vertical infiltration and subsequent leaching from surface water did not govern the fate of antibiotics in groundwater in arid regions because of water deficiency boy roura et al 2018 also reported a weak interplay of antibiotics in surface water and groundwater because of the low hydraulic gradients 3 4 factors influencing antibiotic distributions redundancy analysis rda was conducted to identify the potential factors influencing antibiotic distribution in the surface water antibiotics with low detection 87 0 were not included in the rda model we measured six environmental characteristics ph dissolved oxygen do total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec salinity and oxidation reduction potential orp tds and salinity were removed from the rda model owing to the presence of multicollinearity variance inflation factor 10 vif function in faraway package bruce and bruce 2017 the rda triplot fig 4 indicated that 36 5 axis1 24 8 axis2 9 8 of the variation in the antibiotic concentrations was explained by selected environmental parameters in total this suggests that the selected variables did not strongly affect the distribution of antibiotics in surface water sites from the same river showed antibiotic compositional similarity the sangong river tends to be dominated by fqs and tcs quadrant iii in the left panel of fig 4 whereas las and sas tend to be most abundant in the qira river quadrant i in the right panel of fig 4 the results showed that the distribution and concentration of antibiotics were significantly affected by orp and do p 0 01 for orp p 0 05 for do since ph and ec were not significantly correlated with response variables p 0 05 their influence on antibiotics is not discussed here however previous studies report that ph may affect the removal efficiency of antibiotics via ph mediated reactions such as hydrolysis and epimerization li and zhang 2012 loftin et al 2008 meanwhile aqueous solutions with high ec can introduce faster electron transfer and increase the degradation rates of antibiotics choudhary et al 2021 however positive correlations between ec content and antibiotic concentrations were discovered by chen et al 2022 and huang et al 2019 in this study orp had a strong negative effect on the concentrations of fqs dps and tcs but had no relationship with cps and mls a higher orp environment can mitigate antibiotic contamination because the abundant microbial population in an aerobic environment promotes antibiotic removal hussain et al 2012 do values were negatively correlated with the concentrations of most antibiotics which is consistent with the conclusions of ma et al 2022 and wang et al 2017 the reason for the negative relationship between do and antibiotics is that biodegradation rates are higher under aerobic conditions than in anaerobic liu et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 there was a positive relationship between the do and mls concentrations considering that mls are the most heavily used antibiotic group in china 854 tons of mls versus 180 519 tons of other groups of antibiotics zhang et al 2015 we speculate that the concentrations of the overused mls exceeded the degradation capability and bioavailability of microorganisms in surface water and presented inadequate antibiotic removal in high do environments the number of groundwater samples was insufficient for a rda analysis thus we formed a correlation matrix to determine the relationships between environmental factors and antibiotics in groundwater no significant relationships were found between any values of environmental factors and antibiotic group concentrations p 0 05 however insignificant correlations could be argued because the sample size was small in this correlation analysis these relationships need to be explored using larger sample sizes for reference zainab et al 2021 reported that tetracycline was negatively correlated with ec but positively correlated with tds 3 5 risk assessment fig 5 a and b depict the ecological risks of antibiotics in surface water and groundwater respectively including acute and chronic risks at three trophic levels the ecological risks of antibiotics in surface water ranged from 0 to 0 16 from 0 to 0 02 and from 0 to 2 33 10 4 for algae daphnids and fish respectively 98 9 3312 out of 3348 of samples posed insignificant ecological risks to species in the surface water both etm h2o and lin posed low acute ecological risks to algae in 88 9 of surface water samples nfx posed a low chronic risk to daphnids at ws7 suggesting possible accumulation and long lasting effects of nfx on organisms the ecological risks of antibiotics in groundwater ranged from 0 to 0 22 from 0 to 6 82 10 3 and from 0 to 5 52 10 4 for algae daphnids and fish respectively 99 1 922 out of 930 of samples posed insignificant ecological risks to species in groundwater clarithromycin posed a medium acute risk to algae at cds3 whereas etm h2o and lin posed low acute risks to algae in groundwater no antibiotics were found to exert long term ecological risks in the groundwater of the study area the differences in the ecological risk posed by antibiotics between the surface and groundwater were not significant p 0 05 nevertheless the ecological risks among between species and exposure duration varied regarding exposure duration chronic toxicities were significantly lower than acute toxicities p 0 01 the risks also differed among species p 0 01 risk quotient rq values for algae were significantly higher than those for daphnids and fish however there were no significant differences between the ecological risks posed to daphnids and fish p 0 05 this indicates that algae are the most sensitive organisms for risk assessments generally las and mls had higher rq values than those of the remaining groups demonstrating that organisms are more vulnerable to the toxic effects of las and mls 4 conclusions this study investigated the distribution and potential risks of antibiotics in the surface and groundwater as well as the connections between antibiotics in the surface groundwater system in a typical oasis the major findings are as follows 1 groundwater showed higher detection frequencies and greater concentrations of antibiotics compared with surface water 2 fluoroquinolones dominated antibiotic concentrations in both water compartments whereas the composition patterns consisted by other antibiotic groups displayed inconsistency between surface water and groundwater 3 consumption pattern antibiotic characteristics and overlying soil properties contributed to the dissimilarity in antibiotic behavior between surface water and adjacent groundwater and 4 erythromycin h2o and lincomycin were the greatest contributors to antibiotic risks to the aquatic ecosystem various parameters including hydrogeological factors could be included in deciphering the processes and mechanisms of antibiotic migration in the environment in the future this study highlights the importance of regular groundwater monitoring

15463,intensive use of antibiotics affects biogeochemical cycles and stimulates the evolution of antibiotic resistance thus threatening global health and social development the spatiotemporal distributions of antibiotics in single aqueous matrices have been widely documented however their occurrence in surface groundwater systems has received less attention especially in arid regions that usually have fragile ecosystems therefore we investigated the occurrence of thirty one antibiotics in the surface water and adjacent groundwater in the xinjiang uygur autonomous region china the results showed that the total concentrations of detected antibiotics varied from 17 37 to 84 09 ng l 1 and from 16 38 to 277 41 ng l 1 in surface and groundwater respectively the median concentration of antibiotics showed the pattern of norfloxacin 4 86 ng l 1 ciprofloxacin 3 93 ng l 1 pefloxacin 3 39 ng l 1 in surface water whereas in groundwater this was in the order of pefloxacin 6 30 ng l 1 norfloxacin 4 33 ng l 1 ciprofloxacin 2 68 ng l 1 heatmap analysis indicated that vertical infiltration had limited effects on antibiotic exchange in surface ground water systems because of the high potential evaporation and low water storage redundancy analysis suggested that the oxidation reduction potential p 0 01 and dissolved oxygen p 0 05 jointly affected the distribution of antibiotics in surface water ecological risk assessment showed that antibiotics in 98 9 of surface water and 99 1 of groundwater did not pose significant risks to aquatic species the findings of this study will help develop effective mitigation strategies for antibiotics in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotics arid regions redundancy analysis risk quotient surface groundwater system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics are intensively used to promote livestock growth and treat animal and human diseases oecd 2019 it has been reported that 63 151 tons of antibiotics were used for food animals globally in 2010 and this number is projected to reach 105 596 tons by 2030 van boeckel et al 2015 the daily dose consumption of antibiotics by humans is expected to rise by 202 worldwide from 42 3 billion in 2015 to 128 billion by 2030 klein et al 2018 in terms of environmental behavior antibiotics enter the natural environment during production cardoso et al 2014 administration ghirardini et al 2020 roberts et al 2016 and disposal yu et al 2020 antibiotics have been widely detected in different environments including soils pan et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 sediments kalantzi et al 2021 plants tadić et al 2021 food products li et al 2017 and water chen et al 2020 fattore et al 2018 zainab et al 2021 high antibiotic load in the environment disturbs environmental microbial processes mcrose and newman 2021 and promotes global antibiotic resistance gene transitions pärnänen et al 2022 zhu et al 2017 thus antibiotic residues are of great concern for the ecological safety of stakeholders and policymakers surface water provides habitat and food for amphibians and aquatic organisms whereas groundwater provides 50 of domestic water use globally unesco world water assessment programme 2022 however water has been recognized as the receptor for mass fluxes of antibiotics in the environment chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 aquatic antibiotic pollution has been investigated and reviewed globally anh et al 2021 bexfield et al 2019 carvalho and santos 2016 the concentrations of antibiotics in freshwater range from undetectable to several mg l 1 kovalakova et al 2020 which potentially exceed the upper thresholds of antibiotic resistance and pose health risks bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 as a result pharmaceutical contamination in surface water poses health threats to aquatic organisms in more than a quarter of the world s rivers wilkinson et al 2022 furthermore 80 2 of the isolates from global groundwater samples were resistant to at least one antimicrobial andrade et al 2020 surface water and groundwater are interconnected and pollutants migrate between them mutually hintze et al 2020 wallis et al 2020 during the hydrological cycling process groundwater serves as the receiver of infiltration from surface water and in turn the provider or origin of streamflow unesco who unep 1996 considerable surface groundwater exchanges have been discovered downstream of wastewater treatment plants and effluent discharge has been identified as the main source of pharmaceutical contamination in groundwater bradley et al 2014 nevertheless antibiotic behavior in the surface groundwater system and factors that control the connectivity between them are not well understood therefore a comprehensive understanding of antibiotic contamination in surface groundwater systems is required for clean water availability and environmental sustainability in addition drylands largely act as rangelands for livestock production covering 41 of the earth s land surface which potentially introduces a large burden of antibiotics into the environment u n convention to combat desertification 2017 drylands are the most vulnerable areas because of their exploited resources and increasing stress from climate change causing a lack of resistance to environmental pollution sietz et al 2011 u n convention to combat desertification 2017 thus drylands are hotspots not only for environmental regulation but also for ecosystem diversity the environmental behavior of antibiotics under drought conditions has been previously examined among the different climate regions groundwater in semi arid zones was found to have higher antibiotic concentrations than that in semi humid and humid zones ma et al 2015 in contrast evaporative enrichment of pharmaceuticals was found in an unsaturated column study indicating the accumulation effect of pharmaceuticals in groundwater under arid climate conditions zemann et al 2016 several studies have investigated the distribution of antibiotics in surface water and wastewater in arid areas lei et al 2015 li et al 2016 wang et al 2021 however relatively little research has focused on the interactions between antibiotics in aqueous environments particularly in arid regions accordingly to establish a thorough understanding of antibiotic behavior and latent effects on ecosystems thirty one antibiotics in surface water and groundwater were studied in a typical oasis with a focus on antibiotic transport drivers and risk assessment the detailed objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the occurrence and distribution patterns of antibiotics in surface water and its surrounding groundwater 2 understand the potential interactions between surface water and groundwater and their influencing factors and 3 evaluate the species specific ecological risks of antibiotics in the short and long term in the study area the results of this study can help regulate water protection strategies in arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the xinjiang uygur autonomous region is located inland in eurasia and northwest china the annual average temperature and precipitation in the xinjiang uygur autonomous region are 10 5 c and 145 7 mm respectively statistic bureau of xinjiang uygur autonomous region 2020 the population density 15 people per square kilometer in xinjiang is approximately one tenth of the national average population density chn national bureau of statistic 2020 statistic bureau of xinjiang uygur autonomous region 2020 as shown in fig 1 eighteen surface water samples were collected from the qira river chs1 chs10 and sangong river ws1 ws8 five groundwater samples cds1 cds5 were collected from the qira oasis the sampling campaign was conducted in august 2019 detailed descriptions of the sampling sites and sample collection procedures are listed in tables s1 and supplementary text s1 respectively supplementary material 2 2 chemicals and standards thirty one target antibiotics were tested including one chloramphenicol cps two diaminopyrimidines dps nine fluoroquinolones fqs one lincosamide las three macrolides mls thirteen sulfonamides sas and two tetracyclines tcs nine isotopically labeled antibiotics were spiked for chemical quantification the details are listed in table s2 2 3 sample extraction and quantification briefly water samples 1 l were first filtered through 0 7 μm glass fiber filters whatman gf f fisher scientific loughborough uk supernatants extracted from suspended particles that were attached to filters were transferred to the filtered samples filtered water samples were then extracted and eluted using oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb cartridges 500 mg 6 ml waters milford usa which were subsequently evaporated by nitrogen and redissolved in 1 ml methanol until instrumental analysis ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry uplc acquity xevo tq s waters milford usa was used to quantify the target antibiotics two duplicates for each sample were analyzed to avoid random errors the standard concentrations ranged from 1 to 250 ng l 1 supplementary text s2 provides details regarding the sample extraction procedures and instrumental analysis parameters table s2 lists information regarding compound recoveries 46 6 162 7 and standard curves r2 0 9776 0 9999 2 4 risk assessment ecological risks were evaluated using the risk quotient rq approach u s epa 2021 the rq is defined as the ratio of the measured environmental concentration mec to the predicted no effect concentration pnec indicating the likelihood of adverse effects the toxicity profile consists of acute short term and chronic long term toxicity toxicity data were selected from the ecotox database cfpub epa gov ecotox accessed may 2022 on three trophic levels primary producers e g green algae and blue green algae primary consumers e g crustaceans and secondary consumers e g fish according to the recommendations of the u s epa 2016 when experimental data were not available from ecotox predicted values from ecosar v2 0 www epa gov tsca screening tools ecological structure activity relationships ecosar predictive model accessed august 2022 were chosen instead danofloxacin was not included in the ecological risk evaluation owing to the lack of toxicity data erythromycin h2o etm h2o toxicity values were acquired from its parent compound erythromycin because relevant data were not available detailed formulas and toxicity data are provided in supplementary text s3 and table s6 the ecological risks are classified into three levels according to the rq values 0 01 0 1 indicating a low risk 0 1 1 indicating a medium risk and 1 high risk to the environment 2 5 statistical analysis the maximum likelihood estimation method was performed to acquire descriptive statistics data median arithmetic mean and standard deviation values using cenmle function in the r nada package the concentration data were assumed to follow a log normal distribution cenanova and cen2means functions in the r nada2 package were performed with the concentration data to understand the distribution patterns of antibiotics a one way anova test aov function coupled with a tukey s posthoc test tukeyhd function was conducted for ecological risk evaluations heatmap and redundancy analyses were conducted using the pheatmap and rda functions respectively all analyses and functions were performed in r version 4 0 3 the r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria 3 results and discussion 3 1 antibiotics in surface water 3 1 1 concentrations and compositions the concentrations and detection frequencies df of the antibiotics are listed in table s3 twenty of thirty one target antibiotics were detected in the surface water for the antibiotic groups lincosamides las showed the highest median concentration in surface water samples 2 85 ng l 1 fluoroquinolones fqs were the dominant antibiotic group ranging from 42 8 to 92 2 median 63 6 followed by lincosamides las 0 29 3 median 10 5 and sulfonamides sas 2 5 13 6 median 8 1 individual antibiotic concentrations ranged from nd not detected i e lower than the method detection limits to 25 10 ng l 1 norfloxacin nfx with a range of 1 16 25 10 ng l 1 median value 4 86 ng l 1 showed the highest concentration among selected antibiotics followed by ciprofloxacin cfx median 3 93 ng l 1 and pefloxacin pef median 3 39 ng l 1 fig 2 even though pef and lincomycin lin displayed a slightly higher median concentration than that of cfx fig 2 we consider that the median values generated using the cenmle method nada package which handles left censoring data are more reasonable the summed concentrations of the fqs were significantly correlated with the total concentrations n 18 p 0 001 pearson correlation the relatively low octanol water partition coefficient of fqs log kow from 2 92 to 1 07 table s4 suggests that fqs are more soluble in water and tend to be transported in the environment yao et al 2017 however the highest concentration of las in surface water was related to the intensive use of lincomycin the third most prescribed antibiotic in china in 2013 zhang et al 2015 likewise sas and dps conjointly shared 8 of the total antibiotic usage in northwest china zhang et al 2015 both of which were detected at a median concentration of only 0 17 ng l 1 in the study area compared to the rest of china antibiotic concentrations in the study area were substantially lower than those in southern china with a mean concentration of 34 ng l 1 zhang et al 2021 in central china within the range of nd 745 2 ng l 1 wang et al 2017 and in eastern china within the range of 0 02 502 43 ng l 1 zhu et al 2021 compared to global concentrations in this study surface water showed higher concentrations of antibiotics than those in italy range 2 25 ng l 1 verlicchi et al 2014 but relatively lower concentrations than those in vietnam nd 15 591 ng l 1 tran et al 2019 and ghana nd 2861 ng l 1 azanu et al 2018 the detected antibiotic concentrations were similar to those in spain ranging from nd 150 43 ng l 1 osorio et al 2016 and those in the rhine river 2 101 ng l 1 ruff et al 2015 accordingly the surface water in the studied rivers was less polluted with antibiotics compared to the rest of china and was at an intermediate level of antibiotic pollution 3 1 2 spatial distribution patterns the total concentrations of the thirty one antibiotics varied from 17 37 to 84 09 ng l 1 in surface water fig 3 a spatial variability of antibiotic concentrations was found neither in the qira river nor in the sangong river p 0 05 for both the qira and sangong river cenanova function however except for site chs3 the total concentrations of antibiotics at the lower reaches of the qira river chs7 chs10 17 37 21 04 ng l 1 were lower than those at the upper reaches chs1 chs6 21 45 80 48 ng l 1 chs3 17 95 ng l 1 the majority of sampling sites in the qira river are located in grassland desert areas with less impact from anthropogenic activities and natural attenuation led to decreased antibiotic concentrations in the qira river concerning the sangong river generally antibiotic concentrations in waters downstream of the sangong river were higher than those upstream except for ws2 increased by 71 4 from 30 13 ng l 1 at ws1 to 51 64 ng l 1 at ws8 fig 3a because the sangong river is a local creek with few tributaries continuous inputs along the river caused antibiotic accumulation lei et al 2019 the high occurrence of antibiotics at ws2 could be attributed to intensive human activity specifically ws2 is close to the tianshan tianchi scenic area which leads to greater antibiotic loads from a more densely populated region particularly during the peak tourist season of august 3 2 antibiotics in groundwater 3 2 1 concentrations and compositions twenty four of the target antibiotics were detected in the groundwater the fqs had the highest median concentration 1 83 ng l 1 among the seven groups of antibiotics dps were detected only at cds3 fqs were also the predominant group in groundwater with proportions ranging from 19 1 to 86 6 median 73 0 followed by sas 4 9 44 5 median 8 0 and macrolides mls 3 3 7 4 median 4 5 the concentrations of the individual antibiotics ranged from nd to 55 19 ng l 1 pef had the highest concentration with a median value of 6 30 ng l 1 followed by nfx 4 33 ng l 1 and cfx 2 68 ng l 1 the pollution level of antibiotics in this study was at an intermediate level compared with that reported in previous studies fu et al 2022 reported a total concentration of 39 antibiotics ranging from nd to 196 12 ng l 1 in northern china yao et al 2017 reported the highest nfx and cip concentrations with the median value of 8 55 ng l 1 and 4 51 ng l 1 respectively antibiotic contamination in a karst river in southwest china median concentrations nd 433 ng l 1 was more severe than that observed in this study zou et al 2018 globally antibiotic concentrations in the study area were lower than those in romania szekeres et al 2018 spain boy roura et al 2018 and pakistan zainab et al 2021 but higher than those in germany balzer et al 2016 burke et al 2016 antibiotic pollution levels in the study area were comparable to those in kenya k oreje et al 2016 and switzerland huntscha et al 2012 3 2 2 spatial distribution patterns the total concentrations of the thirty one antibiotics ranged from 16 38 to 277 41 ng l 1 in groundwater fig 3b although the straight line distance between sites cds2 and cds3 was approximately 100 m the total antibiotic concentration at cds3 was 10 fold that at cds2 the difference in concentrations between cds2 and cds3 can be attributed to differences in land use patterns specifically cds2 is located in forestland with relatively high soil moisture whereas cds3 is located in a grassland with more arid soils tang et al 2021 and zhang et al 2022 also observed negative correlations between pharmaceutical concentrations and the percentage of forest area besides sas were proven to be persistent and accumulable in deep and aged groundwaters kivits et al 2018 their higher percentage in the total concentration at cds3 44 5 than that at cds2 8 0 was also a contributor to the higher antibiotic concentration at cds3 than that at cds2 3 3 comparison between antibiotics in surface water and groundwater 3 3 1 concentrations and compositions the mean detection frequency of antibiotics in groundwater 55 5 was slightly higher than that in surface water 51 8 indicating the ubiquity of antibiotics in groundwater and emphasizing the importance of routine groundwater monitoring programs no significant differences in antibiotic concentrations between surface water and groundwater were found p 0 06 cen2means function hereafter however the median and mean concentration of antibiotics in groundwater median 0 42 ng l 1 mean standard deviations 2 84 19 05 ng l 1 were higher than the corresponding concentration in surface water median 0 35 ng l 1 mean standard deviations 1 35 5 11 ng l 1 likewise dps and sas concentrations in groundwater were higher than the concentration of the corresponding antibiotic group in surface water p 0 06 for dps p 0 01 for sas in contrast the concentrations of las and tetracyclines tcs in surface water were significantly higher than those of the corresponding group of antibiotics in groundwater p 0 05 for las and tcs gray et al 2020 reported comparable levels of antibiotic contamination in surface water and groundwater however several studies have revealed higher concentrations in river water than those in groundwater fu et al 2022 vulliet and cren olivé 2011 yao et al 2017 the interception of soil and the unsaturated zone protects groundwater from surface water pollution gaston et al 2019 in our study we considered that the higher contamination of groundwater by antibiotics could be explained by the aeolian sandy soil texture in the qira oasis which is located on the verge of the taklamakan desert liu et al 2018 the average 76 50 μm size of soil particles and mean 1 8 clay content 2 μm in soils in the qira oasis have been recorded previously su et al 2021 wan et al 2013 soils with higher sandy minerals are prone to have better permeability and low antibiotic retention capacity pils and laird 2007 zhi et al 2019 which results in a greater migration of pollutants from soil to groundwater furthermore geothermal activity which creates aerobic redox conditions and hinders antibiotic degradation contributes to the prevalence of antibiotics in groundwater garcía gil et al 2018 fqs were the most detected and highly concentrated antibiotic groups in both the surface and groundwater indicating the widespread use of fqs in the study area however two compounds with the highest concentrations pef and nfx were banned in 2016 for food animals in china chn ministry of agriculture and rural affairs 2015 this implies that fqs persist in the environment sas have much smaller distribution coefficient kd values e g sulfamethazine 1 37 0 16 l kg 1 than those of other antibiotic groups e g tetracycline 1093 91 6 l kg 1 nfx 591 35 0 l kg 1 pan and chu 2016 implying the strong mobility of sas in soil harrower et al 2021 and subsequent accumulation in groundwater in addition because biodegradation is the main removal pathway for sas oberoi et al 2019 sas are eliminated to a lesser extent by microbial communities in anaerobic groundwater compared with aerobic surface water studies have reported either moderate or strong sorptions of trimethoprim tmp which belongs to dps in the soil resulting in a low possibility for tmp leaching into groundwater burke et al 2016 lin and gan 2011 however the sorption coefficients of tmp are positively related to cation exchange capability cec and organic carbon oc content kodešová et al 2015 peng et al 2015 sandy soils which usually have smaller cec and oc values provide fewer active sorption sites for ionized tmp in high ph environments which leads to less tmp retention in soils franklin et al 2022 tcs molecules are rich in functional groups which induce a high affinity of tcs to the soil through electrostatic interactions and ion exchanges dominated by positively charged groups figueroa et al 2004 and hydrogen bonding dominated by polar functional groups gu et al 2007 the chelator nature of tcs causes their high residue in soil and low occurrence in groundwater boy roura et al 2018 3 3 2 spatial distribution characteristics of the thirty one compounds only frequently detected antibiotics detection frequency 87 0 were included in the heatmap analysis the heatmap interpreted the distribution patterns of antibiotics fig 3c in the vertical direction antibiotics were divided into two main clusters cluster 1 including three fqs sarafloxacin ofx and pef two sas sulfathiazole and sulfamerazine and doxycycline was the dominant pollutant not only at the groundwater sites cds but also at the surface water sites in the sangong river ws cluster 2a which includes lin sulfapyridine and two fqs fleroxacin and marbofloxacin was largely loaded only at site cds3 cluster 2b includes etm h2o ff sulfaguanidine sg and three fqs nfx cfx and danofloxacin which was highly loaded in surface water in the horizontal direction the sampling sites were divided into five minor clusters according to their geographic positions i site cds3 groundwater ii the sangong river ws iii the rest of the groundwater except for cds3 iv upstream of the qira river chs and v downstream of the qira river chs9 and chs10 are located in qira county which is more densely populated than the upstream sampling sites ff and sg are two veterinary drugs that are heavily enriched in the lower reaches of the qira river indicating the impact of human activity notably although the groundwater sampling sites cluster i and cluster iii are geographically closer to surface water sites near the qira river cluster v their antibiotic distribution patterns were dissimilar this finding revealed that vertical infiltration and subsequent leaching from surface water did not govern the fate of antibiotics in groundwater in arid regions because of water deficiency boy roura et al 2018 also reported a weak interplay of antibiotics in surface water and groundwater because of the low hydraulic gradients 3 4 factors influencing antibiotic distributions redundancy analysis rda was conducted to identify the potential factors influencing antibiotic distribution in the surface water antibiotics with low detection 87 0 were not included in the rda model we measured six environmental characteristics ph dissolved oxygen do total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec salinity and oxidation reduction potential orp tds and salinity were removed from the rda model owing to the presence of multicollinearity variance inflation factor 10 vif function in faraway package bruce and bruce 2017 the rda triplot fig 4 indicated that 36 5 axis1 24 8 axis2 9 8 of the variation in the antibiotic concentrations was explained by selected environmental parameters in total this suggests that the selected variables did not strongly affect the distribution of antibiotics in surface water sites from the same river showed antibiotic compositional similarity the sangong river tends to be dominated by fqs and tcs quadrant iii in the left panel of fig 4 whereas las and sas tend to be most abundant in the qira river quadrant i in the right panel of fig 4 the results showed that the distribution and concentration of antibiotics were significantly affected by orp and do p 0 01 for orp p 0 05 for do since ph and ec were not significantly correlated with response variables p 0 05 their influence on antibiotics is not discussed here however previous studies report that ph may affect the removal efficiency of antibiotics via ph mediated reactions such as hydrolysis and epimerization li and zhang 2012 loftin et al 2008 meanwhile aqueous solutions with high ec can introduce faster electron transfer and increase the degradation rates of antibiotics choudhary et al 2021 however positive correlations between ec content and antibiotic concentrations were discovered by chen et al 2022 and huang et al 2019 in this study orp had a strong negative effect on the concentrations of fqs dps and tcs but had no relationship with cps and mls a higher orp environment can mitigate antibiotic contamination because the abundant microbial population in an aerobic environment promotes antibiotic removal hussain et al 2012 do values were negatively correlated with the concentrations of most antibiotics which is consistent with the conclusions of ma et al 2022 and wang et al 2017 the reason for the negative relationship between do and antibiotics is that biodegradation rates are higher under aerobic conditions than in anaerobic liu et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 there was a positive relationship between the do and mls concentrations considering that mls are the most heavily used antibiotic group in china 854 tons of mls versus 180 519 tons of other groups of antibiotics zhang et al 2015 we speculate that the concentrations of the overused mls exceeded the degradation capability and bioavailability of microorganisms in surface water and presented inadequate antibiotic removal in high do environments the number of groundwater samples was insufficient for a rda analysis thus we formed a correlation matrix to determine the relationships between environmental factors and antibiotics in groundwater no significant relationships were found between any values of environmental factors and antibiotic group concentrations p 0 05 however insignificant correlations could be argued because the sample size was small in this correlation analysis these relationships need to be explored using larger sample sizes for reference zainab et al 2021 reported that tetracycline was negatively correlated with ec but positively correlated with tds 3 5 risk assessment fig 5 a and b depict the ecological risks of antibiotics in surface water and groundwater respectively including acute and chronic risks at three trophic levels the ecological risks of antibiotics in surface water ranged from 0 to 0 16 from 0 to 0 02 and from 0 to 2 33 10 4 for algae daphnids and fish respectively 98 9 3312 out of 3348 of samples posed insignificant ecological risks to species in the surface water both etm h2o and lin posed low acute ecological risks to algae in 88 9 of surface water samples nfx posed a low chronic risk to daphnids at ws7 suggesting possible accumulation and long lasting effects of nfx on organisms the ecological risks of antibiotics in groundwater ranged from 0 to 0 22 from 0 to 6 82 10 3 and from 0 to 5 52 10 4 for algae daphnids and fish respectively 99 1 922 out of 930 of samples posed insignificant ecological risks to species in groundwater clarithromycin posed a medium acute risk to algae at cds3 whereas etm h2o and lin posed low acute risks to algae in groundwater no antibiotics were found to exert long term ecological risks in the groundwater of the study area the differences in the ecological risk posed by antibiotics between the surface and groundwater were not significant p 0 05 nevertheless the ecological risks among between species and exposure duration varied regarding exposure duration chronic toxicities were significantly lower than acute toxicities p 0 01 the risks also differed among species p 0 01 risk quotient rq values for algae were significantly higher than those for daphnids and fish however there were no significant differences between the ecological risks posed to daphnids and fish p 0 05 this indicates that algae are the most sensitive organisms for risk assessments generally las and mls had higher rq values than those of the remaining groups demonstrating that organisms are more vulnerable to the toxic effects of las and mls 4 conclusions this study investigated the distribution and potential risks of antibiotics in the surface and groundwater as well as the connections between antibiotics in the surface groundwater system in a typical oasis the major findings are as follows 1 groundwater showed higher detection frequencies and greater concentrations of antibiotics compared with surface water 2 fluoroquinolones dominated antibiotic concentrations in both water compartments whereas the composition patterns consisted by other antibiotic groups displayed inconsistency between surface water and groundwater 3 consumption pattern antibiotic characteristics and overlying soil properties contributed to the dissimilarity in antibiotic behavior between surface water and adjacent groundwater and 4 erythromycin h2o and lincomycin were the greatest contributors to antibiotic risks to the aquatic ecosystem various parameters including hydrogeological factors could be included in deciphering the processes and mechanisms of antibiotic migration in the environment in the future this study highlights the importance of regular groundwater monitoring

15464,hypoxia has become a serious threat to the sustainability of marine ecosystems globally as one of the leading components of eutrophication river delivered organic matter rom regulates estuarine coastal dissolved oxygen condition and contributes to hypoxia formation both directly via remineralization and indirectly via the nutrients released during remineralization however the impacts of rom on the coastal environment have long been underestimated because the indirect contribution has been overlooked and left largely unknown this study used the changjiang river the second largest rom source in the world as a prototype a coupled physical biogeochemical model was used to explore the indirect contribution of changjiang rom to marginal sea deoxygenation and hypoxia formation here i show that rom remineralization contributed 5 4 directly and 7 3 indirectly to the total oxygen consumption in the off estuary hypoxic zone the indirect contribution persistently sustained in a large part of the northwest pacific marginal seas strict mitigation is required to manage the ecosystem impacts of deoxygenation the findings of this study also indicate that river discharge freshwater turbidity and interactions between freshwater and shelf circulation are fundamental factors that regulate the contributions of rom to hypoxia formation and shelf deoxygenation graphical abstract image

levin and breitburg 2015 breitburg et al 2018 rapid economic development caused increasing anthropogenic eutrophication bottom hypoxia often forms because the over enrichment of water with nutrients and organic matter leads to severe oxygen consumption through microbial degradation of organic matter om either sinking from the growth of phytoplankton at the surface subsurface or transported from rivers najjar et al 2018 the total number of coastal hypoxia sites has grown by over 10 times globally in the past three decades diaz and rosenberg 2008 rabalais et al 2010 conley et al 2011 hypoxia threatens the sustainability of coastal marine ecosystems such as degradation of biodiversity compression or loss of habitat and shrink of fish stock rabalais and turner 2001 keeling et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 stramma et al 2012 besides inorganic nutrients each year rivers transport vast amounts of terrestrial dissolved and particulate om rom hereafter to coastal seas rom remineralization microbial degradation consumes dissolved oxygen and directly contributes to the total oxygen consumption rom remineralization also releases inorganic nutrients such as ammonium nh4 and phosphate po4 which return to the nutrient pools and fertilize the growth of phytoplankton fennel et al 2006 indirectly contributing to the total oxygen consumption among all rivers the ten largest rivers in the world contribute 40 of the total amount of rom dagg et al 2004 however the impacts of large river introduced rom on coastal hypoxia and shelf oxygen dynamics have seldom been explored over 0 45 billion people live within the drainage basin of the changjiang yangtze river li et al 2011 the changjiang river transports 4 4í106 t yr 1 second largest in the world and 11 8í106 t yr 1 second largest in the world of particulate organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon respectively into the east china sea dagg et al 2004 degradation of phytoplankton derived oceanic om was identified as the dominant oxygen consumer to promote bottom hypoxia off the estuary and the contribution of direct oxygen consumption by rom remineralization is limited wei et al 2007 wang et al 2016 it is counterintuitive that the vast amount of rom has trivial impacts on shelf oxygen condition since the indirect contribution has been overlooked the impacts of rom on the shelf environments have a great chance of being underestimated the contribution of river delivered inorganic nutrients on off estuary hypoxia have been amply investigated wang 2006 zhang et al 2016 chen et al 2020 this is the first study that used coupled physical biogeochemical model to explore the direct and indirect impacts of large river delivered rom on dissolved oxygen condition and deoxygenation over the continental shelf a coupled regional physical biogeochemical model that included the changjiang river as the sole river input of rom was set up and used because indirect contribution of rom cannot be observed directly this study finds that rom remineralization totally contributed 12 7 to the total oxygen consumption in the hypoxic zone off the estuary the indirect contribution of changjiang delivered rom persistently sustained in a large part of the northwest pacific marginal seas covering the entire east china sea south yellow sea and crossing the tsushima straight to reach the japan sea mitigation investigation indicated that pollution abatement must be strictly carried out to prevent the threat of coastal deoxygenation to marine ecosystems 2 methods 2 1 study region the changjiang river the largest river in asia and the fifth largest river in the world in terms of freshwater discharge 9 3í1011 m3 yr 1 chen et al 2009 flows passing multiple mega cities in east china and then discharges into the east china sea through delta outlets fig 1 a the changjiang river delivers vast amounts of sediment inorganic nutrients and organic matters to the estuary and its adjacent shelf waters the freshwater spreads downstream to interact and mix with multiple water masses associated with the complex shelf circulation zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2021a b promoting material exchanges between freshwater and oceanic water masses a large area of bottom hypoxia forms seasonally off the estuary under eutrophication and freshwater induced vertical stratification fig 1b zhou et al 2017 2 2 coupled physical biogeochemical model this study develops a high resolution hydrodynamic model that configured with roms regional ocean modeling system and coupled with a biogeochemical model roms written in f90 f95 is a free surface ocean model that uses terrain following vertical coordinates available online at https www myroms org the computational kernel is described in shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 this coupled model has been validated and used to investigate oxygen dynamics off the changjiang river estuary and factors controlling spatiotemporal spread of seasonal hypoxia off the estuary zhang et al 2018 2019 hypoxia hotspots were mapped to support more efficient research survey cruises the kuroshio subsurface water intrusion was found to be important in regulating the residence time of bottom water over the continental shelf bottom water residence time is essential to the sustainment of summer depletion condition of bottom dissolved oxygen concentration the hydrodynamic model domain fig 1a encompasses the entire bohai sea yellow sea east china sea and part of the japan sea and deep region offshore this roms based model has 30 vertical layers with a minimum water depth of 3 m and a maximum depth of slightly greater than 7000 m the horizontal resolution ranges from 500 m in the upper estuary to 1 km in the plume near field region and to 2 km in the offshore region the model run was initiated from rest and was forced with surface momentum and heat fluxes from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf https www ecmwf int en

al 2018 is a simplified nitrogen cycle model fennel et al 2006 that was expanded to include the dynamics of dip dissolved inorganic phosphorus laurent et al 2017 such that p cycle follows n cycle with

same biogeochemical model scheme has been successfully applied and shown satisfying performance in other hypoxic regions including the northern gulf of mexico and the chesapeake bay fennel et al 2013 feng et al 2015 the biogeochemical component was further expanded in this study to include two additional state variables rdom and rpom to represent riverine dissolved organic matter and particulate organic matter respectively fig 2 a mass conserving sediment oxygen demand sod was specified following fennel et al 2006 which assumes all sinking aquatic phytoplankton derived oceanic organic matter that reaches the water sediment interface is remineralized instantaneously this sediment treatment consumes dissolved oxygen and releases nh4 and po4 to the bottom water and a portion of the organic nitrogen is lost to nitrogen gas n2 via denitrification more detailed description regarding sod can be found in fennel et al 2006 both rdom and rpom experienced remineralization in the water column through which to consume dissolved oxygen and release nh4 and po4 besides rpom can sink to the sediment and then be remineralized and recycled there previous studies li et al 2012 song et al 2016 indicate that riverine om is much less degradable than oceanic pom hence the remineralization rate of riverine om is specified to an order of magnitude lower than the remineralization rate of oceanic om following yu et al 2020 besides only a portion e g 10 following yu et al 2020 of the rpom that reaches the sediment can be instantaneously remineralized and the rest is returned to the bottom water

and open boundary conditions for nutrients were extracted from the climatological monthly woa13 riverine nutrients and om enter the study domain following the changjiang river discharge the riverine nutrients concentrations were taken from previous study gao et al 2012 the rdom 30 mmol n m 3 and rpom 25 mmol n m 3 concentrations were specified following previous study hsiao et al 2014 this model was initiated in january 2009 and ran for 3 years and 4 hourly model output for 2011 was analyzed to ensure sufficient spin up 2 3 model simulations two sets of simulations the baseline cases and the mitigation cases were performed table 2 case1 b1 was forced by all the realistic conditions that were described above in the setup of the model case2 b2 acted as a sensitivity test in which the impacts of riverine om were entirely turned off while case b3 kept the direct oxygen consumption impact and turned off the release of nutrients during remineralization of rom thus the differences between b1 and b2 b1 and b3 and b3 and b2 represent the total indirect and direct impacts respectively please see table 2 for the interpretation of the rest cases 3 results 3 1 model validation this model was found to well reproduce the observed temperature salinity bottom dissolved oxygen concentration zhang et al 2018 and the pattern of surface chlorophyll in the east china sea zhang et al 2019 the model ability was further validated here regarding the impact of rom comparison between fig 2 of hsiao et al 2014 and fig 3 in this study indicates that the model reproduced the dissolved organic nitrogen d o n which is r d o m in the model and particulate organic nitrogen p o n which is r p o m s d e t l d e t in the model concentrations for august 2011 the transect off the changjiang river estuary fig 1b was selected following fig 1a of previous study hsiao et al 2014 note that the unit µmol l 1 is equivalent to mmol m 3 which was used in this study while the unit µg l 1 used for the concentration of p o n in fig 2 of the same literature was converted to mmol m 3 for comparison the observed bottom oxygen concentration obtained during a survey cruise in july 2011 was point to point compared with model simulations with without rom the observation cites were shown in fig 1b and more details regarding the survey information can be found in previous study zhang et al 2018 the overestimation of bottom oxygen concentration was improved with rom activated in the model fig 4 3 2 direct and indirect impacts of rom on dissolved oxygen with rom activated in the model bottom dissolved oxygen concentration and oxygen inventory depth integral of oxygen concentration both decreased fig 5 note that the average of august 2011 was presented hereafter the direct impact of rom was relatively strong in the upper estuary with water depth shallower than 20 m and decreased sharply in the downstream direction figs 5a1 5a2 the direct impact was generally constrained within the near field of the river plume which is highly linked with the lateral spread of freshwater within the hypoxic zone fig 1b the direct oxygen consumption of rom remineralization caused small decreases in the bottom dissolved oxygen concentration and oxygen inventory dod and oid 3 3 mmol m 3 and 105 mmol m 2 respectively table 3 this is consistent with previous study wang et al 2016 that the direct oxygen consumption of rom made minor contribution to hypoxia off the changjiang river estuary rom remineralization indirectly caused high modification of shelf oxygen condition figs 5b1 5b2 the impact spread laterally to reach as far as the northern yellow sea in the northern direction and the tsushima straight in the eastern direction rom indirectly caused larger decreases in the bottom dissolved oxygen concentration and oxygen inventory within the hypoxic zone doind and oiind 4 6 mmol m 3 and 127 mmol m 2 respectively and beyond the hypoxic zone offdoind and offoiind 4 7 mmol m 3 and 200 mmol m 2 respectively table 3 thus rom remineralization in total caused a decrease of 7 9 mmol m 3 in the bottom oxygen concentration in the hypoxic zone fig 5c1 which is nonnegligible compared to the threshold of hypoxia occurrence 63 mmol m 3 the deoxygenation decrease in oxygen inventory fig 5c2 and table 3 due to rom remineralization accounted for over 8 of the current dissolved oxygen inventory of the influenced area here defined as the area characterized by oxygen inventory difference stronger than 20 mmol m 2 3 3 lateral spread of nutrients rom remineralization resulted in increases in nutrients e g nitrate and chlorophyll concentrations over the continental shelf fig 6 the impact on nitrate concentration showed vertical distinction the difference at the surface fig 6a spread eastward toward the tsushima straight while that at the bottom fig 6b spread both eastward toward the tsushima straight and northward toward the yellow sea this results from the vertical distinction of material lateral transport by shelf circulation nitrate inventory beyond the hypoxic zone increased by an average of 10 5 fig 6c the depth integral of chlorophyll concentration within the hypoxic zone showed small variance and large increase in depth integrated chlorophyll mainly occurred beyond the hypoxic zone fig 6d this is because the nutrient supply in the hypoxic zone was excessive and light limitation inhibited further increase in primary production the growth of phytoplankton and the remaining nutrients spread downstream along shelf circulation fig 1a to reach the yellow sea and tsushima straight where additional primary production was fertilized 3 4 contribution of rom to oxygen consumption nutrients released from rom remineralization sustained a relevant indirect contribution to the total oxygen consumption over the continental shelf fig 7 total oxygen consumption is defined as the remineralization of riverine and oceanic om see eq 11 in the method section the direct contribution of rom remineralization to the total oxygen consumption decreased sharply from over 66 in the upper estuary 20 m isobath and shallower to 5 4 in the hypoxic zone then to 0 beyond the hypoxic zone fig 7a rom remineralization indirectly contributed 7 3 to the total oxygen consumption in the hypoxic zone and 10 beyond the hypoxic zone fig 7b thus rom remineralization in total contributed 12 7 to the total oxygen consumption within the hypoxic zone fig 7c besides contributing to the total oxygen consumption rom remineralization can also indirectly regulate shelf oxygen concentration via lateral transport the direct oxygen consumption of rom remineralization caused significant decrease in aquatic dissolved oxygen concentration in the upper estuary fig 5a1 and the water in the upper estuary was subsequently transported downstream as source water water from upstream transported less dissolved oxygen downstream to contribute to the decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration there thus the decrease in oxygen concentration as shown in fig 5b1 may result from the combined effects of the indirect oxygen consumption of rom and the downstream transport of water with low dissolved oxygen due to direct oxygen consumption of rom 3 5 responses of rom impacts to mitigation treatment the direct and indirect impacts of rom remineralization were both sensitive to rom concentrations table 3 the dod and oid relaxed to 2 8 mmol m 3 and 88 mmol m 2 respectively under a 20 mitigation of the rom concentration the corresponding doind and oiind and offdoind and offoiind relaxed to 3 9 mmol m 3 and 110 mmol m 2 and 4 1 mmol m 3 and 173 mmol m 2 respectively in the hypoxic zone and beyond the corresponding decreases in total direct indirect bottom oxygen concentration and oxygen inventory dotot and oitot relaxed from 6 3 mmol m 3 to 5 4 mmol m 3 and from 216 mmol m 2 to 185 mmol m 2 respectively table 3 the area characterized by bottom oxygen decrease exceeding 5 10 of the hypoxia threshold 63 mmol m 3 a5 and a10 shrank from 215 387 114 534 km2 to 190 228 92 048 km2 table 3 and fig 8 the area of 2 deoxygenation a2 shrank from 198 000 km2 to 168 874 km2 table 3 and fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 estuary features control rom impacts river discharge freshwater turbidity and the interactions between freshwater and shelf circulation regulate tthe contributions of rom rom that is delivered by small or moderate river with low turbidity e g the pearl river can both directly and indirectly make important contributions to bottom hypoxia formation this is because the remineralizations of riverine and oceanic om are geographically co located in the upper estuary where bottom hypoxia usually forms fig 10 a two fundamental factors nutrients and light are required for the growth of phytoplankton huisman et al 2006 cullen 2015 for large rivers that carry huge amount of sediment e g the changjiang river the upper estuary experiences extreme turbidity and primary production is strongly inhibited there due to light limitation wang et al 2019 the direct oxygen consumption of rom remineralization predominantly occurs in the upper estuary fig 7a and only a small portion spread beyond the turbid zone to reach the bottom hypoxic zone the direct and indirect contributions of rom remineralization are geographically separated by the turbid zone and the released nutrients by rom remineralization return to the nutrient pools to facilitate primary production beyond the turbid zone where remineralization of oceanic om usually occurs to promote bottom hypoxia fig 10b the remaining inorganic nutrients would be laterally transported by shelf circulation to sustain indirect impact in a large region downstream 4 2 overlooked indirect rom impacts this study indicated that the indirect impacts of rom remineralization on shelf oxygen condition have been underestimated especially for regions with large river input and complex shelf circulation isotope method was used to show that changjiang delivered rom made minor contribution to the total oxygen consumption during hypoxia formation wang et al 2016 this study finds that the direct impact of changjiang rom decreased sharply downstream and only contributed 5 4 to total oxygen consumption in the hypoxic zone fig 1b which generally forms at the offshore edge of the turbid zone the high turbidity in the upper estuary explained the minor direct contribution of rom during hypoxia formation on the other hand the indirect contribution 7 3 spread downstream following shelf circulation to cause deoxygenation in a large area in the northwest pacific marginal seas e g the east china sea the south yellow sea and the tsushima straight fig 7 the characteristic of the indirect contribution of changjiang delivered rom should be universal among large rivers large rivers have strong interactions with shelf circulation and can transport remaining nutrients downstream sustaining indirect impacts over the shelf the rom derived by the mississippi river the fourth longest river in the world also showed the potential to sustain high indirect impact on shelf oxygen condition in the northern gulf of mexico the northern gulf of mexico is another well known coastal region that has been under the threats of detrimental consequences of bottom hypoxia rabalais and turner 2001 hetland and dimarco 2008 rabalais et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 fennel and testa 2019 scavia et al 2019 the remaining inorganic nitrogen in the core of hypoxia off the mississippi river estuary 89 7 w spread downstream for as far as 450 km to reach 93 7 w and caused bottom oxygen decline in a large area over the continental shelf laurent et al 2014 the mississippi river also transports large amount of terrestrial om into the northern gulf of mexico shen et al 2012 thus the released inorganic nitrogen via rom remineralization would be transported downstream and sustained indirect impact in a large area over the shelf the indirect contributions of rom must be considered for the investigations relevant to oxygen consumption coastal deoxygenation or hypoxia formation 4 3 response of deoxygenation to rom mitigation the expansion of seasonal hypoxia has caused detrimental consequences to shelf biodiversity then potentially to other shelf ecosystem functioning historical survey data of dissolved oxygen concentration water ph and trawl catch in the east china sea were showed fig 11 the bottom dissolved oxygen concentration the average of all stations over the shelf during one survey cruise showed an annual minimum occurred in the summer season june july and august the water ph values also showed an annual minimum in the summer season fig 11b the number of demersal nekton species per trawl catch showed obvious seasonal variation fig 11c and biodiversity experienced pressure in the summer season the number of species per trawl catch was negatively correlated to bottom oxygen concentration and water ph figs 11d and 11e and low dissolved oxygen concentration and acidification caused degradation of biodiversity to mitigate the coastal hypoxia off the changjiang river estuary in the east china sea and to ease the aquatic dissolved oxygen stress are essential to the sustainability of coastal marine ecosystem to decrease rom concentration can remit deoxygenation and relieve dissolved oxygen stress for coastal waters rom concentration would experience instantaneous increase under flooding events and the contributions of rom remineralization increased in response to the increased rom concentration in a limited area with small river input wang et al 2018 river delivered om abatement was proved to be efficient in relieving dissolved oxygen stress off the pearl river estuary because the reduction in oxygen consumption by rom remineralization resulted in the shrink in hypoxic water volume yu et al 2020 the decrease in changjiang delivered rom concentration was also proved to be effective in remitting coastal deoxygenation in northwest pacific marginal seas fig 12 table 3 this study suggests that mitigation strategy must be strictly carried out to control the impacts of rom remineralization on shelf oxygen condition at least a 50 mitigation is required to prevent the 5 hypoxia threshold and 2 deoxygenation areas from crossing the tsushima straight to reach the japan sea figs 8 and 9 the a5 and a2 both showed more rapid twice as fast drop with 30 or higher mitigation than lower mitigation indicating that the mitigation efficiency strengthens with higher abatement fig 12 however no tipping point occurred in the rom mitigation curves hence strict mitigation is required to limit the rom remineralization induced oxygen decrease to negligible level e g the decrease in bottom oxygen concentration is smaller than 5 hypoxia threshold or the deoxygenation is smaller than 2 declaration of competing interest the author declares no conflicts of interest

15464,hypoxia has become a serious threat to the sustainability of marine ecosystems globally as one of the leading components of eutrophication river delivered organic matter rom regulates estuarine coastal dissolved oxygen condition and contributes to hypoxia formation both directly via remineralization and indirectly via the nutrients released during remineralization however the impacts of rom on the coastal environment have long been underestimated because the indirect contribution has been overlooked and left largely unknown this study used the changjiang river the second largest rom source in the world as a prototype a coupled physical biogeochemical model was used to explore the indirect contribution of changjiang rom to marginal sea deoxygenation and hypoxia formation here i show that rom remineralization contributed 5 4 directly and 7 3 indirectly to the total oxygen consumption in the off estuary hypoxic zone the indirect contribution persistently sustained in a large part of the northwest pacific marginal seas strict mitigation is required to manage the ecosystem impacts of deoxygenation the findings of this study also indicate that river discharge freshwater turbidity and interactions between freshwater and shelf circulation are fundamental factors that regulate the contributions of rom to hypoxia formation and shelf deoxygenation graphical abstract image

levin and breitburg 2015 breitburg et al 2018 rapid economic development caused increasing anthropogenic eutrophication bottom hypoxia often forms because the over enrichment of water with nutrients and organic matter leads to severe oxygen consumption through microbial degradation of organic matter om either sinking from the growth of phytoplankton at the surface subsurface or transported from rivers najjar et al 2018 the total number of coastal hypoxia sites has grown by over 10 times globally in the past three decades diaz and rosenberg 2008 rabalais et al 2010 conley et al 2011 hypoxia threatens the sustainability of coastal marine ecosystems such as degradation of biodiversity compression or loss of habitat and shrink of fish stock rabalais and turner 2001 keeling et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 stramma et al 2012 besides inorganic nutrients each year rivers transport vast amounts of terrestrial dissolved and particulate om rom hereafter to coastal seas rom remineralization microbial degradation consumes dissolved oxygen and directly contributes to the total oxygen consumption rom remineralization also releases inorganic nutrients such as ammonium nh4 and phosphate po4 which return to the nutrient pools and fertilize the growth of phytoplankton fennel et al 2006 indirectly contributing to the total oxygen consumption among all rivers the ten largest rivers in the world contribute 40 of the total amount of rom dagg et al 2004 however the impacts of large river introduced rom on coastal hypoxia and shelf oxygen dynamics have seldom been explored over 0 45 billion people live within the drainage basin of the changjiang yangtze river li et al 2011 the changjiang river transports 4 4í106 t yr 1 second largest in the world and 11 8í106 t yr 1 second largest in the world of particulate organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon respectively into the east china sea dagg et al 2004 degradation of phytoplankton derived oceanic om was identified as the dominant oxygen consumer to promote bottom hypoxia off the estuary and the contribution of direct oxygen consumption by rom remineralization is limited wei et al 2007 wang et al 2016 it is counterintuitive that the vast amount of rom has trivial impacts on shelf oxygen condition since the indirect contribution has been overlooked the impacts of rom on the shelf environments have a great chance of being underestimated the contribution of river delivered inorganic nutrients on off estuary hypoxia have been amply investigated wang 2006 zhang et al 2016 chen et al 2020 this is the first study that used coupled physical biogeochemical model to explore the direct and indirect impacts of large river delivered rom on dissolved oxygen condition and deoxygenation over the continental shelf a coupled regional physical biogeochemical model that included the changjiang river as the sole river input of rom was set up and used because indirect contribution of rom cannot be observed directly this study finds that rom remineralization totally contributed 12 7 to the total oxygen consumption in the hypoxic zone off the estuary the indirect contribution of changjiang delivered rom persistently sustained in a large part of the northwest pacific marginal seas covering the entire east china sea south yellow sea and crossing the tsushima straight to reach the japan sea mitigation investigation indicated that pollution abatement must be strictly carried out to prevent the threat of coastal deoxygenation to marine ecosystems 2 methods 2 1 study region the changjiang river the largest river in asia and the fifth largest river in the world in terms of freshwater discharge 9 3í1011 m3 yr 1 chen et al 2009 flows passing multiple mega cities in east china and then discharges into the east china sea through delta outlets fig 1 a the changjiang river delivers vast amounts of sediment inorganic nutrients and organic matters to the estuary and its adjacent shelf waters the freshwater spreads downstream to interact and mix with multiple water masses associated with the complex shelf circulation zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2021a b promoting material exchanges between freshwater and oceanic water masses a large area of bottom hypoxia forms seasonally off the estuary under eutrophication and freshwater induced vertical stratification fig 1b zhou et al 2017 2 2 coupled physical biogeochemical model this study develops a high resolution hydrodynamic model that configured with roms regional ocean modeling system and coupled with a biogeochemical model roms written in f90 f95 is a free surface ocean model that uses terrain following vertical coordinates available online at https www myroms org the computational kernel is described in shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 this coupled model has been validated and used to investigate oxygen dynamics off the changjiang river estuary and factors controlling spatiotemporal spread of seasonal hypoxia off the estuary zhang et al 2018 2019 hypoxia hotspots were mapped to support more efficient research survey cruises the kuroshio subsurface water intrusion was found to be important in regulating the residence time of bottom water over the continental shelf bottom water residence time is essential to the sustainment of summer depletion condition of bottom dissolved oxygen concentration the hydrodynamic model domain fig 1a encompasses the entire bohai sea yellow sea east china sea and part of the japan sea and deep region offshore this roms based model has 30 vertical layers with a minimum water depth of 3 m and a maximum depth of slightly greater than 7000 m the horizontal resolution ranges from 500 m in the upper estuary to 1 km in the plume near field region and to 2 km in the offshore region the model run was initiated from rest and was forced with surface momentum and heat fluxes from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf https www ecmwf int en

same biogeochemical model scheme has been successfully applied and shown satisfying performance in other hypoxic regions including the northern gulf of mexico and the chesapeake bay fennel et al 2013 feng et al 2015 the biogeochemical component was further expanded in this study to include two additional state variables rdom and rpom to represent riverine dissolved organic matter and particulate organic matter respectively fig 2 a mass conserving sediment oxygen demand sod was specified following fennel et al 2006 which assumes all sinking aquatic phytoplankton derived oceanic organic matter that reaches the water sediment interface is remineralized instantaneously this sediment treatment consumes dissolved oxygen and releases nh4 and po4 to the bottom water and a portion of the organic nitrogen is lost to nitrogen gas n2 via denitrification more detailed description regarding sod can be found in fennel et al 2006 both rdom and rpom experienced remineralization in the water column through which to consume dissolved oxygen and release nh4 and po4 besides rpom can sink to the sediment and then be remineralized and recycled there previous studies li et al 2012 song et al 2016 indicate that riverine om is much less degradable than oceanic pom hence the remineralization rate of riverine om is specified to an order of magnitude lower than the remineralization rate of oceanic om following yu et al 2020 besides only a portion e g 10 following yu et al 2020 of the rpom that reaches the sediment can be instantaneously remineralized and the rest is returned to the bottom water

nutrients concentrations were taken from previous study gao et al 2012 the rdom 30 mmol n m 3 and rpom 25 mmol n m 3 concentrations were specified following previous study hsiao et al 2014 this model was initiated in january 2009 and ran for 3 years and 4 hourly model output for 2011 was analyzed to ensure sufficient spin up 2 3 model simulations two sets of simulations the baseline cases and the mitigation cases were performed table 2 case1 b1 was forced by all the realistic conditions that were described above in the setup of the model case2 b2 acted as a sensitivity test in which the impacts of riverine om were entirely turned off while case b3 kept the direct oxygen consumption impact and turned off the release of nutrients during remineralization of rom thus the differences between b1 and b2 b1 and b3 and b3 and b2 represent the total indirect and direct impacts respectively please see table 2 for the interpretation of the rest cases 3 results 3 1 model validation this model was found to well reproduce the observed temperature salinity bottom dissolved oxygen concentration zhang et al 2018 and the pattern of surface chlorophyll in the east china sea zhang et al 2019 the model ability was further validated here regarding the impact of rom comparison between fig 2 of hsiao et al 2014 and fig 3 in this study indicates that the model reproduced the dissolved organic nitrogen d o n which is r d o m in the model and particulate organic nitrogen p o n which is r p o m s d e t l d e t in the model concentrations for august 2011 the transect off the changjiang river estuary fig 1b was selected following fig 1a of previous study hsiao et al 2014 note that the unit µmol l 1 is equivalent to mmol m 3 which was used in this study while the unit µg l 1 used for the concentration of p o n in fig 2 of the same literature was converted to mmol m 3 for comparison the observed bottom oxygen concentration obtained during a survey cruise in july 2011 was point to point compared with model simulations with without rom the observation cites were shown in fig 1b and more details regarding the survey information can be found in previous study zhang et al 2018 the overestimation of bottom oxygen concentration was improved with rom activated in the model fig 4 3 2 direct and indirect impacts of rom on dissolved oxygen with rom activated in the model bottom dissolved oxygen concentration and oxygen inventory depth integral of oxygen concentration both decreased fig 5 note that the average of august 2011 was presented hereafter the direct impact of rom was relatively strong in the upper estuary with water depth shallower than 20 m and decreased sharply in the downstream direction figs 5a1 5a2 the direct impact was generally constrained within the near field of the river plume which is highly linked with the lateral spread of freshwater within the hypoxic zone fig 1b the direct oxygen consumption of rom remineralization caused small decreases in the bottom dissolved oxygen concentration and oxygen inventory dod and oid 3 3 mmol m 3 and 105 mmol m 2 respectively table 3 this is consistent with previous study wang et al 2016 that the direct oxygen consumption of rom made minor contribution to hypoxia off the changjiang river estuary rom remineralization indirectly caused high modification of shelf oxygen condition figs 5b1 5b2 the impact spread laterally to reach as far as the northern yellow sea in the northern direction and the tsushima straight in the eastern direction rom indirectly caused larger decreases in the bottom dissolved oxygen concentration and oxygen inventory within the hypoxic zone doind and oiind 4 6 mmol m 3 and 127 mmol m 2 respectively and beyond the hypoxic zone offdoind and offoiind 4 7 mmol m 3 and 200 mmol m 2 respectively table 3 thus rom remineralization in total caused a decrease of 7 9 mmol m 3 in the bottom oxygen concentration in the hypoxic zone fig 5c1 which is nonnegligible compared to the threshold of hypoxia occurrence 63 mmol m 3 the deoxygenation decrease in oxygen inventory fig 5c2 and table 3 due to rom remineralization accounted for over 8 of the current dissolved oxygen inventory of the influenced area here defined as the area characterized by oxygen inventory difference stronger than 20 mmol m 2 3 3 lateral spread of nutrients rom remineralization resulted in increases in nutrients e g nitrate and chlorophyll concentrations over the continental shelf fig 6 the impact on nitrate concentration showed vertical distinction the difference at the surface fig 6a spread eastward toward the tsushima straight while that at the bottom fig 6b spread both eastward toward the tsushima straight and northward toward the yellow sea this results from the vertical distinction of material lateral transport by shelf circulation nitrate inventory beyond the hypoxic zone increased by an average of 10 5 fig 6c the depth integral of chlorophyll concentration within the hypoxic zone showed small variance and large increase in depth integrated chlorophyll mainly occurred beyond the hypoxic zone fig 6d this is because the nutrient supply in the hypoxic zone was excessive and light limitation inhibited further increase in primary production the growth of phytoplankton and the remaining nutrients spread downstream along shelf circulation fig 1a to reach the yellow sea and tsushima straight where additional primary production was fertilized 3 4 contribution of rom to oxygen consumption nutrients released from rom remineralization sustained a relevant indirect contribution to the total oxygen consumption over the continental shelf fig 7 total oxygen consumption is defined as the remineralization of riverine and oceanic om see eq 11 in the method section the direct contribution of rom remineralization to the total oxygen consumption decreased sharply from over 66 in the upper estuary 20 m isobath and shallower to 5 4 in the hypoxic zone then to 0 beyond the hypoxic zone fig 7a rom remineralization indirectly contributed 7 3 to the total oxygen consumption in the hypoxic zone and 10 beyond the hypoxic zone fig 7b thus rom remineralization in total contributed 12 7 to the total oxygen consumption within the hypoxic zone fig 7c besides contributing to the total oxygen consumption rom remineralization can also indirectly regulate shelf oxygen concentration via lateral transport the direct oxygen consumption of rom remineralization caused significant decrease in aquatic dissolved oxygen concentration in the upper estuary fig 5a1 and the water in the upper estuary was subsequently transported downstream as source water water from upstream transported less dissolved oxygen downstream to contribute to the decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration there thus the decrease in oxygen concentration as shown in fig 5b1 may result from the combined effects of the indirect oxygen consumption of rom and the downstream transport of water with low dissolved oxygen due to direct oxygen consumption of rom 3 5 responses of rom impacts to mitigation treatment the direct and indirect impacts of rom remineralization were both sensitive to rom concentrations table 3 the dod and oid relaxed to 2 8 mmol m 3 and 88 mmol m 2 respectively under a 20 mitigation of the rom concentration the corresponding doind and oiind and offdoind and offoiind relaxed to 3 9 mmol m 3 and 110 mmol m 2 and 4 1 mmol m 3 and 173 mmol m 2 respectively in the hypoxic zone and beyond the corresponding decreases in total direct indirect bottom oxygen concentration and oxygen inventory dotot and oitot relaxed from 6 3 mmol m 3 to 5 4 mmol m 3 and from 216 mmol m 2 to 185 mmol m 2 respectively table 3 the area characterized by bottom oxygen decrease exceeding 5 10 of the hypoxia threshold 63 mmol m 3 a5 and a10 shrank from 215 387 114 534 km2 to 190 228 92 048 km2 table 3 and fig 8 the area of 2 deoxygenation a2 shrank from 198 000 km2 to 168 874 km2 table 3 and fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 estuary features control rom impacts river discharge freshwater turbidity and the interactions between freshwater and shelf circulation regulate tthe contributions of rom rom that is delivered by small or moderate river with low turbidity e g the pearl river can both directly and indirectly make important contributions to bottom hypoxia formation this is because the remineralizations of riverine and oceanic om are geographically co located in the upper estuary where bottom hypoxia usually forms fig 10 a two fundamental factors nutrients and light are required for the growth of phytoplankton huisman et al 2006 cullen 2015 for large rivers that carry huge amount of sediment e g the changjiang river the upper estuary experiences extreme turbidity and primary production is strongly inhibited there due to light limitation wang et al 2019 the direct oxygen consumption of rom remineralization predominantly occurs in the upper estuary fig 7a and only a small portion spread beyond the turbid zone to reach the bottom hypoxic zone the direct and indirect contributions of rom remineralization are geographically separated by the turbid zone and the released nutrients by rom remineralization return to the nutrient pools to facilitate primary production beyond the turbid zone where remineralization of oceanic om usually occurs to promote bottom hypoxia fig 10b the remaining inorganic nutrients would be laterally transported by shelf circulation to sustain indirect impact in a large region downstream 4 2 overlooked indirect rom impacts this study indicated that the indirect impacts of rom remineralization on shelf oxygen condition have been underestimated especially for regions with large river input and complex shelf circulation isotope method was used to show that changjiang delivered rom made minor contribution to the total oxygen consumption during hypoxia formation wang et al 2016 this study finds that the direct impact of changjiang rom decreased sharply downstream and only contributed 5 4 to total oxygen consumption in the hypoxic zone fig 1b which generally forms at the offshore edge of the turbid zone the high turbidity in the upper estuary explained the minor direct contribution of rom during hypoxia formation on the other hand the indirect contribution 7 3 spread downstream following shelf circulation to cause deoxygenation in a large area in the northwest pacific marginal seas e g the east china sea the south yellow sea and the tsushima straight fig 7 the characteristic of the indirect contribution of changjiang delivered rom should be universal among large rivers large rivers have strong interactions with shelf circulation and can transport remaining nutrients downstream sustaining indirect impacts over the shelf the rom derived by the mississippi river the fourth longest river in the world also showed the potential to sustain high indirect impact on shelf oxygen condition in the northern gulf of mexico the northern gulf of mexico is another well known coastal region that has been under the threats of detrimental consequences of bottom hypoxia rabalais and turner 2001 hetland and dimarco 2008 rabalais et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 fennel and testa 2019 scavia et al 2019 the remaining inorganic nitrogen in the core of hypoxia off the mississippi river estuary 89 7 w spread downstream for as far as 450 km to reach 93 7 w and caused bottom oxygen decline in a large area over the continental shelf laurent et al 2014 the mississippi river also transports large amount of terrestrial om into the northern gulf of mexico shen et al 2012 thus the released inorganic nitrogen via rom remineralization would be transported downstream and sustained indirect impact in a large area over the shelf the indirect contributions of rom must be considered for the investigations relevant to oxygen consumption coastal deoxygenation or hypoxia formation 4 3 response of deoxygenation to rom mitigation the expansion of seasonal hypoxia has caused detrimental consequences to shelf biodiversity then potentially to other shelf ecosystem functioning historical survey data of dissolved oxygen concentration water ph and trawl catch in the east china sea were showed fig 11 the bottom dissolved oxygen concentration the average of all stations over the shelf during one survey cruise showed an annual minimum occurred in the summer season june july and august the water ph values also showed an annual minimum in the summer season fig 11b the number of demersal nekton species per trawl catch showed obvious seasonal variation fig 11c and biodiversity experienced pressure in the summer season the number of species per trawl catch was negatively correlated to bottom oxygen concentration and water ph figs 11d and 11e and low dissolved oxygen concentration and acidification caused degradation of biodiversity to mitigate the coastal hypoxia off the changjiang river estuary in the east china sea and to ease the aquatic dissolved oxygen stress are essential to the sustainability of coastal marine ecosystem to decrease rom concentration can remit deoxygenation and relieve dissolved oxygen stress for coastal waters rom concentration would experience instantaneous increase under flooding events and the contributions of rom remineralization increased in response to the increased rom concentration in a limited area with small river input wang et al 2018 river delivered om abatement was proved to be efficient in relieving dissolved oxygen stress off the pearl river estuary because the reduction in oxygen consumption by rom remineralization resulted in the shrink in hypoxic water volume yu et al 2020 the decrease in changjiang delivered rom concentration was also proved to be effective in remitting coastal deoxygenation in northwest pacific marginal seas fig 12 table 3 this study suggests that mitigation strategy must be strictly carried out to control the impacts of rom remineralization on shelf oxygen condition at least a 50 mitigation is required to prevent the 5 hypoxia threshold and 2 deoxygenation areas from crossing the tsushima straight to reach the japan sea figs 8 and 9 the a5 and a2 both showed more rapid twice as fast drop with 30 or higher mitigation than lower mitigation indicating that the mitigation efficiency strengthens with higher abatement fig 12 however no tipping point occurred in the rom mitigation curves hence strict mitigation is required to limit the rom remineralization induced oxygen decrease to negligible level e g the decrease in bottom oxygen concentration is smaller than 5 hypoxia threshold or the deoxygenation is smaller than 2 declaration of competing interest the author declares no conflicts of interest
