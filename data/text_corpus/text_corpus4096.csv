combination of values for the empirical coefficients that characterize the porous media in a varans vof model for predicting mean overtopping discharges from an initial reduced set of simulations input and output data are obtained for the training of the ann the ann is then used to estimate the best values for the combination of coefficients that describe the three breakwater layers armour

physics associated with phenomena that are difficult to describe or are not entirely understood and the fact that it is easily controlled and modified as required some disadvantages are associated

numerical modelling is a valuable tool to provide information on the processes that are difficult to measure in a physical model the level of accuracy of the present numerical models is relatively high and many applications were successful in reproducing wave structure interaction processes measured in laboratory experiments numerical modelling can also mitigate two of the biggest weaknesses of physical modelling extraction of data and scale and laboratory effects in numerical models various types of data such as velocity pressure water surface elevation turbulent kinetic energy can be extracted from any point and time in the simulation and the virtual probes do not interfere with the flow vyzikas et al 2014 several studies using numerical models calibrated and validated against physical model tests and subsequently used for assessment of the sensitivity of coastal structures to different scenarios of incident conditions and or geometry are available in the literature raosa et al 2012 altomare et al 2014 molines et al 2019 palma et al 2019 de finis et al 2020 chen et al 2021 the calibration phase for the establishment of the models empirical parameters is often time consuming but this process can be facilitated by the use of artificial neural networks ann as investigated in the present study to the authors knowledge the application of ann to determine the optimum values for the models empirical coefficients that best represent the wave structure interaction processes have not been implemented to date and therefore is investigated in this study the method is developed and validated against a set of laboratory experiments for single layer cube slc armoured breakwaters described in detail in vieira et al 2021 the paper is organized as follows after an introduction and literature review on numerical modelling of wave overtopping and ann in section 1 section 2 describes the laboratory experiments and numerical modelling conducted in this study the analysis and discussion of results are provided in section 3 section 4 presents the main conclusions and recommendations of this study 1 1 numerical modelling of wave overtopping most models solving the flow within a porous media are based on the navier stokes ns equations two different approaches have been followed in numerical modelling of wave propagation and interaction with structures when using the ns equations lagrangian and eulerian losada et al 2016 a detailed description of both approaches is described in detail in losada et al 2016 the governing equations for eulerian models are discretized in space with a finite difference finite volume technique using structured grids with a staggered mesh topology the volume of fluid vof technique is used for free surface tracking vanneste et al 2014 modelling of porous media rubble mound structures is highly complex since these are characterized by irregular pore shapes and sizes within a solid matrix which are usually assumed rigid losada et al 2016 volume averaged reynolds average navier stokes varans equations allow one to consider the porous material as continuous media when characterized by their macroscopic properties only eliminating the need for a detailed description of their complex internal geometry fig 1 the varans equations are derived by integrating the rans equations over a control volume determined based on the structure porosity n the porous media in the varans equations are modelled using forchheimer s relationship that includes two empirical coefficients associated with the linear α and non linear β drag forces the expression used in the model for the linear and non linear drag forces is given by 1 i α ν 1 n 2 n 2 d 50 2 u β 1 n n 2 d 50 u u where n represents the structure porosity d n50 the nominal mean stone diameter ν the kinematic viscosity and u the velocity losada et al 2008 applied a 2d varans model to a rubble mound breakwater that had previously been the subject of an experimental study the results showed that the model was able to reproduce instantaneous and average wave overtopping discharge with a mean error of 9 and 2 5 between measurements and model results for mean and maximum overtopping discharge volumes respectively jensen et al 2014 investigated the empirical coefficients applied for representation of the porous media in the varans equations using openfoam the model was applied and calibrated against a set of experiments for various flow regimes the model using the recommended empirical coefficients was applied to the experimental results reported in bruce et al 2009 for a rock armour layer the model was found to give a good estimation of overtopping discharges the simulated results were distributed around the empirical relationship in the same manner as the experimental results pilechi et al 2018 applied the 2d varans model ih2vof lara et al 2011 to a rubble mound breakwater laboratory experiment the comparisons were carried out for a range of sea state conditions water levels and breakwater geometries the average overtopping discharges predicted by the numerical model are within 20 of accuracy compared to those measured in the physical model palma et al 2019 also applied the model ih2vof to assess the impacts of waves on an overtopping breakwater for energy conversion this breakwater has a relatively complex geometry but the overtopping results still show that the error obtained with the numerical model was relatively small when compared to the measurements molines et al 2019 also applied openfoam to a rubble mound breakwater to evaluate the influence of the crown wall geometry on wave overtopping discharges they obtained relatively good calibration results when compared to physical model tests nevertheless there is still large uncertainty in describing α and β coefficients in varans models lara et al 2008 suggest that they depend on parameters such as the reynolds number shape of the stones grade of the porous material permeability and flow characteristics therefore values for these coefficients should be determined based on the comparison between numerical model results and experimental data although considerable effort has been done over the last three decades to better understand porous flow characteristics in coastal engineering applications there are still open questions the wide range of values found in the literature is a clear indication that there is still room for improvement in the determination of the porous parameter values and how they are linked to the different flow conditions losada et al 2016 in most of the above mentioned studies the determination of α and β coefficients to obtain a satisfactorily model calibration was either taken from literature which is not always applicable to generic cases or by trial and error considering that there are usually 2 to 3 layers of porous material armour and core or armour filter and core this corresponds to a large number of possible combinations of parameters which subsequently results in a great number of simulations and long computational time furthermore the trial and error process is not a systematic and efficient approach one can test different combinations of values but better results could eventually be achieved for combinations that were not considered therefore there is a need to develop a systematic and consistent approach to determine the best combination of values for the porous media coefficients since this is a non linear problem this study presents the implementation of artificial neural networks to obtain better and quicker estimates of the empirical coefficients for the porous media in varans models 1 2 artificial neural networks artificial neural networks ann are data driven algorithms that aim at simulating the structure of the human brain to identify patterns in complex data given a set of inputs and outputs lippman 1987 ann are techniques useful to solve non linear problems when enough experimental data are available for training this process does not require any prior knowledge of the actual physics although it is important to know which input variables are relevant to the problem to be solved vieira et al 2020b ann are widely used in coastal and ocean engineering in various fields including wave overtopping of coastal structures medina 1999 medina et al

vieira et al 2020b ann include processing unit elements called neurons which transform through a nonlinear transfer function a linear combination of the preceding layer the coefficients of the linear combination named synaptic weights w together with the network biases b represent the free parameters of the network model peres et al 2015 the schematic of a two layered x i inputs h i hidden layer and o output layer neuron model with i input parameters j hidden nodes k output nodes and one output parameter p is presented in fig 2 input values are transmitted to the hidden layer nodes each of which sums up the received values from all input nodes adds a bias to this sum and then passes them on through a nonlinear transfer function vieira et al 2020b the output layer nodes receive this information and operate identically to the hidden nodes the ann learning procedure fig 3 consists of adjusting the weights and biases in each step to minimize the errors between predictions outputs p and measurements or targets t this procedure is repeated until an error threshold or a maximum number of iterations is reached a more detailed description of ann can be found in vieira et al 2020b

2 materials and methods 2 1 physical model tests the 2d laboratory experiments were conducted in the wave basin 28 m long 12 m wide and 1 2 m deep of the hydraulics laboratory of the hydraulics water resources and environment division shrha of the faculty of engineering of the university of porto on a geometrical scale of 1 35 a 1 6 m wide flume was constructed within the wave basin the flume was divided in two by an acrylic glass sheet installed between the tested models from the crown wall area to a distance of approximately 2 m seaward of the toe of the structure to test two cross sections with similar reflection characteristics simultaneously the wave flume has a piston type wavemaker with an active wave absorption system which was activated to minimize wave reflections in the model the water depth at the wave generation and model areas was 0 74 and 0 50 m respectively with a 4 8 slope transition between the flat seabed areas fig 4 the breakwater model had a slope of 1 v 1 5h fig 5 the armour layer was built with porosities n of 0 29 and 0 33 the structure consisted of a permeable rock core d n50 1 1 cm a filter layer d n50 1 5 cm and a single layer of cubes d n 3 5 cm placed by hand in a regular pattern a crown wall was placed behind a 3d n wide armoured crest the water surface elevation was measured along the flume using resistive type wave probes with an accuracy of 0 4 mm a group of three probes was placed in the deeper area near the wavemaker and two other groups of three probes near each of the breakwater sections fig 4 probe distances varied according to the incident wave conditions to capture the range of frequencies between 0 5 and 2 0 f p f p 1 t p where t p represents the peak wave period water surface elevations were recorded at a frequency of 40 hz and incident and reflected waves were separated using the method of mansard and funke 1980 which uses simultaneous records of the free surface elevations measured by three aligned wave gauges water was collected via a 0 6 m wide overtopping chute sloping down from the top of the crown wall into reservoirs located on the lee side of the structure the overtopping discharge was measured by a water surface elevation probe placed inside a perforated pvc pipe within the reservoirs to minimize oscillations in the measurements when needed a pump installed inside the reservoir was activated to empty the reservoir during the tests two armour porosities 0 29 and 0 33 and constant wave steepness 0 02 and 0 05 in the wave generation zone s op h m0 l op where h m0 represents the spectral significant wave height l op the wavelength based on the peak wave period t p were adopted with the significant wave height progressively increasing within each test series table 1 irregular sea states defined by a jonswap spectrum with a peak enhancement factor γ 3 3 were used in all tests the test durations varied between 14 min and 26 min corresponding to the generation of approximately 1000 waves in each test a fixed water depth h of 0 50 m at the structure was adopted resulting in a crest freeboard r c of 0 18 m 2 2 numerical model 2 2 1 description the physical model tests were simulated using the numerical model ih2vof lara et al 2011 based on the model cobras uc losada et al 2008 ih2vof solves the two dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations based on the decomposition of the instantaneous velocity and pressure fields into mean and turbulent components the effects of the turbulence field are modelled using the k ε transport equations to calculate the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulent dissipation rate ε the free surface movement in ih2vof is tracked by the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 liu and wen 1997 the flow inside the porous media is resolved using the volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes varans equations a complete mathematical formulation of the varans equations is presented in liu et al 1999 and hsu et al 2002 the ih2vof model was previously applied in a wide range of cases including nearshore processes in the surf zone lara et al 2006a 2011 torres freyermuth et al 2007 2010 wave structure interaction for low crested breakwaters garcia et al 2004 losada et al 2005 lara et al 2006b composite breakwaters lara et al 2008 guanche et al 2009 emerged rubble mound breakwaters losada et al 2008 guanche et al 2009 tsunami propagation aniel quiroga et al 2018 and non conventional breakwaters for wave energy conversion di lauro et al 2019 2 2 2 model setup the domain is 14 6 m long in the x and 1 0 m in the y directions respectively fig 6 the rectangular mesh is divided into 3 and 2 sub zones in the x and y directions respectively for refinement in the region of interest fig 7 the reference mesh size is variable with a resolution of 1 0 cm 2 0 cm in the x direction and 0 5 cm 1 0 cm in the y direction the minimum and maximum δx δy ratio are 1 and 4 respectively the h m0 δy min and l p δx min ratios for the smallest wave condition simulated see table 5 are 21 and 216 respectively the total number of cells is 995 x direction by 150 y direction resulting in approximately 150 000 cells a jonswap spectrum with a peak enhancement factor of 3 3 with the same h m0 and t p as specified in the physical model was adopted for the generation of the wave series but different initial seed numbers were used in the physical and numerical models wave absorption boundaries were implemented at the wave generation and the end of the numerical flume numerical wave gauges were placed at the same locations as those in the physical model an additional gauge was included at the crown wall for the calculation of overtopping discharges the model was run for the same duration as in the physical model various combinations of β were adopted for the porous media layers armour filter and core in the simulations for providing data to the ann lara et al 2006 2008 suggest that numerical results are more sensitive to the non linear drag coefficient β than the linear parameter α for turbulent flows therefore α was kept constant with a value of 200 to limit the number of variables in the problem the value of 200 is based on various applications of ih2vof for similar wave structure interaction problems lara et al 2008 losada et al 2008 guanche et al 2009 2015 additional simulations with the coefficients of losada et al 2008 and jensen et al 2014 were carried out since these studies looked specifically into wave overtopping over rubble mound breakwaters table 2 the simulations are used as a reference for comparison of the performance of the calibrated model with the β obtained from the ann developed in this study porosities of 0 29 and 0 33 were adopted for the armour layer two scenarios 0 40 for the filter and 0 38 for the core 2 2 3 mesh sensitivity a sensitivity analysis to the mesh element size was carried out to assess the influence of this parameter on the results mesh elements with sizes equal to 80 120 and 140 of the reference mesh element were tested table 3 and a sample condition applied at the model boundary with h m0 18 0 cm and t p 1 8 s s op 0 035 for a duration of 60 s the relative differences in comparison to the reference mesh 100 are presented in table 4 the results show that there is a relatively small decrease in the cumulative overtopping volume q and an increase in the reflection coefficient kr for a finer mesh 80 a 20 increase in mesh size results in 10 higher overtopping volumes and a negligible decrease in the reflection coefficient the results for the 140 mesh give similar cumulative overtopping discharges to the 120 mesh but with a reduced value of kr based on these results it was decided to adopt the reference mesh since small differences in q and kr are obtained with the finer mesh but the simulation time is increased by a factor of 2 3 which is considered excessive as many simulations are required in this study the simulations were run on a workstation with intel xeon platinum 8168 cpu 2 7 ghz processors 2 2 4 artificial neural network for estimation of β values the ih2vof model was applied to a combination of incident wave conditions armour layer porosities and β coefficient values to generate values of mean overtopping discharges q for the development of the ann fig 8 the model was run for cases where the mean overtopping discharge obtained in the laboratory is above 0 00 l s m table 5 resulting in 8 wave conditions the values of the β coefficient for each of the three porous layers β armour β filter β core were chosen as model calibration parameters a range between 0 8 and 1 2 was selected for β based on values provided in the literature where a reasonable calibration was achieved the total number of possible combinations for the three β coefficients assuming a range of 0 8 1 2 with a 0 1 spacing is 5 β values 3 β coefficients 125 which would result in a very large number of simulations 125 8 wave conditions 1000 simulations to limit the number of simulations needed to provide enough information for the development of the ann for prediction of the best estimates of β six representative combinations of β values were used table 6 resulting in 8 wave conditions 6 coefficient combinations 48 simulations 1 000 around 5 the six combinations of values were chosen to represent enough variability such that the ann could identify trends in the non linear behaviour of the three coefficients the simulation time for each case varied between 40 and 92 h the 48 runs were done simultaneously in a workstation since ih2vof runs on a single processor the matlab neural network toolbox beale et al 2019 was used in this study a feed forward backpropagation multilayer perceptron type of ann with a sigmoid transfer function in the hidden layer and a linear transfer function in the output layer was applied the input parameters for the ann are h m0 t m 1 0 n armour β armour β filter β core and the output is the mean overtopping discharge q in this study 4 input layers 2 hidden layers and 1 output layer fig 8 were used the early stopping criterion was used in the ann to prevent overlearning in this technique the available data is divided into three subsets the first subset 70 of the data is the training set which was used for computing the gradient and updating the network weights and biases the second subset 15 of the data is the validation set the error on the validation set was monitored during the training process the validation error normally decreases during the initial phase of training as does the training set error however when the network begins to overfit the data the error on the validation set typically begins to rise when the validation error increases the training is stopped and the weights and biases at the minimum of the validation error are returned beale et al 2019 the testing subset 15 of the data was used as cross validation feed forward backpropagation networks may have drawbacks among them is the results sensitivity to the initialization weights which are randomly set at the beginning of the training process iglesias et al 2008 it is therefore recommended to train the ann several times beale et al 2019 to ensure good accuracy of the results in this study 50 networks with different initial weights were tested and the best performing ann selected based on the lowest normalized mean square error nmse defined as 2 n m s e i 1 n y i x i 2 v a r x where var represents the variance of the data n the number of data y i the estimates and x i the observations a lower value of nmse corresponds to better prediction 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of β coefficient values results from the numerical 48 simulations 6 combinations of β values 8 wave conditions were used to develop an ann for estimation of the best combination of β values the nmse was calculated for each of the 50 anns each with different initial weights the best performing ann was number 41 fig 9 top with a nmse 0 5 the agreement between the model results for each of the 48 simulations against the ann estimate is very good fig 9 bottom an input matrix for the 125 possible combinations of β values for the three breakwater layers and 8 wave conditions 1000 cases was generated to be used as input for the ann the nmse for the mean overtopping discharges ann estimated vs actual measured was calculated for each set of β values higher β armour and β core and lower β filter seems to result in a lower nmse fig 10 the best combination of values based on the ann estimates is β armour 1 2 β filter 0 8 β core 1 2 nmse 7 9 these values were then used in the numerical model and the results are presented in the following section 3 2 model validation the comparison between the measured incident wave conditions and the numerical model results for the selected β values show a good agreement with a nmse of 2 6 and 1 5 for h m0 and t m 1 0 respectively fig 11 a snapshot of an overtopping event for one of the simulations is depicted in fig 12 for illustrative purposes a good agreement between the mean overtopping discharge obtained with the numerical model using the β values and those estimated by the ann was achieved with a nmse of 1 4 fig 13 the main difference is for the cases with lower overtopping rates o02 tests in table 5 with measured q prototype of 1 9 and 1 3 l s m for which no overtopping was obtained in the model fig 13 for smaller average overtopping rates in physical models q 1 l s m uncertainties in measurements can become large troch et al 2004 and therefore there is typically more scatter in the data the reliability of the 90 confidence interval prediction with the empirical formula of eurotop 2018 is between a factor of 2 5 and 20 for very small overtopping van der meer et al 2016 it was also noted in zanuttigh et al 2016 that despite the zero values in the datasets of physical model experiments the trained ann in that study could predict relatively small non zero values model results for the β values from losada et al 2008 β los jensen et al 2014 β jen and this study β vie are compared against the data obtained from the laboratory experiments the comparison between the modelled and measured reflection coefficients and non dimensional mean overtopping rates q q g h m 0 3 between the measurements and model results with β los β jen and β vie is depicted in fig 14 and presented in table 7 model results with β los and β vie appear to underestimate the reflection coefficient obtained in the laboratory experiments nmse of 99 5 and 38 6 kr values obtained with β jen agree better with the measurements nmse of 14 7 the root mean square error obtained with the model for β vie is 4 2 which is slightly higher than the values presented in zanuttigh and van der meer 2008 3 7 for armour units based on an empirical formulation and therefore it is considered acceptable the non dimensional overtopping rates obtained with β vie show a good agreement compared to the measurements and perform better than using values of β from the literature fig 14 and table 7 this combination of β values results in the best estimates of q which was the main objective of this work similar performance could eventually be obtained with different combinations of α and β values differences between measurements and model results are inevitably expected for several reasons for example the structure slope in the 2d numerical model was imposed as a straight line whilst in reality there will be irregularities along with the slope profile the actual slope obtained from a laser scanner could be implemented in the model but only one profile would be considered since a 2d model was used also the mesh resolution as shown in section 2 2 3 will result in some differences in results depending on the selected mesh size the mesh size selection is always a compromise between accuracy and computational time constraints in this study different initial seed numbers for the generation of the wave series in the numerical model and experiments were used in vieira et al 2021 the influence of a different initial seed number for the wave generation signal was carried out based on some of the tests presented in this study the difference for prototype mean overtopping discharges above 1 l s m is within the range of 0 8 for the cases with smaller mean overtopping discharges q prototype 1 l s m the maximum differences are between 80 and 130 romano et al 2015 carried out physical model tests for a rock armoured breakwater with different initial seed numbers they found that when the relative freeboard is larger than 1 4 the variability of the overtopping discharge may reach one order of magnitude for the same wave condition based on all of the above aspects it is considered that the validation is adequate and the numerical model can be used for evaluating mean wave overtopping discharges for other incident wave conditions within the range of validated values and investigate the performance for slight geometry modifications 4 conclusions a correct calibration and validation of numerical models against physical model tests are essential to properly represent the wave structure interaction processes a precise model validation provides confidence to study properties not easily measured in the laboratory to assess different structure geometries and or incident wave and water level conditions in the traditional trial and error approach adopted in previous studies it is difficult to ensure the best combination of coefficients is achieved to this end this study presents a novel methodology for the calibration of the porous media coefficients in a varans vof model to obtain the optimum values for the simulation of wave overtopping discharges the new method consists of running a limited number of simulations using different combinations of coefficient values one for each layer to be used in the development of the ann the ann is subsequently used to evaluate a large range of different combinations of coefficient values to select the best performing in terms of mean wave overtopping discharge the selected coefficient values are then applied to the numerical model and the results are validated against 2d physical model test results for single layer cube slc armoured breakwaters this method is shown to perform well and results in a reduced number of simulations 48 compared to the required number to assess all possible combinations of values 1 000 considered in this study a nmse of 13 9 was achieved for non dimensional mean overtopping discharges between the model and laboratory test results which is better than if values from existing literature for similar cases are applied the ann developed in this study aimed at reducing the error in mean overtopping discharge estimates for the entire range of wave conditions and armour layer porosities with a unique combination of coefficient values a better combination of values could be achieved if the objective was to focus on a single incident wave condition and armour layer porosity for example during the design stages it is common to investigate the influence of structure geometry modifications on overtopping performance for the design condition for example the 100 year return period event depending on the focus of the model application an ann to simultaneously reduce the error in both mean wave overtopping and reflection coefficient could be developed in the future credit authorship contribution statement filipe vieira funding acquisition conceptualization methodology investigation visualization formal

extracted from any point and time in the simulation and the virtual probes do not interfere with the flow vyzikas et al 2014 several studies using numerical models calibrated and validated against physical model tests and subsequently used for assessment of the sensitivity of coastal structures to different scenarios of incident conditions and or geometry are available in the literature raosa et al 2012 altomare et al 2014 molines et al 2019 palma et al 2019 de finis et al 2020 chen et al 2021 the calibration phase for the establishment of the models empirical parameters is often time consuming but this process can be facilitated by the use of artificial neural networks ann as investigated in the present study to the authors knowledge the application of ann to determine the optimum values for the models empirical coefficients that best represent the wave structure interaction processes have not been implemented to date and therefore is investigated in this study the method is developed and validated against a set of laboratory experiments for single layer cube slc armoured breakwaters described in detail in vieira et al 2021 the paper is organized as follows after an introduction and literature review on numerical modelling of wave overtopping and ann in section 1 section 2 describes the laboratory experiments and numerical modelling conducted in this study the analysis and discussion of results are provided in section 3 section 4 presents the main conclusions and recommendations of this study 1 1 numerical modelling of wave overtopping most models solving the flow within a porous media are based on the navier stokes ns equations two different approaches have been followed in numerical modelling of wave propagation and interaction with structures when using the ns equations lagrangian and eulerian losada et al 2016 a detailed description of both approaches is described in detail in losada et al 2016 the governing equations for eulerian models are discretized in space with a finite difference finite volume technique using structured grids with a staggered mesh topology the volume of fluid vof technique is used for free surface tracking vanneste et al 2014 modelling of porous media rubble mound structures is highly complex since these are characterized by irregular pore shapes and sizes within a solid matrix which are usually assumed rigid losada et al 2016 volume averaged reynolds average navier stokes varans equations allow one to consider the porous material as continuous media when characterized by their macroscopic properties only eliminating the need for a detailed description of their complex internal geometry fig 1 the varans equations are derived by integrating the rans equations over a control volume determined based on the structure porosity n the porous media in the varans equations are modelled using forchheimer s relationship that includes two empirical coefficients associated with the linear α and non linear β drag forces the expression used in the model for the linear and non linear drag forces is given by 1 i α ν 1 n 2 n 2 d 50 2 u β 1 n n 2 d 50 u u where n represents the structure porosity d n50 the nominal mean stone diameter ν the kinematic viscosity and u the velocity losada et al 2008 applied a 2d varans model to a rubble mound breakwater that had previously been the subject of an experimental study the results showed that the model was able to reproduce instantaneous and average wave overtopping discharge with a mean error of 9 and 2 5 between measurements and model results for mean and maximum overtopping discharge volumes respectively jensen et al 2014 investigated the empirical coefficients applied for representation of the porous media in the varans equations using openfoam the model was applied and calibrated against a set of experiments for various flow regimes the model using the recommended empirical coefficients was applied to the experimental results reported in bruce et al 2009 for a rock armour layer the model was found to give a good estimation of overtopping discharges the simulated results were distributed around the empirical relationship in the same manner as the experimental results pilechi et al 2018 applied the 2d varans model ih2vof lara et al 2011 to a rubble mound breakwater laboratory experiment the comparisons were carried out for a range of sea state conditions water levels and breakwater geometries the average overtopping discharges predicted by the numerical model are within 20 of accuracy compared to those measured in the physical model palma et al 2019 also applied the model ih2vof to assess the impacts of waves on an overtopping breakwater for energy conversion this breakwater has a relatively complex geometry but the overtopping results still show that the error obtained with the numerical model was relatively small when compared to the measurements molines et al 2019 also applied openfoam to a rubble mound breakwater to evaluate the influence of the crown wall geometry on wave overtopping discharges they obtained relatively good calibration results when compared to physical model tests nevertheless there is still large uncertainty in describing α and β coefficients in varans models lara et al 2008 suggest that they depend on parameters such as the reynolds number shape of the stones grade of the porous material permeability and flow characteristics therefore values for these coefficients should be determined based on the comparison between numerical model results and experimental data although considerable effort has been done over the last three decades to better understand porous flow characteristics in coastal engineering applications there are still open questions the wide range of values found in the literature is a clear indication that there is still room for improvement in the determination of the porous parameter values and how they are linked to the different flow conditions losada et al 2016 in most of the above mentioned studies the determination of α and β coefficients to obtain a satisfactorily model calibration was either taken from literature which is not always applicable to generic cases or by trial and error considering that there are usually 2 to 3 layers of porous material armour and core or armour filter and core this corresponds to a large number of possible combinations of parameters which subsequently results in a great number of simulations and long computational time furthermore the trial and error process is not a systematic and efficient approach one can test different combinations of values but better results could eventually be achieved for combinations that were not considered therefore there is a need to develop a systematic and consistent approach to determine the best combination of values for the porous media coefficients since this is a non linear problem this study presents the implementation of artificial neural networks to obtain better and quicker estimates of the empirical coefficients for the porous media in varans models 1 2 artificial neural networks artificial neural networks ann are data driven algorithms that aim at simulating the structure of the human brain to identify patterns in complex data given a set of inputs and outputs lippman 1987 ann are techniques useful to solve non linear problems when enough experimental data are available for training this process does not require any prior knowledge of the actual physics although it is important to know which input variables are relevant to the problem to be solved vieira et al 2020b ann are widely used in coastal and ocean engineering in various fields including wave overtopping of coastal structures medina 1999 medina et al

vieira et al 2020b ann include processing unit elements called neurons which transform through a nonlinear transfer function a linear combination of the preceding layer the coefficients of the linear combination named synaptic weights w together with the network biases b represent the free parameters of the network model peres et al 2015 the schematic of a two layered x i inputs h i hidden layer and o output layer neuron model with i input parameters j hidden nodes k output nodes and one output parameter p is presented in fig 2 input values are transmitted to the hidden layer nodes each of which sums up the received values from all input nodes adds a bias to this sum and then passes them on through a nonlinear transfer function vieira et al 2020b the output layer nodes receive this information and operate identically to the hidden nodes the ann learning procedure fig 3 consists of adjusting the weights and biases in each step to minimize the errors between predictions outputs p and measurements or targets t this procedure is repeated until an error threshold or a maximum number of iterations is reached a more detailed description of ann can be found in vieira et al 2020b

2 materials and methods 2 1 physical model tests the 2d laboratory experiments were conducted in the wave basin 28 m long 12 m wide and 1 2 m deep of the hydraulics laboratory of the hydraulics water resources and environment division shrha of the faculty of engineering of the university of porto on a geometrical scale of 1 35 a 1 6 m wide flume was constructed within the wave basin the flume was divided in two by an acrylic glass sheet installed between the tested models from the crown wall area to a distance of approximately 2 m seaward of the toe of the structure to test two cross sections with similar reflection characteristics simultaneously the wave flume has a piston type wavemaker with an active wave absorption system which was activated to minimize wave reflections in the model the water depth at the wave generation and model areas was 0 74 and 0 50 m respectively with a 4 8 slope transition between the flat seabed areas fig 4 the breakwater model had a slope of 1 v 1 5h fig 5 the armour layer was built with porosities n of 0 29 and 0 33 the structure consisted of a permeable rock core d n50 1 1 cm a filter layer d n50 1 5 cm and a single layer of cubes d n 3 5 cm placed by hand in a regular pattern a crown wall was placed behind a 3d n wide armoured crest the water surface elevation was measured along the flume using resistive type wave probes with an accuracy of 0 4 mm a group of three probes was placed in the deeper area near the wavemaker and two other groups of three probes near each of the breakwater sections fig 4 probe distances varied according to the incident wave conditions to capture the range of frequencies between 0 5 and 2 0 f p f p 1 t p where t p represents the peak wave period water surface elevations were recorded at a frequency of 40 hz and incident and reflected waves were separated using the method of mansard and funke 1980 which uses simultaneous records of the free surface elevations measured by three aligned wave gauges water was collected via a 0 6 m wide overtopping chute sloping down from the top of the crown wall into reservoirs located on the lee side of the structure the overtopping discharge was measured by a water surface elevation probe placed inside a perforated pvc pipe within the reservoirs to minimize oscillations in the measurements when needed a pump installed inside the reservoir was activated to empty the reservoir during the tests two armour porosities 0 29 and 0 33 and constant wave steepness 0 02 and 0 05 in the wave generation zone s op h m0 l op where h m0 represents the spectral significant wave height l op the wavelength based on the peak wave period t p were adopted with the significant wave height progressively increasing within each test series table 1 irregular sea states defined by a jonswap spectrum with a peak enhancement factor γ 3 3 were used in all tests the test durations varied between 14 min and 26 min corresponding to the generation of approximately 1000 waves in each test a fixed water depth h of 0 50 m at the structure was adopted resulting in a crest freeboard r c of 0 18 m 2 2 numerical model 2 2 1 description the physical model tests were simulated using the numerical model ih2vof lara et al 2011 based on the model cobras uc losada et al 2008 ih2vof solves the two dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations based on the decomposition of the instantaneous velocity and pressure fields into mean and turbulent components the effects of the turbulence field are modelled using the k ε transport equations to calculate the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulent dissipation rate ε the free surface movement in ih2vof is tracked by the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 liu and wen 1997 the flow inside the porous media is resolved using the volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes varans equations a complete mathematical formulation of the varans equations is presented in liu et al 1999 and hsu et al 2002 the ih2vof model was previously applied in a wide range of cases including nearshore processes in the surf zone lara et al 2006a 2011 torres freyermuth et al 2007 2010 wave structure interaction for low crested breakwaters garcia et al 2004 losada et al 2005 lara et al 2006b composite breakwaters lara et al 2008 guanche et al 2009 emerged rubble mound breakwaters losada et al 2008 guanche et al 2009 tsunami propagation aniel quiroga et al 2018 and non conventional breakwaters for wave energy conversion di lauro et al 2019 2 2 2 model setup the domain is 14 6 m long in the x and 1 0 m in the y directions respectively fig 6 the rectangular mesh is divided into 3 and 2 sub zones in the x and y directions respectively for refinement in the region of interest fig 7 the reference mesh size is variable with a resolution of 1 0 cm 2 0 cm in the x direction and 0 5 cm 1 0 cm in the y direction the minimum and maximum δx δy ratio are 1 and 4 respectively the h m0 δy min and l p δx min ratios for the smallest wave condition simulated see table 5 are 21 and 216 respectively the total number of cells is 995 x direction by 150 y direction resulting in approximately 150 000 cells a jonswap spectrum with a peak enhancement factor of 3 3 with the same h m0 and t p as specified in the physical model was adopted for the generation of the wave series but different initial seed numbers were used in the physical and numerical models wave absorption boundaries were implemented at the wave generation and the end of the numerical flume numerical wave gauges were placed at the same locations as those in the physical model an additional gauge was included at the crown wall for the calculation of overtopping discharges the model was run for the same duration as in the physical model various combinations of β were adopted for the porous media layers armour filter and core in the simulations for providing data to the ann lara et al 2006 2008 suggest that numerical results are more sensitive to the non linear drag coefficient β than the linear parameter α for turbulent flows therefore α was kept constant with a value of 200 to limit the number of variables in the problem the value of 200 is based on various applications of ih2vof for similar wave structure interaction problems lara et al 2008 losada et al 2008 guanche et al 2009 2015 additional simulations with the coefficients of losada et al 2008 and jensen et al 2014 were carried out since these studies looked specifically into wave overtopping over rubble mound breakwaters table 2 the simulations are used as a reference for comparison of the performance of the calibrated model with the β obtained from the ann developed in this study porosities of 0 29 and 0 33 were adopted for the armour layer two scenarios 0 40 for the filter and 0 38 for the core 2 2 3 mesh sensitivity a sensitivity analysis to the mesh element size was carried out to assess the influence of this parameter on the results mesh elements with sizes equal to 80 120 and 140 of the reference mesh element were tested table 3 and a sample condition applied at the model boundary with h m0 18 0 cm and t p 1 8 s s op 0 035 for a duration of 60 s the relative differences in comparison to the reference mesh 100 are presented in table 4 the results show that there is a relatively small decrease in the cumulative overtopping volume q and an increase in the reflection coefficient kr for a finer mesh 80 a 20 increase in mesh size results in 10 higher overtopping volumes and a negligible decrease in the reflection coefficient the results for the 140 mesh give similar cumulative overtopping discharges to the 120 mesh but with a reduced value of kr based on these results it was decided to adopt the reference mesh since small differences in q and kr are obtained with the finer mesh but the simulation time is increased by a factor of 2 3 which is considered excessive as many simulations are required in this study the simulations were run on a workstation with intel xeon platinum 8168 cpu 2 7 ghz processors 2 2 4 artificial neural network for estimation of β values the ih2vof model was applied to a combination of incident wave conditions armour layer porosities and β coefficient values to generate values of mean overtopping discharges q for the development of the ann fig 8 the model was run for cases where the mean overtopping discharge obtained in the laboratory is above 0 00 l s m table 5 resulting in 8 wave conditions the values of the β coefficient for each of the three porous layers β armour β filter β core were chosen as model calibration parameters a range between 0 8 and 1 2 was selected for β based on values provided in the literature where a reasonable calibration was achieved the total number of possible combinations for the three β coefficients assuming a range of 0 8 1 2 with a 0 1 spacing is 5 β values 3 β coefficients 125 which would result in a very large number of simulations 125 8 wave conditions 1000 simulations to limit the number of simulations needed to provide enough information for the development of the ann for prediction of the best estimates of β six representative combinations of β values were used table 6 resulting in 8 wave conditions 6 coefficient combinations 48 simulations 1 000 around 5 the six combinations of values were chosen to represent enough variability such that the ann could identify trends in the non linear behaviour of the three coefficients the simulation time for each case varied between 40 and 92 h the 48 runs were done simultaneously in a workstation since ih2vof runs on a single processor the matlab neural network toolbox beale et al 2019 was used in this study a feed forward backpropagation multilayer perceptron type of ann with a sigmoid transfer function in the hidden layer and a linear transfer function in the output layer was applied the input parameters for the ann are h m0 t m 1 0 n armour β armour β filter β core and the output is the mean overtopping discharge q in this study 4 input layers 2 hidden layers and 1 output layer fig 8 were used the early stopping criterion was used in the ann to prevent overlearning in this technique the available data is divided into three subsets the first subset 70 of the data is the training set which was used for computing the gradient and updating the network weights and biases the second subset 15 of the data is the validation set the error on the validation set was monitored during the training process the validation error normally decreases during the initial phase of training as does the training set error however when the network begins to overfit the data the error on the validation set typically begins to rise when the validation error increases the training is stopped and the weights and biases at the minimum of the validation error are returned beale et al 2019 the testing subset 15 of the data was used as cross validation feed forward backpropagation networks may have drawbacks among them is the results sensitivity to the initialization weights which are randomly set at the beginning of the training process iglesias et al 2008 it is therefore recommended to train the ann several times beale et al 2019 to ensure good accuracy of the results in this study 50 networks with different initial weights were tested and the best performing ann selected based on the lowest normalized mean square error nmse defined as 2 n m s e i 1 n y i x i 2 v a r x where var represents the variance of the data n the number of data y i the estimates and x i the observations a lower value of nmse corresponds to better prediction 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of β coefficient values results from the numerical 48 simulations 6 combinations of β values 8 wave conditions were used to develop an ann for estimation of the best combination of β values the nmse was calculated for each of the 50 anns each with different initial weights the best performing ann was number 41 fig 9 top with a nmse 0 5 the agreement between the model results for each of the 48 simulations against the ann estimate is very good fig 9 bottom an input matrix for the 125 possible combinations of β values for the three breakwater layers and 8 wave conditions 1000 cases was generated to be used as input for the ann the nmse for the mean overtopping discharges ann estimated vs actual measured was calculated for each set of β values higher β armour and β core and lower β filter seems to result in a lower nmse fig 10 the best combination of values based on the ann estimates is β armour 1 2 β filter 0 8 β core 1 2 nmse 7 9 these values were then used in the numerical model and the results are presented in the following section 3 2 model validation the comparison between the measured incident wave conditions and the numerical model results for the selected β values show a good agreement with a nmse of 2 6 and 1 5 for h m0 and t m 1 0 respectively fig 11 a snapshot of an overtopping event for one of the simulations is depicted in fig 12 for illustrative purposes a good agreement between the mean overtopping discharge obtained with the numerical model using the β values and those estimated by the ann was achieved with a nmse of 1 4 fig 13 the main difference is for the cases with lower overtopping rates o02 tests in table 5 with measured q prototype of 1 9 and 1 3 l s m for which no overtopping was obtained in the model fig 13 for smaller average overtopping rates in physical models q 1 l s m uncertainties in measurements can become large troch et al 2004 and therefore there is typically more scatter in the data the reliability of the 90 confidence interval prediction with the empirical formula of eurotop 2018 is between a factor of 2 5 and 20 for very small overtopping van der meer et al 2016 it was also noted in zanuttigh et al 2016 that despite the zero values in the datasets of physical model experiments the trained ann in that study could predict relatively small non zero values model results for the β values from losada et al 2008 β los jensen et al 2014 β jen and this study β vie are compared against the data obtained from the laboratory experiments the comparison between the modelled and measured reflection coefficients and non dimensional mean overtopping rates q q g h m 0 3 between the measurements and model results with β los β jen and β vie is depicted in fig 14 and presented in table 7 model results with β los and β vie appear to underestimate the reflection coefficient obtained in the laboratory experiments nmse of 99 5 and 38 6 kr values obtained with β jen agree better with the measurements nmse of 14 7 the root mean square error obtained with the model for β vie is 4 2 which is slightly higher than the values presented in zanuttigh and van der meer 2008 3 7 for armour units based on an empirical formulation and therefore it is considered acceptable the non dimensional overtopping rates obtained with β vie show a good agreement compared to the measurements and perform better than using values of β from the literature fig 14 and table 7 this combination of β values results in the best estimates of q which was the main objective of this work similar performance could eventually be obtained with different combinations of α and β values differences between measurements and model results are inevitably expected for several reasons for example the structure slope in the 2d numerical model was imposed as a straight line whilst in reality there will be irregularities along with the slope profile the actual slope obtained from a laser scanner could be implemented in the model but only one profile would be considered since a 2d model was used also the mesh resolution as shown in section 2 2 3 will result in some differences in results depending on the selected mesh size the mesh size selection is always a compromise between accuracy and computational time constraints in this study different initial seed numbers for the generation of the wave series in the numerical model and experiments were used in vieira et al 2021 the influence of a different initial seed number for the wave generation signal was carried out based on some of the tests presented in this study the difference for prototype mean overtopping discharges above 1 l s m is within the range of 0 8 for the cases with smaller mean overtopping discharges q prototype 1 l s m the maximum differences are between 80 and 130 romano et al 2015 carried out physical model tests for a rock armoured breakwater with different initial seed numbers they found that when the relative freeboard is larger than 1 4 the variability of the overtopping discharge may reach one order of magnitude for the same wave condition based on all of the above aspects it is considered that the validation is adequate and the numerical model can be used for evaluating mean wave overtopping discharges for other incident wave conditions within the range of validated values and investigate the performance for slight geometry modifications 4 conclusions a correct calibration and validation of numerical models against physical model tests are essential to properly represent the wave structure interaction processes a precise model validation provides confidence to study properties not easily measured in the laboratory to assess different structure geometries and or incident wave and water level conditions in the traditional trial and error approach adopted in previous studies it is difficult to ensure the best combination of coefficients is achieved to this end this study presents a novel methodology for the calibration of the porous media coefficients in a varans vof model to obtain the optimum values for the simulation of wave overtopping discharges the new method consists of running a limited number of simulations using different combinations of coefficient values one for each layer to be used in the development of the ann the ann is subsequently used to evaluate a large range of different combinations of coefficient values to select the best performing in terms of mean wave overtopping discharge the selected coefficient values are then applied to the numerical model and the results are validated against 2d physical model test results for single layer cube slc armoured breakwaters this method is shown to perform well and results in a reduced number of simulations 48 compared to the required number to assess all possible combinations of values 1 000 considered in this study a nmse of 13 9 was achieved for non dimensional mean overtopping discharges between the model and laboratory test results which is better than if values from existing literature for similar cases are applied the ann developed in this study aimed at reducing the error in mean overtopping discharge estimates for the entire range of wave conditions and armour layer porosities with a unique combination of coefficient values a better combination of values could be achieved if the objective was to focus on a single incident wave condition and armour layer porosity for example during the design stages it is common to investigate the influence of structure geometry modifications on overtopping performance for the design condition for example the 100 year return period event depending on the focus of the model application an ann to simultaneously reduce the error in both mean wave overtopping and reflection coefficient could be developed in the future credit authorship contribution statement filipe vieira funding acquisition conceptualization methodology investigation visualization formal

20481,against the background of a drastically increased demand of marine proteins off bottom bivalve aquaculture provides significant potential for production growth when moved into more energetic marine waters hence research industry and politics are currently proposing the development of new offshore sites the highly energetic conditions at these sites present a challenging environment for bivalve aquaculture in this work physical experiments of suspended bivalves provide new knowledge on the commonly used design parameters the drag and inertia coefficients live bivalves and manufactured surrogate models at a 1 1 scale were tested in a towing tank as well as under waves the drag coefficient of live blue mussels was determined to be cd 1 6 for reynolds numbers between 2 3

an all time high for large populations worldwide it is important that these sources can be produced locally henchion et al 2017 cultivated marine bivalves including oysters mussels and scallops to name a few can play an important role in this regard because all of these species may be farmed at an economically viable scale promotion of fish and seafood as healthy and nutritious food sources has resulted in increased demand for marine protein in developed countries hosomi et al 2012 as a whole the aquaculture industry is a fast growing food production sector with globally increasing growth rates of 5 8 between the years 2000 and 2016 fao 2020 in 2018 coastal aquaculture yielded 30 7 million tons of food fish production with a share of 17 3 million tons of shelled mollusc constituting 56 of the combined production of marine and coastal aquaculture fao 2020 in addition replacement scenarios of red meat with aquaculture proteins have the potential to reduce terrestrial land use and this in turn allows to cut greenhouse gas emissions through afforestation röös et al 2017 as the majority of wild fisheries stocks are being fully exploited some unsustainably aquaculture as an industry is presently growing to meet the increasing demand for seafood fao 2020 to this end policy makers industry officials and researchers are advocating a move to offshore locations despite the higher energetic exposure to waves and currents globally over 1 500 000 km2 could potentially be developed for marine bivalve aquaculture according to gentry et al 2017 based on the relative productivity

rough cylinders as a model to assume a representative dropper line for theoretical research regarding the hydrodynamic implications of offshore mussel farms under current only conditions this author concluded that the use of drag coefficients obtained in laboratory tow tests at constant velocities is not appropriate for wave force calculations stevens et al 2008 provided a detailed description of the physics of shellfish aquaculture systems regarding the effect of the flow on the farm and the movement of the farm s components in the absence of experimentally derived values these authors proposed the use of hydrodynamic coefficients similar to rough cylinders they concluded that further research within this highly interdisciplinary topic needs to be conducted in a multi scale approach e g as feeding and spat retention take place in an individual scale while load dynamics need to be conducted for parts of the system or the system as a whole towing tests have been carried out with a focus on the determination of the effect of in and exhalent mussel jets where a drag coefficient was determined for an artificially re constructed mussel dropper plew et al 2009 a work by shi et al 2011 concentrated on a three dimensional model modified by including two types of drag to study the dynamic coupling between physical and biological processes of an area used for suspended aquaculture the authors showed the vertical structure of currents in a suspended aquaculture site and determined the structure caused a 40 reduction in average flow speed hildebrandt et al 2018 showed in physical model tests that the tested mussel specimens can be assumed to have ultra rough surfaces a recent work by xu et al 2020 describes a computational fluid dynamics approach to obtaining the drag of mussel dropper lines under a tidal current observational studies in aquaculture farms with a focus on the hydrodynamics stresses motion of whole farms of mussel longlines as well as growth behaviour and stock density of the bivalves in exposed environments are also available gagnon and bergeron 2011 díaz et al 2011 garen et al 2004 drapeau et al 2006 plew et al 2005 gagnon and bergeron 2017 showed that the tension in and acceleration of submerged mussel longline farms is significantly smaller compared to surface systems stevens et al 2007 identified tidal loading as a main contributor to the overall force acting on a surface longline farm and assumed that oscillating wave forces contribute significantly a number of aquaculture systems were investigated with respect to their loading conditions in marine currents gagnon and bergeron 2017 zhu et al 2020 konstantinou and kombiadou 2020 liu and huguenard 2020 xu and dong 2018 and oceanic waves hildebrandt et al 2018 heasman et al 2021 landmann et al 2019 lin et al 2016 o donncha et al 2013 reid et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 however research regarding the inertia coefficients c m of mussel dropper lines is particularly scarce thus contrary to the mainly observational and numerical approaches presented above this study focuses on the hydrodynamic loads on mussel dropper lines under laboratory conditions in order to gain a better understanding of the processes around mussel dropper lines a closer look at the available literature reveals that the following aspects of marine loading on shellfish grown rope are not sufficiently understood or substantially covered in the scientific literature commonly force coefficients of mussel droppers are inferred from limited towing tests plew et al 2009 hildebrandt et al 2018 or in few cases by using observational data from farms gagnon and bergeron 2017 yet then no control over the wave conditions exists in other cases laboratory data is obtained through small or mid scale experiments landmann et al 2021 lin et al 2016 however there is no clear guidance as to how the complex surface of mussel droppers should be modelled comparisons between mussel droppers with live animals and their simplified surrogates used in experimental or modelling studies landmann et al 2019 have not been conducted in realistic hydrodynamic conditions it remains unclear to date how appropriate surrogate droppers are with respect to the forces exerted on them determination of the inertia coefficient of mussel dropper lines or their surrogates through physical or numerical experiments has not been conducted for oscillatory flow regimes as summarized by gagnon 2019 are the hydrodynamic coefficients of mussel suspensions in waves unknown this is the most important gap of knowledge for the further development of open ocean aquaculture because the additional peak loads generated by waves can be more than an order of magnitude larger than the current induced forces landmann et al 2021 based on the above identified shortcomings in understanding of the complex flow problem evolving where currents and waves interact with shellfish grown rope a comprehensive experimental program has been devised live blue mussels mytilus edulis as well as potentially scalable substitute surrogate models are tested the surrogate models were created based on 3d scans and the abbott firestone curve as a surface descriptor is tested and analysed carriage based steady flow experiments along the length of a flume with different velocities as well as oscillating wave tests were conducted to determine the forces acting on the dropper lines and identify drag and inertia coefficients the specific objectives of these tests were to separate the complex interdependent loads a mussel dropper is subjected to an open ocean environments and gain insight into the hydrodynamics based on comprehensive tests under laboratory conditions to evaluate and assess drag c d and inertia c m coefficients of live and surrogate dropper lines under steady as well as oscillatory flow conditions including surface gravity waves to report for the first time inertia coefficients for a range of live and surrogate dropper lines in order to facilitate offshore design of aquaculture technology to discuss the appropriateness of the influential parameters i e the characteristic diameter and shape of the dropper lines the suitability of the created surrogates as well as the parameter ranges tested i e kc number and re numbers and the implications for further research 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup in order to better understand the complex loading of mussel dropper lines exposed to oceanic conditions a comprehensive set of experiments with live mussel dropper lines as well as surrogate bodies was carried out at the wave and towing tank schneiderberg wks of the ludwig franzius institute for hydraulic estuarine and coastal engineering of the leibniz universität hannover germany the wks is 110 m long 2 2 m wide and 2 0 m deep its walls and bottom are made of cement plaster and smooth floating screed respectively the electronically driven machine shaft 46 kw with a maximum stroke of 0 9 m can generate maximum regular wave heights of 0 5 m for wave periods of 2 7 s the maximum speed of the wave board is 1 62 m s and the maximal acceleration is 2 88 m s2 the opposite end has a wave absorbing beach wedge made of coarse gravel at a slope of 1 10 the water depth was set to a constant 0 93 m during testing the test location within the wave flume was positioned at a distance of about 60 0 65 0 m from the wave maker where an observational window is located a top and side view of the wks is presented in fig 2 for the tests three 1 0 1 5 m long dropper line specimens blue mussels originate from a farm in the kiel fjord at the baltic coast as well as three different mussel surrogates with a length of 1 00 m were selected the collector rope with live mussels see fig 3 lm were used to derive surrogate specimen and the derivation process included sophisticated laser scanning data modelling and curation as well as laser supported 3d printing fabrication the geometric and material features of the live and surrogate mussel dropper lines used in this work are depicted in a side by side arrangement in fig 3 a more detailed description of procurement of the live mussels the scanned mussel dropper lines in general as well as the surrogate models including their creation is available landmann et al 2019 the surrogates were created based on the aforementioned 3d scanning and the derivation process used the abbott firestone approach abbott and firestone 1933 for live to surrogate model conversion as well as statistical mean value analysis three types of surrogates were proposed for the geometrically similar modelling the first surrogate is based on the average shell of the originally tested live mussels see fig 3 sm1 to that end the length volume weight and width of a representative number of sample blue mussel shells were taken and a digital average representation of blue mussel shells was developed with computer aided design the average model of the blue mussel shells was then arranged around a core cylinder depicting a rope in size diameter by varying each shell s rotation randomly the mean weight per unit length was chosen as a metric and to match the surrogates overall geometry with varying angles as compared to the live blue mussels the second surrogate as shown in fig 3 sm2 is based off a laser scanning 3d point cloud of a section of the scanned live mussels which represents the closest fit to the weighted arithmetic average material distribution the triangulated section estimated the facets not covered by the 3d scan due to a blocked field of view the third surrogate see fig 3 sm3 based on the characteristic abbott firestone curve uses a reproduction of the weighted arithmetic average material distribution as well but condenses the average material distribution into a simplified geometry this was achieved by choosing a slender cylinder with 10 leave shaped outcrops and is proposed here as a more simple potentially easier to build and scale surrogate providing a novel geometric approach to future testing the three different surrogates have been proposed in order to better understand their feedback of the different surface features with respect to uniform and oscillatory flows and their effect on drag and inertia coefficients for the towing as well as the wave tests the mussel and surrogate dropper lines were attached to a towing carriage shown in fig 2 the test setup consisting of an installation frame and various measurement equipment was rigidly attached to the carriage any potential deflections upon current or wave loading onto the long cantilever arm were avoided by using non distensible wire running from the bottom of the installation frame to the top of the carriage the vertically oriented installation frame height x width 1 00 m 0 80 m was designed for the rigid fastening of the dropper lines through clamps with an interlocking grid at the top and bottom the surrogates were attached to the wire using a grub screw preventing translational as well as rotational movement 2 2 instrumentation resulting forces were recorded for the whole holding frame using a six axis force transducer k6d110 me meßsysteme gmbh henningsdorf germany attached to the towing carriage the velocity of the towing carriage was recorded during each run using an incremental rotary encoder dbv50e 22eka0020 sick vertriebs gmbh düsseldorf germany with a resolution of 12 5 pulses mm and an accuracy of 4 mm m the time history of the water surface elevation was recorded using two ultra sonic sensors with the corresponding controller uls 40 d uss 20130 general acoustics kiel germany the accuracy of the sensors is given with 0 36 mm the sensors were recorded using an industry grade data acquisition system set to a sampling rate of 100 hz in addition cameras were used to record each test visually at frame rate of 30 frames s fig 4 shows a photograph of the complete instrumentational set up a more detailed description of the setup used in this work is presented in landmann et al 2019 2 3 experimental procedures and test program two groups of tests were conducted to obtain drag and inertia coefficients for the different samples that were the focus of this work 1 towing and 2 wave tests the individual recordings of each towing test started while the carriage with installation frame and dropper line was at rest to provide a zero load reference for each run in addition the installation frame was also towed along the flume axis without specimen installed in order to obtain forces of the installation frame only these forces were later subtracted from the measurements of the tested dropper lines towing tests were conducted at velocities of u 1 0 25 m s u 2 0 50 m s u 3 0 75 m s and u 4 1 00 m s the towing velocities were recorded during each run by transforming the rotational speed data obtained from the incremental rotary encoder into an equivalent forward speed each dropper line was submerged over a wetted length of l wet 0 80 m measured while the installation frame was at rest the fastening clamps at both ends which were securely tightened created the vertical tension inside the dropper lines this ensured an equal flow velocity along the whole length of the dropper line during the towing tests each test was conducted up to three times for testing repeatability and overall 72 towing tests were conducted secondly the wave tests were conducted in front of the observational window installed in one sidewall of the flume where the towing carriage was rigidly fastened the wave heights tested were h 1 0 10 m h 2 0 12 m and h 3 0 15 m with wave periods of t 1 1 20 s t 2 1 65 s and t 3 2 40 s each test was conducted up to three times for testing repeatability and 72 wave tests were conducted in total again in order to obtain the forces acting only on the dropper lines the installation frame was tested without the dropper lines in zero tests for later subtraction of these forces the overall test parameters in aggregate form are listed in table 1 3 theoretical background and data processing for the analysis of the responses of offshore structures to oceanic waves the forces acting on slender bodies are most commonly estimated using the morison approach morison et al 1950 this allows the calculation of forces on slender bodies fixed in waves or bodies oscillating in still water or waves dnv 2010a the morison equation provides an efficient approach for the calculation of arbitrary complex structures while the cd and cm coefficients take into account vortex shedding effects non static effects as well as the surface roughness of the structure thus complex flow problems can be solved assuming that the dropper lines that were tested could be at first order approximated as a rigid slender cylinder the quantification of the drag and inertia coefficient for the different dropper lines through dedicated force and velocity measurements is possible this assumption is based on the accepted use of hydrodynamic coefficients in aquaculture research wolfram and naghipour 1999 plew 2005 stevens et al 2008 plew et al 2009 gagnon 2019 and industry projects the determination can be based on the morison equation eq 1 f 1 2 ρ c d u 2 a ρ c m v u where f is the total horizontal force ρ 1000 k g m ³ is the density of the fresh water in the flume c d is the drag coefficient u is the horizontal particle velocity a l w e t d c h a r is the referential front face area composed of the wetted length of tested structure l w e t and the characteristic diameter d c h a r c m is the inertia coefficient v is the volume of the structure and u is the flow particle acceleration the wetted length l w e t 0 80 m was kept constant for all tested dropper lines the first term of equation 1 corresponds to the drag forces acting on the dropper line while the second term describes the inertia forces contributed by the flow acceleration through wave motion for the drag tests in steady state flow conditions the equation simplifies to the first term only as no acceleration occurs it then reads eq 2 f d 1 2 ρ c d u 2 a where f d is depicting the drag force acting on the dropper lines more specifically in this work the drag coefficient c d can be also written as eq 3 c d 2 f d ρ u 2 a the drag coefficient is related to the reynolds number reynolds 1883 r e expressed by eq 4 r e u d c h a r ν where u is the velocity of the current or the towing carriage d c h a r is a characteristic diameter of the observed body and ν depicts the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the characteristic diameter chosen using the morison equation the flow parameters and the observed structure s geometry are essential the flow parameters are the horizontal velocity u and horizontal acceleration u which are determined according to stokes 2nd order wave theory an exact determination of the structural parameters is however not straightforward mussel dropper lines are highly irregular 3d objects of which the referential area a and the referential volume v are hard to quantify cavities crevasses and protrusion of individual mussel species into the water column make the frontal area which is blocked for the flow a matter of discussion for the utilization of the morison equation the irregular shape of the dropper lines is approximated by a cylinder with a wetted length l w e t and the characteristic diameter d c h a r the quantity l w e t is determined as the submerged depth beneath the still water line plus the water surface elevation the characteristic diameter d c h a r diverges over the length of the dropper and as said is challenging to estimate for the results presented in this study a 3d scan of the live mussel dropper lines and a subsequent determination of the width at regular intervals along the length yielded an average characteristic diameter the average diameters of the surrogates were determined based on the 3d models landmann et al 2019 if the number of individual measurements d i is large enough the projected area can be determined and divided by number of measurements n this provides a close approximation of the characteristic diameter that is d c h a r 1 n i 1 n d i the determined characteristic diameter of the live mussels is d c h a r l m 10 3 cm and for the surrogates d c h a r s m 1 10 3 cm d c h a r s m 2 12 1 cm and d c h a r s m 3 13 6 cm under realistic offshore conditions currents could deflect the dropper lines with respect to the earth vector of gravity depending on the mass of the mussels and the velocity of the current to account for these effects the morison equation can been adapted to include the yaw angle of the dropper lines however the yawing of the dropper lines is a load evasion mechanism in their original position hanging vertically suspended from the backbone the dropper lines have the largest referential area with the introduction of a current the dropper lines are yawed reducing the referential area and the possible force acting on the aquaculture system in this study the authors opted for an engineering approach focusing on save hydrodynamic coefficients i e higher forces on the dropper lines 3 1 steady flow experiments for the pre processing of the steady state towing experiment group the data sets were first cleaned of frequency components associated with carriage motions and signal noise via a fast fourier transformation next a fourth order low pass butterworth filter with a cut off frequency of 3 hz was applied to the data of the force transducer for the analysis a starting point was set for each towing run when the velocity of the towing carriage has finished the acceleration phase i e the turning point at the transition from increasing to constant velocity is determined an end point was set to be when the velocity starts to decrease again from the set velocity the forces of the installation frame herein called zero tests were subtracted from the measurements with the dropper lines to isolate the force contribution of the dropper lines to that end equation 2 was solved for the zero tests and the c d coefficients for varying reynolds numbers were obtained a linear function was fitted through the data points which shows that the drag coefficient of the holding frame is within a range of c d 1 72 to 1 77 for reynolds numbers of 1 0 10 4 to 1 3 10 5 the function of the c d coefficients was used to solve equation for all unknown values of the reduction force based on the measured velocity of the towing tests with the dropper lines this way the quadratic influence of the velocity on the force is accounted for and the influence of the holding frame on the forces acting on the mussel dropper lines was removed by this procedure the c d coefficients of the dropper lines were determined by excluding the effects of the surrounding test equipment the unfiltered and filtered time series of the force in x direction and the towing velocity for a test run with an approximated speed of 1 0 m s are shown in fig 5 the actual forces i e the c d dependent force without the influence of the frame is also shown 3 2 oscillatory flow experiments equation 1 was solved with the drag and inertia coefficients as unknowns as velocity and acceleration of the water particles fluctuate under the orbital motion of the waves a common approach to solve for the unknown force coefficients is the least squares method wolfram and naghipour 1999 hildebrandt et al 2009 which was also used in this work it compares the theoretically determined and the measured forces and then optimizes for the errors between those by using the least square method iteratively the theoretical force is calculated based on the water elevation determined by the appropriate wave theory which has been determined based on an analysis of the waves shown in table 1 the data of the wave tests were analysed via a fast fourier transformation and a fourth order low pass butterworth filter with a cut off frequency of 3 hz to eliminate frequency components associated with signal noise starting and endpoints of the data records were set by identifying the target wave height after ramp up of the wave maker each wave between these points is identified individually via zero downcrossing dean and dalrymple 1991 and the wave height period and length were determined the influence of the installation frame on the force measurements was taken into account by subtracting zero test forces frame only from the forces measured when testing the actual specimen for the theoretical force the appropriate wave theory was determined by comparing the measured water elevation for all waves in the experimental program stokes 2nd order theory according to the le méhauté diagram le méhauté 1976 were found to be a good approximation subsequently the horizontal velocity u t d and horizontal acceleration u t d of the water particles were calculated for each time step and over the depth of the water column the resulting parameters were used to determine the theoretical forces for the wetted length of the dropper line according to the morison equation morison et al 1950 with varying c d and c m between 0 01 and 6 0 thus the theoretical horizontal loading on the dropper lines could be estimated as a function of the drag and inertia coefficients and the smallest mathematical error between the measured and theoretical value was used as an approximation of c d and c m the keulegan carpenter number k c is used as a reference as it captures the variation in the measured drag and inertia coefficients introduced by keulegan and carpenter 1934 k c is denoted as eq 5 k c u a t d c h a r where u a is the maximum horizontal component of the orbital velocity of a wave at the water s surface t is the wave period and d c h a r is the characteristic diameter of the observed body fig 6 shows the water elevation of a measurement with a wave height of 0 10 m and a wave period of 1 2 s the observed time series as well as all interpolated zero crossings are highlighted furthermore all resulting single waves and the corresponding forces are displayed with an indication of the theoretical wave height according to stokes 2nd order wave theory 4 results and discussion 4 1 steady flow experiments in the experiments reported herein reynolds numbers ranged between r e 2 3 10 4 and r e 1 4 10 5 this covers the sub critical flow regime under steady currents and corresponds to the current velocities expected in marine environments the overall results regarding the steady flow experiments are shown as a scatter plot cp fig 7 the drag coefficients are plotted as a function of the corresponding reynolds numbers horizontal lines indicate the overall median values for all corresponding tests for both live mussels and the tested surrogate models as can be seen the median drag coefficients of the live mussel dropper lines is c d l m 1 6 the drag coefficients of the three surrogates were generally lower than the live mussel results with median values of c d s m 1 0 9 for the first c d s m 2 1 0 for the second and c d s m 3 0 8 for the third surrogate type the data points of each test are shown in grey scale and the median values of each test are depicted as colored cross symbols the statistical median value was chosen as a descriptor as it is robust against outliers outliers present in the data contribute to the large spreading as mentioned before the force contribution of the test frame was separated from the force contribution of the mussel dropper lines via a cd dependent mathematical adjustment of the measured forces with the subtraction of the zero test forces the measured load level was reduced and this in combination with vibrations in the velocity measurements from the rotary encoder leads to the outlying low drag values especially for lower reynolds numbers fig 8 exemplary shows the cumulative distribution function of the drag coefficient of a single test at 0 25 m s as well as a boxplot of the same data set it is shown that most data points are scattered around the unifying median value indicated again through a colored cross at c d 1 6 the outliers characterized by a steep increase or decrease account in the cumulative density function for less than 3 of all data points these outliers are shown in red in the boxplot the standard deviation of the median drag values as a measure of the square root of the variance is σ l m 0 65 and for the surrogates σ s m 1 0 71 σ s m 2 0 30 and σ s m 3 0 29 the large standard deviation for sm1 is due to the scattering at low reynolds numbers and the mentioned vibrations of the test carriage the use of three different lengths of dropper lines during testing explains the larger variance of the live mussels in comparison to the surrogates these live dropper lines varied in diameter and mass and exhibited natural variations in mussel density and marine growth i e soft growth like algae anemones or sponges and secondary seeding the inclusion of them in one dataset increases the amount of data available and the confidence in the results while slightly aggregating the variance for reynolds numbers larger than r e 6 5 10 4 a clustering of the drag coefficients is apparent as the mussel shells and the edges of the surrogate bodies promote flow separation this behaviour has been observed in the comparison of smooth and highly rough cylinders where rough cylinders show near constant drag coefficients while the drag coefficients of smooth cylinders change significantly with reynolds numbers allen et al 2001 this is why constant values were used as an indication of the drag coefficient less outliers or conversely closely scattered data points coincide with the increasing velocity the relative error of the drag coefficients is largest where towing velocities are lowest i e when the measured force is lowest these current velocities around 0 1 m s to 0 2 m s are potentially influenced by the quality of the force measurements compared to realistic oceanic conditions the range of small towing velocities is not as relevant for the design of marine aquaculture farms as the higher flow velocities yet for the sake of completeness are still reported here heasman et al 1998 in regard to investigations pertaining to limiting biological factors e g seston concentration and initial mussel growth rosland et al 2011 number of mussels in a cluster including attachment properties brenner and buck 2010 as well as hitchhiker fouling organisms on the mussel shell telesca et al 2018 further investigations for even smaller reynolds numbers might be required this will remain an activity for future research 4 2 oscillatory flow experiments an objective of these tests was to determine the hydrodynamic parameters under waves with measured velocities and characteristic diameters based on the average diameter keulegan carpenter numbers ranged from k c 1 9 to k c 8 8 for small k c numbers results from steady state flow experiments for the drag coefficient are not comparable to the results of the wave tests as the flow regime around marine cylinders is strongly inertia dominated denny 1995 drag coefficients become comparable when k c numbers roughly larger than 30 are considered sumer and fredsoe 2006 therefore the use of separate coefficients for steady and oscillatory flow is recommended nath 1987 wolfram and naghipour 1999 sarpkaya 1987 fig 8 provides an overview of the calculated drag and inertia coefficients based on the live dropper lines and the surrogate dropper lines these are given as a function of the kc number along with the individual data as well as median values the approximated median drag and inertia coefficients for the live mussels are c d l m 2 3 and c m l m 2 1 for the surrogates the hydrodynamic coefficients are c d s m 1 2 4 c d s m 2 2 8 and c d s m 3 4 4 and c m s m 1 2 3 c m s m 2 2 9 and c m s m 3 4 9 the mathematically best solution determined by the least square optimization is strongly dependent on the inertia coefficient and less dependent on the drag coefficient this results in explicit solutions for the inertia coefficient while the solutions for the drag coefficient are prone to larger scattering the mathematically lowest error was determined as correct a weighted least square approximation of the morison equation might provide more explicit results regarding the drag coefficient but is not necessary for the small kc numbers covered in this study due to the inertia dependence a possible source of uncertainties in the determination of the inertia coefficient is the oscillatory movement of the dropper line under the waves as well as the movement of the live mussels themselves in the study at hand rigid fastening as well as the short length of the dropper line prevents any major deflection which permits the use of the morison equation however for tests on a larger scale a deflection of the dropper like can be expected and needs to be considered similarly the individual motion of live mussels will take a stronger effect on a larger scale the similarity in the results between the rigid surrogates and the more flexible live mussels shows that the influence of movable mussels can be neglected for this setup 4 3 characteristics of developed surrogates one of the objectives of this work was to better understand how well live mussel specimen can be modelled hydro dynamically by developing geometrically similar surrogate models by comparing the steady state and oscillatory based drag and inertia coefficients a better understanding of the characteristics of the surrogates can be gained results show that the hydrodynamic coefficients of the surrogate bodies differ from those of the live mussel dropper lines specifically the results regarding the drag coefficients of the surrogates for steady state flow experiments are 77 8 60 0 and 100 0 lower for surrogate 1 2 and 3 than the results of the live mussels respectively for oscillatory flow experiments the results are 4 3 21 7 and 91 3 higher respectively the inertia coefficients of the surrogates exceed the results of the live mussels by 9 5 38 1 and 133 3 respectively given the ranges of drag and inertia coefficients surrogate 1 sm1 is proposed as the most similar and hydrodynamically suitable surrogate model of the live blue mussel dropper lines the reasons for this are given below one reason for why such large differences were observed is due to the natural properties of the tested live mussels dropper lines consist of hard growth composed of multiple mussels of varying size but similar shape live mussel are moreover very often overgrown with soft growth that is tissue of e g various algae species atalah et al 2016 more specifically the soft growth comprises varying species of algae anemones and sponges and varies strongly depending on environmental conditions such as water depth temperature salinity predation as well as competition and availability of food and space wolfram and theophanatos 1985 joschko et al 2008 this soft growth likely has a large influence on the boundary layer development and was not recreated during the modelling of the surrogates which were made of smooth 3d printing material the live dropper lines which were taken from in situ cultures had considerable soft growth as can be seen in fig 3 lm mussels i e the hard growth form the main component of the dropper lines and are strongly affected to change as the mussels mature the surface roughness increases as the outcropping mussels grow to a harvestable size simultaneously the drag coefficient increases with the surface roughness and thus drag loads on the structure become more influential this is another reason for the differences between the live mussels and the surrogates as only a macroscopic roughness was incorporated in the models e g the individual growth stages of single mussels were not considered surrogate 1 was based on clean smooth average mussels surrogate 2 and 3 instead were based on the weighted arithmetic average material distribution where unrepresentative peaks and valleys were filtered out resulting in a smoother surface therefore with soft growth and natural variations the surface roughness of the live mussel dropper lines was higher compared to the surrogate models the increased roughness affects various aspects of the flow around the mussel dropper lines such as hydrodynamic instabilities i e vortex shedding the interaction of vortices the separation angle the turbulence level as well as the vortex strength hildebrandt et al 2009 obasaju et al 1988 chakrabarti et al 2016 therefore it can be assumed that the increased drag of the live mussels in the steady state experiments is due to an increase in dropper diameter caused by the additional soft growth and a larger roughness this is supported by the results of wolfram and theophanatos 1990 regarding the effects of marine growth on cylinders as well as more recent numerical studies by xu et al 2020 the lowest deviation from surrogate 2 where soft growth was incorporated by the 3d scanning further supports this assumption another reason for the variances are the obvious differences in shapes between live mussels and surrogates fig 9 depicts the single elements of each surrogate used to construct the dropper lines while the mussel shells or mussel like outcrops of surrogate 1 and 2 provide sharp edges which promote flow separation has surrogate 3 a rather rectangular referential area it can be assumed that this promotes the forming of a large wake for the wave tests the results regarding the drag and inertia coefficient are more consistent the inertia dominance in the oscillating flow regime is surely a reason for a far better fit while the above observations pertaining to drag coefficients in steady state conditions mostly still apply concluding we hypothesize that the differences regarding the hydrodynamic coefficients between the live mussels and surrogates are mostly due to natural growth on the live mussels as well as and variations in surface roughness flow regimes and referential frontal areas while current only conditions are not adequately reproduced a satisfactory representation of the live mussel dropper lines considering wave conditions is found as said before surrogate 1 sm1 seems closest to represent the characteristics found surrogate 3 sm3 is dismissed as it differed strongly under oscillatory test conditions as well as surrogate 2 sm which is rejected due to its complex shape which is too specific for a generic surrogate approach 4 4 influence of the characteristic diameter the characteristic diameter chosen for the determination of the drag and inertia coefficients in this study is challenging to estimate as mussel dropper lines are natural structures with uneven growth cavities crevasses and protrusions to provide a better understanding of the importance of the chosen characteristic diameter alternative approaches used in literature are compared to the average diameter used in this study see fig 11 one alternative approach to express the frontal area is based on the non dimensional surface roughness δ k d 0 of long slender cylinders dnv 2010b using a spatial organization model introduced by gagnon 2019 this approach uses the packing geometry of mussel shells around a dropper line and estimates the roughness height k as k 0 5 l m r s r p 2 r p with l m being the mean mussel length r s the distance between the axis of the dropper line and the center of the modelled mussel and r p the radius of the polygon on which the model is based following the spatial organization model allows to solve for an average mussel length of 4 7 cm and smooth cylinder diameters d 0 on the basis of the abbot firestone curve provided by landmann et al 2019 the resulting roughness height is 2 63 cm which results in a characteristic diameters of d c h a r l m 8 6 cm for the live mussels and d c h a r s m 1 7 3 cm d c h a r s m 2 8 6 cm and d c h a r s m 3 8 9 cm for the surrogates another approach for the determination of the frontal area in a laboratory is based on the displaced volume plew 2005 the characteristic diameter can be determined as d c h a r 4 v π l with v being the displaced volume and l w the wetted length of the dropper line the displaced volume was determined by submerging the mussels into a cylinder filled with water with a radius of 39 0 cm and measuring the water level rise for the live mussels with a volume of 0 013 m³ a characteristic diameter of d c h a r l m 9 2 cm was determined for the surrogates characteristic diameters of d c h a r s m 1 7 3 cm d c h a r s m 2 7 2 cm and d c h a r s m 3 7 4 cm were determined as all surrogates are porous the characteristic diameters obtained are smaller in comparison to the other methods however these approaches are not easily applicable for measurements in the field plew et al 2009 suggested defining the characteristic diameter as d c h a r 2 x l m u s s e l with l m u s s e l as the average mussel length this method can easily be applied and compared to visual inspections on site the accuracy of this estimation is however prone to errors regarding natural variations of the dropper lines and different cultivated species for this approach the average mussel length was determined as 4 7 cm and a characteristic diameter of 9 4 cm is assumed for live mussels and surrogates the authors recommend the use of 3d scans and the average diameter for experiments under laboratory conditions as the most explicit representation of the characteristic diameter can be achieved the characteristic diameters calculated according to the above mentioned approaches are displayed in table 2 given the above derived characteristic diameters of the live and surrogate dropper lines a new determination of the drag and inertia coefficients can be conducted the resulting differences in the drag and inertia coefficients are shown for the oscillating flow conditions for the live mussels only and displayed in fig 10 a comparison to the suggested surrogate sm1 is possible via the indicated horizontal lines representing the results as seen above the resulting drag and inertia coefficients are grouped for each tested set of waves to display changes induced by rising kc numbers it can be seen that small differences in the characteristic diameter lead to comparatively large changes regarding the resulting hydrodynamic coefficients this effect seems to increase with rising k c number a decrease of 8 7 in characteristic diameter i e the difference between the average diameter and the multiple of the mussel length results in an increase of the drag coefficient from 1 8 to 2 2 or 18 the inertia coefficient rises from 1 95 to 2 3 this strong sensitivity of the hydrodynamic coefficients concerning the characteristic diameter can be confirmed for all results while the change in loads due to varying diameters is not accounted for highlights this the importance of a sensible choice regarding the characteristic diameter used for the calculation of forces in the morison equation the best agreement of the sm1 can be seen for the average diameter as for rising kc numbers the other methods increase drastically the authors assume that the aforementioned influence of the soft growth and the high roughness lead to a larger characteristic diameter than suggested by the methods currently employed further tests with the aim of creating a referential cylinder are advised said cylinder would vary for the surrogate and the live mussels as the soft growth greatly influences the results however the referential cylinder could be used as an easy to implement body in numerical studies the diameter of the referential cylinder will be larger than the characteristic diameter of the mussel dropper lines as the increase in drag through soft and hard growth needs to be compensated in the absence of this data we recommend using the average diameters for the design of mussel dropper lines or longline farms 4 5 comparison to existing studies the results of the live mussels that were tested experimentally are compared and discussed in the light of other published studies this discussion only references the data regarding drag coefficients as mentioned in a review by gagnon 2019 inertia coefficients of mussel dropper lines have not been experimentally determined before only now these have become available through the work reported herein in numerical studies the dropper lines are modelled as cylinders of varying diameter to which the morison equation is applied and drag coefficients have been assumed as c d 1 5 raman nair and colbourne 2003 or c d 1 2 raman nair et al 2008 the authors stress the necessity of physical experiments or field tests to obtain realistic values as no basis for their assumptions is given a more recent investigation assumes c d 1 1 1 7 as realistic values for the modelling of submerged shellfish longlines knysh et al 2020 based on a literature research their numerical model of a longline aquaculture system showed little sensitivity to the exact choice of drag coefficients regarding the predictions for mooring line tensions and longline dynamics detailing the overall physics of offshore shellfish aquaculture stevens et al 2008 suggest values of c d 1 5 linked to research regarding ultra rough cylinders xu et al 2020 assumed the drag coefficient of mussel dropper lines to range from c d 1 1 to 1 2 based on a computational fluid dynamics approach through a 3d large eddy simulation none of the assumptions mentioned above are based on validated physical experiments and should be considered as an estimate while results regarding drag and inertia coefficients of cylinders with varying roughnesses are readily available are results for physical experiments scarce in a study regarding the hydrodynamic implications of offshore shellfish systems a provisional drag coefficient was determined using towing tank tests on a length of dropper line plew et al 2005 the characteristic diameter was based on the multiple of the mussel length as described above and resulted in a characteristic diameter of 0 16 m a resulting drag coefficient of c d 0 89 was determined in a later investigation a drag coefficient of c d 1 27 was determined through physical model experiments plew et al 2009 a possible weakness is the used test setup where mussel shells p canalicus were glued onto 10 mm polythene hoses to imitate dropper lines and no comparison to live like conditions is given gagnon and bergeron 2011 report on tests conducted with four 4 m long dropper lines where a drag coefficient of c d 1 25 was determined the dropper lines were cut by divers and dragged behind a boat where a load cell was located the influence of waves and current was not included in the results which affects the outcome the results of all mentioned studies are summarized in table 3 with reynolds numbers specified if possible the compiled data show that the available research regarding hydrodynamic coefficients is mainly based on theoretic considerations and numerical approaches without validation furthermore the studies regarding physical experiments are of varying quality as either the dropper lines or laboratory conditions are improvable however precise physical experiments are necessary to accurately predict the forces acting on aquaculture systems in the open ocean during the design stage the hydrodynamic coefficients determined in this study supplement the currently available data give a more reliable estimation and extend the available hydrodynamic parameters with the inclusion of physical model tests in oscillating flow regimes 5 conclusions this work is related to the design and testing of new marine aquaculture concepts during the planning and assessment of marine aquaculture projects there is a need to determine the forces acting on the structural components for efficient designs mussel laden dropper lines form the bulk of the mass and surface area of a longline mussel farm therefore comprehensive physical model tests were conducted to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients of live mussel dropper lines under laboratory conditions in the present study this enables planners and researchers alike to quantify the influence and impact of a single dropper line and assess their combined effect in a farm the main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows drag tests with mussel dropper lines were conducted in a wave flume at varying velocities based on the results a drag coefficient of c d 1 6 is recommended for currents with subcritical flow regimes r e 10 5 and blue mussels mytilus edulis similarly the mussel dropper lines were subjected to waves and a drag coefficient of c d 2 3 and an inertia coefficient of c m 2 1 are proposed for k c 10 further tests with other commonly cultivated species e g green lipped mussels perna canaliculus are suggested to obtain species specific hydrodynamic parameters additional investigations on the hydrodynamic coefficients for large r e and k c numbers are of special interest for the envisaged remote offshore aquaculture sites simultaneously tests with three surrogate models were carried out and their drag and inertia coefficients under steady and oscillatory flow were quantified the aim was to obtain a simplified model which can be used in both physical and numerical experiments without the need for keeping mussels alive or using geometrically divergent forms the performance of the surrogates deviated from the live mussels under steady current while the performance under oscillatory flow showed a good fit surrogate 1 based on the average shell of the originally tested blue mussels was chosen for further testing as it showed the best fit likewise to the live mussels investigations of the surrogates with increasing r e and k c numbers are planned for future research this study shows that the choice of the characteristic diameter has a large influence on the hydrodynamic coefficients and the findings suggest a larger characteristic diameter then former studies a comparison to published studies reveals that experimental research regarding the hydrodynamic coefficients of mussel dropper lines is scarce since most studies focus on drag in steady flow this study provides estimated inertia coefficients of mussel dropper lines and surrogates based on wave tests future testing of the proposed sm1 should include investigations regarding the scaling potential of the surrogate body to enable further physical investigations of whole shellfish longline systems with increased accuracy as well as larger scale experiments to deepen the understanding regarding larger ranges of r e and k c the specific influence of the soft growth and surface roughness on the hydrodynamic parameters of mussel dropper lines was not scope of this study but is subject to ongoing and future studies applying the obtained knowledge to future research this study provides a basis for the design and evaluation of novel offshore bivalve aquaculture the insights gathered in this study facilitate the testing procedure for aquaculture systems and provide robust estimates for numerical approaches this information can be used in the development of novel marine aquaculture systems in the light of the increasing demand for marine protein credit authorship

20481,against the background of a drastically increased demand of marine proteins off bottom bivalve aquaculture provides significant potential for production growth when moved into more energetic marine waters hence research industry and politics are currently proposing the development of new offshore sites the highly energetic conditions at these sites present a challenging environment for bivalve aquaculture in this work physical experiments of suspended bivalves provide new knowledge on the commonly used design parameters the drag and inertia coefficients live bivalves and manufactured surrogate models at a 1 1 scale were tested in a towing tank as well as under waves the drag coefficient of live blue mussels was determined to be cd 1 6 for reynolds numbers between 2 3

an all time high for large populations worldwide it is important that these sources can be produced locally henchion et al 2017 cultivated marine bivalves including oysters mussels and scallops to name a few can play an important role in this regard because all of these species may be farmed at an economically viable scale promotion of fish and seafood as healthy and nutritious food sources has resulted in increased demand for marine protein in developed countries hosomi et al 2012 as a whole the aquaculture industry is a fast growing food production sector with globally increasing growth rates of 5 8 between the years 2000 and 2016 fao 2020 in 2018 coastal aquaculture yielded 30 7 million tons of food fish production with a share of 17 3 million tons of shelled mollusc constituting 56 of the combined production of marine and coastal aquaculture fao 2020 in addition replacement scenarios of red meat with aquaculture proteins have the potential to reduce terrestrial land use and this in turn allows to cut greenhouse gas emissions through afforestation röös et al 2017 as the majority of wild fisheries stocks are being fully exploited some unsustainably aquaculture as an industry is presently growing to meet the increasing demand for seafood fao 2020 to this end policy makers industry officials and researchers are advocating a move to offshore locations despite the higher energetic exposure to waves and currents globally over 1 500 000 km2 could potentially be developed for marine bivalve aquaculture according to gentry et al 2017 based on the relative productivity potential of ocean areas for marine aquaculture and site selection criteria e g temperature tolerance location specific growth potential and constraints such as allowable depth or other relevant environmental conditions to date longline farming systems are considered the most promising technology option for expanding into offshore environments as they have been shown to be the most resilient in high energy conditions buck and langan 2017 cheney et al 2010 buck 2007 these systems commonly consist of multiple rows of dropper lines hanging from a main horizontal line commonly called the backbone floats connected to the backbone provide buoyancy and station keeping is ensured via mooring lines the dropper lines consist of a polyester or polypropylene rope at the core to which the mussels attach via their byssus threads the bundled filaments secreted by bivalves a c fig 1 d shows a longline system with dropper lines its key system elements as well as the motions and forces acting on it when exposed to surface gravity and internal waves as well as tidal currents the interactions between waves currents and structures cp fig 1e e g cylinders are a commonly investigated research topic where the morison equation is used to determine the hydrodynamic loads on slender structures morison et al 1950 recently negro et al 2014 have noted the morison s equation may not be valid for cylindrical offshore wind energy foundations where waves are significantly disturbed and diffracted e g diameter of structure d 0 2 l with l being wave length when interacting with these structures for those cases where wave diffraction can be neglected different flow regimes around cylinders immersed into oceanic waters and the corresponding fluctuations of drag and inertia coefficients have been thoroughly investigated achenbach 1971 sarpkaya et al 1984 sarpkaya 1976 1990 nath 1987 bonakdar et al 2015 these studies focus on the influence of the roughness of cylinders which influences the boundary layer and vortex separation near the cylinder s circumference the difficulties to determine the hydrodynamic forces acting on irregular bodies has also been investigated by bagheri and bonadonna 2016 who introduced a general model for the prediction of drag coefficient of non spherical solid particles of regular and irregular shapes similarly loth 2008 investigated the drag of non spherical objects and discussed the aspect ratios surface area ratios as well as the flow separation and turbulent boundary layer conditions it has been shown that the morison equation is applicable for ultra rough cylinders wolfram and naghipour 1999 to which mussel dropper lines cp fig 1a c can be compared when they grow in suspended cultures plew 2005 used the assumption of ultra rough cylinders as a model to assume a representative dropper line for theoretical research regarding the hydrodynamic implications of offshore mussel farms under current only conditions this author concluded that the use of drag coefficients obtained in laboratory tow tests at constant velocities is not appropriate for wave force calculations stevens et al 2008 provided a detailed description of the physics of shellfish aquaculture systems regarding the effect of the flow on the farm and the movement of the farm s components in the absence of experimentally derived values these authors proposed the use of hydrodynamic coefficients similar to rough cylinders they concluded that further research within this highly interdisciplinary topic needs to be conducted in a multi scale approach e g as feeding and spat retention take place in an individual scale while load dynamics need to be conducted for parts of the system or the system as a whole towing tests have been carried out with a focus on the determination of the effect of in and exhalent mussel jets where a drag coefficient was determined for an artificially re constructed mussel dropper plew et al 2009 a work by shi et al 2011 concentrated on a three dimensional model modified by including two types of drag to study the dynamic coupling between physical and biological processes of an area used for suspended aquaculture the authors showed the vertical structure of currents in a suspended aquaculture site and determined the structure caused a 40 reduction in average flow speed hildebrandt et al 2018 showed in physical model tests that the tested mussel specimens can be assumed to have ultra rough surfaces a recent work by xu et al 2020 describes a computational fluid dynamics approach to obtaining the drag of mussel dropper lines under a tidal current observational studies in aquaculture farms with a focus on the hydrodynamics stresses motion of whole farms of mussel longlines as well as growth behaviour and stock density of the bivalves in exposed environments are also available gagnon and bergeron 2011 díaz et al 2011 garen et al 2004 drapeau et al 2006 plew et al 2005 gagnon and bergeron 2017 showed that the tension in and acceleration of submerged mussel longline farms is significantly smaller compared to surface systems stevens et al 2007 identified tidal loading as a main contributor to the overall force acting on a surface longline farm and assumed that oscillating wave forces contribute significantly a number of aquaculture systems were investigated with respect to their loading conditions in marine currents gagnon and bergeron 2017 zhu et al 2020 konstantinou and kombiadou 2020 liu and huguenard 2020 xu and dong 2018 and oceanic waves hildebrandt et al 2018 heasman et al 2021 landmann et al 2019 lin et al 2016 o donncha et al 2013 reid et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 however research regarding the inertia coefficients c m of mussel dropper lines is particularly scarce thus contrary to the mainly observational and numerical approaches presented above this study focuses on the hydrodynamic loads on mussel dropper lines under laboratory conditions in order to gain a better understanding of the processes around mussel dropper lines a closer look at the available literature reveals that the following aspects of marine loading on shellfish grown rope are not sufficiently understood or substantially covered in the scientific literature commonly force coefficients of mussel droppers are inferred from limited towing tests plew et al 2009 hildebrandt et al 2018 or in few cases by using observational data from farms gagnon and bergeron 2017 yet then no control over the wave conditions exists in other cases laboratory data is obtained through small or mid scale experiments landmann et al 2021 lin et al 2016 however there is no clear guidance as to how the complex surface of mussel droppers should be modelled comparisons between mussel droppers with live animals and their simplified surrogates used in experimental or modelling studies landmann et al 2019 have not been conducted in realistic hydrodynamic conditions it remains unclear to date how appropriate surrogate droppers are with respect to the forces exerted on them determination of the inertia coefficient of mussel dropper lines or their surrogates through physical or numerical experiments has not been conducted for oscillatory flow regimes as summarized by gagnon 2019 are the hydrodynamic coefficients of mussel suspensions in waves unknown this is the most important gap of knowledge for the further development of open ocean aquaculture because the additional peak loads generated by waves can be more than an order of magnitude larger than the current induced forces landmann et al 2021 based on the above identified shortcomings in understanding of the complex flow problem evolving where currents and waves interact with shellfish grown rope a comprehensive experimental program has been devised live blue mussels mytilus edulis as well as potentially scalable substitute surrogate models are tested the surrogate models were created based on 3d scans and the abbott firestone curve as a surface descriptor is tested and analysed carriage based steady flow experiments along the length of a flume with different velocities as well as oscillating wave tests were conducted to determine the forces acting on the dropper lines and identify drag and inertia coefficients the specific objectives of these tests were to separate the complex interdependent loads a mussel dropper is subjected to an open ocean environments and gain insight into the hydrodynamics based on comprehensive tests under laboratory conditions to evaluate and assess drag c d and inertia c m coefficients of live and surrogate dropper lines under steady as well as oscillatory flow conditions including surface gravity waves to report for the first time inertia coefficients for a range of live and surrogate dropper lines in order to facilitate offshore design of aquaculture technology to discuss the appropriateness of the influential parameters i e the characteristic diameter and shape of the dropper lines the suitability of the created surrogates as well as the parameter ranges tested i e kc number and re numbers and the implications for further research 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup in order to better understand the complex loading of mussel dropper lines exposed to oceanic conditions a comprehensive set of experiments with live mussel dropper lines as well as surrogate bodies was carried out at the wave and towing tank schneiderberg wks of the ludwig franzius institute for hydraulic estuarine and coastal engineering of the leibniz universität hannover germany the wks is 110 m long 2 2 m wide and 2 0 m deep its walls and bottom are made of cement plaster and smooth floating screed respectively the electronically driven machine shaft 46 kw with a maximum stroke of 0 9 m can generate maximum regular wave heights of 0 5 m for wave periods of 2 7 s the maximum speed of the wave board is 1 62 m s and the maximal acceleration is 2 88 m s2 the opposite end has a wave absorbing beach wedge made of coarse gravel at a slope of 1 10 the water depth was set to a constant 0 93 m during testing the test location within the wave flume was positioned at a distance of about 60 0 65 0 m from the wave maker where an observational window is located a top and side view of the wks is presented in fig 2 for the tests three 1 0 1 5 m long dropper line specimens blue mussels originate from a farm in the kiel fjord at the baltic coast as well as three different mussel surrogates with a length of 1 00 m were selected the collector rope with live mussels see fig 3 lm were used to derive surrogate specimen and the derivation process included sophisticated laser scanning data modelling and curation as well as laser supported 3d printing fabrication the geometric and material features of the live and surrogate mussel dropper lines used in this work are depicted in a side by side arrangement in fig 3 a more detailed description of procurement of the live mussels the scanned mussel dropper lines in general as well as the surrogate models including their creation is available landmann et al 2019 the surrogates were created based on the aforementioned 3d scanning and the derivation process used the abbott firestone approach abbott and firestone 1933 for live to surrogate model conversion as well as statistical mean value analysis three types of surrogates were proposed for the geometrically similar modelling the first surrogate is based on the average shell of the originally tested live mussels see fig 3 sm1 to that end the length volume weight and width of a representative number of sample blue mussel shells were taken and a digital average representation of blue mussel shells was developed with computer aided design the average model of the blue mussel shells was then arranged around a core cylinder depicting a rope in size diameter by varying each shell s rotation randomly the mean weight per unit length was chosen as a metric and to match the surrogates overall geometry with varying angles as compared to the live blue mussels the second surrogate as shown in fig 3 sm2 is based off a laser scanning 3d point cloud of a section of the scanned live mussels which represents the closest fit to the weighted arithmetic average material distribution the triangulated section estimated the facets not covered by the 3d scan due to a blocked field of view the third surrogate see fig 3 sm3 based on the characteristic abbott firestone curve uses a reproduction of the weighted arithmetic average material distribution as well but condenses the average material distribution into a simplified geometry this was achieved by choosing a slender cylinder with 10 leave shaped outcrops and is proposed here as a more simple potentially easier to build and scale surrogate providing a novel geometric approach to future testing the three different surrogates have been proposed in order to better understand their feedback of the different surface features with respect to uniform and oscillatory flows and their effect on drag and inertia coefficients for the towing as well as the wave tests the mussel and surrogate dropper lines were attached to a towing carriage shown in fig 2 the test setup consisting of an installation frame and various measurement equipment was rigidly attached to the carriage any potential deflections upon current or wave loading onto the long cantilever arm were avoided by using non distensible wire running from the bottom of the installation frame to the top of the carriage the vertically oriented installation frame height x width 1 00 m 0 80 m was designed for the rigid fastening of the dropper lines through clamps with an interlocking grid at the top and bottom the surrogates were attached to the wire using a grub screw preventing translational as well as rotational movement 2 2 instrumentation resulting forces were recorded for the whole holding frame using a six axis force transducer k6d110 me meßsysteme gmbh henningsdorf germany attached to the towing carriage the velocity of the towing carriage was recorded during each run using an incremental rotary encoder dbv50e 22eka0020 sick vertriebs gmbh düsseldorf germany with a resolution of 12 5 pulses mm and an accuracy of 4 mm m the time history of the water surface elevation was recorded using two ultra sonic sensors with the corresponding controller uls 40 d uss 20130 general acoustics kiel germany the accuracy of the sensors is given with 0 36 mm the sensors were recorded using an industry grade data acquisition system set to a sampling rate of 100 hz in addition cameras were used to record each test visually at frame rate of 30 frames s fig 4 shows a photograph of the complete instrumentational set up a more detailed description of the setup used in this work is presented in landmann et al 2019 2 3 experimental procedures and test program two groups of tests were conducted to obtain drag and inertia coefficients for the different samples that were the focus of this work 1 towing and 2 wave tests the individual recordings of each towing test started while the carriage with installation frame and dropper line was at rest to provide a zero load reference for each run in addition the installation frame was also towed along the flume axis without specimen installed in order to obtain forces of the installation frame only these forces were later subtracted from the measurements of the tested dropper lines towing tests were conducted at velocities of u 1 0 25 m s u 2 0 50 m s u 3 0 75 m s and u 4 1 00 m s the towing velocities were recorded during each run by transforming the rotational speed data obtained from the incremental rotary encoder into an equivalent forward speed each dropper line was submerged over a wetted length of l wet 0 80 m measured while the installation frame was at rest the fastening clamps at both ends which were securely tightened created the vertical tension inside the dropper lines this ensured an equal flow velocity along the whole length of the dropper line during the towing tests each test was conducted up to three times for testing repeatability and overall 72 towing tests were conducted secondly the wave tests were conducted in front of the observational window installed in one sidewall of the flume where the towing carriage was rigidly fastened the wave heights tested were h 1 0 10 m h 2 0 12 m and h 3 0 15 m with wave periods of t 1 1 20 s t 2 1 65 s and t 3 2 40 s each test was conducted up to three times for testing repeatability and 72 wave tests were conducted in total again in order to obtain the forces acting only on the dropper lines the installation frame was tested without the dropper lines in zero tests for later subtraction of these forces the overall test parameters in aggregate form are listed in table 1 3 theoretical background and data processing for the analysis of the responses of offshore structures to oceanic waves the forces acting on slender bodies are most commonly estimated using the morison approach morison et al 1950 this allows the calculation of forces on slender bodies fixed in waves or bodies oscillating in still water or waves dnv 2010a the morison equation provides an efficient approach for the calculation of arbitrary complex structures while the cd and cm coefficients take into account vortex shedding effects non static effects as well as the surface roughness of the structure thus complex flow problems can be solved assuming that the dropper lines that were tested could be at first order approximated as a rigid slender cylinder the quantification of the drag and inertia coefficient for the different dropper lines through dedicated force and velocity measurements is possible this assumption is based on the accepted use of hydrodynamic coefficients in aquaculture research wolfram and naghipour 1999 plew 2005 stevens et al 2008 plew et al 2009 gagnon 2019 and industry projects the determination can be based on the morison equation eq 1 f 1 2 ρ c d u 2 a ρ c m v u where f is the total horizontal force ρ 1000 k g m ³ is the density of the fresh water in the flume c d is the drag coefficient u is the horizontal particle velocity a l w e t d c h a r is the referential front face area composed of the wetted length of tested structure l w e t and the characteristic diameter d c h a r c m is the inertia coefficient v is the volume of the structure and u is the flow particle acceleration the wetted length l w e t 0 80 m was kept constant for all tested dropper lines the first term of equation 1 corresponds to the drag forces acting on the dropper line while the second term describes the inertia forces contributed by the flow acceleration through wave motion for the drag tests in steady state flow conditions the equation simplifies to the first term only as no acceleration occurs it then reads eq 2 f d 1 2 ρ c d u 2 a where f d is depicting the drag force acting on the dropper lines more specifically in this work the drag coefficient c d can be also written as eq 3 c d 2 f d ρ u 2 a the drag coefficient is related to the reynolds number reynolds 1883 r e expressed by eq 4 r e u d c h a r ν where u is the velocity of the current or the towing carriage d c h a r is a characteristic diameter of the observed body and ν depicts the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the characteristic diameter chosen using the morison equation the flow parameters and the observed structure s geometry are essential the flow parameters are the horizontal velocity u and horizontal acceleration u which are determined according to stokes 2nd order wave theory an exact determination of the structural parameters is however not straightforward mussel dropper lines are highly irregular 3d objects of which the referential area a and the referential volume v are hard to quantify cavities crevasses and protrusion of individual mussel species into the water column make the frontal area which is blocked for the flow a matter of discussion for the utilization of the morison equation the irregular shape of the dropper lines is approximated by a cylinder with a wetted length l w e t and the characteristic diameter d c h a r the quantity l w e t is determined as the submerged depth beneath the still water line plus the water surface elevation the characteristic diameter d c h a r diverges over the length of the dropper and as said is challenging to estimate for the results presented in this study a 3d scan of the live mussel dropper lines and a subsequent determination of the width at regular intervals along the length yielded an average characteristic diameter the average diameters of the surrogates were determined based on the 3d models landmann et al 2019 if the number of individual measurements d i is large enough the projected area can be determined and divided by number of measurements n this provides a close approximation of the characteristic diameter that is d c h a r 1 n i 1 n d i the determined characteristic diameter of the live mussels is d c h a r l m 10 3 cm and for the surrogates d c h a r s m 1 10 3 cm d c h a r s m 2 12 1 cm and d c h a r s m 3 13 6 cm under realistic offshore conditions currents could deflect the dropper lines with respect to the earth vector of gravity depending on the mass of the mussels and the velocity of the current to account for these effects the morison equation can been adapted to include the yaw angle of the dropper lines however the yawing of the dropper lines is a load evasion mechanism in their original position hanging vertically suspended from the backbone the dropper lines have the largest referential area with the introduction of a current the dropper lines are yawed reducing the referential area and the possible force acting on the aquaculture system in this study the authors opted for an engineering approach focusing on save hydrodynamic coefficients i e higher forces on the dropper lines 3 1 steady flow experiments for the pre processing of the steady state towing experiment group the data sets were first cleaned of frequency components associated with carriage motions and signal noise via a fast fourier transformation next a fourth order low pass butterworth filter with a cut off frequency of 3 hz was applied to the data of the force transducer for the analysis a starting point was set for each towing run when the velocity of the towing carriage has finished the acceleration phase i e the turning point at the transition from increasing to constant velocity is determined an end point was set to be when the velocity starts to decrease again from the set velocity the forces of the installation frame herein called zero tests were subtracted from the measurements with the dropper lines to isolate the force contribution of the dropper lines to that end equation 2 was solved for the zero tests and the c d coefficients for varying reynolds numbers were obtained a linear function was fitted through the data points which shows that the drag coefficient of the holding frame is within a range of c d 1 72 to 1 77 for reynolds numbers of 1 0 10 4 to 1 3 10 5 the function of the c d coefficients was used to solve equation for all unknown values of the reduction force based on the measured velocity of the towing tests with the dropper lines this way the quadratic influence of the velocity on the force is accounted for and the influence of the holding frame on the forces acting on the mussel dropper lines was removed by this procedure the c d coefficients of the dropper lines were determined by excluding the effects of the surrounding test equipment the unfiltered and filtered time series of the force in x direction and the towing velocity for a test run with an approximated speed of 1 0 m s are shown in fig 5 the actual forces i e the c d dependent force without the influence of the frame is also shown 3 2 oscillatory flow experiments equation 1 was solved with the drag and inertia coefficients as unknowns as velocity and acceleration of the water particles fluctuate under the orbital motion of the waves a common approach to solve for the unknown force coefficients is the least squares method wolfram and naghipour 1999 hildebrandt et al 2009 which was also used in this work it compares the theoretically determined and the measured forces and then optimizes for the errors between those by using the least square method iteratively the theoretical force is calculated based on the water elevation determined by the appropriate wave theory which has been determined based on an analysis of the waves shown in table 1 the data of the wave tests were analysed via a fast fourier transformation and a fourth order low pass butterworth filter with a cut off frequency of 3 hz to eliminate frequency components associated with signal noise starting and endpoints of the data records were set by identifying the target wave height after ramp up of the wave maker each wave between these points is identified individually via zero downcrossing dean and dalrymple 1991 and the wave height period and length were determined the influence of the installation frame on the force measurements was taken into account by subtracting zero test forces frame only from the forces measured when testing the actual specimen for the theoretical force the appropriate wave theory was determined by comparing the measured water elevation for all waves in the experimental program stokes 2nd order theory according to the le méhauté diagram le méhauté 1976 were found to be a good approximation subsequently the horizontal velocity u t d and horizontal acceleration u t d of the water particles were calculated for each time step and over the depth of the water column the resulting parameters were used to determine the theoretical forces for the wetted length of the dropper line according to the morison equation morison et al 1950 with varying c d and c m between 0 01 and 6 0 thus the theoretical horizontal loading on the dropper lines could be estimated as a function of the drag and inertia coefficients and the smallest mathematical error between the measured and theoretical value was used as an approximation of c d and c m the keulegan carpenter number k c is used as a reference as it captures the variation in the measured drag and inertia coefficients introduced by keulegan and carpenter 1934 k c is denoted as eq 5 k c u a t d c h a r where u a is the maximum horizontal component of the orbital velocity of a wave at the water s surface t is the wave period and d c h a r is the characteristic diameter of the observed body fig 6 shows the water elevation of a measurement with a wave height of 0 10 m and a wave period of 1 2 s the observed time series as well as all interpolated zero crossings are highlighted furthermore all resulting single waves and the corresponding forces are displayed with an indication of the theoretical wave height according to stokes 2nd order wave theory 4 results and discussion 4 1 steady flow experiments in the experiments reported herein reynolds numbers ranged between r e 2 3 10 4 and r e 1 4 10 5 this covers the sub critical flow regime under steady currents and corresponds to the current velocities expected in marine environments the overall results regarding the steady flow experiments are shown as a scatter plot cp fig 7 the drag coefficients are plotted as a function of the corresponding reynolds numbers horizontal lines indicate the overall median values for all corresponding tests for both live mussels and the tested surrogate models as can be seen the median drag coefficients of the live mussel dropper lines is c d l m 1 6 the drag coefficients of the three surrogates were generally lower than the live mussel results with median values of c d s m 1 0 9 for the first c d s m 2 1 0 for the second and c d s m 3 0 8 for the third surrogate type the data points of each test are shown in grey scale and the median values of each test are depicted as colored cross symbols the statistical median value was chosen as a descriptor as it is robust against outliers outliers present in the data contribute to the large spreading as mentioned before the force contribution of the test frame was separated from the force contribution of the mussel dropper lines via a cd dependent mathematical adjustment of the measured forces with the subtraction of the zero test forces the measured load level was reduced and this in combination with vibrations in the velocity measurements from the rotary encoder leads to the outlying low drag values especially for lower reynolds numbers fig 8 exemplary shows the cumulative distribution function of the drag coefficient of a single test at 0 25 m s as well as a boxplot of the same data set it is shown that most data points are scattered around the unifying median value indicated again through a colored cross at c d 1 6 the outliers characterized by a steep increase or decrease account in the cumulative density function for less than 3 of all data points these outliers are shown in red in the boxplot the standard deviation of the median drag values as a measure of the square root of the variance is σ l m 0 65 and for the surrogates σ s m 1 0 71 σ s m 2 0 30 and σ s m 3 0 29 the large standard deviation for sm1 is due to the scattering at low reynolds numbers and the mentioned vibrations of the test carriage the use of three different lengths of dropper lines during testing explains the larger variance of the live mussels in comparison to the surrogates these live dropper lines varied in diameter and mass and exhibited natural variations in mussel density and marine growth i e soft growth like algae anemones or sponges and secondary seeding the inclusion of them in one dataset increases the amount of data available and the confidence in the results while slightly aggregating the variance for reynolds numbers larger than r e 6 5 10 4 a clustering of the drag coefficients is apparent as the mussel shells and the edges of the surrogate bodies promote flow separation this behaviour has been observed in the comparison of smooth and highly rough cylinders where rough cylinders show near constant drag coefficients while the drag coefficients of smooth cylinders change significantly with reynolds numbers allen et al 2001 this is why constant values were used as an indication of the drag coefficient less outliers or conversely closely scattered data points coincide with the increasing velocity the relative error of the drag coefficients is largest where towing velocities are lowest i e when the measured force is lowest these current velocities around 0 1 m s to 0 2 m s are potentially influenced by the quality of the force measurements compared to realistic oceanic conditions the range of small towing velocities is not as relevant for the design of marine aquaculture farms as the higher flow velocities yet for the sake of completeness are still reported here heasman et al 1998 in regard to investigations pertaining to limiting biological factors e g seston concentration and initial mussel growth rosland et al 2011 number of mussels in a cluster including attachment properties brenner and buck 2010 as well as hitchhiker fouling organisms on the mussel shell telesca et al 2018 further investigations for even smaller reynolds numbers might be required this will remain an activity for future research 4 2 oscillatory flow experiments an objective of these tests was to determine the hydrodynamic parameters under waves with measured velocities and characteristic diameters based on the average diameter keulegan carpenter numbers ranged from k c 1 9 to k c 8 8 for small k c numbers results from steady state flow experiments for the drag coefficient are not comparable to the results of the wave tests as the flow regime around marine cylinders is strongly inertia dominated denny 1995 drag coefficients become comparable when k c numbers roughly larger than 30 are considered sumer and fredsoe 2006 therefore the use of separate coefficients for steady and oscillatory flow is recommended nath 1987 wolfram and naghipour 1999 sarpkaya 1987 fig 8 provides an overview of the calculated drag and inertia coefficients based on the live dropper lines and the surrogate dropper lines these are given as a function of the kc number along with the individual data as well as median values the approximated median drag and inertia coefficients for the live mussels are c d l m 2 3 and c m l m 2 1 for the surrogates the hydrodynamic coefficients are c d s m 1 2 4 c d s m 2 2 8 and c d s m 3 4 4 and c m s m 1 2 3 c m s m 2 2 9 and c m s m 3 4 9 the mathematically best solution determined by the least square optimization is strongly dependent on the inertia coefficient and less dependent on the drag coefficient this results in explicit solutions for the inertia coefficient while the solutions for the drag coefficient are prone to larger scattering the mathematically lowest error was determined as correct a weighted least square approximation of the morison equation might provide more explicit results regarding the drag coefficient but is not necessary for the small kc numbers covered in this study due to the inertia dependence a possible source of uncertainties in the determination of the inertia coefficient is the oscillatory movement of the dropper line under the waves as well as the movement of the live mussels themselves in the study at hand rigid fastening as well as the short length of the dropper line prevents any major deflection which permits the use of the morison equation however for tests on a larger scale a deflection of the dropper like can be expected and needs to be considered similarly the individual motion of live mussels will take a stronger effect on a larger scale the similarity in the results between the rigid surrogates and the more flexible live mussels shows that the influence of movable mussels can be neglected for this setup 4 3 characteristics of developed surrogates one of the objectives of this work was to better understand how well live mussel specimen can be modelled hydro dynamically by developing geometrically similar surrogate models by comparing the steady state and oscillatory based drag and inertia coefficients a better understanding of the characteristics of the surrogates can be gained results show that the hydrodynamic coefficients of the surrogate bodies differ from those of the live mussel dropper lines specifically the results regarding the drag coefficients of the surrogates for steady state flow experiments are 77 8 60 0 and 100 0 lower for surrogate 1 2 and 3 than the results of the live mussels respectively for oscillatory flow experiments the results are 4 3 21 7 and 91 3 higher respectively the inertia coefficients of the surrogates exceed the results of the live mussels by 9 5 38 1 and 133 3 respectively given the ranges of drag and inertia coefficients surrogate 1 sm1 is proposed as the most similar and hydrodynamically suitable surrogate model of the live blue mussel dropper lines the reasons for this are given below one reason for why such large differences were observed is due to the natural properties of the tested live mussels dropper lines consist of hard growth composed of multiple mussels of varying size but similar shape live mussel are moreover very often overgrown with soft growth that is tissue of e g various algae species atalah et al 2016 more specifically the soft growth comprises varying species of algae anemones and sponges and varies strongly depending on environmental conditions such as water depth temperature salinity predation as well as competition and availability of food and space wolfram and theophanatos 1985 joschko et al 2008 this soft growth likely has a large influence on the boundary layer development and was not recreated during the modelling of the surrogates which were made of smooth 3d printing material the live dropper lines which were taken from in situ cultures had considerable soft growth as can be seen in fig 3 lm mussels i e the hard growth form the main component of the dropper lines and are strongly affected to change as the mussels mature the surface roughness increases as the outcropping mussels grow to a harvestable size simultaneously the drag coefficient increases with the surface roughness and thus drag loads on the structure become more influential this is another reason for the differences between the live mussels and the surrogates as only a macroscopic roughness was incorporated in the models e g the individual growth stages of single mussels were not considered surrogate 1 was based on clean smooth average mussels surrogate 2 and 3 instead were based on the weighted arithmetic average material distribution where unrepresentative peaks and valleys were filtered out resulting in a smoother surface therefore with soft growth and natural variations the surface roughness of the live mussel dropper lines was higher compared to the surrogate models the increased roughness affects various aspects of the flow around the mussel dropper lines such as hydrodynamic instabilities i e vortex shedding the interaction of vortices the separation angle the turbulence level as well as the vortex strength hildebrandt et al 2009 obasaju et al 1988 chakrabarti et al 2016 therefore it can be assumed that the increased drag of the live mussels in the steady state experiments is due to an increase in dropper diameter caused by the additional soft growth and a larger roughness this is supported by the results of wolfram and theophanatos 1990 regarding the effects of marine growth on cylinders as well as more recent numerical studies by xu et al 2020 the lowest deviation from surrogate 2 where soft growth was incorporated by the 3d scanning further supports this assumption another reason for the variances are the obvious differences in shapes between live mussels and surrogates fig 9 depicts the single elements of each surrogate used to construct the dropper lines while the mussel shells or mussel like outcrops of surrogate 1 and 2 provide sharp edges which promote flow separation has surrogate 3 a rather rectangular referential area it can be assumed that this promotes the forming of a large wake for the wave tests the results regarding the drag and inertia coefficient are more consistent the inertia dominance in the oscillating flow regime is surely a reason for a far better fit while the above observations pertaining to drag coefficients in steady state conditions mostly still apply concluding we hypothesize that the differences regarding the hydrodynamic coefficients between the live mussels and surrogates are mostly due to natural growth on the live mussels as well as and variations in surface roughness flow regimes and referential frontal areas while current only conditions are not adequately reproduced a satisfactory representation of the live mussel dropper lines considering wave conditions is found as said before surrogate 1 sm1 seems closest to represent the characteristics found surrogate 3 sm3 is dismissed as it differed strongly under oscillatory test conditions as well as surrogate 2 sm which is rejected due to its complex shape which is too specific for a generic surrogate approach 4 4 influence of the characteristic diameter the characteristic diameter chosen for the determination of the drag and inertia coefficients in this study is challenging to estimate as mussel dropper lines are natural structures with uneven growth cavities crevasses and protrusions to provide a better understanding of the importance of the chosen characteristic diameter alternative approaches used in literature are compared to the average diameter used in this study see fig 11 one alternative approach to express the frontal area is based on the non dimensional surface roughness δ k d 0 of long slender cylinders dnv 2010b using a spatial organization model introduced by gagnon 2019 this approach uses the packing geometry of mussel shells around a dropper line and estimates the roughness height k as k 0 5 l m r s r p 2 r p with l m being the mean mussel length r s the distance between the axis of the dropper line and the center of the modelled mussel and r p the radius of the polygon on which the model is based following the spatial organization model allows to solve for an average mussel length of 4 7 cm and smooth cylinder diameters d 0 on the basis of the abbot firestone curve provided by landmann et al 2019 the resulting roughness height is 2 63 cm which results in a characteristic diameters of d c h a r l m 8 6 cm for the live mussels and d c h a r s m 1 7 3 cm d c h a r s m 2 8 6 cm and d c h a r s m 3 8 9 cm for the surrogates another approach for the determination of the frontal area in a laboratory is based on the displaced volume plew 2005 the characteristic diameter can be determined as d c h a r 4 v π l with v being the displaced volume and l w the wetted length of the dropper line the displaced volume was determined by submerging the mussels into a cylinder filled with water with a radius of 39 0 cm and measuring the water level rise for the live mussels with a volume of 0 013 m³ a characteristic diameter of d c h a r l m 9 2 cm was determined for the surrogates characteristic diameters of d c h a r s m 1 7 3 cm d c h a r s m 2 7 2 cm and d c h a r s m 3 7 4 cm were determined as all surrogates are porous the characteristic diameters obtained are smaller in comparison to the other methods however these approaches are not easily applicable for measurements in the field plew et al 2009 suggested defining the characteristic diameter as d c h a r 2 x l m u s s e l with l m u s s e l as the average mussel length this method can easily be applied and compared to visual inspections on site the accuracy of this estimation is however prone to errors regarding natural variations of the dropper lines and different cultivated species for this approach the average mussel length was determined as 4 7 cm and a characteristic diameter of 9 4 cm is assumed for live mussels and surrogates the authors recommend the use of 3d scans and the average diameter for experiments under laboratory conditions as the most explicit representation of the characteristic diameter can be achieved the characteristic diameters calculated according to the above mentioned approaches are displayed in table 2 given the above derived characteristic diameters of the live and surrogate dropper lines a new determination of the drag and inertia coefficients can be conducted the resulting differences in the drag and inertia coefficients are shown for the oscillating flow conditions for the live mussels only and displayed in fig 10 a comparison to the suggested surrogate sm1 is possible via the indicated horizontal lines representing the results as seen above the resulting drag and inertia coefficients are grouped for each tested set of waves to display changes induced by rising kc numbers it can be seen that small differences in the characteristic diameter lead to comparatively large changes regarding the resulting hydrodynamic coefficients this effect seems to increase with rising k c number a decrease of 8 7 in characteristic diameter i e the difference between the average diameter and the multiple of the mussel length results in an increase of the drag coefficient from 1 8 to 2 2 or 18 the inertia coefficient rises from 1 95 to 2 3 this strong sensitivity of the hydrodynamic coefficients concerning the characteristic diameter can be confirmed for all results while the change in loads due to varying diameters is not accounted for highlights this the importance of a sensible choice regarding the characteristic diameter used for the calculation of forces in the morison equation the best agreement of the sm1 can be seen for the average diameter as for rising kc numbers the other methods increase drastically the authors assume that the aforementioned influence of the soft growth and the high roughness lead to a larger characteristic diameter than suggested by the methods currently employed further tests with the aim of creating a referential cylinder are advised said cylinder would vary for the surrogate and the live mussels as the soft growth greatly influences the results however the referential cylinder could be used as an easy to implement body in numerical studies the diameter of the referential cylinder will be larger than the characteristic diameter of the mussel dropper lines as the increase in drag through soft and hard growth needs to be compensated in the absence of this data we recommend using the average diameters for the design of mussel dropper lines or longline farms 4 5 comparison to existing studies the results of the live mussels that were tested experimentally are compared and discussed in the light of other published studies this discussion only references the data regarding drag coefficients as mentioned in a review by gagnon 2019 inertia coefficients of mussel dropper lines have not been experimentally determined before only now these have become available through the work reported herein in numerical studies the dropper lines are modelled as cylinders of varying diameter to which the morison equation is applied and drag coefficients have been assumed as c d 1 5 raman nair and colbourne 2003 or c d 1 2 raman nair et al 2008 the authors stress the necessity of physical experiments or field tests to obtain realistic values as no basis for their assumptions is given a more recent investigation assumes c d 1 1 1 7 as realistic values for the modelling of submerged shellfish longlines knysh et al 2020 based on a literature research their numerical model of a longline aquaculture system showed little sensitivity to the exact choice of drag coefficients regarding the predictions for mooring line tensions and longline dynamics detailing the overall physics of offshore shellfish aquaculture stevens et al 2008 suggest values of c d 1 5 linked to research regarding ultra rough cylinders xu et al 2020 assumed the drag coefficient of mussel dropper lines to range from c d 1 1 to 1 2 based on a computational fluid dynamics approach through a 3d large eddy simulation none of the assumptions mentioned above are based on validated physical experiments and should be considered as an estimate while results regarding drag and inertia coefficients of cylinders with varying roughnesses are readily available are results for physical experiments scarce in a study regarding the hydrodynamic implications of offshore shellfish systems a provisional drag coefficient was determined using towing tank tests on a length of dropper line plew et al 2005 the characteristic diameter was based on the multiple of the mussel length as described above and resulted in a characteristic diameter of 0 16 m a resulting drag coefficient of c d 0 89 was determined in a later investigation a drag coefficient of c d 1 27 was determined through physical model experiments plew et al 2009 a possible weakness is the used test setup where mussel shells p canalicus were glued onto 10 mm polythene hoses to imitate dropper lines and no comparison to live like conditions is given gagnon and bergeron 2011 report on tests conducted with four 4 m long dropper lines where a drag coefficient of c d 1 25 was determined the dropper lines were cut by divers and dragged behind a boat where a load cell was located the influence of waves and current was not included in the results which affects the outcome the results of all mentioned studies are summarized in table 3 with reynolds numbers specified if possible the compiled data show that the available research regarding hydrodynamic coefficients is mainly based on theoretic considerations and numerical approaches without validation furthermore the studies regarding physical experiments are of varying quality as either the dropper lines or laboratory conditions are improvable however precise physical experiments are necessary to accurately predict the forces acting on aquaculture systems in the open ocean during the design stage the hydrodynamic coefficients determined in this study supplement the currently available data give a more reliable estimation and extend the available hydrodynamic parameters with the inclusion of physical model tests in oscillating flow regimes 5 conclusions this work is related to the design and testing of new marine aquaculture concepts during the planning and assessment of marine aquaculture projects there is a need to determine the forces acting on the structural components for efficient designs mussel laden dropper lines form the bulk of the mass and surface area of a longline mussel farm therefore comprehensive physical model tests were conducted to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients of live mussel dropper lines under laboratory conditions in the present study this enables planners and researchers alike to quantify the influence and impact of a single dropper line and assess their combined effect in a farm the main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows drag tests with mussel dropper lines were conducted in a wave flume at varying velocities based on the results a drag coefficient of c d 1 6 is recommended for currents with subcritical flow regimes r e 10 5 and blue mussels mytilus edulis similarly the mussel dropper lines were subjected to waves and a drag coefficient of c d 2 3 and an inertia coefficient of c m 2 1 are proposed for k c 10 further tests with other commonly cultivated species e g green lipped mussels perna canaliculus are suggested to obtain species specific hydrodynamic parameters additional investigations on the hydrodynamic coefficients for large r e and k c numbers are of special interest for the envisaged remote offshore aquaculture sites simultaneously tests with three surrogate models were carried out and their drag and inertia coefficients under steady and oscillatory flow were quantified the aim was to obtain a simplified model which can be used in both physical and numerical experiments without the need for keeping mussels alive or using geometrically divergent forms the performance of the surrogates deviated from the live mussels under steady current while the performance under oscillatory flow showed a good fit surrogate 1 based on the average shell of the originally tested blue mussels was chosen for further testing as it showed the best fit likewise to the live mussels investigations of the surrogates with increasing r e and k c numbers are planned for future research this study shows that the choice of the characteristic diameter has a large influence on the hydrodynamic coefficients and the findings suggest a larger characteristic diameter then former studies a comparison to published studies reveals that experimental research regarding the hydrodynamic coefficients of mussel dropper lines is scarce since most studies focus on drag in steady flow this study provides estimated inertia coefficients of mussel dropper lines and surrogates based on wave tests future testing of the proposed sm1 should include investigations regarding the scaling potential of the surrogate body to enable further physical investigations of whole shellfish longline systems with increased accuracy as well as larger scale experiments to deepen the understanding regarding larger ranges of r e and k c the specific influence of the soft growth and surface roughness on the hydrodynamic parameters of mussel dropper lines was not scope of this study but is subject to ongoing and future studies applying the obtained knowledge to future research this study provides a basis for the design and evaluation of novel offshore bivalve aquaculture the insights gathered in this study facilitate the testing procedure for aquaculture systems and provide robust estimates for numerical approaches this information can be used in the development of novel marine aquaculture systems in the light of the increasing demand for marine protein credit authorship

20482,this study investigates the effects of the reynolds number on the piezoelectric energy harvesting from vortex induced vibrations viv of a circular cylinder the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester is simulated by a representative electro aero mechanical model in which the aerodynamic force is represented by a model with amplitude dependent aerodynamic parameters and an aerodynamic damping envelope model the amplitude dependent aerodynamic parameters at two typical reynolds numbers are identified based on free vibration experiments and forced vibration numerical simulations respectively the aerodynamic damping envelope over a reynolds number range of 500 33000 are identified based on the reynolds number dependent griffin plot wind tunnel experiments are carried out to verify the accuracy of the electro aero mechanical model for the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester a parametric study is then performed to investigate the reynolds number effects on the bifurcation diagrams and maximum power output of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester it is demonstrated that the reynolds number affects not only the levels of the harvested power but also the global branches of the bifurcation diagram the results also show that the performance of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester is more sensitive to the reynolds number for a case with low

supplement to power low energy consumption devices e g wireless sensor networks micro electromechanical systems and sensors on unmanned aerial vehicles etc prauzek et al 2018 yang et al 2018 abdelkefi 2016 towards energy harvesting from ambient vibrations various efforts have been paid to broaden the effective bandwidth of vibration energy harvesting such as the using of multi degree of freedom structures employing mechanical nonlinearities or combining some different energy harvesting principles including piezoelectric chen et al 2020 gu et al 2020 wu et al 2018 electromagnetic fan et al 2019 electrostatic lai et al 2019 yang et al 2020 triboelectric tao et al 2019 and their combinations lai et al 2021 liu et al 2020 wind and water flow are ubiquitous sources in nature that have already been recognized as important renewable energy resources song et al 2018 2020 zhao et al 2019a traditional methods using windmill like turbo machineries or water turbines to collect energy from wind or water have proved that it is reasonable to scavenge high speed flow energy qin et al 2016 rus et al 2016 in addition flow induced vibrations fivs are quite good ways to convert flow energy particularly low speed flow energy into mechanical vibratory energy which can be well employed during the design of energy harvesters wang and ko 2010 wang et al 2020a zhu et al 2018 ding et al 2021 energy harvesting from fivs is realized mainly based on three common aerodynamic phenomena i e vortex induced vibrations galloping and flutter mehmood et al 2013 wang et al 2020b zhu et al 2020 yang and chen 2021 xu et al 2021 machado et al 2021 wang et al 2021 yu and zhang 2021 song et al 2021 song et al 2020 for galloping and flutter it is beneficial to obtain considerable energy due to the self excited vibration characteristics that can cause a quite high amplitude that is after a threshold value of flow velocity the energy harvester can vibrate dramatically and produce a considerable amount of energy barrero gil et al 2020 sun et al 2019 doaré and michelin 2011 zakaria et al 2015 unfortunately one must consider the issue that it is quite difficult to avoid a galloping or flutter based energy harvester being damaged due to too large vibratory amplitude if the flow speed cannot be well controlled in a specific region fortunately viv based energy harvesting can exactly overcome the aforementioned issue because of the existence of the lock in or synchronization phenomenon that is when the flow speed reaches a threshold value the vortex induced vibration enters into a resonance liked stage where the shedding frequency is locked with the natural frequency of the system besides when the flow speed increases beyond the lock in range the vibration suppresses immediately in other words a viv based energy harvester can exactly work as a self protection system that can adapt the severe weather conditions dai et al 2014 despite large progress on viv based energy harvesting the effect of reynolds number re ρud μ ρ is the fluid density u is the flow velocity d is the cylinder diameter μ is the viscosity on the performance of a viv based energy harvester has seldom been evaluated it is well known that the flow regime around a circular cylinder is highly dependent on the reynolds number achenbach and heinecke 1981 identified the laminar subcritical and critical flow regimes based on visual observation and changes in strouhal number st a more detailed classification of the flow regime around a circular cylinder versus reynolds number was later proposed by zdravkovich 1997 norberg 2003 collected experimental measurements of strouhal number and fluctuating lift coefficient c l in a wide range of reynolds number and further proposed empirical formulas to describe the dependence of st and c l on re as presented in fig 1 due to the reynolds number effect on the fluid elastic effect e g st c l and fluid elastic force the viv response of a circular cylinder is also largely affected by the reynolds number govardhan and williamson 2006 martins and avila 2019 raghavan and bernitsas 2011 typical viv responses of lightly damped circular cylinders in the laminar and subcritical regimes are presented in fig 2 the results for re 4000 originated from the experiments of govardhan and williamson 2006 while those for re 90 150 were obtained from the experiments of anagnostopoulos and bearman 1992 it is demonstrated that the reynolds number affects not only the vibration amplitudes but also the global response behavior in the subcritical regime the response consists of three branches i e the initial upper and lower branches however in the laminar regime the response only consists of the initial and lower branches the smaller lock in range for re 90 150 is due to the higher mass damping parameter and lower reynolds number the upper branch in the subcritical regime diminishes with increasing the mass damping parameter of the circular cylinder this paper presents a numerical investigation to study the influence of the reynolds number on the piezoelectric energy harvesting from vortex induced vibrations of circular cylinders a recently developed aerodynamic damping envelope model zhang et al 2020a 2020b is used to simulate the vortex induced force the aerodynamic damping envelope model is then implemented into a lumped parameter model describing the coupled aero electro mechanical system of the viv based energy harvester wind tunnel experiments are conducted to validate the accuracy of the lumped parameter model and to estimate the power output of the energy harvester aerodynamic parameters of the aerodynamic damping envelope model over a reynolds number range of 500 33000 are identified based on the modified griffin plot proposed in raghavan and bernitsas 2011 the performance of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester is then evaluated in this reynolds number range based on the simulated aero electro mechanical system the subsequent parts of this work are organised as follows the aerodynamic damping envelope model for viv and the lumped parameter model for a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester are described in section 2 the accuracy of the electro aero mechanical model is verified by wind tunnel experiments in section 3 the effect of reynolds number on the performance of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester is examined in section 4 the main conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 mathematical modeling of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester 2 1 aerodynamic

aerodynamic force is decomposed into an aerodynamic stiffness component in phase and an aerodynamic damping component in quadrature with the time varying displacement a physical sound single degree of freedom modeling scheme is to simulate the nonlinear aerodynamic force with an amplitude dependent function of the time varying displacement and velocity of the cylinder e g morse and williamson 2009 zhang et al 2020c zhang et al 2020d zhao et al 2019b recently zhang et al zou et al 2019 showed that a model of this type can satisfactorily predict the viv amplitudes of a circular cylinder in a wide range of mass damping parameters following their model the aerodynamic force can be expressed as 2 f a i r 0 5 ρ u 2 d 2 π u r h 1 a u r re y u 4 π u r 2 2 h 4 a u r re y c l u r re sin ω s t φ where ρ is the air density a represents the amplitude of the non dimensional displacement y d h 1 and h 4 are amplitude dependent aerodynamic damping and stiffness parameters respectively c l is a parameter to characterize the forcing term in the aerodynamic force ω s 2πs t u d and φ are the shedding frequency and initial phase of the forcing term respectively for lock in responses with large amplitude vibrations the forcing term in the aerodynamic force is negligible morse and williamson 2009 besides if the mass ratio between the cylinder and displaced air is large e g of order 10 or 100 the effect of the aerodynamic stiffness term on the viv response becomes insignificant as a result the forcing term and aerodynamic stiffness term can be removed to simplify equation 2 3 f a i r 0 5 ρ u 2 d 2 π u r h 1 a u r re y u the governing equation of the elastically mounted rigid cylinder i e equation 1 is then formulated as 4 m y 2 ξ 0 ω 0 y ω 0 2 y 0 5 ρ u 2 d 2 π u r h 1 a u r r e y u by moving the left hand term of equation 4 to the right hand side it becomes 5 y 2 m a ω 0 m α 1 π h 1 a u r r e y ω 0 2 y 0 where α mξ 0 m a is a dimensionless mass damping parameter defined by khalak and williamson 1999 and m a πρd 2 4 is the potential fluid added mass as noticed from equation 5 two important parameters that dominate the viv initiation and amplitude of a circular cylinder are α and h 1 a u r r e fig 4 a schematically presents the dimensionless viv amplitudes for a specific re at three mass damping conditions α the peak viv amplitudes a max for α α 1 α 2 and α 3 occur at reduced wind speeds of u r 1 u r 2 and u r 3 respectively the h 1 curves at u r 1 u r 2 and u r 3 are schematically illustrated in fig 4 b on the other hand in order to obtain the maximum power output of a viv based energy harvester in the lock in range it is beneficial to have a representative model that can directly evaluate the peak viv amplitude within the lock in range of a cylinder for this purpose the upper envelope of h 1 a u r at various reduced flow velocities can be merged into a h 1 m a x a curve as highlighted by a blue line in fig 4 b it should be mentioned that the purpose of fig 4 b is to illustrate how to determine h 1 m a x a based on the h 1 a u r schematically practically it is necessary to have the h 1 a u r at more reduced flow velocities i e densely distributed in the lock in range as the upper boundary of h 1 a u r h 1 m a x a represents the variation of the largest negative aerodynamic damping in the lock in range versus vibration amplitude zhang et al 2020a 2020b showed that equation 6 can be utilized as a simplified aerodynamic force model to conveniently calculate the peak viv amplitudes a max of a circular cylinder with different mass damping conditions α 6 f a i r 0 5 ρ u 2 d 2 π u r h 1 m a x a re y u equation 6 is referred to as the aerodynamic damping envelope model by zhang et al 2020a and h 1 m a x a is the aerodynamic damping envelope the following equation can be employed to calculate the peak viv amplitudes in the lock in range of a circular cylinder at various α and re 7 m y 2 ξ 0 ω 0 y ω 0 2 y 0 5 ρ u 2 d 2 π u r h 1 m a x a re y u it should be highlighted that the aerodynamic parameter h 1 a u r re in the model of equation 3 is a function of the reduced flow velocity and hence the model can be utilized to predict the viv amplitudes at various reduced flow velocities in the entire lock in range on the other hand the aerodynamic parameter h 1 m a x a re in the model of equation 6 is independent of the reduced flow velocity since the model is developed to conveniently evaluate the peak viv amplitude without calculating the viv amplitudes in the entire lock in range as discussed by zhang et al 2020b h 1 a u r for a specific re can be extracted according to the viv displacement signals grow to resonance and or decay to resonance at a single mass damping parameter α for a specific re once h 1 a u r are available in the interested ranges of a and u r h 1 m a x a could be then obtained through the least square fitting based on the upper boundary of h 1 a u r as illustrated in fig 4 b however to identify the aerodynamic parameters at different re by this method a huge amount of experimental work is required to obtain the experimental viv signals at various re a more practical method is to identify h 1 m a x a r e based on the griffin plot i e peak viv amplitude a max versus mass damping parameter α at various re at the peak viv amplitude the energy absorbed from flow is completely dissipated by mechanical damping hence the equivalent negative aerodynamic damping ratio is equal to the mechanical damping ratio accordingly for a specific α and re h 1 m a x at the peak viv amplitude can be obtained according to equation 7 as 8 h 1 m a x a m a x π α govardhan and williamson 2006 systematically collected the experimental viv steady state amplitudes reported before 2006 they showed that over the range of re 500 33000 the peak viv amplitudes a max can be approximated as 9 a m a x 1 1 12 α 0 30 α 2 log 0 41 re 0 36 1 1 12 h 1 m a x π 0 30 h 1 m a x 2 π 2 log 0 41 re 0 36 g h 1 m a x r e according to equation 9 h 1 m a x can be approximated as 10 h 1 m a x g 1 a m a x r e for each specific re an amplitude dependent h 1 m a x function can be obtained from equations 9 and 10 it should be noted that the applicability of equation 10 should be limited within re 500 33000 fortunately this covers the interested re range for a lot of practical viv based energy piezoelectric harvesters the only purpose of introducing equations 8 10 is to identify the h 1 m a x a curves at various re the identified h 1 m a x a curves can be used as input aerodynamic parameters to calculate the displacement responses and output power values of an energy harvester at various re and α to check the validity of the h 1 m a x calculated by equation 10 the peak viv amplitudes of an elastically mounted circular cylinder are predicted by the aerodynamic model at re 4000 and 12000 as presented in fig 5 together with available experimental measurements by govardhan and williamson 2006 it is noted that the predicted peak viv amplitudes agree very well with the experimental measurements suggesting that the h 1 m a x can be accurately calculated from equation 10 2 2 estimation of the harvested power as shown in fig 6 a typical viv based piezoelectric energy harvester consists of a circular cylinder a cantilever beam and a piezoelectric transducer bonded at the root of the beam vibration of the beam can be excited by the aerodynamic force acting on the circular cylinder which leads to power generation by the piezoelectric transducer the lumped parameter

determine the accuracy of the electro aero mechanical model for the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester developed in section 2 a wind tunnel with round cross section diameter 0 40 m is utilized to test the performance of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester as presented in fig 7 a the wind tunnel can generate stable incoming flow by installing a honeycomb structure inside the settling chamber as shown in fig 7 c the wind speed is adjustable in the range of 0 u 7 m s and the freestream turbulent intensity is measured to be lower than 0 5 a piezoelectric patch pzt 5 jiayeshi co china of 37 11 0 6 mm3 is bonded on a substrate made of pure aluminium in a dimension of 200 25 0 5 mm3 to form the piezoelectric cantilever beam the capacitance of the piezoelectric transducer c p is 26 0 nf a circular cylinder is connected at the free end of a piezoelectric cantilever beam as shown in fig 7 b the circular cylinder is a 0 118 m long hard foam with a diameter of 0 032 m the mechanical damping ratio ξ 0 of the piezoelectric harvester can be calculated according to the free vibration decay response in still air using the logarithmic decrement technique a hot wire anemometer model 405i testo co usa is adopted to measure the wind velocity u the voltage output of the harvester is measured by a digital oscilloscope model ds1104s rigol china main parameters of the prototype in the present experiments are listed in table 1 the reynolds number range of the present experiments is re 4000 6000 and the peak viv amplitude occurs at re 5000 to identify the aerodynamic parameters h 1 the viv grow to resonance signals are recorded at various wind speeds some examples are presented in fig 8 for a specific reduced flow velocity u r the amplitude dependent damping ratio ξ a d of a grow to resonance displacement signal can be identified with the algorithm developed by zhang and xu 2018 the equivalent aerodynamic damping ratio can be expressed as 14 ξ a e r o a d ξ a d ξ 0 h 1 at this reduced wind speed is then obtained as 15 h 1 4 m ξ a e r o a d ρ d 2 h 1 for various u r are identified based on the grow to resonance signals as presented in fig 9 the identified h 1 can be used as input aerodynamic parameters for equation 12 to calculate the displacement responses and output power values of the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester at various reduced wind speeds 3 2 comparison between experimental and simulated results the plotted curves in fig 8 compare the experimental and simulated viv displacement time histories to verify the aerodynamic force model described in section 2 1 results of three reduced wind speeds i e near the onset threshold in the middle of the lock in range and near the end threshold are presented it is noted that the time varying amplitudes of simulated displacement histories agree very well with the experimental results for both amplitude increasing stage and steady state stage to validate the representative model for the aero electro mechanical system described in section 2 2 the experimental and simulated viv amplitudes and power outputs of the piezoelectric energy harvester are compared fig 10 compares the experimentally measured and simulated power outputs versus load resistance at a reduced wind speed of u r 5 91 the prediction error is smaller than 5 for most load resistances while the error is higher than 15 for r 100 3000 and 50000 kω this should be mainly due the errors of the identified aerodynamic mechanical and electrical parameters fig 11 compares the experimentally measured and simulated viv amplitudes and power outputs versus the reduced wind speed in the lock in range the average power is calculated using joule s law in conjunction with ohm s law average power rms voltage rms voltage load resistance rms root mean square it is noted that the simulated results agree quite well with the experimental measurements indeed both the optimal load resistance and power outputs in the lock in range can be satisfactorily produced by the representative electro aero mechanical model the comparisons confirm that this model can be utilized to simulate the behavior of the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester with reasonable accuracy hence the representative electro aero mechanical model of equation 12 can be utilized to study the effect of reynolds number on the performance of viv based piezoelectric energy harvesters as stated earlier the maximum viv amplitude and hence the maximum power output of the present experiments occurs at re 5000 h 1 m a x for re 5000 is calculated based on equation 10 and then substituted into equation 13 to calculate the maximum viv amplitude and maximum power output as presented in fig 11 the resulting maximum dimensionless amplitude and maximum power output are 0 66 and 9 99 mw respectively which agree well with the experimental values 0 69 and 9 51 mw respectively the agreements suggest that equation 10 can be used to calculate the aerodynamic damping envelope and hence equation 13 is applicable to calculate the maximum viv amplitude and maximum power output of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester at various reynolds numbers 4 effect of re on performance of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester 4 1 effect of re on power output in the lock in range in order to demonstrate the reynolds number effect on the levels of the harvested power of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester in the lock in range the power outputs at three typical reynolds numbers i e re 100 in the laminar regime and re 4000 6000 and re 10000 in the subcritical regime will be calculated based on the representative electro aero mechanical model of equation 12 the aerodynamic damping parameters h 1 for re 4000 6000 are identified from the experiments in section 3 as presented in fig 9 the h 1 for re 10000 are constructed from the forced vibration experiments of gopalkrishnan 1993 as shown in fig 12 a the h 1 for re 100 are identified based on the computational simulation procedure developed in zhang et al 2020d zhao et al 2019b forced vibration numerical simulations two dimensional unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes simulations are conducted based on the commercial program ansys fluent the computational domain and boundary conditions are schematically shown in fig 13 a the computational domain extends upstream and downstream the circular cylinder by 10d around the circular cylinder refined quadrilateral cells are generated with an initial thickness of 0 03 mm at the tube surface and a growth factor of 1 15 along the radial direction until the 20th layer unstructured grids are used for the rest of the computational domain the total grid number is 45626 which is proved to be enough according to a sensitivity study of mesh dependency fig 13 b presents a partial view of the mesh around the tube surfaces the time step length is selected according to a sensitivity study which proves that a time step of 0 005 s is sufficient to ensure the simulation the simulated h 1 are given in fig 12 b the aerodynamic parameters h 1 for re 100 re 4000 6000 and re 10000 are substituted into the representative electro aero mechanical model of equation 12 to calculate the displacement responses and power outputs of the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester in the lock in range the mass damping and electrical parameters for the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester are the same as those given in table 1 the performances of the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester at three different reynolds numbers are given in fig 14 it is noted that the reynolds number affects not only the values but also the global branches of the power output the maximum power output at re 100 is about 6 62 mw while that at re 4000 6000 and re 12000 are about 9 51 and 14 4 mw respectively the effective wind range for power harvesting is also affected by the reynolds number similar to the viv responses for re 90 150 given in fig 1 the results for re 100 in the laminar regime consists of an initial branch and a lower branch the results in the subcritical regime are supposed to include three branches i e the initial upper and lower branches the upper branches are not clear for the two cases re 4000 6000 and re 10000 due to the limited available reduced wind speeds however according to govardhan and williamson 2006 the results with dimensionless amplitude higher than 0 6 belong to the upper branch therefore the results for re 4000 6000 and re 10000 both include three branches these observations highlight the necessity to consider the reynolds number effect in the design of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester for a specific viv based piezoelectric energy harvester several measures e g increasing the surface roughness the diameter and the natural frequency could be adopted to increase its working reynolds number range fig 15 presents the performances of the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester at various load resistances r for re 4000 6000 and re 10000 the results of the viv amplitudes are not shown since they are only slightly affected by the load resistance it is noted that the optimal load resistance is not affected by the reduced wind speed because it depends on the capacitance and natural frequency of the system which are considered constant in this study the lock in range is insignificantly affected by the load resistance in the considered range which agrees with the observations in wang et al 2020c 4 2 effect of re on maximum power output after highlighting the effect of reynolds number on the performance of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester in section 4 1 the effect of reynolds number on the maximum harvested power output is examined in this section the representative electro aero mechanical model of equation 13 can be utilized together with the aerodynamic damping envelope h 1 m a x calculated by equation 10 to study the reynolds number effect on the maximum harvested power output for a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester fig 16 presents the variation of maximum power output as a function of the electrical load resistance at various reynolds numbers the mass and electrical parameters for the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester are the same as those given in table 1 while a zero mechanical damping is adopted to obtain the highest viv amplitudes and power outputs at various re the maximum power output increases with the load resistance until an optimal value and then decreases the optimal load resistance is not affected by the reynolds number because it depends on the capacitance and natural frequency of the system which are considered constant in this study the effect of the reynolds number on the maximum power output is also clearly highlighted in fig 16 the maximum power output increases with increasing the reynolds number the value at re 500 is about 7 9 mw while that at re 30000 is as high as 34 5 mw the variation of maximum power output versus reynolds number is shown in fig 17 for several mechanical damping levels it is noted that the maximum power output decreases with increasing the mechanical damping ratio ξ 0 for re 30000 the maximum power output at ξ 0 3 0 is 1 7 mw while that at ξ 0 0 is as high as 34 5 mw for lower mechanical damping ratio the maximum power output varies significantly with the reynolds number however the reynolds number effect is significantly reduced by increasing the mechanical damping ratio for ξ 0 0 the maximum power output increases from 7 9 mw to 35 3 mw as the reynolds number increase from 500 to 33000 as a comparison for ξ 0 3 0 the maximum power output increases from 0 39 mw to 1 56 mw as the reynolds number increase from 500 to 33000 the results indicate that the performance of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester is more sensitive to the reynolds number for a case with low mechanical damping ratio the variation of maximum power output versus mechanical damping ratio is shown in fig 18 for several reynolds numbers it is noted that the effect of mechanical damping ratio on the maximum power output is more profound for higher reynold numbers for re 30000 the maximum power output decreases from 34 5 mw to 1 7 mw as the mechanical damping ratio increases from 0 to 3 0 for re 500 the maximum power output decreases from 3 3 mw to 0 7 mw as the mechanical damping ratio increases from 0 to 3 0 the results suggest that the performance of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester is more sensitive to the mechanical damping at high reynolds number 5 conclusions this paper presented a numerical investigation to study the effect of reynolds number on piezoelectric energy harvesting from vortex induced vibration of a circular cylinder the aerodynamic force was simulated by a model with amplitude dependent aerodynamic parameters and an aerodynamic damping envelope model the amplitude dependent aerodynamic parameters at two typical reynolds numbers were identified based on free vibration experiments and forced vibration numerical simulations respectively the aerodynamic damping envelopes over a reynolds number range of 500 33000 were identified based on the reynolds number dependent griffin plot a plot showing the peak viv amplitude versus the mass damping parameter proposed by govardhan and williamson 2006 the mechanical parameters and piezoelectric coupling in the system were represented by the standard electronic components the aerodynamic mechanical and piezoelectric blocks were implemented into a representative electro aero mechanical model to simulate the aero electro mechanical system of the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester wind tunnel experiments were carried out to validate the accuracy of the representative electro aero mechanical model for the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester a parametric study was then presented to study the reynolds number effect on the bifurcation diagrams and maximum power output of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester some important conclusions were given as 1 both the lock in range and power outputs within lock in of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester increase with increasing the reynolds number the reynolds number also affects the global branches of the power output in the subcritical regime the power output consists of three branches i e initial upper and lower branches however in the laminar regime the power output only consists of the initial and lower branches the upper branch in the subcritical regime diminished with increasing the mass damping parameter 2 the optimal load resistance of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester was almost not affected by the reynolds number when the same capacitance and natural frequency are considered the performance of an energy harvester is more sensitive to the reynolds number for a case with a low mechanical damping ratio on the other hand the performance of an energy harvester is more sensitive to mechanical damping at a high reynolds number credit authorship contribution statement mingjie zhang conceptualization

supplement to power low energy consumption devices e g wireless sensor networks micro electromechanical systems and sensors on unmanned aerial vehicles etc prauzek et al 2018 yang et al 2018 abdelkefi 2016 towards energy harvesting from ambient vibrations various efforts have been paid to broaden the effective bandwidth of vibration energy harvesting such as the using of multi degree of freedom structures employing mechanical nonlinearities or combining some different energy harvesting principles including piezoelectric chen et al 2020 gu et al 2020 wu et al 2018 electromagnetic fan et al 2019 electrostatic lai et al 2019 yang et al 2020 triboelectric tao et al 2019 and their combinations lai et al 2021 liu et al 2020 wind and water flow are ubiquitous sources in nature that have already been recognized as important renewable energy resources song et al 2018 2020 zhao et al 2019a traditional methods using windmill like turbo machineries or water turbines to collect energy from wind or water have proved that it is reasonable to scavenge high speed flow energy qin et al 2016 rus et al 2016 in addition flow induced vibrations fivs are quite good ways to convert flow energy particularly low speed flow energy into mechanical vibratory energy which can be well employed during the design of energy harvesters wang and ko 2010 wang et al 2020a zhu et al 2018 ding et al 2021 energy harvesting from fivs is realized mainly based on three common aerodynamic phenomena i e vortex induced vibrations galloping and flutter mehmood et al 2013 wang et al 2020b zhu et al 2020 yang and chen 2021 xu et al 2021 machado et al 2021 wang et al 2021 yu and zhang 2021 song et al 2021 song et al 2020 for galloping and flutter it is beneficial to obtain considerable energy due to the self excited vibration characteristics that can cause a quite high amplitude that is after a threshold value of flow velocity the energy harvester can vibrate dramatically and produce a considerable amount of energy barrero gil et al 2020 sun et al 2019 doaré and michelin 2011 zakaria et al 2015 unfortunately one must consider the issue that it is quite difficult to avoid a galloping or flutter based energy harvester being damaged due to too large vibratory amplitude if the flow speed cannot be well controlled in a specific region fortunately viv based energy harvesting can exactly overcome the aforementioned issue because of the existence of the lock in or synchronization phenomenon that is when the flow speed reaches a threshold value the vortex induced vibration enters into a resonance liked stage where the shedding frequency is locked with the natural frequency of the system besides when the flow speed increases beyond the lock in range the vibration suppresses immediately in other words a viv based energy harvester can exactly work as a self protection system that can adapt the severe weather conditions dai et al 2014 despite large progress on viv based energy harvesting the effect of reynolds number re ρud μ ρ is the fluid density u is the flow velocity d is the cylinder diameter μ is the viscosity on the performance of a viv based energy harvester has seldom been evaluated it is well known that the flow regime around a circular cylinder is highly dependent on the reynolds number achenbach and heinecke 1981 identified the laminar subcritical and critical flow regimes based on visual observation and changes in strouhal number st a more detailed classification of the flow regime around a circular cylinder versus reynolds number was later proposed by zdravkovich 1997 norberg 2003 collected experimental measurements of strouhal number and fluctuating lift coefficient c l in a wide range of reynolds number and further proposed empirical formulas to describe the dependence of st and c l on re as presented in fig 1 due to the reynolds number effect on the fluid elastic effect e g st c l and fluid elastic force the viv response of a circular cylinder is also largely affected by the reynolds number govardhan and williamson 2006 martins and avila 2019 raghavan and bernitsas 2011 typical viv responses of lightly damped circular cylinders in the laminar and subcritical regimes are presented in fig 2 the results for re 4000 originated from the experiments of govardhan and williamson 2006 while those for re 90 150 were obtained from the experiments of anagnostopoulos and bearman 1992 it is demonstrated that the reynolds number affects not only the vibration amplitudes but also the global response behavior in the subcritical regime the response consists of three branches i e the initial upper and lower branches however in the laminar regime the response only consists of the initial and lower branches the smaller lock in range for re 90 150 is due to the higher mass damping parameter and lower reynolds number the upper branch in the subcritical regime diminishes with increasing the mass damping parameter of the circular cylinder this paper presents a numerical investigation to study the influence of the reynolds number on the piezoelectric energy harvesting from vortex induced vibrations of circular cylinders a recently developed aerodynamic damping envelope model zhang et al 2020a 2020b is used to simulate the vortex induced force the aerodynamic damping envelope model is then implemented into a lumped parameter model describing the coupled aero electro mechanical system of the viv based energy harvester wind tunnel experiments are conducted to validate the accuracy of the lumped parameter model and to estimate the power output of the energy harvester aerodynamic parameters of the aerodynamic damping envelope model over a reynolds number range of 500 33000 are identified based on the modified griffin plot proposed in raghavan and bernitsas 2011 the performance of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester is then evaluated in this reynolds number range based on the simulated aero electro mechanical system the subsequent parts of this work are organised as follows the aerodynamic damping envelope model for viv and the lumped parameter model for a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester are described in section 2 the accuracy of the electro aero mechanical model is verified by wind tunnel experiments in section 3 the effect of reynolds number on the performance of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester is examined in section 4 the main conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 mathematical modeling of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester 2 1 aerodynamic

zhang et al 2020c zhang et al 2020d zhao et al 2019b recently zhang et al zou et al 2019 showed that a model of this type can satisfactorily predict the viv amplitudes of a circular cylinder in a wide range of mass damping parameters following their model the aerodynamic force can be expressed as 2 f a i r 0 5 ρ u 2 d 2 π u r h 1 a u r re y u 4 π u r 2 2 h 4 a u r re y c l u r re sin ω s t φ where ρ is the air density a represents the amplitude of the non dimensional displacement y d h 1 and h 4 are amplitude dependent aerodynamic damping and stiffness parameters respectively c l is a parameter to characterize the forcing term in the aerodynamic force ω s 2πs t u d and φ are the shedding frequency and initial phase of the forcing term respectively for lock in responses with large amplitude vibrations the forcing term in the aerodynamic force is negligible morse and williamson 2009 besides if the mass ratio between the cylinder and displaced air is large e g of order 10 or 100 the effect of the aerodynamic stiffness term on the viv response becomes insignificant as a result the forcing term and aerodynamic stiffness term can be removed to simplify equation 2 3 f a i r 0 5 ρ u 2 d 2 π u r h 1 a u r re y u the governing equation of the elastically mounted rigid cylinder i e equation 1 is then formulated as 4 m y 2 ξ 0 ω 0 y ω 0 2 y 0 5 ρ u 2 d 2 π u r h 1 a u r r e y u by moving the left hand term of equation 4 to the right hand side it becomes 5 y 2 m a ω 0 m α 1 π h 1 a u r r e y ω 0 2 y 0 where α mξ 0 m a is a dimensionless mass damping parameter defined by khalak and williamson 1999 and m a πρd 2 4 is the potential fluid added mass as noticed from equation 5 two important parameters that dominate the viv initiation and amplitude of a circular cylinder are α and h 1 a u r r e fig 4 a schematically presents the dimensionless viv amplitudes for a specific re at three mass damping conditions α the peak viv amplitudes a max for α α 1 α 2 and α 3 occur at reduced wind speeds of u r 1 u r 2 and u r 3 respectively the h 1 curves at u r 1 u r 2 and u r 3 are schematically illustrated in fig 4 b on the other hand in order to obtain the maximum power output of a viv based energy harvester in the lock in range it is beneficial to have a representative model that can directly evaluate the peak viv amplitude within the lock in range of a cylinder for this purpose the upper envelope of h 1 a u r at various reduced flow velocities can be merged into a h 1 m a x a curve as highlighted by a blue line in fig 4 b it should be mentioned that the purpose of fig 4 b is to illustrate how to determine h 1 m a x a based on the h 1 a u r schematically practically it is necessary to have the h 1 a u r at more reduced flow velocities i e densely distributed in the lock in range as the upper boundary of h 1 a u r h 1 m a x a represents the variation of the largest negative aerodynamic damping in the lock in range versus vibration amplitude zhang et al 2020a 2020b showed that equation 6 can be utilized as a simplified aerodynamic force model to conveniently calculate the peak viv amplitudes a max of a circular cylinder with different mass damping conditions α 6 f a i r 0 5 ρ u 2 d 2 π u r h 1 m a x a re y u equation 6 is referred to as the aerodynamic damping envelope model by zhang et al 2020a and h 1 m a x a is the aerodynamic damping envelope the following equation can be employed to calculate the peak viv amplitudes in the lock in range of a circular cylinder at various α and re 7 m y 2 ξ 0 ω 0 y ω 0 2 y 0 5 ρ u 2 d 2 π u r h 1 m a x a re y u it should be highlighted that the aerodynamic parameter h 1 a u r re in the model of equation 3 is a function of the reduced flow velocity and hence the model can be utilized to predict the viv amplitudes at various reduced flow velocities in the entire lock in range on the other hand the aerodynamic parameter h 1 m a x a re in the model of equation 6 is independent of the reduced flow velocity since the model is developed to conveniently evaluate the peak viv amplitude without calculating the viv amplitudes in the entire lock in range as discussed by zhang et al 2020b h 1 a u r for a specific re can be extracted according to the viv displacement signals grow to resonance and or decay to resonance at a single mass damping parameter α for a specific re once h 1 a u r are available in the interested ranges of a and u r h 1 m a x a could be then obtained through the least square fitting based on the upper boundary of h 1 a u r as illustrated in fig 4 b however to identify the aerodynamic parameters at different re by this method a huge amount of experimental work is required to obtain the experimental viv signals at various re a more practical method is to identify h 1 m a x a r e based on the griffin plot i e peak viv amplitude a max versus mass damping parameter α at various re at the peak viv amplitude the energy absorbed from flow is completely dissipated by mechanical damping hence the equivalent negative aerodynamic damping ratio is equal to the mechanical damping ratio accordingly for a specific α and re h 1 m a x at the peak viv amplitude can be obtained according to equation 7 as 8 h 1 m a x a m a x π α govardhan and williamson 2006 systematically collected the experimental viv steady state amplitudes reported before 2006 they showed that over the range of re 500 33000 the peak viv amplitudes a max can be approximated as 9 a m a x 1 1 12 α 0 30 α 2 log 0 41 re 0 36 1 1 12 h 1 m a x π 0 30 h 1 m a x 2 π 2 log 0 41 re 0 36 g h 1 m a x r e according to equation 9 h 1 m a x can be approximated as 10 h 1 m a x g 1 a m a x r e for each specific re an amplitude dependent h 1 m a x function can be obtained from equations 9 and 10 it should be noted that the applicability of equation 10 should be limited within re 500 33000 fortunately this covers the interested re range for a lot of practical viv based energy piezoelectric harvesters the only purpose of introducing equations 8 10 is to identify the h 1 m a x a curves at various re the identified h 1 m a x a curves can be used as input aerodynamic parameters to calculate the displacement responses and output power values of an energy harvester at various re and α to check the validity of the h 1 m a x calculated by equation 10 the peak viv amplitudes of an elastically mounted circular cylinder are predicted by the aerodynamic model at re 4000 and 12000 as presented in fig 5 together with available experimental measurements by govardhan and williamson 2006 it is noted that the predicted peak viv amplitudes agree very well with the experimental measurements suggesting that the h 1 m a x can be accurately calculated from equation 10 2 2 estimation of the harvested power as shown in fig 6 a typical viv based piezoelectric energy harvester consists of a circular cylinder a cantilever beam and a piezoelectric transducer bonded at the root of the beam vibration of the beam can be excited by the aerodynamic force acting on the circular cylinder which leads to power generation by the piezoelectric transducer the lumped parameter

determine the accuracy of the electro aero mechanical model for the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester developed in section 2 a wind tunnel with round cross section diameter 0 40 m is utilized to test the performance of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester as presented in fig 7 a the wind tunnel can generate stable incoming flow by installing a honeycomb structure inside the settling chamber as shown in fig 7 c the wind speed is adjustable in the range of 0 u 7 m s and the freestream turbulent intensity is measured to be lower than 0 5 a piezoelectric patch pzt 5 jiayeshi co china of 37 11 0 6 mm3 is bonded on a substrate made of pure aluminium in a dimension of 200 25 0 5 mm3 to form the piezoelectric cantilever beam the capacitance of the piezoelectric transducer c p is 26 0 nf a circular cylinder is connected at the free end of a piezoelectric cantilever beam as shown in fig 7 b the circular cylinder is a 0 118 m long hard foam with a diameter of 0 032 m the mechanical damping ratio ξ 0 of the piezoelectric harvester can be calculated according to the free vibration decay response in still air using the logarithmic decrement technique a hot wire anemometer model 405i testo co usa is adopted to measure the wind velocity u the voltage output of the harvester is measured by a digital oscilloscope model ds1104s rigol china main parameters of the prototype in the present experiments are listed in table 1 the reynolds number range of the present experiments is re 4000 6000 and the peak viv amplitude occurs at re 5000 to identify the aerodynamic parameters h 1 the viv grow to resonance signals are recorded at various wind speeds some examples are presented in fig 8 for a specific reduced flow velocity u r the amplitude dependent damping ratio ξ a d of a grow to resonance displacement signal can be identified with the algorithm developed by zhang and xu 2018 the equivalent aerodynamic damping ratio can be expressed as 14 ξ a e r o a d ξ a d ξ 0 h 1 at this reduced wind speed is then obtained as 15 h 1 4 m ξ a e r o a d ρ d 2 h 1 for various u r are identified based on the grow to resonance signals as presented in fig 9 the identified h 1 can be used as input aerodynamic parameters for equation 12 to calculate the displacement responses and output power values of the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester at various reduced wind speeds 3 2 comparison between experimental and simulated results the plotted curves in fig 8 compare the experimental and simulated viv displacement time histories to verify the aerodynamic force model described in section 2 1 results of three reduced wind speeds i e near the onset threshold in the middle of the lock in range and near the end threshold are presented it is noted that the time varying amplitudes of simulated displacement histories agree very well with the experimental results for both amplitude increasing stage and steady state stage to validate the representative model for the aero electro mechanical system described in section 2 2 the experimental and simulated viv amplitudes and power outputs of the piezoelectric energy harvester are compared fig 10 compares the experimentally measured and simulated power outputs versus load resistance at a reduced wind speed of u r 5 91 the prediction error is smaller than 5 for most load resistances while the error is higher than 15 for r 100 3000 and 50000 kω this should be mainly due the errors of the identified aerodynamic mechanical and electrical parameters fig 11 compares the experimentally measured and simulated viv amplitudes and power outputs versus the reduced wind speed in the lock in range the average power is calculated using joule s law in conjunction with ohm s law average power rms voltage rms voltage load resistance rms root mean square it is noted that the simulated results agree quite well with the experimental measurements indeed both the optimal load resistance and power outputs in the lock in range can be satisfactorily produced by the representative electro aero mechanical model the comparisons confirm that this model can be utilized to simulate the behavior of the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester with reasonable accuracy hence the representative electro aero mechanical model of equation 12 can be utilized to study the effect of reynolds number on the performance of viv based piezoelectric energy harvesters as stated earlier the maximum viv amplitude and hence the maximum power output of the present experiments occurs at re 5000 h 1 m a x for re 5000 is calculated based on equation 10 and then substituted into equation 13 to calculate the maximum viv amplitude and maximum power output as presented in fig 11 the resulting maximum dimensionless amplitude and maximum power output are 0 66 and 9 99 mw respectively which agree well with the experimental values 0 69 and 9 51 mw respectively the agreements suggest that equation 10 can be used to calculate the aerodynamic damping envelope and hence equation 13 is applicable to calculate the maximum viv amplitude and maximum power output of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester at various reynolds numbers 4 effect of re on performance of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester 4 1 effect of re on power output in the lock in range in order to demonstrate the reynolds number effect on the levels of the harvested power of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester in the lock in range the power outputs at three typical reynolds numbers i e re 100 in the laminar regime and re 4000 6000 and re 10000 in the subcritical regime will be calculated based on the representative electro aero mechanical model of equation 12 the aerodynamic damping parameters h 1 for re 4000 6000 are identified from the experiments in section 3 as presented in fig 9 the h 1 for re 10000 are constructed from the forced vibration experiments of gopalkrishnan 1993 as shown in fig 12 a the h 1 for re 100 are identified based on the computational simulation procedure developed in zhang et al 2020d zhao et al 2019b forced vibration numerical simulations two dimensional unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes simulations are conducted based on the commercial program ansys fluent the computational domain and boundary conditions are schematically shown in fig 13 a the computational domain extends upstream and downstream the circular cylinder by 10d around the circular cylinder refined quadrilateral cells are generated with an initial thickness of 0 03 mm at the tube surface and a growth factor of 1 15 along the radial direction until the 20th layer unstructured grids are used for the rest of the computational domain the total grid number is 45626 which is proved to be enough according to a sensitivity study of mesh dependency fig 13 b presents a partial view of the mesh around the tube surfaces the time step length is selected according to a sensitivity study which proves that a time step of 0 005 s is sufficient to ensure the simulation the simulated h 1 are given in fig 12 b the aerodynamic parameters h 1 for re 100 re 4000 6000 and re 10000 are substituted into the representative electro aero mechanical model of equation 12 to calculate the displacement responses and power outputs of the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester in the lock in range the mass damping and electrical parameters for the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester are the same as those given in table 1 the performances of the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester at three different reynolds numbers are given in fig 14 it is noted that the reynolds number affects not only the values but also the global branches of the power output the maximum power output at re 100 is about 6 62 mw while that at re 4000 6000 and re 12000 are about 9 51 and 14 4 mw respectively the effective wind range for power harvesting is also affected by the reynolds number similar to the viv responses for re 90 150 given in fig 1 the results for re 100 in the laminar regime consists of an initial branch and a lower branch the results in the subcritical regime are supposed to include three branches i e the initial upper and lower branches the upper branches are not clear for the two cases re 4000 6000 and re 10000 due to the limited available reduced wind speeds however according to govardhan and williamson 2006 the results with dimensionless amplitude higher than 0 6 belong to the upper branch therefore the results for re 4000 6000 and re 10000 both include three branches these observations highlight the necessity to consider the reynolds number effect in the design of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester for a specific viv based piezoelectric energy harvester several measures e g increasing the surface roughness the diameter and the natural frequency could be adopted to increase its working reynolds number range fig 15 presents the performances of the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester at various load resistances r for re 4000 6000 and re 10000 the results of the viv amplitudes are not shown since they are only slightly affected by the load resistance it is noted that the optimal load resistance is not affected by the reduced wind speed because it depends on the capacitance and natural frequency of the system which are considered constant in this study the lock in range is insignificantly affected by the load resistance in the considered range which agrees with the observations in wang et al 2020c 4 2 effect of re on maximum power output after highlighting the effect of reynolds number on the performance of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester in section 4 1 the effect of reynolds number on the maximum harvested power output is examined in this section the representative electro aero mechanical model of equation 13 can be utilized together with the aerodynamic damping envelope h 1 m a x calculated by equation 10 to study the reynolds number effect on the maximum harvested power output for a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester fig 16 presents the variation of maximum power output as a function of the electrical load resistance at various reynolds numbers the mass and electrical parameters for the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester are the same as those given in table 1 while a zero mechanical damping is adopted to obtain the highest viv amplitudes and power outputs at various re the maximum power output increases with the load resistance until an optimal value and then decreases the optimal load resistance is not affected by the reynolds number because it depends on the capacitance and natural frequency of the system which are considered constant in this study the effect of the reynolds number on the maximum power output is also clearly highlighted in fig 16 the maximum power output increases with increasing the reynolds number the value at re 500 is about 7 9 mw while that at re 30000 is as high as 34 5 mw the variation of maximum power output versus reynolds number is shown in fig 17 for several mechanical damping levels it is noted that the maximum power output decreases with increasing the mechanical damping ratio ξ 0 for re 30000 the maximum power output at ξ 0 3 0 is 1 7 mw while that at ξ 0 0 is as high as 34 5 mw for lower mechanical damping ratio the maximum power output varies significantly with the reynolds number however the reynolds number effect is significantly reduced by increasing the mechanical damping ratio for ξ 0 0 the maximum power output increases from 7 9 mw to 35 3 mw as the reynolds number increase from 500 to 33000 as a comparison for ξ 0 3 0 the maximum power output increases from 0 39 mw to 1 56 mw as the reynolds number increase from 500 to 33000 the results indicate that the performance of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester is more sensitive to the reynolds number for a case with low mechanical damping ratio the variation of maximum power output versus mechanical damping ratio is shown in fig 18 for several reynolds numbers it is noted that the effect of mechanical damping ratio on the maximum power output is more profound for higher reynold numbers for re 30000 the maximum power output decreases from 34 5 mw to 1 7 mw as the mechanical damping ratio increases from 0 to 3 0 for re 500 the maximum power output decreases from 3 3 mw to 0 7 mw as the mechanical damping ratio increases from 0 to 3 0 the results suggest that the performance of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester is more sensitive to the mechanical damping at high reynolds number 5 conclusions this paper presented a numerical investigation to study the effect of reynolds number on piezoelectric energy harvesting from vortex induced vibration of a circular cylinder the aerodynamic force was simulated by a model with amplitude dependent aerodynamic parameters and an aerodynamic damping envelope model the amplitude dependent aerodynamic parameters at two typical reynolds numbers were identified based on free vibration experiments and forced vibration numerical simulations respectively the aerodynamic damping envelopes over a reynolds number range of 500 33000 were identified based on the reynolds number dependent griffin plot a plot showing the peak viv amplitude versus the mass damping parameter proposed by govardhan and williamson 2006 the mechanical parameters and piezoelectric coupling in the system were represented by the standard electronic components the aerodynamic mechanical and piezoelectric blocks were implemented into a representative electro aero mechanical model to simulate the aero electro mechanical system of the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester wind tunnel experiments were carried out to validate the accuracy of the representative electro aero mechanical model for the viv based piezoelectric energy harvester a parametric study was then presented to study the reynolds number effect on the bifurcation diagrams and maximum power output of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester some important conclusions were given as 1 both the lock in range and power outputs within lock in of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester increase with increasing the reynolds number the reynolds number also affects the global branches of the power output in the subcritical regime the power output consists of three branches i e initial upper and lower branches however in the laminar regime the power output only consists of the initial and lower branches the upper branch in the subcritical regime diminished with increasing the mass damping parameter 2 the optimal load resistance of a viv based piezoelectric energy harvester was almost not affected by the reynolds number when the same capacitance and natural frequency are considered the performance of an energy harvester is more sensitive to the reynolds number for a case with a low mechanical damping ratio on the other hand the performance of an energy harvester is more sensitive to mechanical damping at a high reynolds number credit authorship contribution statement mingjie zhang conceptualization

20483,to obtain the hydrodynamic loads of a floating horizontal axis tidal turbine with rotation and pitching motion under the free surface condition a numerical simulation method based on cfd is established the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients at different pitch periods pitch amplitudes and blade tip immersion depths were analyzed the results show that the instantaneous values of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients have obvious periodic fluctuations and the fluctuation amplitude increases with the increase of the pitch frequency and amplitude on this basis the damping and additional mass coefficients are obtained based on the least square method the damping coefficient of inflow direction load and power coefficients fluctuates periodically and the fluctuation period is equal to the pitch period the damping coefficient of pitching moment coefficient also fluctuates periodically and the fluctuation period is not only related to pitch period but also related to the rotation period of the turbine the research findings can provide relevant data for studying the coupling motion of floating tidal current energy device and control design of the output electricity keywords horizontal axis turbine hydrodynamic performance pitching motion damping coefficient free surface 1 introduction tidal energy is an attractive form of clean and renewable energy resources which is sustainable predictable and richly distributed along the coastal regions adcock et al 2015 charlier 2003 li et al 2010 it has been reported that an available tidal power of 95 and 61 3 twh year are available in the uk and china respectively the crown estate and 2012 u 2012 liu et al 2011 the horizontal axis tidal turbine hatt has caught the attention of many scholars because it experiences less intense load changes in the flow field features little flow interference and achieves stable power output in deep waters defined as being deeper than 70 m a number of floating tidal turbines have been proposed the major advantage of floating tidal turbines is that they can be easily maintained as all electrical equipment can be placed inside the floating structure and they tend to be easier and quicker to install brown et al 2020 zhou et al 2017 another consideration is that the tidal flow is stronger near the sea surface and therefore a floating tidal turbine can generate more energy compared to a bottom mounted one at the same site guo et al 2018a however due to the presence of waves the turbine generates wave motion along with the floating platform together which may induce large dynamic loads on the blade leading to unexpected structure failure therefore the hydrodynamic characteristics of a hatt on a floating platform is necessary and valuable subject and we study it in detail in this paper recently many studies have investigated the dynamic behavior of turbine performance of scale model hatts immersed in towing and flume tanks to highlight the turbine dynamic loading resulted from wave current interactions in 2013 lust et al 2013 carried out experiments in a towing tank with regular waves their studies confirmed that the average power and thrust were unaffected by the passing waves in 2014 galloway et al 2014 investigated wave effects on a 3 bladed hatt device being towed at 0 9 m s in regular waves they also found that the presence of waves did not affect the time averaged torque and thrust but imposed fluctuating loads in 2015 milne et al 2015 presented experiments to measure unsteady bending moments at the blade root for a scaled hatt subjected to planar forcing in a towing tank they found that the unsteady blade loads increased with frequency and exceeded steady loads by up to 15 in 2018 guo et al 2018b studied the hydrodynamic performance of a scale model turbine immersed in a towing tank with towing velocity of 0 68 m s the fluctuation amplitudes of thrust and torque reached up to 50 of their mean values due to surface waves of 1 6 s wave period and 0 14 m wave height in 2019 draycott et al 2019 conducted the model test on a three bladed hatt to further the fundamental understanding of the influence of regular waves in both following current and opposing current conditions results demonstrated that the wave induced fluctuations increased with wave amplitude but decreased with wave frequency and following wave conditions exhibit greater variations than opposing for waves with the same wave height and frequency due to the lower associated wavenumbers similar hydrodynamic turbine tests were also carried out by barltrop barltrop et al 2007 gaurier gaurier et al 2013 luznik luznik et al 2013 and henriques de jesus henriques et al 2014 et al in summary most of the previous studies are about hatt revolving around the fixed axis and with no movement relative to the floating platform however the wave excited motion of the floating platform influences the hydrodynamic loads of the hatt in practice it is necessary to study the relationship between the hydrodynamic loads of the hatt and the movement of the floating platform the hydrodynamic analysis of a horizontal axis turbine and floating platform in a wave current field is very complicated the hydrodynamic loads of the turbine depend on the current velocity rotational speed of the turbine speed of the waves and motion of the floating platform in this paper we simplify the hydrodynamic problems and propose the following assumptions 1 the horizontal axis turbine is fixed on a floating platform and the floating platform exhibits relatively simple harmonic motion that is caused by wave excitation 2 the inflow velocity is a constant that is not influenced by the waves but the influence of free surface is considered 3 the turbine is working with constant rotational speed in floating tidal current power station as shown in fig 1 the floating platform is easily pitched in the presence of waves literature reports zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2019 that the hydrodynamic load of a hatt with surging and rotational motion is affected by the frequency and amplitude of the surge however it does not consider the influence of the free surface hence based on previous research a numerical simulation method of hatt rotating and pitching motion under free surface conditions is established and the hydrodynamic loads under different pitch periods pitch amplitudes and blade tip immersion depths are analyzed on this basis the hydrodynamic load is divided into the hydrodynamic load with rotation only the damping force related to the pitch angle velocity and the additional mass force related to the pitch angle acceleration based on the least square method the damping and additional mass coefficients at different pitch periods pitch amplitudes and blade tip immersion depths are obtained the ultimate purpose of this paper is to get the approximate functional relationship between the hydrodynamic load and pitching motion of the turbine under the free surface condition so as to predict the hydrodynamic load of the turbine quickly and approximately

and isothermal ideal gas is selected to account for the air compressibility the isothermal law is selected in current study because of the fact that the air compressibility and temperature variation at such small scales are negligible assuming isothermal avoids solving an ordinary energy transport equation and hence reduces computational time 3 cfd numerical simulations 3 1 calculation model the turbine rotor blades used in the calculation model were designed by the institute of renewable energy deep sea center harbin engineering university wang 2015 a cross sectional airfoil with a blade extending is s809 and the form of varying chord length and pitch angle is adopted the chord length and pitch angle of different radius sections are shown in table 1 the turbine diameter and blade number are 0 7 m and 2 respectively and the hubs at both ends are hemispherical and have diameters of 0 1d the distance between the hatt rotation axis and the center of the pitch is 5d 7 the hatt model is shown in fig 1a two right handed cartesian coordinate systems are defined which can be seen in fig 2 one is the space fixed system oxyz with its origin o placed at the pitch center and the x axis is in the direction of tidal current and the z axis points upwards the other is a body fixed system oxyz with its origin o placed at the rotating center of the hatt and the x axis is the direction of the rotating axis in this paper an overlapping grid is used to simulate the turbine with rotation and pitching θ a p sin ω p t motion therefore two domains are established the background domain and the rotation domain the background domain is the area that simulates the flow field and should be as large as possible the distances of the turbine rotation plane from the inlet boundary and the outlet boundary of the background domain are 5d and 15d respectively and the distance of the turbine rotation axis from the bottom and the side of the background domain are 5d since the simulation is two phase flow the distance between the rotating center of hatt and the top side of the background domain is set as 2 5d in order to reduce the calculation 3 2 mesh grid model the work wang et al 2014 has studied the number and convergence of meshes the results showed that when the number of cells reached 2 31 million and the height of the first layer of mesh on the model surface was 0 0005 m the mesh was continued to be refined and the calculation results have basically not been changed in this paper the mesh is refined on the basis of the method wang et al 2014 which improves the mesh quality at the hatt surface and the free surface area the target size and minimum size of turbine surface are set as 0 002 m and 0 0005 m in fig 2b as shown in fig 2c the height of the turbine surface mesh of the first layer height is 0 0005 m the stretching ratio is 1 1 the number of boundary layers is 10 and the y ranges in 0 7 48 in fig 2e the cells around the free surface and the turbine are hierarchically refined in order to capture the deformation of the free surface it should be noted that the grid scale of the background domain within the motion range of the rotation domain should be basically the same as that of the boundary grid scale of the rotation domain because of the overlapping grid model the total number of cells is more than 5 6 million 3 3 boundary conditions rotation and pitching motion are realized by overlapping grid the overlapping grid method divides the rotation and background domains separately and then embeds the rotation domain mesh into the background domain mesh resulting in overlapping parts between the meshes after pre processing such as digging holes the overlapping parts of the meshes in the background domain will be removed and excluded from the calculation and the interpolation relationship will be established in the remaining overlapping area of meshes finally the interpolation method enables the data exchange between the rotation domain and background domain meshes in the overlapping area so as to achieve the overall calculation of the flow field the motion model of rotation and pitching is established and then the pitching and rotation angular velocities are given in the rotation domain this paper set the atmosphere as the reference pressure and the direction of gravitational acceleration z the inlet boundary inlet is set to velocity entry and a uniform flow velocity u 1 5 m s and turbulence parameters are given the outlet boundary uses the pressure outlet and the hydrostatic pressure is given according to the blade tip immersion depth the volume fractions of water and air at the inlet and outlet are given the bottom and sides of the computational domain are set as free slip walls the top of the computational domain is set as an open pressure boundary and the volume fraction of water and air are 0 and 1 respectively the surface of the hatt is set as the non slip wall the background and rotating domains are connected by an overlapping grid the boundary conditions are set as shown in fig 3 moreover we set the hatt rotating 2 for each time step and the simulation results has reached the convergence criterion under the given time step during computing process spatial discrete uses high resolution scheme which owns second order or higher order accurate and temporal discrete adopts second order implicit scheme sst k ω model was first proposed by menter in 1994 menter 1994 the model combines the advantages of two mainstream two equation turbulence models k ω model and standard k ε model through shear stress transport formula it is a popular turbulence model at present therefore the turbulence model used in this study is the sst k ω model the sst k ω model has demonstrated better flow separation prediction and more accurate performance assessment in several turbine cfd studies wang et al 2012 sufian et al 2017 elhanafi 2016 4 result and analysis 4 1 hydrodynamic load of the hatt the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients are defined as follows 4 c f x f x 1 2 ρ u 2 π r 2 5 c p m x ω t 1 2 ρ u 3 π r 2 6 c m p m y 1 2 ρ u 2 π r 2 l 7 t ω p t the actual turbine diameter is 4 m the tidal current velocity is 3 5 m s and the wave period is 5 10 s the diameter of the calculation model is 0 7 m according to the similarity theory the velocity in numerical simulation is about 1 5 m s and the wave period is about 2 1 4 5 s it is assumed that the pitching motion response of the floating carrier occurs and the pitch period is the same as the wave period 4 2 validity verification based rotation the above grid model and boundary condition set were used to simulate the test state of institute of renewable energy deep sea center harbin engineering university u 1 5 m s h 0 79d and then the inflow direction load and power coefficients of the hatt with different rotation speed were obtained under the experimental condition the hatt only rotates the comparison between the experimental values and the average values of the calculated results are shown in fig 4 the average value refers to the arithmetic average of the calculated results when the turbine rotates once it can be seen that the calculated value and the experimental value are basically the same the result verifies the feasibility and accuracy of the numerical method on studying the hydrodynamic characteristics of the hatt under the condition of free surface it should be noted that since deep sea center renewable energy institute of harbin engineering university measures the output power of the generator during the turbine test the experimental data in the figure are the revised values 4 3 influence of the pitch period on hydrodynamic performance of the hatt to understand the effects of the pitch period on the hatt performance multiple pitch periods 2 1 s 2 5 s 2 9 s 3 5 s and 4 5 s are selected for numerical simulation to obtain the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients and the results are presented in fig 5 the blade tip immersion depth is set as d 8 the pitch amplitude is 10 the rotational speed is 230 r min and the uniform flow velocity is 1 5 m s in fig 5 when the turbine generates rotation and pitching coupled motion the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients generate clear periodic fluctuations with the hatt pitching the fluctuation frequency is consistent with the pitch frequency and the fluctuation amplitude increases as the pitch period decreases due to the existence of the free surface the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients will generate micro amplitude fluctuation with the hatt rotation the frequency of the micro amplitude fluctuation is twice as many as the rotational frequency for a 2 blade hatt and the fluctuation amplitude increases with the decrease of the pitch period the reason is that the pitching motion changes the angle of the inflow direction and the turbine rotation plane so the magnitude and direction of the relative velocity at the turbine rotation plane changes constantly the smaller the period is the faster the relative velocity of the hatt changes so the larger the amplitude and frequency of the hatt load fluctuation at the pitch equilibrium position the pitch velocity reaches the maximum and the direction of pitch velocity and inflow velocity are parallel which causes the relative velocity of the turbine at the equilibrium position reaches the maximum the pitch velocity direction is opposite to the direction of inflow and minimum the pitch velocity direction is the same as the inflow direction as a result the hydrodynamic loads of the hatt at the equilibrium position reaches the maximum and minimum values 4 4 influence of the pitch amplitude on hydrodynamic performance of the hatt to understand the effects of the pitch amplitude on the hatt performance three pitch amplitudes 7 5 10 and 12 5 are selected for numerical simulation to obtain the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients and the results are presented in fig 6 the blade tip immersion depth is set as d 8 the pitch period is 2 9 s the rotational speed is 230 r min and the uniform flow velocity is 1 5 m s as shown in fig 6 with the increase of pith amplitude the fluctuation amplitude of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients increase gradually but the fluctuation periods stay the same the mean values of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients decrease slightly this is because that the pitch amplitude determines the amplitude of the pitch velocity and pitch angle which is similar to the reason for the impact of pitch frequency on the loads as the pitch amplitude increases the amplitude of the relative velocity and the angle change at the turbine rotation plane concurrently increase so the amplitude of the hatt load fluctuation increases as well therefore the motion amplitude of the floating platform should be minimized to enhance the structural security of the hatt system during the design process 4 5 influence of the blade tip immersion depth on hydrodynamic performance of the hatt the pitch period and amplitude are 2 9 s and 10 respectively the rotational speed is 230 r min and the uniform flow velocity is 1 5 m s the hydrodynamic loads of the hatt under different blade tip immersion depths 0d d 8 d 4 3d 8 and d 2 are calculated the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients are all obtained which can be seen in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the mean values of inflow direction load coefficient power and pitching moment coefficients gradually increases with the blade tip immersion depth increase but the rate of growth gradually decreases with the blade tip immersion depth increases the amplitude of fluctuations based on the rotation frequency of the hatt gradually decreases but the amplitude of fluctuations based on the pitch frequency change little the main reason is that the existence of the free surface and pitching motion changes the magnitude and direction of relative velocity of the hatt during one revolution as a result the hydrodynamic load fluctuates based on the two times rotation frequency in addition the diffusion of the flow field is limited by the existence of the free surface which leads to a slight increase in the amplitude of the fluctuation based on the pitch frequency with the increase of the blade tip immersion depth 5 load decomposition analysis according to the analysis of the calculation results in section 4 the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients have multi frequency periodic fluctuations based on the pitch frequency and turbine rotation frequency therefore based on fourier series expansion method the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients can be written as the following trigonometric series 8 c f x c f x 0 i 0 1

inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients fig 8 shows the comparison curve between cfd calculated value and fitting value for inflow direction load and power coefficients fit

has basically been in complete agreement with the cfd calculated value therefore in the subsequent analysis for the fitting of the inflow direction load and power coefficients take m 0 1 n 1 n 2 2 m 1 m 2 0 for the fitting of pitching moment coefficient take m 0 0 n 1 n 2 1 m 1 m 2 1 n 1 n 2 2 m 1 m 2 0 the dimensionless pitch angle velocity and acceleration are defined as eqs 11 and 12 respectively eqs 8 10 can be written as eq 13 15 that is the hydrodynamic load is divided into three parts the hydrodynamic load when only rotating the damping force related to the pitch angle velocity and the additional mass force related to the pitch angle acceleration 11 u p a p ω p cos ω p t l p u 12 a p a p ω p 2 sin ω p t l p 2 u 2 13 c f x c f x 0 c f x 1 sin n ω t t ψ f x t 1 c f x

additional mass coefficient is basically stable during the motion but the damping coefficient will change periodically with the pitch motion for pitching moment coefficient the damping coefficient changes periodically with the rotation and pitching motion while the additional mass coefficient only changes periodically with the rotation 5 1 effect of the pitch period on the fitting coefficient based on eq 13 15 the least squares method is used to fit the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients at different pitch periods and the correlation coefficients in eq 13 15 can be obtained and the results are shown in tables 2 4 it can be seen from tables 2 4 that with the increase of the pitch period the c f x 0 c p 0 and c m p 0 basically remains stable that is the change of pitch period has no effect on the time mean values of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients with the increase of the period the average value of the damping coefficient is basically stable for the inflow direction load coefficient the fluctuation amplitude of the damping coefficient increases with the increase of pitch period for the power coefficient the fluctuation amplitude of the damping coefficient increases slightly with the increase of pitch period for pitching moment coefficient with the increase of pitch period the fluctuation amplitude of damping coefficient based on rotation frequency is basically stable but the fluctuation amplitude of damping coefficient based on pitch frequency increases gradually according to eqs 11 and 12 compared with the damping coefficient the influence of the additional mass coefficient on the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients is much smaller which can be ignored 5 2 effect of the pitch amplitude on the fitting coefficient based on eq 13 15 the least squares method is used to fit the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients at different pitch amplitudes and the correlation coefficients in eq 13 15 can be obtained which are given in tables 5 7 it can be seen from tables 5 7 that with the increase of the pitch amplitude the c f x 0 c p 0 and c m p 0 gradually decreases that is the time mean value of inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients gradually decreases this is because the larger the pitch amplitude is the larger the variation range of the angle between the rotating axis of the hatt and the inflow velocity is which leads to the decrease of the time mean value of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients with the increase of pitch amplitude the average value of damping coefficient is basically stable but the fluctuation amplitude of the damping coefficient based on pitch frequency increases gradually the average value of additional mass coefficient is basically stable and the additional mass coefficient is far less than the damping coefficient for pitching moment coefficient the fluctuation amplitude of the damping coefficient based on rotation frequency and the fluctuation amplitude of the added mass coefficient keep stable with the increase of pitch amplitude 5 3 effect of the blade tip immersion depth on the fitting coefficient based on eq 13 15 the least squares method is used to fit the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients at different blade tip immersion depths and the correlation coefficients in eq 13 15 can be obtained as shown in tables 8 10 it can be seen from tables 8 10 that with the increase of the blade tip immersion depth the c f x 0 c p 0 and c m p 0 gradually increases but the increasing rate decreases gradually the average value of the damping coefficient increases slightly but the fluctuation amplitude of the damping coefficient based on pitch frequency is basically stable the average value of the additional mass coefficient decreases gradually and the additional mass coefficient is far less than the damping coefficient this is because with the increase of the blade tip immersion depth the influence of free surface on the hydrodynamic force of turbine decreases gradually which leads to the increase of the time mean value of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients for pitching moment coefficient with the increase of the blade tip immersion depth the fluctuation amplitude of the damping coefficient based on rotation frequency keeps stable and the fluctuation amplitude of the added mass coefficient decreases gradually 5 4 verification of load decomposition the purpose of eq 13 15 is to divide the load into three parts the hydrodynamic load when only rotating the damping force related to the pitch angle velocity and the additional mass force related to the pitch angle acceleration in order to verify the validity of eq 13 15 the calculation results based on eq 13 15 are compared with the cfd results as shown in fig 9 cal1 and cal2 represent the calculation results obtained by eq 13 15 cal1 ignore the influence of additional mass coefficient and cal2 consider the influence of additional mass coefficient as seen in fig 9 the calculation values of eq 13 15 ignoring the added mass coefficient effects are basically consistent with the cfd calculation values it verifies the accuracy of eq 13 15 and proves that eq 13 15 can reflect the hydrodynamic load characteristics of the hatt with rotation and pitching motion under different pitch periods pitch amplitudes and blade tip immersion depth it also shows that the effect of additional mass on hydrodynamic loads of the hatt with rotation and pitching motion under the condition of free surface is very small 6 conclusions in this paper a numerical simulation method for the hatt with rotation and pitching motion under the condition of free surface is established on this basis the hydrodynamic load is divided into three parts based on its characteristics and they are the hydrodynamic load when rotating only the damping force related to the pitch angle velocity and the additional mass force related to the pitch angle acceleration the variation rules of the damping and additional mass coefficients under different the pitch periods pitch amplitudes and blade tip immersion depths can be obtained by the least square method the study demonstrates the followings 1 the instantaneous values of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients have obvious periodic fluctuations the overall fluctuation frequency is equal to the pitch frequency and the micro amplitude fluctuation frequency is twice as many as the rotational frequency as the pitch frequency and amplitude increase the average values of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients change little but the fluctuation amplitude increases gradually 2 with the blade tip immersion depth increase the mean values of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients increase gradually 3 the influence of damping coefficient on the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients is very obvious while the influence of additional mass coefficient can be neglected 4 for inflow direction load and power coefficients the damping coefficient fluctuates periodically with pitching motion and the fluctuation period is equal to pitch period with the increase of the pitch frequency and amplitude the mean value of damping coefficient is basically stable but its amplitude increases gradually 5 for pitching moment coefficient the damping coefficient fluctuates periodically with rotation and pitching motion with the increase of the pitch frequency and amplitude the average value of the damping coefficient and the fluctuation amplitude of the damping coefficient based on rotation frequency are basically stable but the fluctuation amplitude of the damping coefficient based on pitch frequency increases gradually credit authorship

20483,to obtain the hydrodynamic loads of a floating horizontal axis tidal turbine with rotation and pitching motion under the free surface condition a numerical simulation method based on cfd is established the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients at different pitch periods pitch amplitudes and blade tip immersion depths were analyzed the results show that the instantaneous values of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients have obvious periodic fluctuations and the fluctuation amplitude increases with the increase of the pitch frequency and amplitude on this basis the damping and additional mass coefficients are obtained based on the least square method the damping coefficient of inflow direction load and power coefficients fluctuates periodically and the fluctuation period is equal to the pitch period the damping coefficient of pitching moment coefficient also fluctuates periodically and the fluctuation period is not only related to pitch period but also related to the rotation period of the turbine the research findings can provide relevant data for studying the coupling motion of floating tidal current energy device and control design of the output electricity keywords horizontal axis turbine hydrodynamic performance pitching motion damping coefficient free surface 1 introduction tidal energy is an attractive form of clean and renewable energy resources which is sustainable predictable and richly distributed along the coastal regions adcock et al 2015 charlier 2003 li et al 2010 it has been reported that an available tidal power of 95 and 61 3 twh year are available in the uk and china respectively the crown estate and 2012 u 2012 liu et al 2011 the horizontal axis tidal turbine hatt has caught the attention of many scholars because it experiences less intense load changes in the flow field features little flow interference and achieves stable power output in deep waters defined as being deeper than 70 m a number of floating tidal turbines have been proposed the major advantage of floating tidal turbines is that they can be easily maintained as all electrical equipment can be placed inside the floating structure and they tend to be easier and quicker to install brown et al 2020 zhou et al 2017 another consideration is that the tidal flow is stronger near the sea surface and therefore a floating tidal turbine can generate more energy compared to a bottom mounted one at the same site guo et al 2018a however due to the presence of waves the turbine generates wave motion along with the floating platform together which may induce large dynamic loads on the blade leading to unexpected structure failure therefore the hydrodynamic characteristics of a hatt on a floating platform is necessary and valuable subject and we study it in detail in this paper recently many studies have investigated the dynamic behavior of turbine performance of scale model hatts immersed in towing and flume tanks to highlight the turbine dynamic loading resulted from wave current interactions in 2013 lust et al 2013 carried out experiments in a towing tank with regular waves their studies confirmed that the average power and thrust were unaffected by the passing waves in 2014 galloway et al 2014 investigated wave effects on a 3 bladed hatt device being towed at 0 9 m s in regular waves they also found that the presence of waves did not affect the time averaged torque and thrust but imposed fluctuating loads in 2015 milne et al 2015 presented experiments to measure unsteady bending moments at the blade root for a scaled hatt subjected to planar forcing in a towing tank they found that the unsteady blade loads increased with frequency and exceeded steady loads by up to 15 in 2018 guo et al 2018b studied the hydrodynamic performance of a scale model turbine immersed in a towing tank with towing velocity of 0 68 m s the fluctuation amplitudes of thrust and torque reached up to 50 of their mean values due to surface waves of 1 6 s wave period and 0 14 m wave height in 2019 draycott et al 2019 conducted the model test on a three bladed hatt to further the fundamental understanding of the influence of regular waves in both following current and opposing current conditions results demonstrated that the wave induced fluctuations increased with wave amplitude but decreased with wave frequency and following wave conditions exhibit greater variations than opposing for waves with the same wave height and frequency due to the lower associated wavenumbers similar hydrodynamic turbine tests were also carried out by barltrop barltrop et al 2007 gaurier gaurier et al 2013 luznik luznik et al 2013 and henriques de jesus henriques et al 2014 et al in summary most of the previous studies are about hatt revolving around the fixed axis and with no movement relative to the floating platform however the wave excited motion of the floating platform influences the hydrodynamic loads of the hatt in practice it is necessary to study the relationship between the hydrodynamic loads of the hatt and the movement of the floating platform the hydrodynamic analysis of a horizontal axis turbine and floating platform in a wave current field is very complicated the hydrodynamic loads of the turbine depend on the current velocity rotational speed of the turbine speed of the waves and motion of the floating platform in this paper we simplify the hydrodynamic problems and propose the following assumptions 1 the horizontal axis turbine is fixed on a floating platform and the floating platform exhibits relatively simple harmonic motion that is caused by wave excitation 2 the inflow velocity is a constant that is not influenced by the waves but the influence of free surface is considered 3 the turbine is working with constant rotational speed in floating tidal current power station as shown in fig 1 the floating platform is easily pitched in the presence of waves literature reports zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2019 that the hydrodynamic load of a hatt with surging and rotational motion is affected by the frequency and amplitude of the surge however it does not consider the influence of the free surface hence based on previous research a numerical simulation method of hatt rotating and pitching motion under free surface conditions is established and the hydrodynamic loads under different pitch periods pitch amplitudes and blade tip immersion depths are analyzed on this basis the hydrodynamic load is divided into the hydrodynamic load with rotation only the damping force related to the pitch angle velocity and the additional mass force related to the pitch angle acceleration based on the least square method the damping and additional mass coefficients at different pitch periods pitch amplitudes and blade tip immersion depths are obtained the ultimate purpose of this paper is to get the approximate functional relationship between the hydrodynamic load and pitching motion of the turbine under the free surface condition so as to predict the hydrodynamic load of the turbine quickly and approximately

method along with high resolution interface capturing hric scheme wacławczyk and koronowicz 2008 are employed to resolve the free surface simulations are carried out by using a segregated flow model and isothermal ideal gas is selected to account for the air compressibility the isothermal law is selected in current study because of the fact that the air compressibility and temperature variation at such small scales are negligible assuming isothermal avoids solving an ordinary energy transport equation and hence reduces computational time 3 cfd numerical simulations 3 1 calculation model the turbine rotor blades used in the calculation model were designed by the institute of renewable energy deep sea center harbin engineering university wang 2015 a cross sectional airfoil with a blade extending is s809 and the form of varying chord length and pitch angle is adopted the chord length and pitch angle of different radius sections are shown in table 1 the turbine diameter and blade number are 0 7 m and 2 respectively and the hubs at both ends are hemispherical and have diameters of 0 1d the distance between the hatt rotation axis and the center of the pitch is 5d 7 the hatt model is shown in fig 1a two right handed cartesian coordinate systems are defined which can be seen in fig 2 one is the space fixed system oxyz with its origin o placed at the pitch center and the x axis is in the direction of tidal current and the z axis points upwards the other is a body fixed system oxyz with its origin o placed at the rotating center of the hatt and the x axis is the direction of the rotating axis in this paper an overlapping grid is used to simulate the turbine with rotation and pitching θ a p sin ω p t motion therefore two domains are established the background domain and the rotation domain the background domain is the area that simulates the flow field and should be as large as possible the distances of the turbine rotation plane from the inlet boundary and the outlet boundary of the background domain are 5d and 15d respectively and the distance of the turbine rotation axis from the bottom and the side of the background domain are 5d since the simulation is two phase flow the distance between the rotating center of hatt and the top side of the background domain is set as 2 5d in order to reduce the calculation 3 2 mesh grid model the work wang et al 2014 has studied the number and convergence of meshes the results showed that when the number of cells reached 2 31 million and the height of the first layer of mesh on the model surface was 0 0005 m the mesh was continued to be refined and the calculation results have basically not been changed in this paper the mesh is refined on the basis of the method wang et al 2014 which improves the mesh quality at the hatt surface and the free surface area the target size and minimum size of turbine surface are set as 0 002 m and 0 0005 m in fig 2b as shown in fig 2c the height of the turbine surface mesh of the first layer height is 0 0005 m the stretching ratio is 1 1 the number of boundary layers is 10 and the y ranges in 0 7 48 in fig 2e the cells around the free surface and the turbine are hierarchically refined in order to capture the deformation of the free surface it should be noted that the grid scale of the background domain within the motion range of the rotation domain should be basically the same as that of the boundary grid scale of the rotation domain because of the overlapping grid model the total number of cells is more than 5 6 million 3 3 boundary conditions rotation and pitching motion are realized by overlapping grid the overlapping grid method divides the rotation and background domains separately and then embeds the rotation domain mesh into the background domain mesh resulting in overlapping parts between the meshes after pre processing such as digging holes the overlapping parts of the meshes in the background domain will be removed and excluded from the calculation and the interpolation relationship will be established in the remaining overlapping area of meshes finally the interpolation method enables the data exchange between the rotation domain and background domain meshes in the overlapping area so as to achieve the overall calculation of the flow field the motion model of rotation and pitching is established and then the pitching and rotation angular velocities are given in the rotation domain this paper set the atmosphere as the reference pressure and the direction of gravitational acceleration z the inlet boundary inlet is set to velocity entry and a uniform flow velocity u 1 5 m s and turbulence parameters are given the outlet boundary uses the pressure outlet and the hydrostatic pressure is given according to the blade tip immersion depth the volume fractions of water and air at the inlet and outlet are given the bottom and sides of the computational domain are set as free slip walls the top of the computational domain is set as an open pressure boundary and the volume fraction of water and air are 0 and 1 respectively the surface of the hatt is set as the non slip wall the background and rotating domains are connected by an overlapping grid the boundary conditions are set as shown in fig 3 moreover we set the hatt rotating 2 for each time step and the simulation results has reached the convergence criterion under the given time step during computing process spatial discrete uses high resolution scheme which owns second order or higher order accurate and temporal discrete adopts second order implicit scheme sst k ω model was first proposed by menter in 1994 menter 1994 the model combines the advantages of two mainstream two equation turbulence models k ω model and standard k ε model through shear stress transport formula it is a popular turbulence model at present therefore the turbulence model used in this study is the sst k ω model the sst k ω model has demonstrated better flow separation prediction and more accurate performance assessment in several turbine cfd studies wang et al 2012 sufian et al 2017 elhanafi 2016 4 result and analysis 4 1 hydrodynamic load of the hatt the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients are defined as follows 4 c f x f x 1 2 ρ u 2 π r 2 5 c p m x ω t 1 2 ρ u 3 π r 2 6 c m p m y 1 2 ρ u 2 π r 2 l 7 t ω p t the actual turbine diameter is 4 m the tidal current velocity is 3 5 m s and the wave period is 5 10 s the diameter of the calculation model is 0 7 m according to the similarity theory the velocity in numerical simulation is about 1 5 m s and the wave period is about 2 1 4 5 s it is assumed that the pitching motion response of the floating carrier occurs and the pitch period is the same as the wave period 4 2 validity verification based rotation the above grid model and boundary condition set were used to simulate the test state of institute of renewable energy deep sea center harbin engineering university u 1 5 m s h 0 79d and then the inflow direction load and power coefficients of the hatt with different rotation speed were obtained under the experimental condition the hatt only rotates the comparison between the experimental values and the average values of the calculated results are shown in fig 4 the average value refers to the arithmetic average of the calculated results when the turbine rotates once it can be seen that the calculated value and the experimental value are basically the same the result verifies the feasibility and accuracy of the numerical method on studying the hydrodynamic characteristics of the hatt under the condition of free surface it should be noted that since deep sea center renewable energy institute of harbin engineering university measures the output power of the generator during the turbine test the experimental data in the figure are the revised values 4 3 influence of the pitch period on hydrodynamic performance of the hatt to understand the effects of the pitch period on the hatt performance multiple pitch periods 2 1 s 2 5 s 2 9 s 3 5 s and 4 5 s are selected for numerical simulation to obtain the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients and the results are presented in fig 5 the blade tip immersion depth is set as d 8 the pitch amplitude is 10 the rotational speed is 230 r min and the uniform flow velocity is 1 5 m s in fig 5 when the turbine generates rotation and pitching coupled motion the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients generate clear periodic fluctuations with the hatt pitching the fluctuation frequency is consistent with the pitch frequency and the fluctuation amplitude increases as the pitch period decreases due to the existence of the free surface the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients will generate micro amplitude fluctuation with the hatt rotation the frequency of the micro amplitude fluctuation is twice as many as the rotational frequency for a 2 blade hatt and the fluctuation amplitude increases with the decrease of the pitch period the reason is that the pitching motion changes the angle of the inflow direction and the turbine rotation plane so the magnitude and direction of the relative velocity at the turbine rotation plane changes constantly the smaller the period is the faster the relative velocity of the hatt changes so the larger the amplitude and frequency of the hatt load fluctuation at the pitch equilibrium position the pitch velocity reaches the maximum and the direction of pitch velocity and inflow velocity are parallel which causes the relative velocity of the turbine at the equilibrium position reaches the maximum the pitch velocity direction is opposite to the direction of inflow and minimum the pitch velocity direction is the same as the inflow direction as a result the hydrodynamic loads of the hatt at the equilibrium position reaches the maximum and minimum values 4 4 influence of the pitch amplitude on hydrodynamic performance of the hatt to understand the effects of the pitch amplitude on the hatt performance three pitch amplitudes 7 5 10 and 12 5 are selected for numerical simulation to obtain the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients and the results are presented in fig 6 the blade tip immersion depth is set as d 8 the pitch period is 2 9 s the rotational speed is 230 r min and the uniform flow velocity is 1 5 m s as shown in fig 6 with the increase of pith amplitude the fluctuation amplitude of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients increase gradually but the fluctuation periods stay the same the mean values of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients decrease slightly this is because that the pitch amplitude determines the amplitude of the pitch velocity and pitch angle which is similar to the reason for the impact of pitch frequency on the loads as the pitch amplitude increases the amplitude of the relative velocity and the angle change at the turbine rotation plane concurrently increase so the amplitude of the hatt load fluctuation increases as well therefore the motion amplitude of the floating platform should be minimized to enhance the structural security of the hatt system during the design process 4 5 influence of the blade tip immersion depth on hydrodynamic performance of the hatt the pitch period and amplitude are 2 9 s and 10 respectively the rotational speed is 230 r min and the uniform flow velocity is 1 5 m s the hydrodynamic loads of the hatt under different blade tip immersion depths 0d d 8 d 4 3d 8 and d 2 are calculated the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients are all obtained which can be seen in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the mean values of inflow direction load coefficient power and pitching moment coefficients gradually increases with the blade tip immersion depth increase but the rate of growth gradually decreases with the blade tip immersion depth increases the amplitude of fluctuations based on the rotation frequency of the hatt gradually decreases but the amplitude of fluctuations based on the pitch frequency change little the main reason is that the existence of the free surface and pitching motion changes the magnitude and direction of relative velocity of the hatt during one revolution as a result the hydrodynamic load fluctuates based on the two times rotation frequency in addition the diffusion of the flow field is limited by the existence of the free surface which leads to a slight increase in the amplitude of the fluctuation based on the pitch frequency with the increase of the blade tip immersion depth 5 load decomposition analysis according to the analysis of the calculation results in section 4 the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients have multi frequency periodic fluctuations based on the pitch frequency and turbine rotation frequency therefore based on fourier series expansion method the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients can be written as the following trigonometric series 8 c f x c f x 0 i 0 1

inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients fig 8 shows the comparison curve between cfd calculated value and fitting value for inflow direction load and power coefficients fit

has basically been in complete agreement with the cfd calculated value therefore in the subsequent analysis for the fitting of the inflow direction load and power coefficients take m 0 1 n 1 n 2 2 m 1 m 2 0 for the fitting of pitching moment coefficient take m 0 0 n 1 n 2 1 m 1 m 2 1 n 1 n 2 2 m 1 m 2 0 the dimensionless pitch angle velocity and acceleration are defined as eqs 11 and 12 respectively eqs 8 10 can be written as eq 13 15 that is the hydrodynamic load is divided into three parts the hydrodynamic load when only rotating the damping force related to the pitch angle

additional mass coefficient is basically stable during the motion but the damping coefficient will change periodically with the pitch motion for pitching moment coefficient the damping coefficient changes periodically with the rotation and pitching motion while the additional mass coefficient only changes periodically with the rotation 5 1 effect of the pitch period on the fitting coefficient based on eq 13 15 the least squares method is used to fit the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients at different pitch periods and the correlation coefficients in eq 13 15 can be obtained and the results are shown in tables 2 4 it can be seen from tables 2 4 that with the increase of the pitch period the c f x 0 c p 0 and c m p 0 basically remains stable that is the change of pitch period has no effect on the time mean values of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients with the increase of the period the average value of the damping coefficient is basically stable for the inflow direction load coefficient the fluctuation amplitude of the damping coefficient increases with the increase of pitch period for the power coefficient the fluctuation amplitude of the damping coefficient increases slightly with the increase of pitch period for pitching moment coefficient with the increase of pitch period the fluctuation amplitude of damping coefficient based on rotation frequency is basically stable but the fluctuation amplitude of damping coefficient based on pitch frequency increases gradually according to eqs 11 and 12 compared with the damping coefficient the influence of the additional mass coefficient on the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients is much smaller which can be ignored 5 2 effect of the pitch amplitude on the fitting coefficient based on eq 13 15 the least squares method is used to fit the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients at different pitch amplitudes and the correlation coefficients in eq 13 15 can be obtained which are given in tables 5 7 it can be seen from tables 5 7 that with the increase of the pitch amplitude the c f x 0 c p 0 and c m p 0 gradually decreases that is the time mean value of inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients gradually decreases this is because the larger the pitch amplitude is the larger the variation range of the angle between the rotating axis of the hatt and the inflow velocity is which leads to the decrease of the time mean value of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients with the increase of pitch amplitude the average value of damping coefficient is basically stable but the fluctuation amplitude of the damping coefficient based on pitch frequency increases gradually the average value of additional mass coefficient is basically stable and the additional mass coefficient is far less than the damping coefficient for pitching moment coefficient the fluctuation amplitude of the damping coefficient based on rotation frequency and the fluctuation amplitude of the added mass coefficient keep stable with the increase of pitch amplitude 5 3 effect of the blade tip immersion depth on the fitting coefficient based on eq 13 15 the least squares method is used to fit the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients at different blade tip immersion depths and the correlation coefficients in eq 13 15 can be obtained as shown in tables 8 10 it can be seen from tables 8 10 that with the increase of the blade tip immersion depth the c f x 0 c p 0 and c m p 0 gradually increases but the increasing rate decreases gradually the average value of the damping coefficient increases slightly but the fluctuation amplitude of the damping coefficient based on pitch frequency is basically stable the average value of the additional mass coefficient decreases gradually and the additional mass coefficient is far less than the damping coefficient this is because with the increase of the blade tip immersion depth the influence of free surface on the hydrodynamic force of turbine decreases gradually which leads to the increase of the time mean value of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients for pitching moment coefficient with the increase of the blade tip immersion depth the fluctuation amplitude of the damping coefficient based on rotation frequency keeps stable and the fluctuation amplitude of the added mass coefficient decreases gradually 5 4 verification of load decomposition the purpose of eq 13 15 is to divide the load into three parts the hydrodynamic load when only rotating the damping force related to the pitch angle velocity and the additional mass force related to the pitch angle acceleration in order to verify the validity of eq 13 15 the calculation results based on eq 13 15 are compared with the cfd results as shown in fig 9 cal1 and cal2 represent the calculation results obtained by eq 13 15 cal1 ignore the influence of additional mass coefficient and cal2 consider the influence of additional mass coefficient as seen in fig 9 the calculation values of eq 13 15 ignoring the added mass coefficient effects are basically consistent with the cfd calculation values it verifies the accuracy of eq 13 15 and proves that eq 13 15 can reflect the hydrodynamic load characteristics of the hatt with rotation and pitching motion under different pitch periods pitch amplitudes and blade tip immersion depth it also shows that the effect of additional mass on hydrodynamic loads of the hatt with rotation and pitching motion under the condition of free surface is very small 6 conclusions in this paper a numerical simulation method for the hatt with rotation and pitching motion under the condition of free surface is established on this basis the hydrodynamic load is divided into three parts based on its characteristics and they are the hydrodynamic load when rotating only the damping force related to the pitch angle velocity and the additional mass force related to the pitch angle acceleration the variation rules of the damping and additional mass coefficients under different the pitch periods pitch amplitudes and blade tip immersion depths can be obtained by the least square method the study demonstrates the followings 1 the instantaneous values of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients have obvious periodic fluctuations the overall fluctuation frequency is equal to the pitch frequency and the micro amplitude fluctuation frequency is twice as many as the rotational frequency as the pitch frequency and amplitude increase the average values of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients change little but the fluctuation amplitude increases gradually 2 with the blade tip immersion depth increase the mean values of the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients increase gradually 3 the influence of damping coefficient on the inflow direction load power and pitching moment coefficients is very obvious while the influence of additional mass coefficient can be neglected 4 for inflow direction load and power coefficients the damping coefficient fluctuates periodically with pitching motion and the fluctuation period is equal to pitch period with the increase of the pitch frequency and amplitude the mean value of damping coefficient is basically stable but its amplitude increases gradually 5 for pitching moment coefficient the damping coefficient fluctuates periodically with rotation and pitching motion with the increase of the pitch frequency and amplitude the average value of the damping coefficient and the fluctuation amplitude of the damping coefficient based on rotation frequency are basically stable but the fluctuation amplitude of the damping coefficient based on pitch frequency increases gradually credit authorship

stainless steel is the main material used in large cruise ship and the quality of the welds significantly affects the service performance of the components in this study the effect of weld defects on the mechanical properties of 316l welded joints was investigated to this end welds without defects as well as welds with burn through defects and incomplete penetration defects were welded by manual tig subsequently the microstructure of the weld zone and heat affected zone of the three weld types was characterized and the mechanical property tests such as tensile bend impact and micro hardness were performed then the fracture morphology of the welded joints after the tensile and impact tests was observed the results showed that the weld zone and heat affected zone of the three weld types were all austenite and ferrite structures compared to welds without defects the average ultimate tensile strength of welds with burn through defects was lower by 2 7 and the average impact strength was higher by 6 5 the average ultimate tensile strength and average impact strength of welds with incomplete penetration defects was lower by 35 1 and 14 1 respectively in terms of hardness the two types of defects had almost no impact on the welds keywords 316l stainless steel weld joint weld defects manual tig welding microstructure mechanical properties fracture mode 1 introduction welding is a key process in the modern shipbuilding industry which not only has a great impact on the quality of ship construction but also plays an important role in improving the productivity and shortening the shipbuilding cycle during the construction of large cruise ships welding is applied in many sections such as pipelines hulls bulkheads decks and keels involving a variety of materials such as stainless steel cast iron different types of alloys and non ferrous metals therefore the weld quality of all these materials plays an extremely important role in the safe operation of large cruise ships the water mist fire extinguishing system of such ship is composed of many stainless steel components most of which are made of aisi 316l stainless steel it is connected by 316l stainless steel pipelines to supply high pressure water during its operation the pipelines should bear the combined action of internal medium pressure and external load thus the welded joints of the pipelines are required to have good strength compactness and toughness to ensure the safe operation of the pipeline system the weld quality of the pipe materials has a great effect on the bearing capacity of the water mist fire extinguishing system pipeline and the overall design of the cruise ship should meet the fire protection design requirements of safe return to port in other words the survivability of the system in the pipe network design of the water mist fire extinguishing system must be improved imo 2014 consequently it is necessary to investigate the weld quality of the pipeline materials at present a large number of studies have been conducted concerning the welding of aisi 316l stainless steel and tig welding some of which have focused on the effect of the welding methods and processes on weld performance for example li et al performed underwater wet welding of 316l stainless steel with a specially designed nickel based welding wire at shallow water and obtained fully austenitic weld metal without cracks and pores microstructure characterization and mechanical property tests demonstrated that the weld metal had good properties li et al 2016 feng et al presented an ideal process of keyhole tungsten inert gas k tig welding of mid thickness 316l stainless steel with high efficiency and low cost and by analyzing the mechanical properties microstructure and corrosion resistance of the welded joints they proved that high quality welded joints of 316l stainless steel can be obtained feng et al 2015 moslemi et al investigated the effect of tig welding current on the microstructure and mechanical properties of 316 stainless steel welded joints and determined experimentally that an arc current of 100 a is the most suitable to obtain high quality welded joints moslemi et al 2015 anbarasu et al studied the effect of super duplex er2594 filler on the micro hardness and microstructure of tig welded joints of mild steel is 2062 the effect of the welding parameters on hardness was analyzed statistically by anova and a mathematical model for predicting the hardness was proposed anbarasu et al 2020 sabzi et al investigated the effect of applying electromagnetic vibration during welding on the quality of 316l stainless steel welded joints the microstructure analysis and mechanical property test results revealed that the increase of electromagnetic vibration during welding can significantly improve the mechanical properties of the 316l stainless steel welded joint and reduce its thermal cracking sensitivity sabzi et al 2018 other studies have focused on analyzing the quality of welded joints between 316l stainless steel and dissimilar metal for example moteshakker et al investigated the mechanical properties of dissimilar welded joints between saf 2205 and aisi 316l and determined through micro hardness and tensile tests that the hardness of the weld metal obtained from different welding wires was higher than that of the aisi 316l base metal and lower than that of the saf 2205 base metal in addition they reported that the 309l welding wire was more suitable for welding duplex stainless steel to austenitic stainless steel by gas tungsten arc welding gtaw process moteshakker et al 2016 ramkumar et al investigated the weld quality of dissimilar welded joints of 4 mm thick plates of inconel 718 and 316l stainless steel welded by tig welding without using activated flux and revealed through microstructure tensile bending and other mechanical property and corrosion tests that the dissimilar weldments possessed better strength and worse corrosion resistance compared to the 316l stainless steel ones ramkumar et al 2017 the above research has either focused on the effect of the welding method and process on the weld performance or on the quality of welded joints between 316l stainless steel and dissimilar metal however the studies on the effect of weld defects on weld performance are relatively few due to factors in the welding process such as personnel qualifications design process materials and environmental conditions weldments cannot be always perfect and weld defects can inevitably occur the presence of defects has a great impact on the quality and safe use of welded parts based on the position of the defects in a weld weld defects can be mainly divided into external and internal defects external defects mainly refer to defects that appear on the weld surface and can be detected by macroscopic detection methods such as naked eye observation or a low power magnifier among other they include shape and size defects cracks undercut incomplete fusion incomplete penetration and overlap internal defects refer to defects that appear inside the weld and need to be detected by flaw detection methods or destructive tests they include cracks gas pores slag inclusions and incomplete fusion defects based on their nature weld defects of fusion welded joints can be generally divided into six types cracks pores solid inclusions incomplete fusion and penetration poor shape and size and other defects such as spatter and surface tearing peyman et al 2021 among the numerous weld defects surface cracks are important factors that affect the stress intensity of the weldments surface cracks commonly initiate at complicated welding residual stress fields therefore gadallah et al investigated the calculation of stress intensity factor sif for surface cracks in a non uniform welding residual stress field a technique that based on the crack face traction cft integral was proposed to improve the accuracy of the calculated sif solutions the accuracy easiness to use and effectiveness of the technique were verified using different finite element models under different loading conditions gadallah et al 2017 at present superstructures of super large ships have begun to use thin plate welded structures however the complex weld defects of thin plate structures also bring challenges to stress concentration analysis and fatigue strength evaluation of their welded joints on the basis of considering the influence of welding angle deformation and initial welding deformation on thin plate butt joints shen et al proposed a modified formula to calculate the stress amplification factor through experimental data and numerical results in the literature it was proved that the modified formula has higher accuracy and practical value than the traditional formula in correcting the stress concentration effect of thin plate joints shen et al 2019 as the most common shielding gas in tig welding the purity of argon is very important for the weld quality and even lead to weld surface defects when argon pollution is serious krolczyk et al studied the influence of argon polluted by oxygen on the weld surface morphology and topographic parameters by an optical 3d measurement system the results showed that pollution of the argon with oxygen did not influence the width of the heat affected zone and the surface morphology but the composition of the shield gas significantly influenced the surface asymmetry ssk and sku and other topographic parameters and then influenced the weld surface quality krolczyk et al 2015 fracture surface morphology analysis is one of the common methods to study the failure mechanism of weldments through the analysis of weld fracture morphology the damage caused by weld defects can be determined macek et al studied the influence of material isotropy on fatigue fracture by metrological methods and analyzed the failure of fatigue fracture by surface topography parameters the results showed that the skewness values of the stress ratios r 1 0 5 were higher than that of r 0 while the kurtosis values were lower than that of r 0 at the same time it was also determined that the method used to measure the fatigued fracture is proper for analyzing different fractures macek et al 2020 non destructive testing is a common method to inspect weld defects at present there are many kinds of non destructive testing methods used in engineering each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages therefore it is particularly important to select the appropriate testing method to inspect weld defects krolczyk et al discussed advantages and drawbacks of the analyzed diagnostic methods and a classification of conventional and specific welded joint flaws in detail the surface topography of austenitic stainless steel welds was inspected by x ray computed tomography and surface profilometry and the advantages and disadvantages of the three testing methods were analyzed which could provide useful reference for engineering application krolczyk et al 2016 in general the distribution of various defects is not the same and the harm to the weldment differs as well therefore it is necessary to investigate the weld defects and analyze the effect of various weld defects on the weld quality in order to provide theoretical support for engineering applications in this study taking the manual tungsten inert gas tig welding of aisi 316l stainless steel pipes as an example an analysis method of the weld quality was introduced and the effect mechanism of weld defects on the welds and the service performance of the system was revealed 2 experimental procedure 2 1 base metals and welding process in the welding process aisi 316l stainless steel was used as the base metal and er316l was used as the filler wire as shown in fig 1 the microstructure of the aisi 316l stainless steel base metal consists of equiaxed austenite grains and a small amount of ferrite chemical composition analysis was performed on the aisi 316l base metal and the er316l filler wire using energy dispersive spectroscopy eds the chemical compositions of the 316l stainless steel and er316l filler wire used in the present study as well as their standard chemical compositions are presented in table 1 the base metals were sliced into coupons of dimensions 500 200 4 mm using a wire cut electrical discharge machining wedm to perform tig welding before welding the welding coupons were cleaned and standard v butt configurations were employed and then butt welding was performed due to the low thermal conductivity and the large linear expansion coefficient of austenitic stainless steel large thermal deformation is prone to occur in the welding as a result g type fixtures were used to firmly fasten the welding thin plates on the copper plate with pads to maintain the base metal parts in proper alignment and avoid thermal deformation during welding the set up used to carry out the welding is presented in fig 2 the diameter of the er316l filler wire was 1 6 mm the polarity of the welding power was direct current straight polarity dcsp the welding process was protected by pure argon gas and no post weld heat treatment was applied all the welding experiments were performed with a manual tig welding equipment ws250 which was produced by ourui co ltd in shenzhen china the tig welding principle is shown in fig 3 it should be noted that the selection of welding parameters was finalized after several trials and three forms of welds were obtained 2 2 microstructure inspection microstructural inspections were conducted according to the gb t13298 2015 standard concerning the microstructure inspection methods for metals the microstructure inspection samples were cut along the cross section of the welded specimens by wedm such that the weld zone wz heat affected zone haz and base metal bm were included the samples were ground polished and etched and the microstructure of the welded joints was examined and analyzed by a dmi8 c lycra metallographic microscope and a tescan vega3 scanning electron microscope sem 2 3 mechanical testing mechanical testing samples were machined by wedm from three different types of welds the defectless weld was specimen 1 the weld with burn through defects was specimen 2 and the weld with incomplete penetration defects was specimen 3 the photographic view of each specimen type is presented in fig 4 from specimen type two tensile samples four bend samples and six impact samples were prepared fig 5 illustrates a schematic representation of the mechanical test samples obtained from each weld specimen the tensile test samples were prepared according to the gb t228 1 2010 standard the actual thickness of all the samples was 3 7 mm and the width at the reduced cross section was 24 5 mm tensile tests were carried out using a sht4106 computer controlled electro hydraulic servo universal testing machine at a strain rate of 0 0067 s 1 at room temperature for each weld specimen the average ultimate tensile strength and elongation were determined finally the fracture surfaces of the tensile samples were investigated using a vhx 2000 3d microscope with super wide depth of field the samples for the transverse bend tests were prepared according to the gb t2653 2008 standard the transverse bend tests were performed using a sht4106 microcomputer controlled electro hydraulic servo universal testing machine two face bend tests where the surface of the weld was the tension face and two root bend tests where the root of the weld was the tension face were conducted the purpose of the bend test was to assess the flexural strength and plasticity of the weld specimens hence only four representative samples from each weld specimen were tested v notch impact test samples were prepared according to the gb t229 2007 standard due to the fact that the weld size was not enough to prepare standard size impact test samples small size samples with dimensions of 10 2 5 55 mm with 45 v notch were prepared the impact tests were performed using a zbc2302 b pendulum impact tester at room temperature for each weld specimen the impact strength of the wz and haz was tested again the fracture surfaces of the impact samples were observed using a 3d microscope with super wide depth of field the micro hardness was tested according to the gb t4340 1 2009 standard using a mvd 1000jmt2 micro vickers hardness tester with computer digital display a test load of 0 2 kgf for a dwell period of 10 s was applied to investigate the effect of the weld defects on the hardness of each part of the weld micro hardness tests were carried out in the wz haz and bm of three different weld types in each region five tests were performed at the center of the cross section to obtain the average hardness the average hardness of each region was compared to determine the effect of the weld defects on the average hardness of the wz and haz 3 results and discussion 3 1 inspection of weld results the cross sections of three weld types were observed using the 3d microscope with super wide depth of field and some selected details are shown in fig 6 1 2 2 2 3 2 the weld quality of specimen 1 was fine it can be observed in fig 6 1 2 that the filler metal was fused well with the bm and no common defects such as cracks and gas pores were found after inspection specimen 2 contained burning through defects which can be easily generated in the welding of thin plates and pipes they are mainly caused by excessive current or insufficient supporting force of the backing plate and are presented as overlap and excessive penetration fig 6 2 2 in addition a small number of burning through holes were found in the weld during inspection specimen 3 contained incomplete penetration defects which are very common in tig and other fusion welding methods they are mainly caused by arc blowing or low welding heat input and appear as incomplete penetration at the root of the weld fig 6 3 2 moreover some incomplete fusion defects were also found during inspection 3 2 welded joint microstructure the microstructure and grain state of each part of the welded joints are important factors that affect the weld quality and mechanical properties the distribution of the internal microstructure and mechanical properties of the welded joints can be extremely uneven due to the different thermal effect on each part of the joint consequently it is necessary to investigate the changes in the microstructure and properties of each part of the welded joint occurred during a welding thermal cycle in fig 7 the distribution of the different zones of the welded joint is presented the microstructure of the wz and haz of the welded joints were observed and analyzed and the results are presented in the following sections 3 2 1 wz microstructure the microstructure of the wz of the three different weld types was observed by sem and a metallurgical microscope as shown in fig 8 in the sem images a black austenite matrix and white ferrite structures were observed while in the metallographic images there was an obvious black grain boundary which was produced after etching of the metallographic specimens distinguishing the austenite matrix from the ferrite structure the wz microstructure of specimen 1 which is presented in fig 8 1 1 1 2 consisted mainly of austenite and dendritic ferrite the latter exhibited obvious directionality the grains were fine and uniformly distributed as it can be seen in fig 8 2 1 2 2 the wz microstructure of specimen 2 consisted mainly of austenite and various forms of ferrite in which the ferrite was punctiform dendritic and vermicular with no obvious directionality the microstructure was uniformly distributed while the grain size was larger than that of specimen 1 as shown in fig 8 3 1 3 2 the wz microstructure of specimen 3 was similar to that of specimen 2 with the ferrite grains being mostly punctiform and vermicular and the dendritic ferrite being more slender the wz microstructure of the three weld types consisted of austenite and a small amount of ferrite eds analysis on the wz of the three weld types was performed and the calculated creq nieq ratios in all three cases were just above 1 5 and less than 2 it can be concluded that the formation of a small amount of ferrite was due to that during the condensation of the weld pool after welding the creq nieq ratios of the weld center of the three weld types were all located in the δ γ two phase region of the pseudo binary phase diagram of the fe cr ni system where ω fe 70 as shown in fig 9 fei et al 2019 therefore the condensation of the weld pool was carried out in ferrite austenite fa mode the initial precipitated phase of solidification was ferrite and at the end of solidification the microstructure consisted of dendritic ferrite and austenite just as the solidification mode mentioned in the report of fei et al 2019 the fa solidification mode can lead to grain refinement and further improve the mechanical properties of the weld 3 2 2 haz microstructure according to the sem and metallographic microscope observations shown in fig 10 the haz microstructure of the three different weld types consisted of austenite and ferrite in all cases the haz near the bm consisted mainly of coarse equiaxed austenite grains and a very small amount of ferrite by comparing the three weld types it can be clearly observed that the austenite grains in specimen 1 were tinier and of uniform size while those in specimens 2 and 3 were coarser with uneven size distribution the differences in the haz microstructure of the three welds near the weld side was due to that different form of ferrite were distributed on the austenite matrix the grains of the austenite matrix in specimen 1 were tinier and tiny dendritic ferrite grains with obvious orientation were uniformly distributed on the austenite matrix on the other hand the grains in the austenite matrix of specimen 2 were coarser and the morphology of dendritic ferrite was slender and directional while the orientation was not as obvious as in specimen 1 the grain size distribution of austenite and ferrite in specimen 3 was extremely uneven and the ferrite had various shapes such as punctiform dendritic and vermicular similar microstructure was obtained in 316l welded joint by shreyas et al 2020 3 3 tensile testing the tensile testing results of the tig welded joints tested at room temperature are shown in table 2 figs 11 and 12 plot respectively the average values of the ultimate tensile strength and elongation obtained from the tensile tests performed on samples prepared from the three different weld types representative fractured tensile samples are shown in fig 13 the tensile testing results demonstrated that the average ultimate tensile strength of specimens 1 2 and 3 was 600 0 mpa 584 0 mpa and 389 5 mpa respectively the proportion of incomplete penetration defects in specimen 3 was different which resulted in great difference in the ultimate tensile strength compared to specimen 1 the average ultimate tensile strength of specimen 2 was lower by 2 7 and that of specimen 3 was lower by 35 1 the calculations revealed that the average elongation of specimens 1 2 and 3 was 17 5 13 9 and 1 8 respectively compared to specimen 1 the average elongation of specimen 2 was lower by 20 6 and that of specimen 3 was lower by 90 0 by observing the fracture positions of all tensile samples it was found that the fracture of specimen 1 occurred in the bm while those of both specimens 2 and 3 occurred in the wz therefore it can be deduced that the tensile strength of specimen 1 was higher than that of the bm while that of specimens 2 and 3 was lower than that of the bm the partial macroscopic fracture morphology of the different tensile samples was observed as shown in fig 13 ultrasonic cleaning and drying were performed on the fracture surface of the tensile samples and the microscopic fracture morphology was observed using 3d microscope with super wide depth of field fig 14 as it can be seen in fig 13 in the tensile samples of specimen 1 large plastic deformation was produced which led to an obvious necking phenomenon the fracture surface was uneven and the color was gray similar to that of the bm the fracture morphology was fibrous there was a radial pattern on the edge of the fracture surface and the angle between the fracture and the main tensile stress direction was about 45 further observations on the micro morphology of the fracture were made as shown in fig 14 1 1 1 2 it can be observed that on the fracture surface there were a large number of dimples and based on the 3d morphology the dimples were uniformly distributed in bulges and pits therefore the fracture mode of the tensile samples of specimen 1 was plastic ductile fracture this is attributed to that the fracture positions on the tensile samples of specimen 1 were located in the bm which was aisi316l stainless steel that has good plasticity and ductility during stretching the samples produced first uniform elastoplastic deformation with the gradual increase of tensile load the samples underwent strain hardening and the tensile cross sectional area decreased when the tensile load increased beyond the highest point of the tensile curve the samples exhibited a necking phenomenon with the continuous increase of the actual stress at the necking section cracks initiated from the necking center and expanded continuously when the cracks had propagated to a certain extent the heat generated by plastic deformation caused part of the metal to soften and finally break along the 45 direction with the main tensile stress resulting in plastic ductile fracture by comparing figs 1 and 8 1 2 it can be found that compared to the bm the wz of specimen 1 had smaller austenite grains and more ferrite content in addition the tiny austenite grains provided the wz of specimen 1 with higher strength and ductility than that of the bm the increase of ferrite content can not only reduce the ductility but also further strengthen the wz thus specimen 1 presented a higher ultimate tensile strength compared to the bm however its ductility was also reduced to a certain extent the analysis of the fracture morphology and microstructure corroborate well with the experimental results during tensile fracture the tensile samples of specimen 2 also produced obvious plastic deformation and necking the fracture surface was uneven the color of the fracture surface was gray similar to that of the bm there macroscopic morphology at the fracture was fibrous and the angle between the fracture and the main tensile stress direction in some areas was about 45 further observations of the micro morphology of the fracture surface were made which are shown in fig 14 2 1 2 2 it can be seen that there was a large number of evenly distributed dimples with uniform size on the fracture surface therefore the fracture mode of the tensile samples of specimen 2 was also plastic ductile fracture by comparing fig 1 with fig 8 1 2 and 7 2 2 it can be found that the austenite grains of specimen 2 were larger than those of specimen 1 but smaller than those of the bm in addition the ferrite content of specimen 2 was also higher than that of the bm judging from the microstructure specimen 2 should have higher ultimate tensile strength and lower ductility than the bm however the ultimate tensile strength of specimen 2 was found lower than that of the bm this is attributed to that specimen 2 contained burn through defects such as overlap and excessive penetration which can easily lead to stress concentration and decrease the tensile cross sectional area stress concentration tends to cause crack generation and the decrease in tensile cross sectional area of the specimen results in the decrease of tensile strength moreover there were also a few burn through holes in the weld which may have been additional crack sources consequently when a specimen is subjected to tensile stress the existence of defects causes crack generation and rapid propagation decreasing the strength and ductility of the wz due to the combined action of microstructure and defects the ultimate tensile strength and elongation of specimen 2 was decreased to a certain extent however due to the low distribution of defects the decrease of the ultimate tensile strength of specimen 2 was low and that of the elongation was more severe compared to specimen 1 by observing the fracture surface of the tensile samples of specimen 3 it was found that the fracture surface was relatively flat and perpendicular to the tensile load direction without apparent necking or plastic deformation additionally the fracture exhibited an obvious herringbone pattern and there was a clear unfused zone at the fracture surface further observations on the micro morphology of the fracture surface were made which are shown in fig 14 3 1 3 2 it can be seen that the color of the metal at the fracture location was relatively bright and there were microporous dimples of different sizes on the fracture surface based on the macroscopic and microscopic morphologies it can be judged that the fracture mode of the tensile samples of specimen 3 was mixed fracture dominated by brittle fracture accompanied by plastic ductile fracture by comparing fig 1 with fig 8 1 2 and 7 3 2 from the microstructure perspective the microstructure of specimen 3 was similar to that of specimen 2 more specifically the ultimate tensile strength of specimen 3 should be higher than that of the bm and lower than that of specimen 1 and the elongation of specimen 3 should be lower than that of the bm and specimen 1 therefore the tensile samples of specimen 3 should break at the bm and their elongation should not decrease significantly nevertheless in the experiments all the tensile samples of specimen 3 broke at the weld and the elongation was 90 lower than that of specimen 1 this can be attributed to the incomplete penetration defects in specimen 3 and the incomplete fusion part of the weld which led to a decrease in the tensile section of the weld and weakened the mechanical properties of the weld joint moreover these defects would cause stress concentration at the weld root and even initiate cracks leading eventually to the overall fracture of the weld when tensile load was applied to the samples plastic deformation occurred in the wz first however the tensile stress in the wz increased sharply due to the decrease in the tensile cross sectional area as a result it was difficult for the plastic zone of the wz to form a certain scale in time to resist the sharp increase in tensile stress and finally low stress brittle fracture occurred in the wz 3 4 bend testing transverse bend tests on the three weld types were performed at room temperature the diameter of the bend center was 16 mm and the bending angle was 180 the bend testing results demonstrated that the surfaces of all the face bend and root bend samples of specimen 1 were smooth and without any cracks as shown in fig 15 1 1 and 1 2 respectively in addition there were also no cracks on the surfaces of all the face bend samples of specimen 2 fig 15 2 1 but expanded pores could be observed on the surfaces of the root bend samples fig 15 2 2 as it can be seen in fig 15 3 1 no cracks were found on the surfaces of all the face bend samples of specimen 3 however in the root bend samples cracks were observed the length of which was greater than 3 mm fig 15 3 2 by observing the cracks in fig 15 3 2 it was found that part of the weld exhibited obvious incomplete penetration defects and incomplete fusion thus the main reason for the cracks in the root bend samples of specimen 3 was determined to be the fact that the heat input in the welding process was too small as a result there were incomplete penetration defects at the root of the weld as well as an incomplete fusion part and the bend strength of the weld root was greatly reduced consequently large cracks appeared during the root bend tests 3 5 impact testing the impact testing results and the average impact strength of the wz and haz of the three different weld types are shown in table 3 and fig 16 respectively the impact test results demonstrated that in the wz the average impact strength of specimen 2 was higher than that of specimen 1 by 6 5 while that of specimen 3 was 14 1 lower than that of specimen 1 in the haz the average impact strength of specimens 2 and 3 were lower by varying degrees compared to that of specimen 1 more specifically the average impact strength of the haz of specimens 2 and 3 was lower by 21 2 and 29 7 respectively compared to that of specimen 1 by comparing the test results of three different specimens it was found that the impact strength deviation of specimen 3 was large which was due to the fact that the samples of specimen 3 contained different amounts of incomplete penetration defects the partial macroscopic fracture morphologies of the wz of the different impact samples were observed as shown in fig 17 it can be clearly observed that the impact samples of specimens 1 to 3 exhibited obvious plastic deformation and necking at the fracture location and shear lips could be observed on both sides of the fracture further observations were made on the micro morphology of the fracture as shown in fig 18 it can be seen that on the fracture surface there were dimples with different sizes and no brittle fracture characteristics were found by observing the 3d morphology it was found that the dimples were uniformly distributed in the bulges and pits on the fracture surface therefore it can be judged that the fracture mode in the wz of the impact samples of all specimens 1 was plastic fracture fan et al 2020 ramkumar et al 2015 by comparing fig 8 1 2 2 2 3 2 it was found that the distribution of ferrite in specimen 2 was clearly lower than that in specimens 1 and 3 this may be attributed to the larger heat input in specimen 2 and the higher temperature of the molten pool which finally led to the less and coarser ferrite grains at the end of solidification at the same time no weld defects were found in the impact samples when they were prepared this may have caused the slightly better toughness in the wz of the impact samples of specimen 2 compared to that of specimen 1 as a result the impact strength in the wz of specimen 2 was found 6 5 higher than that of specimen 1 the ferrite distribution in specimen 3 was similar to that in specimen 1 while the grain size in specimen 3 was coarser than that in specimen 1 thus the toughness of specimen 3 was lower than that of specimen 1 the impact test results were consistent with the microstructure observations however the impact strength of specimen 3 presented large deviation due to varying size of the defects which also indicates that the macroscopic defects have a greater effect on the mechanical properties of the weld the partial macroscopic morphologies of the fracture surface of the haz impact samples are presented in fig 19 it can be clearly observed that the haz in the impact samples of specimens 1 and 2 underwent obvious plastic deformation and necking at fracture and shear lips could be observed on both sides of the fracture further observations were made on the micro morphology of the fracture as shown in fig 20 as it can be seen in fig 20 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 a large number of dimples was observed at the fracture surface without obvious characteristics of brittle fracture therefore it can be determined that the fracture mode in the haz of the impact samples of specimens 1 and 2 was plastic fracture the fracture positions on the haz impact samples of specimen 3 were located in the haz while obvious cracks could be observed in the wz fig 19 3 these cracks indicated that there were obvious defects of incomplete penetration in the wz while obvious necking and shear lips were observed at the fracture location of the samples in fig 20 3 1 3 2 it can be seen that there were obvious ripple slip characteristics and dimples hence the fracture mode of the samples of specimen 3 was plastic fracture these judgments are consistent with those of fan et al 2020 ramkumar et al 2015 however due to the effect of the incomplete penetration defects large cracks were generated in the wz during impact by comparing fig 10 1 2 2 2 3 2 it was found that the grains on both sides of the haz of specimens 2 and 3 were coarser than those of specimen 1 therefore the strength and toughness of the haz of specimens 2 and 3 were lower than those of specimen 1 by observing the micro morphology of the fracture surface it was also found that the fracture surface of specimen 1 had more dimples their size was uniform and their depth was deeper specimen 2 was the next and specimen 3 was the worst based on the above observations it can be determined that the toughness of the haz of specimen 1 was the best followed by that of specimen 2 while that of specimen 3 was the worst this was consistent with the impact test results 3 6 micro hardness testing the vickers hardness test results are given in table 4 and the average hardness of the wz haz and bm of the three specimen types are shown in fig 21 the hardness test results showed that there was no significant difference in the hardness of the wz haz and bm among the three specimen types and the burn through and incomplete penetration defects had no significant effect on the hardness of the welds this is mainly due to that the three specimen types had similar microstructure and chemical composition by comparing the wz haz and bm of each specimen it was found that the changes in the hardness of the three specimens had the same trend that is the hardness of the haz was the highest followed by that of the wz and that of the bm was the worst this is attributed to that the haz had higher ferrite content and coarser grain structure than the wz and bm the ferrite plays a second phase strengthening role on the metal and the coarser grain structure makes the haz easy to harden thus the haz exhibited higher hardness jahanzeb et al made a more in depth study on the effect of microstructure on the hardness heterogeneity and some similar conclusions were obtained jahanzeb et al 2017 4 conclusions welds without defects and welds with burn through defects and incomplete penetration defects were welded by manual tig and their microstructure and mechanical properties were compared and analyzed 1 the microstructure analysis demonstrated that the wz and haz of the three weld types obtained by manual tig were all austenite and ferrite structures 2 the mechanical properties including the tensile bend impact and micro hardness properties of the three weld types were tested the results revealed that a small amount of burn through defects would affect the strength and toughness of the weld to a small extent compared to welds without defects the average ultimate tensile strength of welds with burn through defects was lower by 2 7 and the average impact strength was higher by 6 5 on the other hand a small amount of incomplete penetration defects would reduce the strength and toughness of the weld to a great extent compared to welds without defects the average ultimate tensile strength and average impact strength of welds with incomplete penetration defects was lower by 35 1 and 14 1 respectively seriously affecting its mechanical properties in terms of hardness the two types of defects had almost no impact on the welds and the differences in the hardness of the welds were mainly due to the differences in their microstructure caused by different heat input 3 the two types of defects were found to have a great effect on the service performance of the welds a small amount of burn through defects had a relatively little effect on the mechanical properties of the welds nevertheless the existence of burn through holes destroys the integrity and tightness of the structure which can easily lead to the leakage of internal medium the incomplete penetration defects reduce the effective cross sectional area of the weld significantly weaken its mechanical properties and do great harm to its quality different weld defect types and different amounts of weld defects have different effect on the mechanical properties and service performance of the welds consequently it is necessary to develop a standard for judging the weld mechanical properties by planning the weld defect types and quantifying their size this way the deterioration of the weldment mechanical properties can be determined by simple non destructive tests indicating whether the weldments need patch welds repair or rewelding this is also the next research direction of this work moreover in the future study we will not only study the effect of welding defects on the mechanical properties through microstructure mechanical properties and fracture morphology but also will pay more attention to the effect of chemical elements phase transformation and solidification modes on the mechanical properties of welds credit authorship contribution statement yaobo wang conceptualization methodology

stainless steel is the main material used in large cruise ship and the quality of the welds significantly affects the service performance of the components in this study the effect of weld defects on the mechanical properties of 316l welded joints was investigated to this end welds without defects as well as welds with burn through defects and incomplete penetration defects were welded by manual tig subsequently the microstructure of the weld zone and heat affected zone of the three weld types was characterized and the mechanical property tests such as tensile bend impact and micro hardness were performed then the fracture morphology of the welded joints after the tensile and impact tests was observed the results showed that the weld zone and heat affected zone of the three weld types were all austenite and ferrite structures compared to welds without defects the average ultimate tensile strength of welds with burn through defects was lower by 2 7 and the average impact strength was higher by 6 5 the average ultimate tensile strength and average impact strength of welds with incomplete penetration defects was lower by 35 1 and 14 1 respectively in terms of hardness the two types of defects had almost no impact on the welds keywords 316l stainless steel weld joint weld defects manual tig welding microstructure mechanical properties fracture mode 1 introduction welding is a key process in the modern shipbuilding industry which not only has a great impact on the quality of ship construction but also plays an important role in improving the productivity and shortening the shipbuilding cycle during the construction of large cruise ships welding is applied in many sections such as pipelines hulls bulkheads decks and keels involving a variety of materials such as stainless steel cast iron different types of alloys and non ferrous metals therefore the weld quality of all these materials plays an extremely important role in the safe operation of large cruise ships the water mist fire extinguishing system of such ship is composed of many stainless steel components most of which are made of aisi 316l stainless steel it is connected by 316l stainless steel pipelines to supply high pressure water during its operation the pipelines should bear the combined action of internal medium pressure and external load thus the welded joints of the pipelines are required to have good strength compactness and toughness to ensure the safe operation of the pipeline system the weld quality of the pipe materials has a great effect on the bearing capacity of the water mist fire extinguishing system pipeline and the overall design of the cruise ship should meet the fire protection design requirements of safe return to port in other words the survivability of the system in the pipe network design of the water mist fire extinguishing system must be improved imo 2014 consequently it is necessary to investigate the weld quality of the pipeline materials at present a large number of studies have been conducted concerning the welding of aisi 316l stainless steel and tig welding some of which have focused on the effect of the welding methods and processes on weld performance for example li et al performed underwater wet welding of 316l stainless steel with a specially designed nickel based welding wire at shallow water and obtained fully austenitic weld metal without cracks and pores microstructure characterization and mechanical property tests demonstrated that the weld metal had good properties li et al 2016 feng et al presented an ideal process of keyhole tungsten inert gas k tig welding of mid thickness 316l stainless steel with high efficiency and low cost and by analyzing the mechanical properties microstructure and corrosion resistance of the welded joints they proved that high quality welded joints of 316l stainless steel can be obtained feng et al 2015 moslemi et al investigated the effect of tig welding current on the microstructure and mechanical properties of 316 stainless steel welded joints and determined experimentally that an arc current of 100 a is the most suitable to obtain high quality welded joints moslemi et al 2015 anbarasu et al studied the effect of super duplex er2594 filler on the micro hardness and microstructure of tig welded joints of mild steel is 2062 the effect of the welding parameters on hardness was analyzed statistically by anova and a mathematical model for predicting the hardness was proposed anbarasu et al 2020 sabzi et al investigated the effect of applying electromagnetic vibration during welding on the quality of 316l stainless steel welded joints the microstructure analysis and mechanical property test results revealed that the increase of electromagnetic vibration during welding can significantly improve the mechanical properties of the 316l stainless steel welded joint and reduce its thermal cracking sensitivity sabzi et al 2018 other studies have focused on analyzing the quality of welded joints between 316l stainless steel and dissimilar metal for example moteshakker et al investigated the mechanical properties of dissimilar welded joints between saf 2205 and aisi 316l and determined through micro hardness and tensile tests that the hardness of the weld metal obtained from different welding wires was higher than that of the aisi 316l base metal and lower than that of the saf 2205 base metal in addition they reported that the 309l welding wire was more suitable for welding duplex stainless steel to austenitic stainless steel by gas tungsten arc welding gtaw process moteshakker et al 2016 ramkumar et al investigated the weld quality of dissimilar welded joints of 4 mm thick plates of inconel 718 and 316l stainless steel welded by tig welding without using activated flux and revealed through microstructure tensile bending and other mechanical property and corrosion tests that the dissimilar weldments possessed better strength and worse corrosion resistance compared to the 316l stainless steel ones ramkumar et al 2017 the above research has either focused on the effect of the welding method and process on the weld performance or on the quality of welded joints between 316l stainless steel and dissimilar metal however the studies on the effect of weld defects on weld performance are relatively few due to factors in the welding process such as personnel qualifications design process materials and environmental conditions weldments cannot be always perfect and weld defects can inevitably occur the presence of defects has a great impact on the quality and safe use of welded parts based on the position of the defects in a weld weld defects can be mainly divided into external and internal defects external defects mainly refer to defects that appear on the weld surface and can be detected by macroscopic detection methods such as naked eye observation or a low power magnifier among other they include shape and size defects cracks undercut incomplete fusion incomplete penetration and overlap internal defects refer to defects that appear inside the weld and need to be detected by flaw detection methods or destructive tests they include cracks gas pores slag inclusions and incomplete fusion defects based on their nature weld defects of fusion welded joints can be generally divided into six types cracks pores solid inclusions incomplete fusion and penetration poor shape and size and other defects such as spatter and surface tearing peyman et al 2021 among the numerous weld defects surface cracks are important factors that affect the stress intensity of the weldments surface cracks commonly initiate at complicated welding residual stress fields therefore gadallah et al investigated the calculation of stress intensity factor sif for surface cracks in a non uniform welding residual stress field a technique that based on the crack face traction cft integral was proposed to improve the accuracy of the calculated sif solutions the accuracy easiness to use and effectiveness of the technique were verified using different finite element models under different loading conditions gadallah et al 2017 at present superstructures of super large ships have begun to use thin plate welded structures however the complex weld defects of thin plate structures also bring challenges to stress concentration analysis and fatigue strength evaluation of their welded joints on the basis of considering the influence of welding angle deformation and initial welding deformation on thin plate butt joints shen et al proposed a modified formula to calculate the stress amplification factor through experimental data and numerical results in the literature it was proved that the modified formula has higher accuracy and practical value than the traditional formula in correcting the stress concentration effect of thin plate joints shen et al 2019 as the most common shielding gas in tig welding the purity of argon is very important for the weld quality and even lead to weld surface defects when argon pollution is serious krolczyk et al studied the influence of argon polluted by oxygen on the weld surface morphology and topographic parameters by an optical 3d measurement system the results showed that pollution of the argon with oxygen did not influence the width of the heat affected zone and the surface morphology but the composition of the shield gas significantly influenced the surface asymmetry ssk and sku and other topographic parameters and then influenced the weld surface quality krolczyk et al 2015 fracture surface morphology analysis is one of the common methods to study the failure mechanism of weldments through the analysis of weld fracture morphology the damage caused by weld defects can be determined macek et al studied the influence of material isotropy on fatigue fracture by metrological methods and analyzed the failure of fatigue fracture by surface topography parameters the results showed that the skewness values of the stress ratios r 1 0 5 were higher than that of r 0 while the kurtosis values were lower than that of r 0 at the same time it was also determined that the method used to measure the fatigued fracture is proper for analyzing different fractures macek et al 2020 non destructive testing is a common method to inspect weld defects at present there are many kinds of non destructive testing methods used in engineering each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages therefore it is particularly important to select the appropriate testing method to inspect weld defects krolczyk et al discussed advantages and drawbacks of the analyzed diagnostic methods and a classification of conventional and specific welded joint flaws in detail the surface topography of austenitic stainless steel welds was inspected by x ray computed tomography and surface profilometry and the advantages and disadvantages of the three testing methods were analyzed which could provide useful reference for engineering application krolczyk et al 2016 in general the distribution of various defects is not the same and the harm to the weldment differs as well therefore it is necessary to investigate the weld defects and analyze the effect of various weld defects on the weld quality in order to provide theoretical support for engineering applications in this study taking the manual tungsten inert gas tig welding of aisi 316l stainless steel pipes as an example an analysis method of the weld quality was introduced and the effect mechanism of weld defects on the welds and the service performance of the system was revealed 2 experimental procedure 2 1 base metals and welding process in the welding process aisi 316l stainless steel was used as the base metal and er316l was used as the filler wire as shown in fig 1 the microstructure of the aisi 316l stainless steel base metal consists of equiaxed austenite grains and a small amount of ferrite chemical composition analysis was performed on the aisi 316l base metal and the er316l filler wire using energy dispersive spectroscopy eds the chemical compositions of the 316l stainless steel and er316l filler wire used in the present study as well as their standard chemical compositions are presented in table 1 the base metals were sliced into coupons of dimensions 500 200 4 mm using a wire cut electrical discharge machining wedm to perform tig welding before welding the welding coupons were cleaned and standard v butt configurations were employed and then butt welding was performed due to the low thermal conductivity and the large linear expansion coefficient of austenitic stainless steel large thermal deformation is prone to occur in the welding as a result g type fixtures were used to firmly fasten the welding thin plates on the copper plate with pads to maintain the base metal parts in proper alignment and avoid thermal deformation during welding the set up used to carry out the welding is presented in fig 2 the diameter of the er316l filler wire was 1 6 mm the polarity of the welding power was direct current straight polarity dcsp the welding process was protected by pure argon gas and no post weld heat treatment was applied all the welding experiments were performed with a manual tig welding equipment ws250 which was produced by ourui co ltd in shenzhen china the tig welding principle is shown in fig 3 it should be noted that the selection of welding parameters was finalized after several trials and three forms of welds were obtained 2 2 microstructure inspection microstructural inspections were conducted according to the gb t13298 2015 standard concerning the microstructure inspection methods for metals the microstructure inspection samples were cut along the cross section of the welded specimens by wedm such that the weld zone wz heat affected zone haz and base metal bm were included the samples were ground polished and etched and the microstructure of the welded joints was examined and analyzed by a dmi8 c lycra metallographic microscope and a tescan vega3 scanning electron microscope sem 2 3 mechanical testing mechanical testing samples were machined by wedm from three different types of welds the defectless weld was specimen 1 the weld with burn through defects was specimen 2 and the weld with incomplete penetration defects was specimen 3 the photographic view of each specimen type is presented in fig 4 from specimen type two tensile samples four bend samples and six impact samples were prepared fig 5 illustrates a schematic representation of the mechanical test samples obtained from each weld specimen the tensile test samples were prepared according to the gb t228 1 2010 standard the actual thickness of all the samples was 3 7 mm and the width at the reduced cross section was 24 5 mm tensile tests were carried out using a sht4106 computer controlled electro hydraulic servo universal testing machine at a strain rate of 0 0067 s 1 at room temperature for each weld specimen the average ultimate tensile strength and elongation were determined finally the fracture surfaces of the tensile samples were investigated using a vhx 2000 3d microscope with super wide depth of field the samples for the transverse bend tests were prepared according to the gb t2653 2008 standard the transverse bend tests were performed using a sht4106 microcomputer controlled electro hydraulic servo universal testing machine two face bend tests where the surface of the weld was the tension face and two root bend tests where the root of the weld was the tension face were conducted the purpose of the bend test was to assess the flexural strength and plasticity of the weld specimens hence only four representative samples from each weld specimen were tested v notch impact test samples were prepared according to the gb t229 2007 standard due to the fact that the weld size was not enough to prepare standard size impact test samples small size samples with dimensions of 10 2 5 55 mm with 45 v notch were prepared the impact tests were performed using a zbc2302 b pendulum impact tester at room temperature for each weld specimen the impact strength of the wz and haz was tested again the fracture surfaces of the impact samples were observed using a 3d microscope with super wide depth of field the micro hardness was tested according to the gb t4340 1 2009 standard using a mvd 1000jmt2 micro vickers hardness tester with computer digital display a test load of 0 2 kgf for a dwell period of 10 s was applied to investigate the effect of the weld defects on the hardness of each part of the weld micro hardness tests were carried out in the wz haz and bm of three different weld types in each region five tests were performed at the center of the cross section to obtain the average hardness the average hardness of each region was compared to determine the effect of the weld defects on the average hardness of the wz and haz 3 results and discussion 3 1 inspection of weld results the cross sections of three weld types were observed using the 3d microscope with super wide depth of field and some selected details are shown in fig 6 1 2 2 2 3 2 the weld quality of specimen 1 was fine it can be observed in fig 6 1 2 that the filler metal was fused well with the bm and no common defects such as cracks and gas pores were found after inspection specimen 2 contained burning through defects which can be easily generated in the welding of thin plates and pipes they are mainly caused by excessive current or insufficient supporting force of the backing plate and are presented as overlap and excessive penetration fig 6 2 2 in addition a small number of burning through holes were found in the weld during inspection specimen 3 contained incomplete penetration defects which are very common in tig and other fusion welding methods they are mainly caused by arc blowing or low welding heat input and appear as incomplete penetration at the root of the weld fig 6 3 2 moreover some incomplete fusion defects were also found during inspection 3 2 welded joint microstructure the microstructure and grain state of each part of the welded joints are important factors that affect the weld quality and mechanical properties the distribution of the internal microstructure and mechanical properties of the welded joints can be extremely uneven due to the different thermal effect on each part of the joint consequently it is necessary to investigate the changes in the microstructure and properties of each part of the welded joint occurred during a welding thermal cycle in fig 7 the distribution of the different zones of the welded joint is presented the microstructure of the wz and haz of the welded joints were observed and analyzed and the results are presented in the following sections 3 2 1 wz microstructure the microstructure of the wz of the three different weld types was observed by sem and a metallurgical microscope as shown in fig 8 in the sem images a black austenite matrix and white ferrite structures were observed while in the metallographic images there was an obvious black grain boundary which was produced after etching of the metallographic specimens distinguishing the austenite matrix from the ferrite structure the wz microstructure of specimen 1 which is presented in fig 8 1 1 1 2 consisted mainly of austenite and dendritic ferrite the latter exhibited obvious directionality the grains were fine and uniformly distributed as it can be seen in fig 8 2 1 2 2 the wz microstructure of specimen 2 consisted mainly of austenite and various forms of ferrite in which the ferrite was punctiform dendritic and vermicular with no obvious directionality the microstructure was uniformly distributed while the grain size was larger than that of specimen 1 as shown in fig 8 3 1 3 2 the wz microstructure of specimen 3 was similar to that of specimen 2 with the ferrite grains being mostly punctiform and vermicular and the dendritic ferrite being more slender the wz microstructure of the three weld types consisted of austenite and a small amount of ferrite eds analysis on the wz of the three weld types was performed and the calculated creq nieq ratios in all three cases were just above 1 5 and less than 2 it can be concluded that the formation of a small amount of ferrite was due to that during the condensation of the weld pool after welding the creq nieq ratios of the weld center of the three weld types were all located in the δ γ two phase region of the pseudo binary phase diagram of the fe cr ni system where ω fe 70 as shown in fig 9 fei et al 2019 therefore the condensation of the weld pool was carried out in ferrite austenite fa mode the initial precipitated phase of solidification was ferrite and at the end of solidification the microstructure consisted of dendritic ferrite and austenite just as the solidification mode mentioned in the report of fei et al 2019 the fa solidification mode can lead to grain refinement and further improve the mechanical properties of the weld 3 2 2 haz microstructure according to the sem and metallographic microscope observations shown in fig 10 the haz microstructure of the three different weld types consisted of austenite and ferrite in all cases the haz near the bm consisted mainly of coarse equiaxed austenite grains and a very small amount of ferrite by comparing the three weld types it can be clearly observed that the austenite grains in specimen 1 were tinier and of uniform size while those in specimens 2 and 3 were coarser with uneven size distribution the differences in the haz microstructure of the three welds near the weld side was due to that different form of ferrite were distributed on the austenite matrix the grains of the austenite matrix in specimen 1 were tinier and tiny dendritic ferrite grains with obvious orientation were uniformly distributed on the austenite matrix on the other hand the grains in the austenite matrix of specimen 2 were coarser and the morphology of dendritic ferrite was slender and directional while the orientation was not as obvious as in specimen 1 the grain size distribution of austenite and ferrite in specimen 3 was extremely uneven and the ferrite had various shapes such as punctiform dendritic and vermicular similar microstructure was obtained in 316l welded joint by shreyas et al 2020 3 3 tensile testing the tensile testing results of the tig welded joints tested at room temperature are shown in table 2 figs 11 and 12 plot respectively the average values of the ultimate tensile strength and elongation obtained from the tensile tests performed on samples prepared from the three different weld types representative fractured tensile samples are shown in fig 13 the tensile testing results demonstrated that the average ultimate tensile strength of specimens 1 2 and 3 was 600 0 mpa 584 0 mpa and 389 5 mpa respectively the proportion of incomplete penetration defects in specimen 3 was different which resulted in great difference in the ultimate tensile strength compared to specimen 1 the average ultimate tensile strength of specimen 2 was lower by 2 7 and that of specimen 3 was lower by 35 1 the calculations revealed that the average elongation of specimens 1 2 and 3 was 17 5 13 9 and 1 8 respectively compared to specimen 1 the average elongation of specimen 2 was lower by 20 6 and that of specimen 3 was lower by 90 0 by observing the fracture positions of all tensile samples it was found that the fracture of specimen 1 occurred in the bm while those of both specimens 2 and 3 occurred in the wz therefore it can be deduced that the tensile strength of specimen 1 was higher than that of the bm while that of specimens 2 and 3 was lower than that of the bm the partial macroscopic fracture morphology of the different tensile samples was observed as shown in fig 13 ultrasonic cleaning and drying were performed on the fracture surface of the tensile samples and the microscopic fracture morphology was observed using 3d microscope with super wide depth of field fig 14 as it can be seen in fig 13 in the tensile samples of specimen 1 large plastic deformation was produced which led to an obvious necking phenomenon the fracture surface was uneven and the color was gray similar to that of the bm the fracture morphology was fibrous there was a radial pattern on the edge of the fracture surface and the angle between the fracture and the main tensile stress direction was about 45 further observations on the micro morphology of the fracture were made as shown in fig 14 1 1 1 2 it can be observed that on the fracture surface there were a large number of dimples and based on the 3d morphology the dimples were uniformly distributed in bulges and pits therefore the fracture mode of the tensile samples of specimen 1 was plastic ductile fracture this is attributed to that the fracture positions on the tensile samples of specimen 1 were located in the bm which was aisi316l stainless steel that has good plasticity and ductility during stretching the samples produced first uniform elastoplastic deformation with the gradual increase of tensile load the samples underwent strain hardening and the tensile cross sectional area decreased when the tensile load increased beyond the highest point of the tensile curve the samples exhibited a necking phenomenon with the continuous increase of the actual stress at the necking section cracks initiated from the necking center and expanded continuously when the cracks had propagated to a certain extent the heat generated by plastic deformation caused part of the metal to soften and finally break along the 45 direction with the main tensile stress resulting in plastic ductile fracture by comparing figs 1 and 8 1 2 it can be found that compared to the bm the wz of specimen 1 had smaller austenite grains and more ferrite content in addition the tiny austenite grains provided the wz of specimen 1 with higher strength and ductility than that of the bm the increase of ferrite content can not only reduce the ductility but also further strengthen the wz thus specimen 1 presented a higher ultimate tensile strength compared to the bm however its ductility was also reduced to a certain extent the analysis of the fracture morphology and microstructure corroborate well with the experimental results during tensile fracture the tensile samples of specimen 2 also produced obvious plastic deformation and necking the fracture surface was uneven the color of the fracture surface was gray similar to that of the bm there macroscopic morphology at the fracture was fibrous and the angle between the fracture and the main tensile stress direction in some areas was about 45 further observations of the micro morphology of the fracture surface were made which are shown in fig 14 2 1 2 2 it can be seen that there was a large number of evenly distributed dimples with uniform size on the fracture surface therefore the fracture mode of the tensile samples of specimen 2 was also plastic ductile fracture by comparing fig 1 with fig 8 1 2 and 7 2 2 it can be found that the austenite grains of specimen 2 were larger than those of specimen 1 but smaller than those of the bm in addition the ferrite content of specimen 2 was also higher than that of the bm judging from the microstructure specimen 2 should have higher ultimate tensile strength and lower ductility than the bm however the ultimate tensile strength of specimen 2 was found lower than that of the bm this is attributed to that specimen 2 contained burn through defects such as overlap and excessive penetration which can easily lead to stress concentration and decrease the tensile cross sectional area stress concentration tends to cause crack generation and the decrease in tensile cross sectional area of the specimen results in the decrease of tensile strength moreover there were also a few burn through holes in the weld which may have been additional crack sources consequently when a specimen is subjected to tensile stress the existence of defects causes crack generation and rapid propagation decreasing the strength and ductility of the wz due to the combined action of microstructure and defects the ultimate tensile strength and elongation of specimen 2 was decreased to a certain extent however due to the low distribution of defects the decrease of the ultimate tensile strength of specimen 2 was low and that of the elongation was more severe compared to specimen 1 by observing the fracture surface of the tensile samples of specimen 3 it was found that the fracture surface was relatively flat and perpendicular to the tensile load direction without apparent necking or plastic deformation additionally the fracture exhibited an obvious herringbone pattern and there was a clear unfused zone at the fracture surface further observations on the micro morphology of the fracture surface were made which are shown in fig 14 3 1 3 2 it can be seen that the color of the metal at the fracture location was relatively bright and there were microporous dimples of different sizes on the fracture surface based on the macroscopic and microscopic morphologies it can be judged that the fracture mode of the tensile samples of specimen 3 was mixed fracture dominated by brittle fracture accompanied by plastic ductile fracture by comparing fig 1 with fig 8 1 2 and 7 3 2 from the microstructure perspective the microstructure of specimen 3 was similar to that of specimen 2 more specifically the ultimate tensile strength of specimen 3 should be higher than that of the bm and lower than that of specimen 1 and the elongation of specimen 3 should be lower than that of the bm and specimen 1 therefore the tensile samples of specimen 3 should break at the bm and their elongation should not decrease significantly nevertheless in the experiments all the tensile samples of specimen 3 broke at the weld and the elongation was 90 lower than that of specimen 1 this can be attributed to the incomplete penetration defects in specimen 3 and the incomplete fusion part of the weld which led to a decrease in the tensile section of the weld and weakened the mechanical properties of the weld joint moreover these defects would cause stress concentration at the weld root and even initiate cracks leading eventually to the overall fracture of the weld when tensile load was applied to the samples plastic deformation occurred in the wz first however the tensile stress in the wz increased sharply due to the decrease in the tensile cross sectional area as a result it was difficult for the plastic zone of the wz to form a certain scale in time to resist the sharp increase in tensile stress and finally low stress brittle fracture occurred in the wz 3 4 bend testing transverse bend tests on the three weld types were performed at room temperature the diameter of the bend center was 16 mm and the bending angle was 180 the bend testing results demonstrated that the surfaces of all the face bend and root bend samples of specimen 1 were smooth and without any cracks as shown in fig 15 1 1 and 1 2 respectively in addition there were also no cracks on the surfaces of all the face bend samples of specimen 2 fig 15 2 1 but expanded pores could be observed on the surfaces of the root bend samples fig 15 2 2 as it can be seen in fig 15 3 1 no cracks were found on the surfaces of all the face bend samples of specimen 3 however in the root bend samples cracks were observed the length of which was greater than 3 mm fig 15 3 2 by observing the cracks in fig 15 3 2 it was found that part of the weld exhibited obvious incomplete penetration defects and incomplete fusion thus the main reason for the cracks in the root bend samples of specimen 3 was determined to be the fact that the heat input in the welding process was too small as a result there were incomplete penetration defects at the root of the weld as well as an incomplete fusion part and the bend strength of the weld root was greatly reduced consequently large cracks appeared during the root bend tests 3 5 impact testing the impact testing results and the average impact strength of the wz and haz of the three different weld types are shown in table 3 and fig 16 respectively the impact test results demonstrated that in the wz the average impact strength of specimen 2 was higher than that of specimen 1 by 6 5 while that of specimen 3 was 14 1 lower than that of specimen 1 in the haz the average impact strength of specimens 2 and 3 were lower by varying degrees compared to that of specimen 1 more specifically the average impact strength of the haz of specimens 2 and 3 was lower by 21 2 and 29 7 respectively compared to that of specimen 1 by comparing the test results of three different specimens it was found that the impact strength deviation of specimen 3 was large which was due to the fact that the samples of specimen 3 contained different amounts of incomplete penetration defects the partial macroscopic fracture morphologies of the wz of the different impact samples were observed as shown in fig 17 it can be clearly observed that the impact samples of specimens 1 to 3 exhibited obvious plastic deformation and necking at the fracture location and shear lips could be observed on both sides of the fracture further observations were made on the micro morphology of the fracture as shown in fig 18 it can be seen that on the fracture surface there were dimples with different sizes and no brittle fracture characteristics were found by observing the 3d morphology it was found that the dimples were uniformly distributed in the bulges and pits on the fracture surface therefore it can be judged that the fracture mode in the wz of the impact samples of all specimens 1 was plastic fracture fan et al 2020 ramkumar et al 2015 by comparing fig 8 1 2 2 2 3 2 it was found that the distribution of ferrite in specimen 2 was clearly lower than that in specimens 1 and 3 this may be attributed to the larger heat input in specimen 2 and the higher temperature of the molten pool which finally led to the less and coarser ferrite grains at the end of solidification at the same time no weld defects were found in the impact samples when they were prepared this may have caused the slightly better toughness in the wz of the impact samples of specimen 2 compared to that of specimen 1 as a result the impact strength in the wz of specimen 2 was found 6 5 higher than that of specimen 1 the ferrite distribution in specimen 3 was similar to that in specimen 1 while the grain size in specimen 3 was coarser than that in specimen 1 thus the toughness of specimen 3 was lower than that of specimen 1 the impact test results were consistent with the microstructure observations however the impact strength of specimen 3 presented large deviation due to varying size of the defects which also indicates that the macroscopic defects have a greater effect on the mechanical properties of the weld the partial macroscopic morphologies of the fracture surface of the haz impact samples are presented in fig 19 it can be clearly observed that the haz in the impact samples of specimens 1 and 2 underwent obvious plastic deformation and necking at fracture and shear lips could be observed on both sides of the fracture further observations were made on the micro morphology of the fracture as shown in fig 20 as it can be seen in fig 20 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 a large number of dimples was observed at the fracture surface without obvious characteristics of brittle fracture therefore it can be determined that the fracture mode in the haz of the impact samples of specimens 1 and 2 was plastic fracture the fracture positions on the haz impact samples of specimen 3 were located in the haz while obvious cracks could be observed in the wz fig 19 3 these cracks indicated that there were obvious defects of incomplete penetration in the wz while obvious necking and shear lips were observed at the fracture location of the samples in fig 20 3 1 3 2 it can be seen that there were obvious ripple slip characteristics and dimples hence the fracture mode of the samples of specimen 3 was plastic fracture these judgments are consistent with those of fan et al 2020 ramkumar et al 2015 however due to the effect of the incomplete penetration defects large cracks were generated in the wz during impact by comparing fig 10 1 2 2 2 3 2 it was found that the grains on both sides of the haz of specimens 2 and 3 were coarser than those of specimen 1 therefore the strength and toughness of the haz of specimens 2 and 3 were lower than those of specimen 1 by observing the micro morphology of the fracture surface it was also found that the fracture surface of specimen 1 had more dimples their size was uniform and their depth was deeper specimen 2 was the next and specimen 3 was the worst based on the above observations it can be determined that the toughness of the haz of specimen 1 was the best followed by that of specimen 2 while that of specimen 3 was the worst this was consistent with the impact test results 3 6 micro hardness testing the vickers hardness test results are given in table 4 and the average hardness of the wz haz and bm of the three specimen types are shown in fig 21 the hardness test results showed that there was no significant difference in the hardness of the wz haz and bm among the three specimen types and the burn through and incomplete penetration defects had no significant effect on the hardness of the welds this is mainly due to that the three specimen types had similar microstructure and chemical composition by comparing the wz haz and bm of each specimen it was found that the changes in the hardness of the three specimens had the same trend that is the hardness of the haz was the highest followed by that of the wz and that of the bm was the worst this is attributed to that the haz had higher ferrite content and coarser grain structure than the wz and bm the ferrite plays a second phase strengthening role on the metal and the coarser grain structure makes the haz easy to harden thus the haz exhibited higher hardness jahanzeb et al made a more in depth study on the effect of microstructure on the hardness heterogeneity and some similar conclusions were obtained jahanzeb et al 2017 4 conclusions welds without defects and welds with burn through defects and incomplete penetration defects were welded by manual tig and their microstructure and mechanical properties were compared and analyzed 1 the microstructure analysis demonstrated that the wz and haz of the three weld types obtained by manual tig were all austenite and ferrite structures 2 the mechanical properties including the tensile bend impact and micro hardness properties of the three weld types were tested the results revealed that a small amount of burn through defects would affect the strength and toughness of the weld to a small extent compared to welds without defects the average ultimate tensile strength of welds with burn through defects was lower by 2 7 and the average impact strength was higher by 6 5 on the other hand a small amount of incomplete penetration defects would reduce the strength and toughness of the weld to a great extent compared to welds without defects the average ultimate tensile strength and average impact strength of welds with incomplete penetration defects was lower by 35 1 and 14 1 respectively seriously affecting its mechanical properties in terms of hardness the two types of defects had almost no impact on the welds and the differences in the hardness of the welds were mainly due to the differences in their microstructure caused by different heat input 3 the two types of defects were found to have a great effect on the service performance of the welds a small amount of burn through defects had a relatively little effect on the mechanical properties of the welds nevertheless the existence of burn through holes destroys the integrity and tightness of the structure which can easily lead to the leakage of internal medium the incomplete penetration defects reduce the effective cross sectional area of the weld significantly weaken its mechanical properties and do great harm to its quality different weld defect types and different amounts of weld defects have different effect on the mechanical properties and service performance of the welds consequently it is necessary to develop a standard for judging the weld mechanical properties by planning the weld defect types and quantifying their size this way the deterioration of the weldment mechanical properties can be determined by simple non destructive tests indicating whether the weldments need patch welds repair or rewelding this is also the next research direction of this work moreover in the future study we will not only study the effect of welding defects on the mechanical properties through microstructure mechanical properties and fracture morphology but also will pay more attention to the effect of chemical elements phase transformation and solidification modes on the mechanical properties of welds credit authorship contribution statement yaobo wang conceptualization methodology
